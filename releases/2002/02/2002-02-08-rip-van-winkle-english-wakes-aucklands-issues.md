“Bill English is doing a great Rip Van Winkle impersonation, and it’s lucky for Auckland that he’s woken up after twelve years rather than forty,” said Judith Tizard today.

“There’s a lot of work to do as a result of nine years of National Party inaction. This morning I told the Auckland Mayoral Forum that we are in the process of finalising a legislation package to speed up solutions to Auckland’s transport problems.

“The Labour-Alliance Government is delighted that National’s Rip Van Winkle has woken up and we welcome his undertaking to support Parliament in getting this legislative package through, which will benefit the whole of New Zealand,” the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues added.

“The problem with National’s transport ‘policy’ is it only looks at one corner of the whole picture. The Resource Management Act is just one of the many things that need to be looked at to solve Auckland’s congestion issues and develop a better transport system overall.

“There are no quick fixes but in the last two years the Labour-Alliance Government has pinpointed a range of issues which we have specifically worked to improve, at the same time as implementing several transport initiatives”:

·Auckland now has a government-appointed representative, Grant Kirby to work as Auckland’s Transport Advocate, overseeing the planning, development and delivery of major projects in the Auckland region.  
·Improved co-ordination between the bodies that have to work together to get roading and passenger transport projects completed.  
·The government’s “kick-start” and patronage funding schemes have resulted in Auckland Regional Council reporting a 7.6% increase in the number of Aucklanders using public transport in the last year – the equivalent of an extra 2.9 million Aucklanders using buses, trains and ferries since the scheme was introduced in 2000.  
·$2.1 million has been put into the Environment Court, to pay for more judges to get cases heard; research is being undertaken into what further problems are in the Environment Court in order to work towards concrete solutions to manage cases more effectively.  
·Developed strong relationships with Auckland’s local bodies to address issues surrounding Auckland’s growth, including transport. Judith Tizard invited to, and attends, monthly Auckland Mayoral Forums to continue this process.  
·Secured Auckland’s rail corridor in partnership with local government in Auckland as part of the government’s commitment to public transport. An agreement to purchase the corridors was reached just before Christmas 2001. The deal will provide Auckland with the rail corridors it needs for a rapid passenger transit system while preserving the integrity of the rail network and the freight link to Northland.

Judith Tizard said major work has begun or is set to proceed on a number of huge roading and passenger transport projects in Auckland. They include:

·Construction on the Grafton Gully to Ports link;  
·Detailed investigation work on the Central Motorway Junction (Spaghetti Junction);  
·Design work on North Shore’s bus rapid transit system and construction work on the North Shore Busway;  
·Design funding for the Esmonde Road interchange upgrade;  
·Design funding for the State Highway 20 extension to link the south to the northwest via the Southwestern motorway;  
·Construction of the Puhinui interchange at the intersection of the Southwestern motorway and Puhinui Road to relieve a significant bottleneck on the eastern access route to Auckland International Airport.

“These are all multi-million dollar projects, and expenditure will increase significantly in the next five years as major projects come on stream. Unlike National, we see passenger transport as part of the solution. Auckland’s traffic grows by about 4 percent each year, so good public transport options need to exist alongside a decent roading network.

“Helen Clark appointed me as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues and as Associate Transport Minister to work across all portfolios, because we knew we needed a whole-of-government approach to Auckland’s needs.

“I continue to meet with the Auckland Mayoral Forum and in the near future North Shore Mayor George Wood and I will be liasing with all of Auckland’s MPs on Auckland transport issues.

“Sorting Auckland’s transport problems out will benefit the whole of New Zealand, and I welcome Bill English’s awakened enthusiasm for Auckland.”
