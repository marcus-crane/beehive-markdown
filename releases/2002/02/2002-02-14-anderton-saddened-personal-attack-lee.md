Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Alliance Jim Anderton expressed sadness at the reported personal attack on Sandra Lee and reiterated his full support for her.

This was an electorate employee whose contract ended at the 1999 General Election and the case is being brought against the Parliamentary Service as employer.

“I work closely with Sandra, more closely than anyone else in the last ten years, and I know she is a hardworking politician who is motivated and driven by what she believes in.

“My abililty to comment further is limited during the hearing itself, but I can say that I know that last year Sandra wrote to Parliamentary Services opposing any possibility of an out-of-court settlement in this case rather than giving in to what she believed to be completely false allegations.

"I am impressed by her integrity and her conviction in this matter, where she is prepared to suffer personal attack on a point of principle," Jim Anderton said.
