Communications Minister Paul Swain wants telecommunications companies to sort out interconnection issues that reportedly ended in a woman in Christchurch being unable to get through to the 111 service.

Paul Swain says it is not good enough for interconnection issues to interfere with basic services like 111.

“Telecom and TelstraClear need to get together and sort this out immediately.

“The 111 service in New Zealand is a basic and fundamental service that every New Zealander needs to be able to rely on in an emergency.

“Having even one person not being able to use the service because of an argument between phone companies is not good enough.

“I am not interested in whose fault this is, I want the situation resolved, and I want to see it resolved quickly,” Paul Swain said.
