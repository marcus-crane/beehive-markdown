Youth Affairs Minister, Laila Harré, will present a Commonwealth Youth Programme (CYP) Regional Service Award to Youthline, in Auckland tomorrow.

Youthline was one of two New Zealand youth projects to receive the CYP award for 2001. The other recipient was The Event Underwriting Fund of Nelson.

Youthline was established in 1970 and aims to develop young people as leaders with the skills to support other young people in distress. It provides phone line help for young people, face to face, family and alternative education services and youth development programmes.

Its philosophy is about involving the community to address community needs and it has over 400 youth volunteers. Youthline intends to use its $3,300 award money for youth development and leadership training.

The CYP awards competition is held each year in the Commonwealth’s South Pacific region. It aims to recognise the contribution made by young people in the development of their community and country.
