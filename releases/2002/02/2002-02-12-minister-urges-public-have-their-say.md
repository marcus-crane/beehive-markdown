The Minister Responsible for the Law Commission Hon Margaret Wilson has welcomed the release of the Commission’s discussion paper on the resolution of Family Court disputes.

“The Family Court has come in for criticism from time to time and up until now it has been difficult to gauge whether or not that criticism is justified,” she said. “This discussion paper sets out the role and function of Family Court, what the Law Commission sees as the main problems with the current system and offers suggestions for change.”

Ms Wilson said the discussion paper has been published to stimulate debate.

“Although the Law Commission has outlined problems and made suggestions for change, it wants to hear from people who have had first hand experience of the Family Court – public and professionals alike – to hear what they think are the difficulties and the solutions. After all more people have contact with the Family Court than any other court in the judicial system.”

Ms Wilson urges people to forward any comments or submissions to the Law Commission by April 4. The Report is available on the Law Commission Website at [www.lawcom.govt.nz](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz)
