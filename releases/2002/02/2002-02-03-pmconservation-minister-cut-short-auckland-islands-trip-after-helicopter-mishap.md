NZ Defence Force media release-Sunday 3 February 2001  
"Helicopter incident in Auckland Islands"

The Seasprite helicopter embarked in HMNZS CANTERBURY for this weekend's Auckland Island's naval resupply mission, suffered an incident this morning when the left hand cargo door window blew off in flight, striking the tail rotor and tail boom.  
The aircraft was landed safely back on board and inspected. The Seasprite has been cleared for flying, but will be limited to 100 knots maximum airspeed, during the remainder of the resupply tasks for the Department of Conservation.  
However it is unlikely that the aircraft will be used on Monday morning to fly the Prime Minister ashore to Bluff, rather she is likely to return to Dunedin in the CANTERBURY later in the day.
