The Law Commission has been asked to look into liability issues relating to the release of genetically modified materials, Minister Responsible for the Law Commission Hon Margaret Wilson said today.

“We need to know whether or not our existing laws are robust enough to deal with any harm resulting from the development, supply or use of genetically modified organisms,” she said. “Should the current law be found wanting, the Law Commission will also look at what options exist for specific liability regimes and at the pros and cons of these options.”

Margaret Wilson said there are a number of reasons why the Law Commission was asked to carry out the work.

“There are complex legal issues involved and already we have seen some conflicting reports on this liability question. The independence of the Law Commission will be an important factor when it comes to weighing up the various competing arguments.”

Independence of legal advice was particularly important given the controversial nature of genetic modification matters, Margaret Wilson said.

The Law Commission is due to report back to the Minister by late May.
