Judith Tizard has welcomed the election of Gwen Bull as the new Auckland Regional Council Chair.

Gwen Bull will be officially elected at the next full meeting of the Auckland Regional Council on February 25.

Gwen Bull replaces Phil Warren, who died suddenly last month.

“Gwen brings rural common sense, a sharp intellect and a good community knowledge of Counties Manukau and the whole Auckland region to her new role,” said Judith Tizard, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues.

“Gwen has a strong commitment to the Regional Growth Strategy, a broad understanding of Auckland’s resource and transport issues, and she has chaired the regional councillors’ forums which bring together district and city councillors from across Auckland to discuss issues being looked at by the Auckland Mayoral Forum.

“Gwen will have a different style to Phil Warren, but she too brings strong leadership, which is what Auckland needs as central and local government work together to find solutions to the region’s growth problems while enhancing its environment and resources.”
