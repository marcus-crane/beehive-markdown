“We must have people who are 100% heart and soul behind the strategy to get Alliance policy back into government,” says Alliance cabinet minister Matt Robson.

He was speaking last night at his selection meeting in Otara, South Auckland where a record 249 local people selected him to be Alliance candidate for Manukau East in the next election.

Matt Robson said that recent tensions between the Alliance Council and Alliance MPs and Ministers must be resolved quickly.

“We all have to make a choice: do we want to be in government and succeed where we can? Or do you want to be in opposition?

“I believe some people are best suited to opposition. I am not one of them.

“When we formed the Alliance ten years ago we set our sights on being part of a progressive left government. Some called it a wild dream

“Well, we have succeeded in realising that dream. This government is the most popular government since Micky Savage.

“If we had made a list in 1999 of what we wanted to achieve in our first term in government, we would have applauded a list that included: a kiwi bank, paid parental leave and the lowest unemployment in 13 years.

“Top on our list in 2002 for the next term in government is full employment. People in work pay taxes, which means more money to lower the costs of health and education and more money to invest.

“I want Alliance policy to be discussed and argued around the cabinet table of New Zealand for another three years.

“Because I know, a government without the daily presence of Alliance ministers and Alliance policy will not be a government of full employment and public service,” says Matt Robson.
