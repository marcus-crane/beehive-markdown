Health Minister Annette King says she has received a preliminary report from the Ministry of Health on issues surrounding heart surgery in the South Island.

Ms King asked for an urgent report from the Ministry last week on South Island heart surgery waiting lists.

At a meeting with the Ministry today she was told North Island private hospitals had current spare capacity for a total of 34 operations a month, “and I told the Ministry I want this used if the backlog of operations cannot be cleared quickly in the South Island.

“I expect to receive more details by early next week.”
