One of New Zealand’s oldest police stations is set to undergo a major face-lift, costing over $2 million, Police Minister George Hawkins said today.

The Oamaru Police Station was built around 1919 and is the oldest police facility of this size in New Zealand.

“Police are hoping to spend up to $60 million over the next five to six years, for the much-needed upgrade of police stations around the country.

“Police stations were left to fall into a state of disrepair under the previous government during the 1990s. The Labour-Alliance government’s multi-million dollar investment in this area is a significant move towards reversing the legacy of neglect that led to rotting police stations under National.

“This government strongly supports the police officers of this country. The Oamaru police station refurbishment is part of our commitment to supporting those police staff and in turn, it represents a commitment from police to the Oamaru community,” George Hawkins said.

In recognition of the Oamaru station’s heritage status, the outer shell of the existing building will be preserved. However, the interior will be completely refurbished to meet modern policing needs.

Construction is due to start between July and September this year.
