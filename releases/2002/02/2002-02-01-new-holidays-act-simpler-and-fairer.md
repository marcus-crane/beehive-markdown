“New Zealanders will be better off as a result of Labour Alliance Coalition changes to the Holidays Act.”

“The key decisions announced today as part of the Government’s Holidays Act review will make new holidays legislation much simpler and fairer for both employers and employees”, said Associate Minister of Labour Laila Harré.

“The strengthening of the special leave entitlements was a high priority for the Alliance and is of particular importance to workers with poor bargaining power, who in many cases, have had only 5 days a year combined for sick leave, domestic leave and bereavement leave”, said Laila Harré.

“Being able to accumulate up to 15 days special leave and making bereavement leave much more flexible will make a huge difference.”

“We have recognised the importance of public holidays for workers by saying that they should be paid time and a half for working that day as well as getting a day off in lieu, as is the current situation. The Alliance has always pushed for a minimum additional payment for public holidays”.

As Associate Minister, and Alliance Industrial Relations Spokesperson, Laila Harré has played an active role throughout the review and is very pleased with the decisions reached by Cabinet.

Laila Harré also acknowledged the efforts of the union and employer advisory group in identifying the key issues and their positions. She said she believes the Cabinet decisions should be acceptable to both employers and unions.

One of the key components of the review was on the period of annual leave entitlement, over which coalition partners have agreed to disagree

Although the legislation that will be introduced will only provide for 3 weeks minimum annual leave entitlement, the Alliance has agreement from Cabinet that it will introduce an amendment that this be extended to 4 weeks minimum entitlement.

“We are working on a campaign to win this amendment. I am pretty confident that before this law goes through Parliament it will include 4 weeks annual leave.”

“The amendment aims to bring up the standard of leave entitlement to levels enjoyed by workers in almost sixty countries around the world. Australian workers receive 4 weeks minimum annual leave, while workers in countries such as France, Germany and Sweden have 5 to 6 weeks holiday a year”, said Ms Harré.

“Annual leave entitlements in New Zealand have not been increased for almost 30 years. Initiatives such as 4 weeks annual leave, paid parental leave and improvements in minimum wages are all part of the Alliance’s commitment to modernising working conditions for New Zealand workers”.

Four weeks annual leave is one of the policies that the Alliance has signalled as a priority for this year in government.
