The Attorney General, Margaret Wilson, today announced that no further action would be taken in relation to internet access by five District Court Judges.

The Attorney General today met with the Chief District Court Judge, Judge David Carruthers, to discuss the matter. Judge Carruthers had sought an explanation from each of the District Court Judges concerned.

In four of the cases, the access was work related. In the other case, the access was of extremely short duration and was accidental.

The Department for Courts scan also indicated access by a quasi-judicial officer. The Chief District Court Judge is discussing the issue further with the quasi-judicial officer concerned.

“I am satisfied with the information provided by the Chief District Court Judge and am not intending to take any further action in relation to these judges,” Margaret Wilson said.
