Union members are gathering at Parliament this Friday lunchtime (March 1) in what Minister of Labour Hon Margaret Wilson describes as a sober reminder of the tragedy that lies behind the headlines of workplace deaths.

Union members are delivering their submissions in support of the Health and Safety Amendment Bill which close tomorrow.

They also plan to plant 500 white crosses on the lawn in front of Parliament.

“The crosses will highlight the more than 500 work-related deaths which take place in New Zealand every year,” Margaret Wilson said. “Deaths which are an appalling waste of life, a source of suffering to families, friends and workmates and an economic cost to the workers’ employers and the country.”

There will be a similar event on Friday lunchtime at the Auckland construction site where Terua Tearoa was killed in January.

Margaret Wilson said the new Bill is about creating a workplace culture where health and safety are real priorities and builds on the existing legislation through small but significant steps.
