Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Margaret Wilson, and Minister of Housing, Hon Mark Gosche, today announced the appointment of Patricia McConnell of Rotorua as the Principal Tenancy Adjudicator.

The Principal Tenancy Adjudicator is responsible for the efficient operation of the Tenancy Tribunal throughout the country.

Ms McConnell, who currently works part-time as the Deputy Principal Tenancy Adjudicator, takes over from Paul Skinner who has held the position since 1987. During his tenure Mr Skinner has overseen an increase in the number of cases heard by the Tribunal from 6,000 to about 25,000 per year.

The Ministers paid tribute to Mr Skinner for his successful stewardship of the Tribunal over the past 14 years.

"His success in the position can be measured by the prompt and efficient way proceedings have been disposed of and the low level of complaints or appeals in respect of adjudicators’ decisions."

Since 1996 Ms McConnell has worked as a Barrister sole, specialising in alternative dispute resolution and the establishment and management of community organisations. At various times she has combined this role with that of Tenancy Adjudicator, Child Support Review Officer for the Inland Revenue Department and a role of Community Law Centre liaison for the Legal Services Board. She was appointed Deputy Principal Tenancy Adjudicator in February last year.

Ms McConnell takes up her new role on February 14.
