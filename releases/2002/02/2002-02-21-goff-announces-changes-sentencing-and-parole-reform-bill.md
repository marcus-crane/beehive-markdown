Justice Minister Phil Goff today announced three important enhancements to the Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill.

These will allow the statutory limit on judge numbers to be increased, addresses the long-standing issue of young people being held in police cells while on remand and allow judges to set a non-parole period for serious offenders.

Increase in Judge Numbers

“Our reform of sentencing and parole legislation may lead to an increased workload for the court system. Therefore, there is a need to increase the statutory number of District Court Judges by three and of High Court Judges by one.

“This increase will ensure that if they are needed there will be sufficient judicial resources available to meet the increased workload of the District Court. Increased workloads may result from procedural changes in sentencing reform and the enhanced role of District Court judges as Parole Board panel convenors.

“The increase to High Court judge numbers will ensure sufficient judges are available should it be necessary to appoint a Parole Board Chairperson from the existing Bench.

Remand of young people to Penal Institutions

“A Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) will be released proposing to enable Youth Courts to remand a young person of 15 to 16 to an appropriate penal institution to avoid the long-standing problem of youths spending extended periods in police cells.

“For many years youths have been remanded in custody in police cells which are not designed for much more than an overnight stay. They have no exercise facilities or dining facilities and sometimes no natural light.

“We would not keep adults in them for any lengthy period of time so keeping young people in police cells for long periods is unacceptable.

“The amendment will allow for 15 and 16-year-old’s on long-term remand to be placed in penal institutions, preferably purpose-designed youth units.

“The court must be satisfied that the remand to a penal institution is in all circumstances appropriate and that there are no other alternatives.

“This is only a short-term solution and there will be a sunset clause in the legislation so that the provisions expire on 30 June 2004.

“Longer term solutions the government is working on include the construction of further youth residential facilities by CYFS and changes to fast-track procedures to reduce the amount of time spent on remand in custody awaiting trial.

Non-parole periods for serious offenders

“The Bill abolishes the current automatic release provisions for serious violent offenders after they have served two thirds of their sentence. This has been widely welcomed.

“Under the Bill, offenders would become eligible to apply for parole at one third of their sentence. Serious offenders of course have little prospect of being granted parole at this stage. Indeed, for the first time, those who constitute ongoing risk would face the prospect of serving their full sentence.

“However public submissions revealed a concern that there is a need for judges to be able to set a minimum non-parole period of greater than one third.

“I have decided to amend the Bill to give judges that option. An amendment will be introduced to allow judges to set a minimum non-parole period of up to two thirds of the sentence with a maximum of 10 years non-parole for finite sentences of two years or more.

“This amendment is only a safeguard and is unlikely to increase the prison muster further because we have already estimated that very few, if any violent offenders would be released on parole at that point.

“It will, however, save victims and the public being subjected to concern that the worst offenders could be granted early release and will reduce the number of parole hearings,” Mr Goff said.
