Matt Robson welcomes first Pacific Island judge.

Courts Minister Matt Robson today welcomed the appointment of Judge A’e’au Semi Epati to the District Court bench.

“I am delighted by the appointment of the first Pacific Island judge, says Matt Robson.

“This is a long overdue appointment from the talented ranks of lawyers of Pacific descent.”

Matt Robson says he worked with Judge Epati as a fellow south Auckland lawyer before entering Parliament.

“Judge Epati brings to the Bench not only his detailed knowledge of the law but also a deep understanding of Pacific cultures, says Matt Robson.

“We have in him a judge who is not only eminent in his field so will serve all New Zealanders well but also one who knows intimately the lives of Pacific people.

“As Minister for Courts I warmly welcome Judge Epati’s elevation to the Bench where I know he will be an asset.”

Judge Epati will be sworn in at a ceremony at the Manukau District Court on Friday 22 February 2002 commencing at 4.00pm, and will sit in the Manukau District Court.
