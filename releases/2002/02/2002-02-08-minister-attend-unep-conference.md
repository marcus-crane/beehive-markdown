Environment Minister Marian Hobbs leaves on Sunday for Colombia to attend an international environment ministers' conference.

The United Nations Environment Programme ministerial forum, which will be held in Cartagena from February 13-15, will focus on international environmental governance and UNEP’s contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) to be held in Johannesburg in September.

Marian Hobbs said the meeting will also consider international chemicals management and compliance with international environmental agreements.

She also hopes to discuss with the Executive Director of UNEP, Dr Klaus Töpfer, ways that the New Zealand government and UNEP can continue Sir Peter Blake’s work on raising environmental awareness.

Marian Hobbs will also meet with Commonwealth Environment Ministers on February 12, again focussing on preparations for WSSD, and have individual discussions with ministers from Europe, north and south America and Australia.

The minister returns to New Zealand on February 18.
