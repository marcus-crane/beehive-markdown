Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, is aiming for a record number of nominations for the 2002 Green Ribbon Awards.

The awards attracted 117 nominations nationwide in 2001, more than double 2000's entries. The Minister is keen to beat that record.

"I know there are hundreds of people and businesses out there doing their best to make our environment cleaner and greener," Marian Hobbs said. "I want to know about them.

"There is a definite gap between New Zealand’s clean green image and reality, which is somewhat clean, still green around the edges. I want to hear about the people, community organisations and businesses that are doing their best to make the image the reality.

"Those we honour through the Green Ribbon Awards are an example to the rest of us of how individuals and small organisations can make a big difference through their commitment and hard work."

Awards will be made for:  
\* caring for the urban environment  
\* caring for the rural environment  
\* caring for our biodiversity  
\* raising awareness of environmental issues  
\* business caring for our environment  
\* kids who care – youth award  
\* state of the environment reporting

Nominations close on April 30 and the winners will be announced on World Environment Day, June 5.

In the past 11 years, 38 individuals, businesses, voluntary organisations, schools and councils from all over New Zealand have been honoured with Green Ribbon Awards.
