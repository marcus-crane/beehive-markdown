Today the doors opened to a new Ministry of Education that includes Group Special Education.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard marked the day by visiting the Tauranga office of the Ministry. The office was previously a Special Education Service Office. SES closed its doors yesterday and staff will now be part of the Group Special Education team within the Ministry of Education.

“I can see that by joining Specialist Education Services with the Ministry of Education we have a great opportunity to take the strengths of both organisations and provide better services for children and young people with special needs,” Trevor Mallard said.

“New structures are not an end in themselves, but they are about positioning in order to provide a clear way forward.

“I believe we have the right structure and people to effect change, but change does take time.

“This new organisation will help to make special education services more responsive by better co-ordinating special education services service delivery and Ministry policy and operations work.

“The launch of the new Ministry signals the government’s commitment to improving education outcomes and responding to issues in the area.”

“The Wylie review in February 2000 was a significant piece of work that highlighted that improvements were needed in special education services. The government has responded to the issues highlighted in the report.

“Today’s launch is more than a launch of a new organisation it is also the launch of a new era for education, one that responds to learners and is committed to continually improving education,” Trevor Mallard said.

The launch of the new Ministry of Education was marked with short ceremonies throughout the country at regional offices and the national office in Wellington.
