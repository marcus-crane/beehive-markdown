New Zealand’s first comprehensive youth strategy was launched today by Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré.

“The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa is a long-term plan and direction for how to support and develop young people in New Zealand, aged 12 to 24 years. It is not a quick-fix strategy that attempts to patch up problems as they arise – that kind of approach has been tried in the past and has failed young people,” said Ms Harré.

“If you have a leaking roof on your house and you run around getting the roof fixed, then discover the plumbing is not working and get the plumber in, or the wiring’s faulty and fix that, you are wasting your time and resources if you never look at the design of the house.”

“In the same way, if we continue to identify young people according to their separate ‘problems’ rather than address the whole design of youth policy, we will fail them.”

The strategy’s model of positive youth development is already receiving international support and is being recognised as a cutting-edge policy.

Young people are shaped by four key social environments – family/whanau, school/training/work, community and peers. The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa is about government doing what it can to ensure that young people are strongly and positively connected to others in these four key environments.

“The current generation of young people and those entering it are much more likely to have experienced major economic and personal stress than any recent generation of New Zealanders. It is incredibly important that we implement this strategy now and not leave their transition into adulthood to chance.”

“A Strategy implies action. I will be working with my colleagues across many portfolios, to ensure it shapes all policies and programmes that work with and for young people. Rather than establishing totally new initiatives, the focus is on improving and building on existing ones. The Strategy is government’s pledge to young people that all programmes developed for them will be developed with them and according to stricter critieria”.

Eighteen months of work by the Ministry of Youth Affairs has gone into developing the Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa. Consultation was a key part of its development, with160 written responses from adults and agencies and 227 from young people. Over 1,400 young people went to meetings or contributed a written response.

Youth Affairs will take a lead role in working with other central government agencies to apply this Strategy across the work of government portfolio areas.
