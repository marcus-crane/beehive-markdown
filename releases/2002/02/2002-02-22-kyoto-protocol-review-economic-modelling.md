Pete Hodgson, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, today released a review of two significant economic models used to analyse the possible effects of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.

The review has been released in response to an Official Information Act request. It has also been supplied to Parliament’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, which is examining the government’s National Interest Analysis of ratification of the Protocol, in response to requests from committee members.

Commissioned by the government’s Climate Change Project, the review by Arthur Grimes of GT Research and Consulting investigates economic modelling by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) for the government, and by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) for the Greenhouse Policy Coalition and the Petroleum Exploration Association of New Zealand.
