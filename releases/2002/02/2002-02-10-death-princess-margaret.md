Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her sadness at the death of Princess Margaret, the only sibling of the Queen, who died yesterday.

Helen Clark said that while Princess Margaret had never visited New Zealand, this country’s close association with the monarchy meant that many New Zealanders knew of her life and times and her association with many charitable causes.

“To New Zealanders of my generation, Princess Margaret was a glamorous and fun-loving person. In more recent years she has suffered poor health, but this sudden news of her death comes as a shock.

“Princess Margaret was a strong supporter of voluntary and charitable organisations which have long been active in New Zealand. In particular, her many years of involvement with the Order of St John and Barnados were appreciated by their branches in New Zealand. As a former girl guide she retained a lifelong interest in the Girl Guides movement. Also today British charities associated with HIV-AIDS work have paid tribute to her support for them.

“Princess Margaret was also a longstanding supporter of the creative arts, especially the ballet.

“New Zealanders’ sympathies today will be with Princess Margaret’s children, Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto, the Queen and Queen Mother, and all members of the Royal Family.”

Helen Clark said that the government had conveyed a message of condolence to the Queen late last night.

“Buckingham Palace has also advised that the Queen will proceed with her visit to New Zealand, beginning on 22 February,” Helen Clark said.
