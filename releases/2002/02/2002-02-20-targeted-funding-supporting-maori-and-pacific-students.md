More Maori and Pacific students are enrolling and completing tertiary qualifications, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Steve Maharey said $3.7m was granted to tertiary institutions during the 2000/2001 financial year to fund support services at public tertiary education institutions for Maori and Pacific students. The special supplementary grant, which is paid on a per equivalent full-time student basis, supports the additional costs associated with providing high quality education to groups traditionally under-represented in tertiary education.

“The government is committed to raising the level of achievement of Maori and Pacific students, increasing their retention rate and encouraging them into subject areas where they are underrepresented in tertiary education.

“During the 2000/2001 financial year institutions received $3.7m to provide support services designed to attract and retain Maori and Pacific students. Often tertiary learning can be a very isolating experience for students coming from families who have not participated at this level of our education system before.

“The funding has supported some excellent initiatives to help students make the adjustment to tertiary learning. Examples include:

\* the employment of a full-time learning support person for Pacific students studying at Massey University’s Albany campus; and,

\* monthly mentoring and support workshops for students at Whitireia Community Polytechnic.

“In addition the Ministry of Education has worked with tertiary providers to share the steps they have already taken to boost the number of Maori and Pacific students beginning and completing qualifications. Two publications have been produced and are available from the Ministry of Education,” Steve Maharey said.
