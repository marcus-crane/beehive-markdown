Cabinet has adopted a set of key principles to guide the development of New Zealand’s climate change policies.

The principles are included in the National Interest Analysis accompanying the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, tabled in Parliament today. The analysis is to be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, which will seek submissions and report back to the House.

Pete Hodgson, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, said the Government had agreed in principle to ratify the Protocol, subject to the further steps required to achieve ratification. These include the select committee’s consideration of the National Interest Analysis, introduction of the necessary legislation for ratification and final policy decisions on the Government’s preferred policy approach.

A final decision on ratification of the Protocol will be made by the Government after final policy decisions and a further round of public and stakeholder consultation.

Mr Hodgson said the overall goal of New Zealand’s climate change response was that:  
·New Zealand should have made significant greenhouse gas reductions on business as usual and be set towards a permanent downward path for total gross emissions by 2012.

The following principles would guide Government policy on climate change:  
·policies must result in permanent reductions in emissions over the long term;  
·policies need to be responsive to the changing international context;  
·policies need to be consistent with a growing and sustainable economy;  
·policies will not disadvantage the vulnerable in our society.

“These principles are an important foundation for policies that will enable New Zealand to take responsibility for its greenhouse gas emissions, while maximising benefits and minimising risks to our economy,” Mr Hodgson said.
