There were 237 secondary teacher vacancies on the first day of the school year or an average of less than one vacancy per school, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard today released the results of the annual Teacher Survey which provides a comprehensive picture of staff vacancies at the start of the school year.

“Schools completed the survey on the first day of school, a very busy time, and I would like to thank them for their participation,” Trevor Mallard said.

“As with other years the survey has had an excellent response rate of 99.2 per cent. The 237 secondary teaching vacancies represent 1.5 per cent of the total teaching workforce, a small increase against last year’s figure of 1.1 per cent.

“This backs up other indicators of teacher vacancies like the advertisements in the Education Gazette. Teacher supply is tight, but I believe it is manageable and consistent with roll growth in the sector.

“Like previous years, vacancies are mostly concentrated in certain areas and subjects, such as Auckland (1.6% of vacancies) and science subjects (13% of vacancies). Management positions have inceased to 12 % of vacancies this year.

“Another positive aspect of this survey is that 74 per cent of secondary schools employed at least one first year beginning teacher. There was also a total of 891 first year beginning teachers in all secondary schools this year compared with 733 in 2001.

“The government has initiatives to help meet increased demand in areas and subjects such as the Secondary Subject Trainee Allowances for people studying targeted subjects such mathematics, physics, computing, physical education and Maori language. TeachNZ scholarships worth $10,000 each available for Maori, Pacific or rural people entering primary or secondary teacher training or Maori medium-training course.

The staffing survey has been undertaken every year since 1997. It asks principals of all state and integrated schools how many vacancies and re-advertised vacancies they have on the first day of school.
