Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson has appointed three new board members for the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and reappointed three for a second term.

The new members are Professor Gary Hook and Associate Professor Pare Keiha, who will join the board immediately. Dame Margaret Bazley will join the board as deputy chair on May 1.

“Between them, Gary Hook and Pare Keiha bring great experience in international, Maori, research, legal and business perspectives,” Mr Hodgson said. “Along with Dame Margaret’s extensive public management experience, the new directors will add momentum to the Foundation’s role in funding and promoting research and innovation in New Zealand.”

The Foundation invests nearly $400 million a year in research with economic, social and environmental benefits for New Zealand, and funds further education for researchers.

The three reappointed board members are Neil Richardson (chair), Paula Rebstock and Dr Jim Watson. The other current members are Maxine Simmons, Neville Jordan and Andy Pearce.

Mr Hodgson paid tribute to Professor Mason Durie whose term on the board finished on January 31.

“Professor Durie made a major contribution to the Foundation as part of his tireless work across the research, health and education sectors,” Mr Hodgson said.
