Ngati Tama and representatives of the Crown are today celebrating the signing of a Deed of Settlement that settles all of Ngati Tama’ s historical claims against the Crown in Taranaki. That celebration is taking place this morning at Pukearuhe Marae, north of Waitara.

The Deed of Settlement was formally signed in Wellington by representatives of Ngati Tama and the Crown on Friday, 20 December 2001. The settlement was ratified by 98% of iwi members who took part in a postal ballot on the settlement proposal. 61% of eligible members cast a vote.

The settlement provides a formal apology from the Crown, a payment of $14.5 million and cultural redress including the transfer of 1870 hectares of land. The settlement is binding on both Ngati Tama and the Crown and subject only to the passage of settlement legislation and establishing a suitable governance entity to receive and manage the settlement on behalf of Ngati Tama.

The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon Margaret Wilson, said “the confiscation of much of Ngati Tama’s land by the Crown following fighting in Taranaki was one of the most severe breaches by the Crown of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi in the 19th century.”

“The settlement will allow both the Crown and Ngati Tama to develop a new relationship that will be more positive and focused on the future rather than the past. The strength of support for the settlement among the members of Ngati Tama was a very strong indication that they wish to see what they can achieve with the settlement package. It is a good day for Ngati Tama, the people of Taranaki and all other New Zealanders.”
