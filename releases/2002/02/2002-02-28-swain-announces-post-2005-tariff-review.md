Commerce Minister Paul Swain has announced a review of tariff policy to determine the shape of New Zealand’s post-2005 tariff regime.

The current tariff freeze of tariffs at the July 1999 rates, ends on 1 July 2005.

“We need to give some certainty to business about the future,” Paul Swain said.

“New Zealand’s prosperity is directly linked to our ability to grow our exports of goods and services.

“At the same time we have to remain mindful of the social, employment and regional impacts of tariff policy. These broad dimensions are reflected in the Terms of Reference for the review.

“The work of the review will be complementary to other government initiatives, including the textile, clothing and footwear sector strategy work currently underway.

The review will be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Economic Development, and is due to be completed by 31 March 2003. Final recommendations should be with government by mid 2003. Submissions can be made in writing or by visiting the tariff review webpage at: www.med.govt.nz/buslt/tariffs/review/

The deadline for initial submissions is 30 April 2002 to allow officials the chance to seek further comment from interested parties where necessary.
