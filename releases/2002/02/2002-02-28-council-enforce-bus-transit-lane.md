Council to Enforce Bus Transit Lane  
North Shore City Council officers are to be allowed to enforce the North Shore bus transit lane along Onewa Road, and other councils may get similar powers, Transport Minister Mark Gosche and Northcote MP Ann Hartley announced today.

The bus lane is for use by buses, cars with three or more occupants motorbikes and bicycles. The aim is to promote public transport and better use of private vehicles by giving these vehicles the sole use of the lane so they might have a faster trip, said Mr Gosche.

“The power to enforce the transit lane currently lies with the police, who because of other safety-related priorities are not able to enforce the lane as much as is needed.

Ann Hartley said that as a result, the transit lane was being misused by other traffic.

“This decision offers a practical and sensible solution to that problem by allowing council officers to enforce the lane. That will keep the lane free for the traffic it is intended for and allow the police resources that are currently used for policing the lane to be available for other traffic safety work.”

The North Shore Council is the only council to have requested these powers to date, but Mr Gosche said that other requests were likely, particularly in Auckland, and these would be considered on a case-by-case basis.

“The Police Commissioner will be responsible for warranting council officers to enforce the transit lane. Initially, the powers will be granted for one year only and is dependent on the officers having received adequate training.”

The council will retain any revenue collected through the issuing of fines for misuse of the transit lane. The proposed maximum fine is $150.

Mr Gosche said that the initiative will be closely monitored by the Police Commissioner and Police backup will be available to council officers, if required.

“With this initiative local and central government are working together to relieve Auckland’s congestion problems.”
