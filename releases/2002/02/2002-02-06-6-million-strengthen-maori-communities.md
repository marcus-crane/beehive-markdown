Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says new funding of almost $6 million over the next three years continues the government push to assist Maori communities to design their own solutions.

At Waitangi, Mr Horomia said the funding is for projects by Te Aronga Hou, Nga Rangatahi o Ngati Hinearo-Ngati Tuera Information Technology Service Provider, Nga Rauru Iwi Authority Society The Waiapu Work Trust and Te Runanga o Raukawa.

“I am pleased to say that the five groups have been working in their respective communities for a long time. They all have vision and commitment and have been doing the hard yards. Today’s funding acknowledges that and assists them to continue their work and achieve their long term aims for their communities.”

Mr Horomia said the projects deal with the immediate needs of the communities while developing the potential of human and physical assets.

“The Prime Minister, Minister Turia and I visited Te Aronga Hou in South Auckland last year as part of the series of Ministerial Regional Visits. We were impressed by their focus, commitment and good humour even though their work with young Maori on the streets of South Auckland was often stressful and difficult.

The Waiapu Work Trust, based on the East Coast, works with unemployed Maori so that they can take up the job opportunities in farming and forestry. Nga Rangatahi o Ngati Hinearo-Ngati Tuera Information Technology Service Provider, Nga Rauru Iwi Authority Society Inc and Te Runanga o Raukawa will look at longer term plans to develop their people and their lands,” said Mr Horomia.

The Minister said he is pleased to be able to support these grassroots initiatives and will look forward to watching their progress.
