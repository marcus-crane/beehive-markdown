Health Minister Annette King says more affordable, effective and responsive services will be available for Pacific people when the health and disability sector embraces ideas set out in the Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan.

“This Action Plan, developed by the Ministry of Health's Pacific Health Reference Group and the Pacific community, sets out the path and actions District Health Boards and the Ministry will have to take to reduce health inequalities between Pacific and non-Pacific people,” she said at today’s Wellington launch of the Action Plan.

“The health of Pacific people in New Zealand is poorer than that of non-Pacific people. They have a higher death rate and lower life expectancy than other ethnic groups, excluding Maori. Socio-economic factors such as lower incomes, poorer housing and lower education achievements also contribute to relatively poor Pacific health.

"If we use the opportunities presented in the Action Plan, we can improve health, reduce inequalities and offer higher quality care for Pacific people. Pacific health providers will have a particularly special role to play in achieving these goals.”

Ms King thanked Ministry of Health's Pacific Health Reference Group, the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, and the Pacific community for developing the Action Plan.

“The Action Plan highlights six priority areas for improvements – child and youth health, promoting healthy lifestyles and well-being, primary health care and preventive services, provider and workforce development, promoting participation of disabled Pacific people, and health and disability information and research,” Ms King said.

“For each priority area, actions have been identified. For example, to ensure local Pacific primary health providers, the plan suggests Pacific Primary Health Organisations are established and cultural training is developed and offered to mainstream health providers.”

Ms King said the Ministry's Pacific Provider Development Fund, launched last November, would be used in part to fund Pacific provider and workforce development, with about $15 million allocated for provider development over the next three years.

The Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan is available on the Ministry of Health website www.moh.govt.nz
