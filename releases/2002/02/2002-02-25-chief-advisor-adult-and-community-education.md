Associate Education Minister Marian Hobbs has announced the appointment of Judi Altinkaya as Chief Advisor in Adult and Community Education within the Ministry of Education.  
"This is an important step in revitalising a sector which has struggled with inadequate funding and ad hoc decisions for over a decade," Marian Hobbs said. "Developing the sector is part of the coalition government’s commitment to providing lifelong learning opportunities in New Zealand. It is critical that all New Zealanders have the opportunity to gain new skills throughout their lives to enable them to participate fully in their communities and in the workforce. Adult and community education provides many opportunities to gain those new skills."  
Steps to strengthening the sector have already been taken with the release of the Working Party on Adult and Community Education Report, "Koia! Koia! Towards a Learning Society", which made a series of recommendations. Cabinet accepted this report last year and agreed that work should be undertaken to carry out the recommendations.  
Marian Hobbs said the creation of the chief advisor position is another important step on the way to creating a learning society. Ms Altinkaya will be responsible for leading the strengthening of the sector. She will take responsibility for the development of policy and strategic priorities, which will include improving participation rates for under-represented groups in post-compulsory education programmes.  
Ms. Altinkaya has been involved in adult and community education for the past 15 years as a programme organiser at local level and, since 1993, as the CEO of the ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) Home Tutor service.  
Ms. Altinkaya takes up her appointment on April 8 2002.
