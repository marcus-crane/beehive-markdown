Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today that he had been reassured of the funding and contract management processes of the Maori broadcasting funding agency Te Mangai Paho.

Minister Horomia met with the chief executive Trevor Moeke today to discuss the circumstances surrounding contracts with Astraeus Ltd, a television production company headed by Tukoroirangi Morgan.

Mr Horomia received reassurances that the application for the Hawaiiki series went through a rigorous process of consideration prior to being approved by the Board.

“Te Mangai Paho has decided to initiate an audit of the Hawaiiki project. The audit, to be conducted by Audit NZ, is in line with the contract management process of the agency.”

“I am pleased that Te Mangai Paho has taken this step because people need to have confidence in the process. It will provide further assurance that the decisionmaking process is transparent and also that key production milestones are being met,” said Mr Horomia.

The Minister also moved to correct earlier misreporting that the Hawaiiki series received 40% of Te Mangai Paho’s funding for documentary and magazine programming for 2000-01.

“The total funding allocated to documentary and magazine programming is $5.419 million in 2000-01. The Hawaiiki project received 19% of that total funding ($1.050m).”
