A $100,000 contribution through Industry New Zealand is helping a Nelson company expand to a stage where it can expand sales in Australia and open up markets in Europe and Asia.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today opened a new cool store and factory for Nelson jam and pickle manufacturer Anathoth.

The expansion has been made possible after the Industry New Zealand board approved Business Growth Service funding of $100,000 towards Anathoth’s plans to get advice on growth and management strategies and to develop a website. Anathoth matches the funding dollar for dollar.

Jim Anderton says the expansion of Anathoth will mean more jobs, boosted export earnings for New Zealand and an important contribution to the economy of the Nelson area.

“One of the main aims of the Government’s economic development policies is to grow good companies to the next level faster.

“New Zealand doesn’t have enough large businesses exporting high-value products. The Business Growth Service was introduced through Industry New Zealand to assist established businesses with high-growth potential.

“Anathoth is growing quickly. It started out with a stall at the Nelson market, and over the last five years it has grown its market share to first in the South Island and second nationally. Even more importantly, it has opened up an export market in Australia and today’s expansion will accelerate its export growth.

“Anathoth is a very positive example of the way the Government is working in partnership with industry to create jobs and export earnings through successful, high-value businesses. If we want more jobs and rising incomes for the entire nation, New Zealand needs to repeat the success of Anathoth in hundreds of companies, and we are doing so” Jim Anderton said.
