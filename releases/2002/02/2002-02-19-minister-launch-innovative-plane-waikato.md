Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton will launch a new type of flying  
machine at the SportAvex airshow in Matamata on Friday.

The Kahu, a prototype gyroplane developed by father and daughter team Chris  
and Michelle Wade, is a cross between a helicopter and a plane, and  
features the same carbon fibre technology used in making America's Cup  
yachts.

The Wades have set up a company, Aero-Sport International, to market the  
Kahu gyroplane, and are aiming specifically at export markets.

Mr Sutton will also open the SportAvex airshow at the Matamata Aerodrome.

He will also visit two companies, one in Matamata and one in Thames. An  
export commendation award will be presented to Thames company A & G Price  
Engineering and Foundry.

Mr Sutton said there was a lot of innovation going on in the Waikato and  
Bay of Plenty.

"Agriculture and horticulture are making great advances in the area, but  
manufacturers are also demonstrating great ability."

He said he was looking forward to getting a first-hand view of some of the  
developments companies in the areas were making.
