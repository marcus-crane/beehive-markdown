28 February 2002Media Statement  
EMBARGOED TO 1am THURSDAYConfidence boost welcomed

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the latest National Bank survey showing a sharp rebound in business confidence saying it augured well for growth.

“The results are not surprising given the stream of positive economic data  
we have had this year and the strong optimism in the economy shown by recent opinion polls.

“Still it is good to have that evidence reinforced.”

Dr Cullen said the net 38.5 percent positive reading in the important own activity indicator was particularly encouraging.
