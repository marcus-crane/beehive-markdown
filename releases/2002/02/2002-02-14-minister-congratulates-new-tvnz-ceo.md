Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs has congratulated Ian Fraser on his appointment by the Television New Zealand Board as chief executive of TVNZ.

Speaking from Colombia where she is attending a United Nations environment conference Marian Hobbs said:

"In appointing Ian Fraser, the board has chosen a New Zealander with a well-established record of serving the public in a wide range of fields. This includes his previous employment with TVNZ as a current affairs journalist, interviewer and presenter and most recently as chief executive of the NZ Symphony Orchestra.

"Mr Fraser takes over as TVNZ enters a new era as a public broadcaster governed by a charter to guide its programming performance.

"I wish him well in his new appointment."
