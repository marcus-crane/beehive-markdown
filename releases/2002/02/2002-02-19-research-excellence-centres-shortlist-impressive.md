The eleven short-listed applicants for the government’s new $60m Centres of Research Excellence fund all have the potential to make a major contribution to New Zealand’s future economic and social development, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Between three and six specialist centres of research excellence, which operate at the leading edge of their field within the international research community, will be established this year. Operating expenditure of $40.6 million over four years, and one-off capital funding of $20m for investment in strategic research assets this financial year is available for the initiative which is being independently managed by the Royal Society of New Zealand. The centres on the shortlist will be visited by the selection panel, with the successful applicants being chosen in March.

Steve Maharey said Centres of Research Excellence (CoRE) are a concrete example of the government’s active support for key drivers of economic and social transformation.

“Returning New Zealand to the top half of the OECD will require us to be innovative in everything we do to create higher value in our economy. The CoRE fund is designed to encourage greater concentration and networking of high quality specialised research resources in the tertiary sector, with a focus on producing leading-edge research and leading-edge researchers.

“The fund was recommended by the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission and is being independently managed by the Royal Society.

“To be successful, applicant centres must demonstrate that they will support research that is of excellent (world class) quality, focused on New Zealand’s future economic and social development and that will lead to the transfer of knowledge.

“The centres shortlisted ably demonstrate the considerable contribution the tertiary education sector will make to economic and social transformation.

“Growing a more innovative New Zealand requires exactly this kind of government-brokered partnership,” Steve Maharey said.
