The ACT party's formerly invisible spokesperson on Tourism has shown how poorly informed she is, with her criticism of the new Tourism Research and Development Strategy, Tourism Minister Mark Burton said.

"Penny Webster has clearly had little or no contact with the tourism sector. For tourism operators, it's a case of "Penny who"?

"The tourism sector does not want a hands-off government – it wants, and it has, a government that is working in partnership.

"I established the Tourism Research Council New Zealand two years ago, and it has already been very active in producing key data sets, such as the Tourism Satellite Account and the Commercial Accommodation Monitor.

"It's latest production, the Tourism Research and Development Strategy 2002, points the way forward for research and forecasting.

"All businesses require sound and reliable information to assist their decision-making processes. This government is ensuring that tourism businesses have access to such information.

"Penny Webster has caught the carping disease that is running rampant through the Opposition. If she actually got out and talked to tourism operators like I do, she'd know that we have enthusiastic and innovative people who are glad to have the government working with them," Mark Burton said.
