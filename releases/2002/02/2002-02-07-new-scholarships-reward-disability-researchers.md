Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today presented two new scholarships for disability education and research. The recipients, Robin Maxwell from Wellington and Lea Gavin from Dunedin, are both doing university research into spinal chord injury through Otago University.

This is the the inaugural year of the Ian Campbell Scholarships, which have been set up by the Wellington Paraplegic and Physically Disabled Trust. The scholarships have been named after Dr Ian Campbell in recognition of his work as a founding member of the trust and for his practical and theoretical contribution in workers’ and accident compensation schemes.

The scholarships are available for education and research either by a person with a disability or on disability–related issues. The winners for 2002 are Robin Maxwell from Wellington and Lea Gavin from Dunedin.

Robin Maxwell is a qualified physiotherapist with 15 years experience working with people with neurological conditions. She currently works at Capital Coast Rehab, Ward 2. The scholarship is a contribution towards her Masters Degree in Rehabilitation through Otago University. In her thesis, Robin is looking at the ongoing use of standing equipment following spinal cord injury, and at the social and physical factors that influence ongoing use.

Lea Gavin is in her final year of a PhD n Psychology at Otago University, investigating the psychological impacts of spinal cord injury. Lea has personal experience of disability and eight years of psychology training, both practical and theoretical.  
In addition to these two awards, the trust also gave a grant to Kelly Cotter, from New Plymouth, towards the capital cost of camera equipment required for her photography course and future profession. Kelly is the first student with a disability to undertake the one-year course.
