Police Minister George Hawkins has welcomed the appointment of New Zealand’s first female Police District Commander, Superintendent Sandra Manderson.

Superintendent Manderson has been appointed District Commander for the Canterbury Police District. She will replace Superintendent John Reilly when he retires from the position next month.

“At a time when the New Zealand Police are working hard to recruit more women, this appointment sends a clear message that policing is a great career option for women,” said Mr Hawkins. “I wish Superintendent Manderson every success in her new position.”
