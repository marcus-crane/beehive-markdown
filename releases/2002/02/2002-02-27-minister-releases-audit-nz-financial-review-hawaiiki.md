Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia has released the Audit Office review of funding provided to Astraeus Limited (Astraeus) for programme series Hawaiiki.

Mr Horomia said he decided to release the report so that people have accurate information before making judgements about the programme, the company and the funding organisation.

“While some minor matters needed to be tidied up, there has been nothing to cause Audit NZ concern about the operations of Te Mangai Paho and Astraeus,” said Mr Horomia.

Mr Horomia said the report made no comment on the appropriateness of the level of funding. The Audit NZ report also stated there was no concern about the appropriateness of expenditure of grant monies.
