Associate Education Minister, Marian Hobbs, is re-instating a Sanson school bus service that was cancelled at the end of last year.

"Since school began it's become clear that the alternative public service is not able to cope with the numbers of students seeking to use it and the operator cannot provide additional buses on this route," Marian Hobbs said.

"Therefore a free school bus service between Ohakea, Sanson and Palmerston North for students eligible for transport assistance will be re-instated from tomorrow morning, Tuesday February 5."

Students are eligible for transport assistance if they are aged under 10 years and live more than 3.2 km from their nearest school, or 10 years and over and live more than 4.8 km from their nearest school. Transport assistance is not provided where there are suitable public passenger services available.

The Sanson bus service was cancelled when the Ministry of Education advised that an alternative public service was available.

"Getting students safely to their nearest school is my priority as minister," Marian Hobbs said. "Once the Ministry of Education confirmed that the public service was unsuitable for students to use I moved quickly to reinstate the free service."

Marian Hobbs is asking the Ministry for a full explanation of the procedures followed leading to the original cancellation of the service.
