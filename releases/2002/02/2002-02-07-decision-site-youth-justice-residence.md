Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today he has decided to proceed with the crown owned Runners Rd site proposed for Child, Youth and Family’s new Christchurch-based youth justice residence.

A new securely designed purpose-built youth justice residential centre is planned for the 8.6 ha site. When fully complete the Residential Centre will provide placements for up to 40 children and young people. It will result in the closure of the youth justice unit at the Kingslea Residential Centre in Burwood.

“The proposal to develop the site was announced in October 2001 and Child Youth and Family has been consulting with the Rolleston/Burnham community since that time.

“I would like to thank the community for their input, and active engagement throughout the consultation process,” Steve Maharey said. “Community feedback was generally very positive with many people saying that the site was appropriate for the new centre”.

“The Department has received a great deal of useful information and suggestions from the community that are being considered for the final proposal.”

Mr Maharey also extended his thanks to the Canterbury Community Working Group and in particular the chair, Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, for the role they played in the selection, assessment and consultation of the Runners Rd site.

The new Youth Justice Residential Centre will be the sixth of seven residences planned nationwide to improve the care and control Child, Youth and Family is able to provide for vulnerable children and young people and young offenders.

Steve Maharey said he expects the notice of requirement to designate the site to be lodged with the Selwyn District Council in early March. The Council will then publicly notify the notice and call for submissions.
