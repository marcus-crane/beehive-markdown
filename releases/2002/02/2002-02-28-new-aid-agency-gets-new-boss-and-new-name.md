New aid agency gets new boss and new name

“I am delighted to announce that the new aid agency will be called NZAID (New Zealand Agency for International Development). I also welcome the announcement today of the appointment of NZAID’s new Executive Director, Peter Adams,” says the Minister responsible for International Development Matt Robson.

NZAID will be formally established on 1 July 2002 as a semi-autonomous body within the wider Ministry, ushering in a new era for aid delivery.

“I am sure that NZAID will become a recognised world leader in development cooperation, one that will make a significant contribution to the elimination of poverty, especially in the Pacific region,” says Matt Robson

“The new agency will have its own vote and will report directly to Ministers on policy and operational matters. It is also vital that we ensure that NZAID will be properly resourced to meet the high standards the government expects of it.

“NZAID will have the ability to recruit and build a team of specialist development staff and develop new assessment frameworks and evaluation systems.

“This year the international community’s leaders will meet twice to review and re-set the agenda for sustainable development and the eradication of poverty in the future. I will be attending the Monterrey International Financing for Development Conference, in Mexico, 18-22 March. The World Summit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg, follows in September, with the Prime Minister planning to attend.”

“The launch of NZAID mid-year means that we can take full advantage of the renewed political will, practical steps and partnerships arising from these world summits”, said Matt Robson.
