No further action is required in relation to internet access by High Court Judge Robert Fisher, Attorney-General Margaret Wilson said this evening.

“I have now met with Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias, the Acting Solicitor General and the Chief Executive of the Department for Courts to go through the further Crown Law and Department of Courts report into the matter,” she said. ”These further inquiries confirm there is no element of unlawfulness.”

Margaret Wilson said because there is no illegality involved there is no further role for the Attorney General in this case.”

“The essence of judiciary independence is that the judiciary act independently. I’m sure they will play their role in maintaining public confidence in the courts,” she said.
