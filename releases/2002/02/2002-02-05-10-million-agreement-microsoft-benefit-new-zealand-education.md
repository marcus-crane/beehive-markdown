Education Minister Trevor Mallard has signed an agreement in Seattle that gives New Zealand schools access to the latest versions of a package of Microsoft products.

The Minister signed the agreement with Microsoft’s Worldwide General Manager, Education Solutions Group, Mark East during a visit to Microsoft’s headquarters.

The $10 million agreement was reached with Microsoft New Zealand last year. It provides computer software to all state and integrated schools and their staff and covers software licences for around 70,000 school PCs for two years. At the end of that time the agreement will be reviewed.

“Since this deal was announced last year, I’ve had lots of feedback from schools about how this will benefit both their administrative systems as well as teaching and learning in classrooms,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I’m particularly pleased that we were able to negotiate a deal which includes teachers’ personal computers as I strongly believe that children’s learning through ICT can only reach its potential if teachers are comfortable with the technology.

“The bulk buying power of Government has enabled us to negotiate a great deal for schools, and at no cost to them. The financial savings to schools will be significant, particularly for those with large numbers of computers.”

The agreement between the Government and Microsoft will be administered by EdCom, a division of the Multi Serve Education Trust. Towards the end of last year, EdCom held seminars throughout New Zealand to explain the arrangement to schools and how they may access the deal. Schools will be receiving further information to enrol in the agreement soon.

The agreement contains the following software:

- Microsoft Office Professional
- Microsoft Office for Mac
- Microsoft Windows Operating System Upgrades (all versions)
- Microsoft CORE Client Access License
- Microsoft Front Page
- Microsoft Visual Studio Professional (programming tools)
- Microsoft Encarta Reference Library
- Microsoft Publisher
- Microsoft Works
