Associate Minister of Tourism Parekura Horomia says funding assistance to four regional Mäori tourism organisations is a major step towards increasing Mäori participation in New Zealand’s multi-billion dollar tourism industry.

Mr Horomia announced funding assistance for organisations at the Ngati Kahungunu ki Heretaunga Economic Summit in Napier today. The organisations are Taitokerau Mäori Cultural Tourism Association (Northland), Maunga Tu Maunga Ora (Taranaki), Mäori in Tourism Rotorua (Rotorua) and Te Ara A Maui (Wellington). Two further applications are expected to be approved soon.

Mr Horomia said the aim is to assist Mäori tourism organisations to promote and develop resources in the regions.

“The funding also recognises the need to strengthen relationships between Mäori tourism operators and industry associations, particularly existing regional tourism organisations. Regional development is often about the right people talking with each other at the right time so that they combine their collective energy for the benefit of the region.”

Mr Horomia said the assistance is another government initiative that addresses issues raised in the report He Matai Tapoi Maori – A study of barriers, impediments and opportunities for Maori in Tourism.

“There are issues unique to Maori operators. These include the lack of representation in key decision making positions on key industry organisations, the lack of protection of intellectual property, inadequate market research, difficulty in securing debt and equity financial and also inadequate and inappropriate industry training.”

Mr Horomia said Maoridom has assets with tremendous potential – its people, its land-based resources and intellectual property.

“I am pleased to say the Labour-Alliance government is committed to the development of these assets, for the benefit of Maoridom and also for the country as a whole.”

How is a region determined for Mäori regional tourism funding?

The size and coverage of a region for the purposes of this funding is defined by the applicants themselves. Where there is an overalp between two or more applications, Te Puni Kökiri will work with these groups to agree on the boundaries different organisations will cover.

How much funding will each of the organisations receive?

The organisations will receive up to $90,000 each over three years. The funding is paid in declining amounts from $50,000 in year one, $30,000 in year two, and $10,000 in year three. One of the reasons for this is to encourage the organisations to develop strategies to be self-funding over time.

What outcomes are expected for the funding that has been allocated?  
The purpose of the funding is to assist Mäori regional tourism organisations to develop business capabilities within Mäori tourism businesses and promote the interests of Mäori tourism within key industry organisations. This is expected to enhance the quality of Mäori tourism in the region and stronger relationships with existing Regional Tourism Organisations.

Who will monitor the contracts?  
The contracts will be monitored by Te Puni Kökiri’s regional offices in the same way as other funding. This will include reviewing the quality of deliverables, and maintaining periodic contact with the organisations to provide other assistance as necessary.

What is the criteria used to select the tourism organisatons?  
Funding proposals were assessed against the following criteria:  
\* Proposal clearly sets out how the Mäori regional tourism organisation will address the purposes of the funding;  
\* Evidence of accountability to and support for the proposal from an existing network of Mäori tourism operators;  
\* Evidence of co-operation across the region and with iwi within the region;  
\* Evidence of priority on promoting the interests of Mäori tourism operators in their region;  
\* Evidence of management structures, systems and financial management procedures in place;  
\* Proposal realistically sets out strategies indicating how financial sustainability of the organisation will be achieved beyond the proposed funding (including evidence of existing viability where relevant);  
\* Evidence of existing relationships or potential for relationships with regional tourism organisations and other industry associations; and  
\* No other competing bid from a Mäori regional tourism organisation in the area.

What effect will this have on the Regional Tourism Industry bodies?  
The Mäori regional tourism organisation funding is not expected to replace or assume the responsibilities of existing regional tourism bodies. The Government would however like to see existing regional tourism bodies and Mäori regional tourism groups working more closely together.
