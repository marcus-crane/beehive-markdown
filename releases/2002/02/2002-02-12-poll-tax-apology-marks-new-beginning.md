Today’s apology for the poll tax and related discrimination against Chinese settlers in the late 1800s demonstrates the government’s desire to build lasting partnerships with Ethnic New Zealanders, said Ethnic Affairs Minister George Hawkins.“Chinese New Year is the oldest and most important festival to the Chinese community. So it was the perfect opportunity for the Government to formally apologise for discrimination that, while historical, is still very significant for many Chinese New Zealanders.“In my role as Minister for Ethnic Affairs I have met many industrious and outstanding Chinese New Zealanders. And in the course of my visits to Chinese communities around the country I have also met a lot of Chinese New Zealanders still hurting from the discrimination by a government many years ago. While the measures imposed were lawful at the time, today we regret that laws like this were ever considered appropriate.“We are not the first government to have heard a lot about the poll tax and related discrimination. But unlike the previous government, we have done something about it. That is something to be proud of.“I hope that today’s apology marks the beginning of an even stronger partnership between the government and Chinese New Zealanders, and makes Chinese New Year 2002 one to remember,” said Mr Hawkins.
