Tourism Minister Mark Burton has today released a research strategy for the tourism sector, as part of the government's commitment to 'smart' intervention to support innovative economic growth.

"The tourism sector is hugely important, but what has been missing in the past is relevant, timely and quality information to assist with planning and decision-making", Mark Burton said. "The Tourism Research and Development Strategy 2002 is a key to ensuring such information is readily available."

The strategy has been prepared by the Tourism Research Council New Zealand, which was set up by the Minister in 2000, and advances the recommendations of last year's New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

"The provision of quality research, information and forecasting to decision-makers in the tourism sector is vital for its ongoing development, " Mark Burton said. "As this government has recognised right across our economy, we need to be innovative and informed, in order to create higher value and sustainable growth.

"Tourism contributes around 10 percent of New Zealand's GDP and it is absolutely vital that we understand this industry, how it works, how it contributes and what we can do to help it perform even better.

"This document has been created as part of the government's ongoing collaboration with the private sector to develop new strategies to lift economic performance. The TRCNZ undertook an extensive consultative process to identify what information is needed, and who needs it.

"This document will play a vital role in focussing research effort in tourism and as such I commend it to users. This work also represents an important milestone for the TRCNZ as the lead body for the provision of quality research for tourism".

TRCNZ Chairman Sean Murray said they have an ambitious work programme that will play an increasingly important role in the New Zealand tourism sector.

"We now have a comprehensive target for TRCNZ's efforts that is closely aligned with the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010. This alignment of strategic effort in tourism is an important development and I look forward to working with a wide range of stakeholders to achieve this common vision".
