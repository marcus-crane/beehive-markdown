The Government is to develop a framework for making decisions about support for major tertiary partnerships between tertiary institutions, the private sector and the government, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said cabinet supports the concept of financial contribution to new major capital projects in tertiary education that are also supported by significant private sector funding.

“The government is not a cash cow – but we do want to support projects that advance our objectives for greater innovation and economic transformation,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Cabinet has asked for a report by the end of next month on a framework for decision-making on government support for major tertiary education partnership proposals where they are supported by significant private sector funding.

“This complements the “Growing an Innovative New Zealand” strategy released last week which emphasises the Government’s commitment to returning New Zealand to the top half of the OECD rankings by strengthening the fundamentals of the economy and building more effective innovation into the economy.

“One of the ways of enhancing our innovation framework is to foster better linkages between tertiary education providers, industry and communities.

“The Transition Tertiary Education Commission is involved in developing the framework to ensure proposals relate to the strategy for the tertiary sector.”

Trevor Mallard said the decision had been prompted by a proposal put to the government for a capital contribution of up to a maximum of $25 million towards the development of a new business school at the University of Auckland.

“It is a proposal that Cabinet has agreed to in principle. The capital contribution would be subject to matching contributions from private donors, approval of a business case by Ministers, and consistency with the new framework.

“The funding would allow for the development of a world class centre for business education in a new facility. It will provide entrepreneur support, grow more talent, and develop tertiary education aligned to the requirements of a knowledge economy and society.

“The government recognises it as a worthwhile and exciting project and I hope that the private sector will also respond favourably,” Trevor Mallard said.
