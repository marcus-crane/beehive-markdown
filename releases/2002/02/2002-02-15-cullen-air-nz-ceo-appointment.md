13 February 2002Media Statement  
Cullen on Air New Zealand CEO appointment

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today congratulated Ralph Norris on being appointed chief executive of Air New Zealand.

The government had played no role in the appointment as it was an operational issue and therefore a matter for the board.

“Mr Norris is a very successful businessman.”

“I particularly hope he will build on the good relations Air New Zealand has established with its workforce, and on the good will the unions have shown toward the company’s reconstruction as this is a big competitive advantage Air New Zealand has over its main Australian competitor,” he said.
