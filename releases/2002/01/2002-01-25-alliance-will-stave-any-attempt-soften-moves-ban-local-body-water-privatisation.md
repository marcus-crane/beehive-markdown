Local Government Minister and Deputy Leader of the Alliance Sandra Lee says the party will vigorously oppose any move to soften government proposals to ban the privatisation of local body water supply and wastewater services.  
"This is the first time in the history of local government legislation that local authorities have been prohibited from privatising their water services. I said on the introduction of the Local Government Bill 2001 last month that access to water is not a commodity but a fundamental human right," said Ms Lee.  
"I am advised some local authority figures may regard Clause 129 in the Bill as the toughest anti-privatisation measure ever inserted into local government legislation."  
Ms Lee said Clause 129 stated that a territorial local authority that was providing water supply and wastewater services once the Bill was passed into law later this year "must continue to do so and must maintain its capacity to do so".  
The Bill also stated that local bodies "must not transfer ownership or control" of significant water assets to anyone unless they are council-controlled, and they are also banned from privatising the ownership of such council-controlled bodies.  
"There are no ifs or buts or maybes around the words 'must' and 'must not', " Ms Lee said.  
"I don't want to pre-empt the recommendations of the Local Government and Environment select committee which is now considering the entire Bill, but it is only fair to signal the Alliance is drawing a line in the sand on this issue."  
"I am advised that some submissions are likely to be made to the select committee aimed at trying to soften or remove the anti-water-privatisation measures. The committee will make its recommendations in due course."  
Submissions on the Bill close on 22 February 2002.
