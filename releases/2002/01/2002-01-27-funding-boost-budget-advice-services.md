Over $600,000 of new funding is to be invested in voluntary budget advice services, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

During 2001 the 144 budget services that are affiliated to the New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services received 249,449 enquiries and worked with 38,077 client families who collectively owed about $168 million.

Steve Maharey said budget services report that the cases they assist with are becoming more complex and difficult to resolve. In addition falling numbers of people are making themselves available to volunteer their time as budget advisers.

"I'm pleased to be able to announce extra money to provide help to those struggling to make ends meet.

"The extra funding will help deal with the pressures faced by budget services, and will enable some paid budget advisers to be employed to provide continuity. The funds will also ensure that the new recruits are fully trained. It is also a recognition that the services have had real funding levels eroded over the last five years.

"The allocation of $619,000 this financial year was decided on after consulting about distribution criteria with umbrella budget services groups.

"This announcement comes at a particularly busy time for budget advisory services. Christmas and summer holiday bills are now arriving in letterboxes and many families will find it difficult to cope without quality budget advice," Steve Maharey said.
