Much has been said recently about the possible consequences for New Zealand of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.

The most dramatic predictions – which naturally attract the most attention – have come from those opposed to the protocol. They argue that it will have dire consequences for the international competitiveness of New Zealand businesses.

This analysis is mistaken: it assumes that the Government will be adopting extreme and punitive policies to meet New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emission targets, when we have no intention of doing so. See [www.climatechange.govt.nz](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/) for some of the economic analysis behind this debate.

In this article, however, I want to discuss what the consequences of bowing to the critics’ arguments would be. What would happen if New Zealand walked away from the Kyoto Protocol?

First, New Zealand’s absence would not stop the Protocol coming into force. It will become operational when 55 countries have ratified it, including those responsible for 55 percent of developed world emissions in the benchmark year of 1990.

The world’s largest emitter, the United States, has said it will not ratify, but the Protocol is expected to come into force anyway with the support of Japan, Russia, Canada, Britain, the European Union, Scandinavia and others.

If New Zealand joined the US – and possibly Australia – in refusing to join the collective effort of those other nations, we would suffer serious damage to the “clean and green” reputation we trade on internationally. President Bush was burned in effigy at large demonstrations in Europe following his decision to abandon the Protocol. Is New Zealand prepared to accept that kind of vilification of its representatives and products abroad?

This is no mere question of diplomatic “face”. Our international tourism marketing, with its “100% pure NZ” theme relies heavily on our environmental credentials. And the marketing of New Zealand produce is increasingly tailored to the environmental sensibilities of sophisticated northern hemisphere consumers.

Our record in tackling greenhouse gas emissions offers us no defence. New Zealand produces less than 0.2 percent of world emissions. But our emissions per person are the fourth highest in the developed world, including large methane emissions from farming. Carbon dioxide emissions have increased faster than the population over the past decade. Energy demand for transport, the main source of carbon dioxide emissions, has been growing steadily at about 4 percent a year.

New Zealand depends on an equable, stable climate for its prosperity more than other developed nations, because our economy is still grounded in primary production. That is why successive New Zealand governments have argued consistently for international action to combat climate change. We need global action more than it needs us.

Now that a large part of the international community has agreed to act, are New Zealanders really prepared to take the benefits without playing our part? The Protocol is the only global mechanism that offers any progress in combating climate change. It is possible to freeload, but I do not believe that is the New Zealand way. And freeloading is certainly not the kind of leadership our Asia-Pacific neighbours expect of us.

Some government critics would say their beef is only with “early” ratification of the Protocol, saying New Zealand should wait until Australia and the United States have ratified. So what if we waited?

As far as the rest of the world is concerned, “waiting” would be the same as refusing to ratify. That, after all, is the current US position. If Australia follows the US into the wilderness – and it is not yet clear that it will – and New Zealand follows both, the rest of the world will see little distinction between us. The main difference is that New Zealand has consistently been more positive and constructive in Protocol negotiations, and would therefore be judged more of a hypocrite.

Pegging New Zealand’s ratification to that of the US or Australia would also entail a surrender of both control and predictability. New Zealand’s decision on timing would effectively be made in Washington. We have no way of knowing when the US might reverse its position on Kyoto, so business in this country would face more years of uncertainty.

At the same time, waiting would risk magnifying the shock of any eventual commitments to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of having the best part of a decade to adapt to relatively mild constraints on emissions, business would have much less time – and risk much tougher constraints cutting in later.

If we are to trial the various market mechanisms the Protocol provides for, undertake research, begin switching from fossil fuels, redirect capital investment and begin to explore the commercial opportunities that the Protocol will bring, we need as much lead time as we can get. Delaying our response to climate change will not help us secure the economic benefits of reducing agricultural methane, increase use of petrol-electric hybrid vehicles or accelerate the arrival of more wind, solar, micro-hydro or geothermal electricity generation. Technology transfer takes time. New Zealand should seize every moment available.
