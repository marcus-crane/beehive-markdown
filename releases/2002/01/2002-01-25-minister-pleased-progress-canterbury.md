Minister pleased at progress in Canterbury

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today the Government has been informed there has been progress in the Canterbury industrial dispute, and that nurses have decided to continue mediation.

“This is welcome. The Government does not intend to get in the way of these negotiations.”
