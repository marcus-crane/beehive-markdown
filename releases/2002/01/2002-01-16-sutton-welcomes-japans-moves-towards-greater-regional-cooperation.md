Minister for Trade Negotiations and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Jim Sutton, welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi’s recent expressions of support for enhanced cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Koizumi’s remarks, made in a speech in Singapore this week, included New Zealand in a vision for strengthened regional cooperation across a spectrum of interests including economic reform, development, security, education and cultural exchange.

“New Zealand supports regional initiatives such as APEC, ASEAN+3 and the ASEAN Regional Forum. Mr Koizumi’s vision for the creation of a community in the Asia-Pacific that “acts together and advances together” resonates with New Zealand’s commitment to regional cooperation” Mr Sutton said.

Mr Sutton emphasised the value New Zealand places on its bilateral relationship with Japan and welcomed its outward looking initiatives aimed at helping the region grow and enhancing stability and prosperity. “I look forward to seeing how these proposals for greater cooperation and exchange in the Asia-Pacific region develop” Mr Sutton said.

“The Prime Minister has invited Mr Koizumi to visit New Zealand this year and we would welcome the opportunity of discussing this initiative and other matters with him, should he be able to do so.”
