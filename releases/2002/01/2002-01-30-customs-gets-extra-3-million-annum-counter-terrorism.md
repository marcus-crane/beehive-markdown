“Three million dollars per annum of new funding for Customs will be used to help prevent New Zealand being used as a base for terrorism overseas or as a transit point for international terrorism,” says Acting Customs Minister Jim Anderton.

“New Zealand may not be under threat directly but we need to play our part in keeping other countries and the international community free from terrorist attacks.

“The extra funding will enable Customs to work more closely with other agencies both in New Zealand and internationally, to better track and identify travellers and cargo that may be linked to terrorist networks.

“There will be more physical inspections of cargo and a higher level of monitoring of planes and ships as a result of this increased funding.

“Funding will also go to the state-of-the-art Customs computer system, CusMod, which alerts Customs Officers to travellers and cargo that represent a high risk.

“Customs has already boosted its information and intelligence-gathering initiatives and its hands-on checks on some goods and travellers since September 11, from within existing resources.

“Customs will continue to build on its close working relationships with MAF Quarantine and the New Zealand Immigration Service at the border.

Jim Anderton says all Customs information gathering and sharing is governed by New Zealand legislation, including the Customs and Excise Act, the Privacy Act and the Official Information Act.

“The Labour Alliance Coalition Government is also planning some changes to legislation to ensure Customs is provided electronically with accurate information about goods shipments, and to provide more flexibility in sharing information with overseas law enforcement agencies,” said Jim Anderton.
