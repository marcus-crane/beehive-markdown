The Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee will visit the Auckland Islands next week.  
The PM’s party will sail from Bluff on the Leander frigate HMNZS CANTERBURY on Friday 1 February 2002, accompanied by the Navy tanker HMNZS ENDEAVOUR.  
The Ships are servicing Department of Conservation projects on the Islands, landing 14 tonnes of equipment and material on the Islands and will transport DOC staff as part of a Navy contract with government departments.  
The Prime and Minister and the Minister of Conservation will have the opportunity during 2-3 February to inspect DOC projects, visit historic sites, observe wildlife and explore these isolated islands which were the site of one the shortest-lived settlements in New Zealand’s history – the Enderby settlement at the township of Hardwicke at Port Ross on the northern end of Auckland Island was established in 1850 and abandoned in 1852.  
The Ships will carry one of the Navy’s new Seasprite helicopters which will be used for off-loading supplies and ferrying personnel ashore.  
The Prime Minister and party will fly to Invercargill airport on Monday 4 February from Fouveaux Strait while the ships continue to Dunedin where the ships’ companies will join in Waitangi Day celebrations.  
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Conservation will be accompanied by their partners and three staff members as well as five media staff.
