The New Zealand Government will contribute $100,000 towards relief efforts in Vanuatu following an earthquake which struck earlier this month, Minister in charge of Official Development Assistance, Matt Robson says.

“This cash grant will go towards temporary repair of the Teouma bridge on the main island of Efate and other immediate repair work to infrastructure links damaged by the earthquake,” says Matt Robson

“Vanuatu’s roads and the Teouma Bridge have sustained major damage from the earthquake, cutting off many vital transport links.

“The Teouma Bridge is a particularly important link for those who live in the northern and eastern parts of Efate and rely on ready access to Port Vila for their income. These repairs will stabilise the bridge and enable them to continue commuting to the capital while a permanent solution to building a new bridge is found.

“Aside from this emergency relief, New Zealand and the FRANZ (France, Australia and New Zealand) group of donors will keep in continuous contact with Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management office and Public Works Department to assess the need for long term donor assistance,” says Matt Robson.

Vanuatu was struck by the earthquake on 3 January. It was centred 50 kilometres east of Port Vila, measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale.
