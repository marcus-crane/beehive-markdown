Communications and Information Technology Minister Paul Swain has welcomed moves by Fonterra to find partners to set up an alternative internet network, using satellite and wireless technology.

“Farmers need better access to the internet if they are going to stay internationlly competitive ,” Paul Swain said.

“The fact that www is more likely to mean world wide wait rather than worlid wide web to people in rural and provincial areas is not lost on the government,” he said.

“Last year we set a goal is to ensure all kiwi communities can access two-way high-speed Internet services by the end of 2003.

“The government is funding six regional pilot schemes to test the potential for bringing together broadband demand in regions in a commercially attractive way for suppliers.

“Over the next month I will be visiting each of these pilot schemes to gauge their progress.

“Fonterra’s decision to pursue a solution to the problems facing farmers is very welcome at this time,” Paul Swain said.
