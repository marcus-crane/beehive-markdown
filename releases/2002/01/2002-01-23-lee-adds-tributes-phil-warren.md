Local Government Minister Sandra Lee has added her tribute to those being paid to Auckland local government leader Philip Warren who died this morning.  
"Phil Warren had a distinguished record as a local authority leader, most recently as Chairman of the Auckland Regional Council, but also previously with the Auckland City Council as Deputy Mayor, and as an office holder of Local Government New Zealand."  
"He was an icon of the New Zealand entertainment industry, and a popular talkback radio host," Ms Lee said.  
"He was so well-regarded by his peers that he was elected to chair the Hauraki Gulf Forum at a meeting in Auckland that he couldn't attend because he was overseas on business, and only learned of his new responsibilities when contacted by staff."  
Ms Lee extended her condolences to Mr Warren's son and daughter, and the extended Warren family.

Auckland Regional Council media release announcing Mr Warren's death

ARC Chairman dies suddenly

January 23, 2002  
The Auckland Regional Council regrets to announce the sudden death of its Chairman Philip Warren QSO, JP this morning.  
ARC Chief Executive Jo Brosnahan says Mr Warren was admitted to hospital early this morning and died following a heart attack. He was 63.  
"Phil Warren has been an incredibly strong Auckland leader for more than two decades and his death is a sad loss not only for the ARC but for the Auckland region as a whole."  
Mr Warren has been Chairman of the ARC since 1992 and last year was re-elected to a record fourth term as Chairman. He has also been Chairman of the Auckland Regional Growth Forum and the Hauraki Gulf Forum since its inception.  
Prior to his election to the ARC he spent 12 years as an Auckland City councillor including four years as Deputy Mayor and a period as Acting Mayor. He was awarded the Queen’s Service Order in 1994.  
Mrs Brosnahan says Mr Warren oversaw many significant changes during his tenure as Chairman.  
"He was at the forefront of an integrated approach to regional issues. He was always adamant that a combined effort by all the Auckland local government authorities was needed to solve our major issues of transport, growth and the environment," Mrs Brosnahan says.  
"Mr Warren was an Aucklander through and through with a passion for the Auckland Region which was clearly evident in everything he fought for.  
"He was also one of this region’s most colourful politicians, prepared to take on any issue and call a spade a spade. His personality will be sorely missed on the political landscape.  
"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his family at this time."  
ARC Deputy Chairman Philip Sherry takes over as Acting Chairman immediately.  
"Mr Warren suffered a health scare in 1999 but he bounced back with renewed vigour," Cr Sherry says.  
"With the death of his wife Pat Warren in March 2000, this is added grief for his son Reece and daughter Keeley, grandchildren April, Grace Tom, and the extended Warren family. On behalf of his council colleagues I would like to extend condolences to them."  
The family requests no flowers be sent. Mr Warren would have preferred donations to be sent to the SPCA of which he was a past president or the Cancer Society.  
Funeral information will be included in death notices.
