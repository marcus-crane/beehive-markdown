“The NZ Customs Service will soon have the first mobile x-ray machine of its type in the country which will help combat terrorism and strengthen our international borders”, the Acting Minister of Customs Jim Anderton announced today: International Customs Day.

Jim Anderton said the new machine will be used by the Customs Service as it deals with increasing challenges such as organised terrorism, drug rings, and wildlife smuggling.

Greater detection powers will help Customs to identify potential threats and contraband more easily.

“The impact of the international changes mean we are seeing a significant upgrade in the way our borders are managed – we’re moving from a benign environment to a more hostile environment in border management.

“Drugs are also of significant concern and I commend Customs for the daily war waged for all New Zealanders to prevent illicit drugs arriving here.

“NZ is now being targeted by Asian criminal gangs producing and trafficking in amphetamine type substances such as ecstasy and ice,” said Jim Anderton.

The new machine, valued at over $100,000, will be used to detect and prevent narcotics and other restricted items from coming into New Zealand.

The main areas where the unit will be deployed at this stage will be to examine cargo (air & sea) and passengers’ baggage from cruise ships

A purpose built trailer is being built, and a generator is being purchased to make the unit totally mobile – where it can be used anywhere in the country.
