Alliance leader and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton will go to Waitangi this year with the Prime Minister.

And his message for the day is: ‘New Zealand is an example to the world, and we should celebrate that.’

“With the Government returning to Waitangi, I hope all New Zealanders will join together in celebrating our nationhood,” Jim Anderton said.

“For all the difficulties New Zealand has had over the years, we have forged relations in a way which is an example to most other countries of a positive partnership.

“It’s time that we learnt how to celebrate achievements, and not just be paralysed by the past, and I hope the spirit of celebration is shared by all New Zealanders.

“For most New Zealanders, Waitangi Day is another well-earned day off in the summer sun, and that probably puts into perspective the anxiety that some people like to express on Waitangi Day.”

The official party will attend a powhiri at the National Marae on the afternoon of Tuesday, 5 February, and a Dawn karakia on Waitangi Day.

Jim Anderton has previously spent Waitangi Day as Deputy Prime Minister at the Orongomai Marae open day in the Hutt Valley.
