Up to ten outstanding tertiary teachers will be awarded New Zealand's first Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards this year.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey called for applications for the inaugural awards today and said they will recognise excellence in tertiary teaching, promote good teaching practice and enhance career development for tertiary teachers. An annual publication showcasing tertiary teaching best-practice will also be produced and widely distributed. Funding for the awards and the publication was set aside in last year's budget.

Details of the awards criteria are being sent out this week along with an invitation to tertiary providers to identify tertiary teachers they consider most worthy of recognition.

Steve Maharey said the awards give tertiary teaching the recognition it has long lacked and are a practical way for the government to encourage the transfer of knowledge.

"Ground-breaking research by academic staff in our tertiary institutions has long been recognised - but until now cutting-edge teaching has not been acknowledged nationally.

"The awards not only acknowledge and reward our best tertiary teachers, but also generally raise awareness of the need for ongoing teaching improvement across the whole post-secondary education and training system.

"There will be up to ten awards each year for excellence across three categories as well as a supreme Prime Minister's award. The number of awards made each year will depend on the quality of the nominations received.

"The categories are Sustained Excellence, Excellence in Innovation and Excellence in Collaboration. The recipients of the excellence awards will receive $20,000 each and the winner of the Prime Minister's award will receive $30,000 to be spent enhancing their teaching career and promoting best practice.

"The awards are an important element of the government's tertiary education agenda to provide clear strategic direction for the entire post-secondary education and training system and to improve the quality of teaching and research. Other related initiatives include the establishment of a tertiary complaints function within the Office of the Ombudsman this year and the Centres of Excellence Research (CoRE) Fund.

"Nominations will be considered by a specially constituted Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards Committee drawn from the sector chaired by Massey University Assistant Vice- Chancellor (Academic) Professor Graeme Fraser.

"The other members of the committee are Andrew Campbell, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students' Association; Deborah Willis, Director of the Victoria University of Wellington University Teaching Development Centre; Stuart Middleton, General Manager Academic Services at Auckland College of Education; June Tam, representing the Aotearoa Tertiary Students Association; John Blakey, chair of the Industry Training Federation; Christine Teariki, chair of the Takitimu School of the Performing Arts Trust; Kathie Irwin, Managing Director of Educational Horizons Limited and Paul McElroy, Chief Executive of the Universal College of Learning.

"The awards criteria and nominations process were also developed by the committee," Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey said the committee provides excellent coverage of the tertiary sector and consists of respected experts.

Nominations are expected from a variety of tertiary providers, including universities, wananga, polytechnics, colleges of education and organisations representing private training establishments. Nominations close on 29 March 2002, with the recipients announced at a ceremony in June 2002. The awards are administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.
