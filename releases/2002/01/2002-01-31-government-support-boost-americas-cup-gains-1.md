The Government is committing another $3 million to help New Zealand realise the potential from hosting the America’s Cup.

Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard made the announcement during a visit to Team New Zealand’s base in the Auckland Viaduct.

Today’s funding announcement is on top of the $5.6 million announced in May 2000 to assist Team New Zealand in its defence of the America’s Cup through an association with Brand New Zealand.

“Team New Zealand has not only been a wonderful ambassador for New Zealand but their success also had positive economic impact on the country. The government is determined that the enormous opportunities offered by the New Zealand’s second defence of the America’s Cup, are not lost,” Helen Clark said.

“Late last year I announced funding to help us maximise the potential from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In a similar vein, hosting the second defence of the America’s Cup in New Zealand provides us with opportunities to promote New Zealand in ways that would otherwise not be possible.

“Ministers have therefore approved a number of activities that take advantage of these opportunities in the areas of trade, tourism, industry development and culture.

“This is a good investment for the country. The national pride which winning the last challenge created was evident following the historic win. But a report into the economic impact of the 1999-2000 America's Cup regatta shows that such large-scale events also have an economic spin-off that benefits the whole country. The Fairgray Report estimated that the event generated $640 million of economic activity in New Zealand.

“The government is keen to support activities that will enhance the potential from the next defence.”

Trevor Mallard said the range of activities included increased promotion in the home countries of the challenging syndicates as well as on the ground activities to help support the event itself.

“Offshore activities include carefully targeted marine sector supplements and seminars in conjunction with yacht clubs in the challenging syndicate countries which will promote both the defence of the America’s Cup as well as tourism, investment and trade opportunities, and New Zealand food and beverage.

“In just under two weeks’ time, some of the syndicates taking part in the Louis Vuitton will be racing against Team New Zealand in a key event building up to the America’s Cup. Tourism New Zealand and Trade New Zealand will be using that event to host up to 50 international journalists – mainly from travel and lifestyle publications in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.

“This weekend sees the start of official government welcomes for the challenging syndicate. Making challenging syndicates feel welcome in our country is an important aspect of the success of the 2002/03 event. It will also help ensure that syndicates want to return to New Zealand for Team New Zealand’s next defence!

Other initiatives include  
\* funding business facilitators to work closely with regional tourism, business, economic development agencies, Maori business and cultural groups to help leverage development opportunities;

\* provision of ongoing communications, facilitation and advisory services by a central government presence in Auckland;

\* and funding for collaborative promotion and marketing of planned events to ensure New Zealand’s culture and heritage is prominent during the event.

“The defence of the America’s Cup promises New Zealand a further opportunity to revisit the success of the previous campaign,” Trevor Mallard said.
