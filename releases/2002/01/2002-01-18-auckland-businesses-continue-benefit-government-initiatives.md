“Auckland businesses are reaping the benefits of the government’s increased commitment to private sector research and development,” says Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

Auckland City has been the highest recipient of Grants for Private Sector Research and Development (GPSRD) since the scheme began in September 2000. Manukau City was the second-highest recipient.

GPSRD grants support the technological or technical development of new products, processes and services in small to medium sized firms. They are targeted at firms who are increasing their annual investment in R&D.

Between September 2000 and the end of November 2001, Auckland City received $4,861,606 and Manukau City received $3,340,481 in grants. The Auckland region combined received almost $10 million in grants - 47% of the total funds available (including North Shore $887,942 and Waitakere City $509, 624)

Minister for Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson says the GPSRD Scheme is one of three programmes administered by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology to encourage greater investment in R&D.

“As the economic powerhouse of New Zealand, Auckland has a large role to play in building a true knowledge society,” says Judith Tizard. “The Labour-Alliance Government is providing opportunities for greater research and innovation, and Auckland is taking up those opportunities.”

Alongside the GPSRD Scheme, Auckland’s entrepreneurs and small businesses have received a good proportion of Industry New Zealand’s Enterprise Awards, and in December, Industry New Zealand gave the Auckland region a $750,000 boost for regional economic development.

“The Labour-Alliance Government made a commitment to work collaboratively with the whole of Auckland to improve the region’s international competitiveness and urban infrastructure,” says Judith Tizard. “A strong and healthy Auckland is an asset to the rest of New Zealand.”
