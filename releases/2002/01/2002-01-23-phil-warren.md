Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to Auckland Regional Council chair Phil Warren, who died this morning, saying his passing was a significant loss to the Auckland region.

“Phil Warren has been an outstanding figure in Auckland local and regional government. He was an Auckland City Councillor for 12 years, and deputy mayor for four. He led the Auckland Regional Council from its inception in 1992, and was a driving force in enabling the region to work together more effectively.

“On the national level, Phil Warren served as a council member of Local Government New Zealand from 1996 to 2001 and played a key role in helping to build the new, positive relationship which has developed between central and local government.

“The entertainment industry will also mourn Phil’s death. There he was known for his energy, flair, and entrepreneurial ability. He brought colour and life to Auckland and New Zealand in the more staid times of the 1960s and 70s.

“Phil was not without controversy – some would say he courted it at times – and he relished taking on challenges, but it was always with good humour.

“Phil Warren was a good friend. I will miss him for his good humour, sheer zest for life, and enthusiasm for Auckland,” Helen Clark said.

Phil Warren was made awarded a Queen’s Service Order for public services in the 1994 Queen’s Birthday honours list.
