Judith Tizard, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues said today that Phil Warren’s sudden death this morning was a blow to Auckland and to her personally.

"Phil Warren showed courage, vision and leadership, and while he never shrank from controversy, his passionate advocacy for Auckland was always for the good of the entire region.

"Phil’s death will be sorely felt by all those who were working to make Auckland both a better place to live and to work.

"I like many others have been grateful for his personal friendship and I have always regarded Phil as a friend and mentor."
