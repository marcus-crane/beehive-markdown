Agiculture Minister Jim Sutton said today that he welcomed the decision to merge the food safety and assurance responsibilities of the Health Ministry and the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry into a semi-autonomous agency within MAF.

Mr Sutton said he also welcomed the appointment of Health Minister Annette King as Food Minister-designate.

“Annette has a commonsense approach that should ensure the continuation of New Zealand’s excellent export reputation for safe, high quality food.”

Mr Sutton said food safety was a vitally important issue all around the world.

”It is critical for New Zealand – a country heavily reliant on food exports – that we have the right mechanisms to maintain our good international reputation.”
