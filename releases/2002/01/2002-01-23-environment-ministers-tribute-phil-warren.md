Environment Minister Marian Hobbs says the late Phil Warren was a strong advocate for improving Auckland's environment and the region is the poorer with his sudden death.

"As chairman of the Auckland Regional Council he played an outstanding role in raising the profile of environmental issues particularly with last year's campaign directed at smokey vehicles, diesel pollution and the region's transport difficulties," Marian Hobbs said.

"Phil Warren took a lead in empowering people with the opportunity to do something about their environment.

"I always found him engaging and challenging.

"I extend my condolences to Mr Warren's family, colleagues and many friends."
