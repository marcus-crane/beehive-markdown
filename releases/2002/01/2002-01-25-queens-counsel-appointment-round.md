Queen’s Counsel Appointment Round for 2002

The Attorney-General, the Hon Margaret Wilson announced today that a new appointment round for Queen’s Counsel will begin this year.  
Queen’s Counsel appointments for 2001 were deferred following a review of the process. That review is now complete. Changes to the appointment process of Queen’s Counsel now await Cabinet consideration which will take place by the end of January. Any changes will be linked with the proposed new Bill regulating the legal profession.  
Accordingly, there will be a new round of Queen’s Counsel appointments this year. The appointments for this round will be made on the same basis as previous years in accordance with existing regulations. However some of the procedural improvements foreshadowed in the review will be implemented for this round. In particular, the Attorney-General will convene an advisory panel comprising the Solicitor-General and representatives of the Law Society and Bar Association to advise the Attorney-General, in consultation with the Chief Justice, in the selection process.  
Applications for Queen’s Counsel should be sent to the Solicitor-General no later than 28 February 2002.
