Commerce Minister Paul Swain has welcomed the appointment by the Australian government of John King as the New Zealand member of the Australian Takeovers Panel.

John King is the chairman of the New Zealand Takeovers Panel.

“Mr King’s appointment is part of a reciprocal arrangment between Australia and New Zealand for the appointment of a representative to each country’s Takeovers Panel,” Paul Swain said.

“Last year we appointed Denis Byrne as an Australian member of the New Zealand Takeovers Panel.

“Our governments see these Trans-tasman appointments as cementing the relationship of closer co-ordination in the area of takeovers law.

“These appointments reflect the increasing integration of the New Zealand and the Australian business sectors in the broader context of CER,” Paul Swain said.

John King is the senior partner with law firm Russell McVeagh. His current directorships include Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited,  
WestpacTrust Investments Limited, The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company  
Limited and New Zealand Guardian Trust Funds Management Limited. He is also a member of the boards of the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc and the Spirit of Adventure Trust.
