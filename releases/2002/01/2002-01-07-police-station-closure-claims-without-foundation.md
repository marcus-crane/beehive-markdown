Published claims about the closure of police stations are misleading, mischievous and lack credibility, Police Minister George Hawkins said today.

“There is no closure list.

“The Commissioner of Police has reassured me in a briefing this afternoon that the claims do not reflect reality. The police are committed to community policing and so is the government.

“The consultant’s reports are actually report cards on the previous National government’s degradation of police stations. Between 1996 and 1999 the National government spent, on average, only $750,000 a year on police property. No wonder a number of police stations have fallen into a state of disrepair.

“In contrast the Labour-Alliance government is spending $50m to $60 million over the next 5 or 6 years on police capital works, including the upgrade of police stations. That’s a substantial investment in community police stations throughout New Zealand,” George Hawkins said.

George Hawkins has challenged the opposition to name the police stations that are going to be closed.
