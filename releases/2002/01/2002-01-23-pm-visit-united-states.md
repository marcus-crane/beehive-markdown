Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that she will meet United States President George W Bush in Washington on 26 March.

Helen Clark’s visit follows a brief meeting between the two leaders in Shanghai last October at the APEC leaders summit.

“I look forward very much to seeing Mr Bush again and talking with him about issues of concern to our two countries,” Helen Clark said.

“The United States is a very important partner for New Zealand. President Bush and I will have the opportunity to discuss bilateral matters, including trade, and important regional and international issues, including the campaign against terrorism.”

In the United States Helen Clark will also meet members of the business community to promote a closer economic partnership with the US and investment opportunities in New Zealand.
