Associate Energy Minister Paul Swain says for the first time New Zealand is to host the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

OPEC oil-producing countries represent about 40 per cent of the world’s petroleum production and have a significant influence on world oil prices.

Ali Rodriguez-Araque is to present the opening address to the New Zealand Petroleum Conference in Auckland in February.

Paul Swain said this is the first visit to New Zealand by any OPEC Secretary-General.

“Dr Rodriguez-Araque, was the former president of OPEC, he was appointed as OPEC Secretary General just a year ago and is highly regarded for his abilities to give some stability to world oil prices.

“The fact he will be here for the New Zealand Petroleum Conference is welcome news. These conferences are biennial events and provide a focus for New Zealand’s petroleum exploration and production industry.

“This year’s conference will concentrate on the potential for the petroleum industry, ranging from the extension to deeper water exploration to new ideas for exploration in the Taranaki Basin.

“The Conference will also hear about commercial issues, extension of New Zealand’s continental shelf, geological advances and plans for the development of the new Pohokura and Rimu fields,” Paul Swain said.
