Commerce Minister Paul Swain has released his letter to the Australian Stock Exchange outlining concerns over ASX proposals to significantly lift the threshold for listed entities to qualify for Foreign Exempt Status.

Paul Swain said such a move would increase compliance costs to companies listed on both the NZSE and ASX.

“I have pointed out that, consistent with the CER Agreement and MOU on Business Law Co-ordination, we should be looking to reduce the costs of firms having to comply with multiple laws in a transTasman market – not make it more complicated.

“Historically New Zealand companies have been given preferential treatment on Foreign Exempt Status by not having to meet either the ‘profit’ test or ‘net tangible asset test’.

“Suggestions that the ASX might treat New Zealand listed companies precisely the same as any other foreign listed entity is a backward step, and one that I personally would not like to see taken.

“I recognise that it is the ASX’s prerogative to change the rule. For this reason I have suggested, if the rule change does happen, that we work together to minimise compliance costs for dual listed companies.

“ASX managing director Richard Humphry has now responded to my letter and indicates a Consultation Paper will be released for comment this month.

“His response affirms the ASX’s commitment to avoid unnecessary administration and compliance costs for its customers. This is precisely the aim of our proposals.

“While I respect Mr Humphry's intention that the ASX retains direct responsibility and authority for the administration of its listing contracts, I do not believe that our proposals undermine this right.

“Our relationship to Australia is unique and that should be recognised,” Paul Swain said.
