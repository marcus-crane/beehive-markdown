Minister of Transport Paul Swain has directed the board of Transfund New Zealand to provide Northland and East Cape with 100% funding for land transport projects that assist in regional development.

“The direction applies to the allocation of the $30 million earmarked for transport-related regional development projects that was announced in February’s ‘Moving Forward’ package,” said Mr Swain. “It is aimed at helping Northland and East Cape develop better transport links to cope with the so-called wall of wood, due to be harvested soon.

“The direction requires Transfund to provide 100% funding for regional development roads and alternatives to roading to the six councils in the East Cape and Northland regions. Transfund usually funds about half of a project’s cost, on average, so this is an exception to the normal funding arrangements, ” said Mr Swain. “But the six councils must continue with their overall contribution to land transport investment in their districts.

“This is great news for the East Cape and Northland regions as it will increase the likelihood of land transport projects that aid regional development proceeding. The spin-offs from this, such as increased investment from forestry and transport companies in these regions, will create jobs and boost the local economies.

The direction supports the government’s commitment to regional development, especially in acute need regions,” said Mr Swain. “It will also ensure that the New Zealand economy as a whole can benefit from the wall of wood and it will assist us with our goal of returning to the top half of the OECD.”

Mr Swain said he would like to thank Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton, who has worked with local authorities, iwi, business and community representatives in Northland and East Cape to successfully address regional development issues.
