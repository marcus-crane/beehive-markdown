STATE SECTOR STANDARDS BOARD: THE ETHOS OF THE STATE SECTOR REPORT, AS AT 30 JUNE 2002

Introduction

The State Sector Standards Board was appointed in November 2000. Its members are: Kerry McDonald (chairman), Angela Foulkes, John Martin, Rangimarie Parata Takurua, Elmar Toime and Jim Turner. The Board has been assisted by Christine Goodman (SSC). This is its second annual report on the ethos of the State Sector.

The Ethos of the State Sector

There do not appear to have been any significant developments in the ethos of the State Sector since the Board’s last report. Concerns about the ethical and managerial standards of organisations in the State Sector preceded the establishment of this Board and, in the words of the State Services Commissioner, ‘cast a shadow’ over public organisations. Regrettably, instances of inappropriate behaviour continue to come to light and underline our observation in last year’s report that there is ‘a need to be vigilant, in terms of behavioural standards, effective systems, and commitment by leadership’.

The promulgation of a revised Public Service Code of Conduct is welcomed, as is the work programme outlined in the SSC’s Statement of Intent . We note, however, that there remains a pressing need to clarify the particular governance relationships in respect of the various types of Crown entities.

The Board considers that the issues raised in its reports on Parliament and the State Sector, and the Official Information Act, the Privacy Act and the Protected Disclosures Act are important in relation to the development of the ethos of the State Sector, particularly in terms of respect for the institutions of democracy and citizens’ trust in public services.

On 11 March 2001 the Government announced that it had adopted the Board’s recommended Statement of Expectations and that, as recommended by the Board, Ministers were also signing a Statement of Commitment to the State Sector.

The Board’s reports have encouraged increased activity, especially in the Public Service and among chief executives, in aspects of State Sector management to which the Board, particularly in the 2001 Ethos Report, has drawn attention. This activity included the project on the Review of the Centre, and many of the proposals coming from that review have value. Most of this work, in various forms, is ongoing and an important recent development is the Government’s establishment of the Review of the Centre’s Change Implementation Advisory Group. The Board also welcomes the possibility of a broadening of the State Services Commission’s mandate, leading to providing a more consistent oversight of the whole of the State Sector on matters relating to ethics and ethos.

The Board’s reports have acknowledged the very substantial improvement in many aspects of the performance of the State Sector over the last fifteen years and the generally high standards of behaviours. However, they have also highlighted areas of significant concern, which, despite the initiatives of the past year or so, continue to require serious attention. These include:

· quality of leadership ;  
· quality and effective use of performance management systems and processes;  
· inadequate attention to the training and development of staff;  
·lack of focus on succession planning and career development;  
·need for a State Sector strategy on remuneration, particularly for lower level and front line staff;  
·weak orientation to “whole of government” and an inclination to work in compartments; and  
·continuing emphasis on outputs at the expense of outcomes.

Other important points of concern are:

·the apparent failure of organisations within the State Sector to effectively disseminate and use the Government’s Statement of Expectations, as the foundation of a culture of ethical behaviour and high performance .

·the need for rigorous policy analysis and effective consultation is endorsed, but there appears to be at times a reluctance to move on to decision and implementation;  
·the protracted processes of achieving consensus among the State Sector leadership group (including the relitigation of policy issues) can lead to delays and dilution of clear government intentions, which within a three year electoral cycle can have the effect of defeating the democratic process;  
·the working relationships between Ministers and officials. To achieve good outcomes, the State Sector depends on both leadership from ministers and responsiveness, professionalism and commitment by officials . From time to time, for example after a General Election, more effective ‘orientation’ measures designed to facilitate the smooth functioning of these crucial relationships would be useful; and  
·circumstances where it appears that State Sector organisations avoid constructive engagement with an issue, particularly when another organisation is taking the initiative or has the main responsibility. Effective performance management should give more positive incentives for the desired behaviour and sharper consequences for undesirable behaviour.

These concerns must be seen in the context of the vital role of the State Sector, in relation to New Zealand’s economic and social performance, the well being of the community and the effectiveness of the conduct of New Zealand’s international relations. They also reflect the substantial assets, numbers of people and cash flows that are managed and controlled by the State Sector. The State Sector is so large and its influence so pervasive that any weakness in its performance has a serious influence on New Zealand’s overall performance, both absolutely and in comparison with other countries.

The Board is aware of the reality that significant cultural change in organisations cannot be achieved overnight. Nonetheless, the Board is concerned that change and improvement in systems and processes across the State Sector, including the Public Service, often seem to take an unduly long time to implement. Change is too slow, particularly given the urgent need for improvement in a number of key areas. Vital improvement processes take years, when weeks or months would be more appropriate, and are reasonably achievable, for example, to ensure that sound performance management systems are in effective use .

The matters referred to here do not necessarily involve departmental re-organisations or legislative amendment, although that may be required if improvement cannot be achieved otherwise. Rather, they require more effective leadership and a sharp improvement in performance management in State Sector organisations. Linked with this should be a major improvement in training and development of staff, more collaborative working arrangements amongst State Sector organisations, oriented to the “whole of government” and a stronger focus on outcomes.

The Board has explicitly stated that it is not obvious that there is a consistently better standard of performance in the private sector compared with the State Sector, but there are significant aspects of organisation, system and process, widely and effectively used in the private sector and in some parts of the State Sector, which should be more widely adopted within the State Sector.

It is not sufficient for State Sector organisations simply to transact day-to-day business, without also developing the basis for the organisation to assess and deal with strategic issues and to improve and develop their capability to operate more efficiently and effectively in future.  
The need for more emphasis on capacity building is underlined by New Zealand’s poor relative economic performance within the OECD over a number of decades. While growth in GDP per capita is not the sole measure for the well being of New Zealand and its citizens, the consequences of a low rate of economic growth over a long period are now increasingly evident in the gaps between expectations and the reality of our standard of living and well being.

For the State Sector, achieving a marked improvement in processes to build capacity is vital. Whilst recognising that some work is underway in building a leadership capacity, there needs to be a stronger commitment to broad capacity building amongst all State Sector employees. Part of that capacity should be developing the mechanisms to engage with the community in a manner that enables regional New Zealand to participate fully in the development and delivery of State services. The central agencies should be ensuring that this happens, and without protracted delays.

Following a General Election the new government should affirm, amend or abandon the Statements of Expectation and Commitment. A reaffirmation (or amendment) of the Statements should be accompanied by strong ministerial advocacy.

Why is an improved performance so important?

Improved performance by organisations means more efficient and effective use of the resources that they control or influence. Improved policy development and implementation processes produce better outcomes, greater employee productivity and therefore higher remuneration and improved employee satisfaction, potential and career prospects.

Done properly, the results are positive for everyone.

The alternative is often a potentially serious win/lose situation, where better results are achieved simply by pushing people harder. Without sound improvement processes, greater output often means longer hours and greater stress for employees, and a generally unsustainable and unsatisfactory situation. Unfortunately, this scenario is the more evident, with numbers of State Sector employees asserting that work pressures are too great and their role is undervalued. Whilst much of this is positioning / bargaining, about which we have no mandate to express a view, dealing with this perception requires a more strategic and effective approach, encompassing the issues raised by this Board.

Who benefits from improved performance?

The community, through the more efficient and effective use of resources and the delivery of more and better public services.

The government of the day through the more efficient and effective achievement of its objectives. Consequently, it can do more by way of policy implementation and contributing to the social and economic development of New Zealand.

State Sector employees, as effective organisational and performance improvements typically enable them to work more efficiently and effectively, to achieve more, to develop their own capability and to get more satisfaction from their work.

The private sector in New Zealand faces many of the same challenges as the State Sector. There is a real, but currently untapped, potential to develop a level of excellence amongst State Sector leaders and managers, beginning at the more senior levels, so that these people become a valuable resource for New Zealand generally and have the capability to be highly productive and effective in both the State and Private sectors.

Recommendations:

The State Sector Standards Board recommends that:

·(as in last year’s report) as a high priority for enhancing the ethos and standards in the State Sector, greater impetus be given to addressing the Impediments identified in the Board’s initial report, the Important Influences in its 2001 Ethos Report, and the issues of concern in this report;  
·an appropriate process be established to ensure that these matters are dealt with promptly and effectively, with an agreed range of outcomes and timetable;  
·consideration be given to post election measures to facilitate the development of smooth and effective relationships between Ministers and officials; and  
·that the incoming Government reaffirm the Statements of Expectation and Commitment and ensure their effective advocacy and implementation across the State Sector.
