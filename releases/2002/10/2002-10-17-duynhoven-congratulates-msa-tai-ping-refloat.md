Associate Minister of Transport Harry Duynhoven congratulated the Maritime Safety Authority, Environment Southland and all those involved in the successful refloat of the Tai Ping.

“The refloating of the Tai Ping started at about 10am today and the ship was successfully manuevered into the shipping channel and then to berth,” said Mr Duynhoven.

“Due to the careful detailed planning and preparation work undertaken by the Maritime Safety Authority since October 8, the refloat resulted in no oil leaking in to the harbour. Purely as a precaution, the ship has been surrounded by oil spill containment booms.

“I would like to record my appreciation of the outstanding work done by all involved in this successful endeavour: the director and staff of the Maritime Safety Authority, oil spill response staff of Environment Southland, all members of the oil spill control team at Bluff and Invercargill, the salvors - Alan Bond and Jacob Hogendorp - and salvage personnel, the MSA’s independent salvage adviser John Walker, the ship’s master and crew, staff of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority who traveled to Bluff and Defence Force staff who helped transport equipment.

“I would like to assure the public that the ship will not be permitted to sail from Bluff until it has been surveyed, repaired, and deemed seaworthy by the Director of Maritime Safety,” said Mr Duynhoven.
