The pilot phase of GoProcure, the Government’s planned e-procurement system, is entering its final stages, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“The Commission expects to receive the remaining responses from government agencies concerning participation in GoProcure this week.

“A report will then be prepared for the Government making recommendations on whether the system should proceed to the operational stage, with a public announcement likely in late October 2002,” Trevor Mallard said.

Many government agencies have been participating in the pilot phase of GoProcure, the planned system to allow government agencies to purchase goods and services over the internet.

The pilot, costing $250,000, has been run by the State Services Commission with vendor Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, using Oracle software.

A centralised e-procurement system will give benefits to government agencies by streamlining procurement processes, giving greater control over what is bought, and allowing government agencies to work together more collaboratively. In addition, suppliers to government will have a single entry point to deal with government agencies.

There will be no further comment on Go-procure until the planned public announcement in October.
