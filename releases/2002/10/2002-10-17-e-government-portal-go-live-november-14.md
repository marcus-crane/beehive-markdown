The e-government portal, a “one stop shop” website allowing the public to access government information and services, will be launched on November 14, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“This ground-breaking portal is an excellent example of the Government’s commitment to better service delivery and greater participation of people in democracy. It’s an initiative that backs our desire to make life simpler and more efficient for people and business,” Trevor Mallard said.

The e-government portal is a single website giving structured access to the websites of New Zealand government agencies, and access to services and information that is available from government call centres or offices.

It is a convenient way of finding out about government information and services from one place, without having to understand how government is organised and therefore which sites you need to use.  
The first phase of the portal will provide easy access to almost 5000 government services and information, delivered by around 90 agencies, as well as local government.  
“Future phases of the portal will provide access to an even wider range of services,” Trevor Mallard said.  
The portal will be launched, and go live on November 14. Details of the launch will be advised shortly.
