New Zealand’s future energy prospects and climate change objectives will be significantly enhanced if the government achieves its renewable energy target, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

Mr Hodgson said today that Cabinet had accepted the proposed target of an extra 30 PJ of renewable energy by 2012, which is about 8,300 GWh a year. The Government’s preferred target and the mechanisms to achieve it were released for consultation in April.

Currently New Zealand generates 133 PJ a year from renewable sources. If the target is achieved, that would increase to 163 PJ a year by 2012. The increase would be equivalent to the energy produced by an additional 3.5 Benmore Dams or 60 Tararua wind farms.

“The renewable energy target is a major plank of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy and the Government’s climate change policy programme," Mr Hodgson said. The target demonstrates the Government’s commitment to a broad-based plan of action to achieve a sustainable energy future for New Zealand.

“The achievement of the renewable energy target will be supported by the expansion of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority’s renewable energy programme. It will also depend on the incentives provided by climate change policies.

"The Climate Change Projects mechanism will be a competitive bid-in fund designed to support a range of emission reduction projects, including renewable energy. Funding for projects will be sought in the 2003 Budget round as part of the wider climate change programme.

“Some firms that enter into Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements, which will involve binding commitments to manage their greenhouse gas emissions, may source renewable energy as a way to meet their commitments. The eventual introduction of an emissions charge on fossil fuels will also provide an incentive for greater use of renewable energy.”

Mr Hodgson said the drive for new renewable energy would produce valuable new business opportunities.

"New Zealand is already renowned for technical expertise in geothermal and hydro energy. This could extend to biomass, wind and other technologies as they are developed and installed.

“This target is an achievable challenge. In energy terms it is about double the amount of renewable energy that we would expect to come on stream if we did nothing to address climate change and renewable energy.

“I want New Zealand to have a sustainable energy future. To achieve this we must have a balanced portfolio of energy efficiency improvements and a transition to renewable energy sources,” Mr Hodgson said.
