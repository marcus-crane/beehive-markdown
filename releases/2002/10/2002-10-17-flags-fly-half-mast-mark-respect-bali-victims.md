Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that flags will fly at half mast from Friday to Sunday as a mark of respect to and in remembrance of all who perished in last weekend’s bombing on Bali.

Helen Clark said that she had directed that flags on all government buildings and naval vessels be flown at half-mast. The Prime Minister has also asked that condolence books be placed at Parliament for New Zealanders to record their condolences, and invited local government also to make books available.

“This weekend, as New Zealanders attend their places of worship and go about their normal business, we can reflect on the sorrow and distress which many of our families and the families of Australia, Indonesia, and many other nations are experiencing right now.

“Foremost in our thoughts also will be those who have suffered appalling injuries in the bombing, those who have witnessed the carnage and terror caused by the bombing, and the families, friends and communities of all who have suffered.

“Last Saturday night’s events in Bali shocked our nation and the world. It was a callous act of terror against innocent people and against humanity.

“On behalf of the government and people of New Zealand, I am also sending a message of condolence to the Prime Minister of Australia as our neighbour mourns its victims of the tragedy this Sunday.

“Condolence books for the people of Australia and Indonesia, whose nations suffered the greatest number of deaths and casualties, will be available for signature in Parliament from Friday.

“I have also asked the Department of Internal Affairs to make preparations for a memorial service in remembrance of all the victims of the tragedy at an appropriate time,” Helen Clark said.
