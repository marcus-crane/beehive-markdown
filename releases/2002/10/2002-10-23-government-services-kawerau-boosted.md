Government services are being brought closer again to people in rural areas with the opening of Heartland Services centres across provincial New Zealand, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey opened the latest Heartland Services Centre in Kawerau today. The Centre will serve the district and is one of approximately 20 Heartland Services Centres being established in provincial locations around the country. $2.27m was provided in the Budget to establish and staff the centres over the next four years.

“Heartland Services is a new government initiative which restores face to face access to a range of government services in provincial communities. Over recent years small towns across the country have experienced a flight of government services.

“People in rural areas experience significant difficulties accessing government services because of poor telephone coverage and lack of public transport.

"Heartland Service Centre coordinators will provide the link between local people making enquiries, and government agencies. A public telephone and computer is provided at each centre and the coordinator can help with general enquiries, including accessing government websites for job searches and other information.

"Government services most in demand in the Kawerau area include the Housing New Zealand Corporation, ACC, Child, Youth and Family and the Inland Revenue Department. The centre offers a one-stop shop in a convenient location.

“Heartland Service centres make links to these agencies a whole lot easier, friendlier and better coordinated,” Steve Maharey said.
