1INTRODUCTION

·In January 2001, the State Sector Standards Board drafted a statement of the Government’s Expectations of the State sector. This statement was subsequently adopted and promulgated by the Government.

·At the same time the Government endorsed a Statement of Commitment to employees in the State sector.  
·In June 2001, the Board reported to the Government on the ethos of the State sector, and proposed that particular attention should be given to the Education and Health sectors, two major services which are of particular concern and importance to the community.

·In response, the Minister of State Services agreed that the Board should review the education sector as part of its 2002 work programme.

·The Board is charged with using its experience, relationships and publicly available material, to form its views – in this instance of the ethos and current standards of performance in the education sector.

·In producing this report the Board reviewed a considerable quantity of existing material, interviewed a number of people within the sector and consulted with the Ministry of Education, which provided a wide range of information for the Board’s use.

·The Board thanks those who contributed to its processes.

2THE NATURE OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR

·In OECD terms New Zealand is now a low productivity, low income economy.

·Quality education has been identified by the Government and others as having a vital role in developing a higher productivity, higher-income nation, and for reducing disparities and increasing wealth and wellbeing.

·The education sector’s role in relation to national values and preparing students for their future as citizens is also a key to the success and cohesion of New Zealand as a nation.

·Most New Zealanders appear to be generally satisfied with the present quality of education and it is not clear that there is a commitment to raising standards and performance to the level needed for New Zealand to significantly improve its position.

·Nor is it clear that New Zealanders generally are committed to the need for lifelong learning for themselves and their families.

·Whilst there may be broad agreement about the importance of the education sector, there is less agreement about the role and functions of the various components that make it up.  
·The governance structure in the sector is fragmented, reflecting the multiple stakeholders (citizens, principals, institutions, teachers, employers, employee organisations, Government, etc) and, in particular, the inherent tension between the community and the centre. For example, the Minister of Education is responsible to Parliament. Parent elected boards look to the Minister on one hand and their community on the other. Whilst by statute they have “complete discretion to control the management of the school”, they are constrained by their charter, by the National Education Guidelines and by the fact that only some 30% of school expenditure is under their control.

·The position has been made worse by what appears to be a serious structural vacuum, that neither politicians nor educators have successfully filled over the past decade, despite numerous and continuing reviews and reports and policy changes.

·For this report we were considering a sector that extends from early childhood, through compulsory education and on into tertiary institutions, workplace training, and adult education.

·We also included the leadership of the sector through government agencies (Ministry of Education, ERO, NZQA, Skill New Zealand, Transitional Tertiary Education Commission, etc.) and quasi-autonomous bodies (NZVCC, APNZ, STA, Teachers Council, etc.).

·Responsibility for the funding and delivery of education rests with the State, although a wide range of governance and ownership structures support that delivery.

·Where education is delivered by other than the State sector, there are still strong regulatory and contractual relationships with government and its agents.

·Since 1987 the sector has been subject to a series of structural reforms, which are continuing, with legislative changes relating to the tertiary sector and industry training currently proceeding through Parliament. It is fourteen years since Tomorrow’s Schools and nine years since the National Education Framework was promulgated. The structural changes in administration and the continuing debate about assessment have been major features of developments at the school level. The first year of the NCEA is a significant milestone. At the tertiary level the establishment of the TEA is a pivotal development.

·The range of reforms has been focused on achieving an appropriate mix amongst multiple goals that are often conflicting and difficult to manage, particularly when crucial instruments, such as standard setting and funding, are also matters of controversy.

·Particularly in the primary and secondary sectors, governance structures, which emphasise the responsibility of trustees, might lead to the mistaken assumption that they have similar responsibilities over resourcing and curriculum, which is not the case, or the intent of the present system. Nor have parents always received the support and training required to lead school communities, and it is difficult to imagine the degree of training and support in practice that would turn part time parental administrators into professional leaders of school communities.

3THE COMPETING PRESSURES

·The curriculum is increasingly specific in a range of areas. At the same time, student and parent choice is being promoted, and the school day isn't getting any longer.

·The EFTS funding regime promotes full time courses, whilst lifelong learning often requires more customised and creatively delivered education.

·Governance arrangements have been devolved, whilst the policy and purse strings remain centrally controlled.

·There is increasing competition amongst providers in some areas, such as post-graduate qualifications, and reduced access in other areas, such as trades training.

·The aim of delivering quality education is often competing with funding needs and constraints, with particular issues with international students.

·The pastoral role of institutions is more necessary, but perhaps now more difficult to deliver.

·Schools, as currently structured, do not met the needs of some students, but providing alternative educational forms requires innovation and partnerships that schools have difficulty with.

·Despite well heralded demographic and policy changes, the sector is slow in recognising the needs of Maori and too ready to accept Maori failure and underachievement.

·Where the leadership in the sector lies is not clear, with a number of diverse groups claiming leadership of various aspects of education.

·There is also uncertainty and dispute about who owns, and/or who should control, major elements of the sector, e.g. the universities.

·Student/parent choice is emphasised in generating educational demand and, under present arrangements, supply, but this may conflict with the needs of the economy and New Zealand’s wellbeing.

·Similarly, the issue of private and public gain from education remains contentious and unresolved, as does the question of whether the marginal resources should be used to provide competence for most, or excellence for those who can attain it.

·The teaching profession is ageing and many appear to be disenchanted, at a time when professional development, commitment and innovation are needed.

·Teachers feel undervalued, and although teacher training is expanding, many prospective trainees are either choosing not to enter the profession or are leaving early in their careers.

·The various components of the system do not have an agreed view of the linkages, priorities and concerns of other parts of the sector.

·There are intense pressures on the resources of schools in some localities and sectors. There are also pressures on some institutions to remain viable.

4THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT’S STATEMENT OF EXPECTATIONS AND THE EDUCATION SECTOR

·It is not evident that the education sector sees itself as being subject to the Government’s Statement of Expectations.

·There is little indication that the Statement has been promulgated or discussed within the sector.

·The fragmented nature of governance in the sector, and the variety of professions and views on ethical issues cause difficulty in this context.

·In addition, differentiation and independence from the Government is a source of pride among some parts of the sector.

·For example, the sector does not see itself bound by the duty to be non-partisan and to serve the Government of the day, that binds the Public Service.

·Much hope is being pinned on the newly established Teachers Council, which the Standards Board welcomes, but the need to promote State sector standards, as outlined in the Government’s Statement of Expectations, as well as professional standards, remains. This is a vital issue for the Government and the education sector for the future.  
5THE STANDARDS BOARD VIEW

·The Standards Board believes that the education sector offers both great promise and serious risk to the Government and New Zealand.

·Education, and the opportunities it brings, is among the greatest gifts a society can provide to its people. It develops collective and individual feelings of self worth and offers horizons for growth and continuing development. It is also the greatest tool in reducing disparities and increasing wealth and wellbeing. Access by every individual to the right learning environment for their needs should be a goal for which we consistently strive.

·New Zealand has not been good in celebrating and promoting excellence in learning. This has to change, leadership has to be shown, and a voyage has to commence. Travel to a more diverse, wealthy and confident country can occur two ways for many New Zealanders. They can fly out, or New Zealand can change. Education and educators will have a key role in determining which or the two routes young, and not so young New Zealanders take.

·There are many examples of excellence at every level, from early childhood to adult learning. But there are also too many examples of failure and lack of delivery. The opportunity to fully develop an individual's potential should not be a lottery based on locality or institution. Equally, investing the communities' resources in education should not be driven entirely by individuals’ choices.

·Currently, and despite considerable attention over recent years, the system looks broken in a number of important areas. There is no greater priority than fixing it.

·The Board believes that the principal interests identified in its first report (citizens, non-citizens, State sector employees, Parliament and the Government) are as relevant in the education sector as in the core Public Service.

·In promulgating its Statement of Expectations the Government established an expectation that all individuals and agencies in the State sector including in Education, would act in ways that reflect the following values:

1.Integrity

·act honestly  
·give free, frank and comprehensive advice  
·be non-partisan and free from bias  
·avoid and manage conflicts of interest  
·serve the public interest.

2.Responsibility

·act with personal and professional responsibility  
·have concern for the consequences of public actions.

3\. Respect

·respect people, as citizens and clients  
·respect the rule of law  
·respect the institutions of democracy  
·respect the Treaty of Waitangi.

Nothing in our work has led us to believe that these values are not equally relevant to the education sector. It may be, however, that meeting these expectations requires different or additional responses, compared to other elements of the State sector.

The Minister of Education and Ministry of Education have key roles in developing recognition of the importance of ethos and of high standards in the sector.

As with the broader State sector this means a need to develop institutions that:

·are responsive to the community  
·are performance orientated  
·are accountable  
·are a good employer  
·work within a “whole of government” commitment  
·serve the Government.

The Standards Board view is that, in terms of the education sector this, more specifically and by way of illustration, means:

Responsiveness to the community

·Having programmes that realistically reflect the needs within a city, region and New Zealand.  
·Providing pastoral care and clear guidance to students, particularly for immigrant groups, or overseas students purchasing education in New Zealand.  
·Setting standards of behaviour that reflect community expectations.  
·Establishing a culture of achievement and aspiration.  
·Challenging all students to achieve their potential.  
·Maintaining strong external community relationships.  
·Moving beyond the physical boundaries of the institution, if this improves delivery to students and stakeholders.  
·Having a “whole of government” view.

Performance Orientation

·Setting and working efficiently to achieve objectives.  
·Accepting and leading change.  
·Developing innovative responses to emerging social need.  
·Maintaining high levels of professional and organisational performance and development.  
·Identifying and developing leadership in boards and staff.  
·Measuring student outcome on both an individual and group basis.  
·Establishing pathways for continuing learning for all students.

Accountability

·Maintaining clear reporting to stakeholders, including the government and the school community.  
·Setting clear expectations for individual staff and group performance, and assessing and managing against expectations.  
·Recognising or sanctioning individual and group performance.  
·Addressing identified failures, faults and deficiencies in delivery.  
·Prioritising investment and resourcing to maintain long term effectiveness.  
·Using appropriate technologies and systems to support students, educators and reporting requirements.

Be a Good Employer by:

·Recognising merit in all areas of the employment regime.  
·Providing systems and processes for employee management, training and development.  
·Ensuring that employment opportunities reflect the gender and ethnic mix of the school community.  
·Providing a safe environment, free of inappropriate physical or professional risk.

Have a Whole of Government commitment

·Seeking partnerships and resource sharing opportunities with other institutions.  
·Contributing to Government campaigns to improve delivery to Maori and other disadvantaged groups.  
·Seeking opportunities to reinforce the innovation and learning objectives of Government.  
·Promoting strong social and civic values within the school community.

Serving the Government

·Being aware of and reflecting the Government’s priorities.  
·Implementing its decisions effectively and with commitment.  
·Participating constructively in consultations within the education sector.  
·Promoting education as a key, and positive, contributor to the economy.  
·Being politically non aligned.

6CONCLUSIONS

·The education sector has a critical role in the New Zealand community

·While there are many examples of good performance within the sector, there are serious grounds for concern about its overall position. In spite of numerous reviews, studies and policy changes, there is a substantial degree of dissatisfaction and serious concerns amongst the sector’s stakeholders and a considerable number of issues, which need to be addressed. This includes the absence of an integrating sense of common purpose – a shared set of longer term directions that can inform developments across the institutions that plan and deliver education, from early childhood to lifelong learning, and that pull together the multiple interests in what happens in education.

·It is difficult to determine where leadership in this diverse sector is located. The agencies of central government, those responsible for the governance of learning institutions, the professions, the workforce employers and citizens at large all have a role. This is a structural problem. But, without a sense of shared commitment to common purposes, well-intentioned initiatives may well fail to deliver the intended and needed benefits.

·It is of particular concern that the Government’s Statement of Expectations has not been effectively promulgated within the sector and this should be given a high priority.
