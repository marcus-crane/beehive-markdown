Nearly half the officers graduating today from the Porirua Police College are bound for the Auckland area.

Police Minister George Hawkins says 22 of the 52 officers graduating today will soon be on the beat in Auckland, including nine for Auckland City, eight for Counties Manukau and six for North Shore Waitakere.

“As well, I am advised 20 of the 58 officers graduating from the College on 14 November will go to Auckland, as will 34 of the 80 students set to graduate on 13 December,” Mr Hawkins said.

“Coupled with today’s graduates, this means Auckland police numbers should be boosted by around 76 officers before Christmas,” he said.

Wellington and Central districts would receive six officers each, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Eastern four, Canterbury three and Northland, Southern and Tasman one, following today’s graduation, Mr Hawkins said.
