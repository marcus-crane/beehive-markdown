‘Full employment is within sight ’ says Jim Anderton welcoming regional statistics from the Department of Work and Income that show that unemployment numbers have dropped in every region in New Zealand.

“Unemployment is down in every region as a result of three years of policies which work toward full employment through economic, industry and regional development initiatives,” said Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“Strong growing regions and more jobs are goals that I have advocated for the last three years have been assisted through the creation of the Ministry of Economic Development and Industry New Zealand,” said Jim Anderton.

“Unemployment is at its lowest in 14 years, at 5.1 per cent, and all the regions are in positive growth mode with most growing at over 4 per cent.

In some regions the numbers of registered unemployed have dropped by over 60 per cent in the past three years. For example in Otago the numbers have dropped by 62.5 per cent and in Nelson by 67 per cent. Marlborough like many regions is booming with a 76 per cent decline in registered unemployed.

“It is heartening to see registered unemployment is down in acute regions such as Gisborne (37 per cent), Northland (24 per cent) and the Whanganui (33 per cent).

“The next major economic challenge New Zealand faces is how to retrain the remaining 101,000 unemployed New Zealanders to meet the serious skills shortages that are now a major obstacle to even more rapid economic growth. Having a ‘shortage’ of skills is, however, a much more pleasant challenge than a desperate shortage of jobs,” says Jim Anderton.
