Government, business, trade union and community leaders remain strongly committed to achieving higher, sustainable economic growth, Prime Minister Helen Clark said following a forum at Parliament Buildings today.

Helen Clark, and the chairman of the Growth and Innovation Advisory Board, Rick Christie, said the one-day forum with the leaders of some of New Zealand’s largest businesses had been valuable and successful.

“The capacity for constructive partnerships between the public and private sectors is accelerating and building a new base from which to achieve the higher growth rates which will deliver not only a strong economy, but a strong society,” Helen Clark and Rick Christie said.

Among the key areas for action to emerge during the day’s discussions were:

·the need to make research, science and technology a top national priority  
·ensuring that this environment fosters companies that are “born global” – thinking internationally from day one, whether they export or are globally competitive in the New Zealand market  
·creating an environment in which small and medium-sized companies can more easily become large companies  
·filling the gap faced by many new companies between venture capital start-up funding and securing long term investors  
·working on a better strategic understanding of New Zealand’s infrastructure needs and the possible development of a national infrastructure strategy  
·more intense efforts to attract foreign investment in new, high value businesses, rather than buying existing assets  
·identifying key international markets for special focus through joint government/business initiatives, such as Australia, the United States, and key Asian markets, especially China  
·repositioning New Zealand internationally as not only clean and green, but also as a smart, dynamic nation that is better than anywhere at fostering international connections because it needs those connections more than anywhere else  
·to address the “tail” of educational underachievement which will otherwise hold back a significant minority of the next generation from full participation in work and society  
·intensifying collaboration between businesses, trade unions and government to upskill the existing workforce  
·changing the immigration system to ensure that the country benefits more from the skills of new arrivals  
·making a greater effort to communicate the importance of a strongly growing, innovation-led economy if New Zealanders are to continue achieving mutually desired health, education, social, environmental and lifestyle goals.

The workshops identified many other critical areas for action, ranging across issues such as adult literacy and the capacity of the Resource Management Act to support sustainable development.

“Today’s forum has given both the Growth and Innovation Advisory Board and the government a number of useful and significant areas for further work,” Helen Clark and Rick Christie said.

They welcomed the commitment by business leaders to work with ministers and government agencies to create specially focused teams to deepen New Zealand’s relationships in three key markets – Australia, the United States, and China.

Telecom chief executive Theresa Gattung and the chief executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Murdoch, will lead the Australia taskforce.

The chief executives of Fonterra and Carter Holt Harvey, Craig Norgate and Chris Liddell, will lead the China grouping, and the US relationship will be the focus of a group involving Andrew Grant, from McKinsey & Company, John Hagen from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Mr Norgate, in association with the US/NZ Business Council.

“Once again, this forum has reminded us that attitudes, culture, and leadership are as crucial to our success as a nation as any single piece of government policy or private sector initiative.

“Regular dialogue of this kind is one of the hallmarks of an active partnership approach to government,” Helen Clark and Rick Christie said.
