Education Minister Trevor Mallard has welcomed the Woolf Fisher Trust’s decision to offer four new professional development awards to primary and intermediate principals.

These awards, an extension of the annual Woolf Fisher Fellowships, will enable the recipients to jointly attend a world-class leadership course at an overseas university such as Harvard or Cambridge. They will then undertake an individual travel and study programme of their choice.

“We know that the key professional in a school is the principal. The tone and performance of a school can stand or fall on their abilities. Opportunities like this are important for education providers in improving the educational achievement of their students and furthering their own professional development,” Trevor Mallard said.

The new Fellowships are given the status of "prestigious awards" which means recipients' schools will be eligible for relief teacher costs.

The Trustees will make selections after wide and confidential consultation and the first awards will be made for travel in 2003.

“The Woolf Fisher Trust have made a generous contribution over the past 40 years to the professional development of secondary teachers and principals. This extension of the scheme enhances the Trust's commitment to furthering the vision of Mr Fisher,” Trevor Mallard said.
