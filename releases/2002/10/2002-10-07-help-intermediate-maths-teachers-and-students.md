Intermediate school students and teachers will be able to make further big strides towards better maths with the latest publications in the “Figure It Out” series, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard announced the release of a further six books in the “Figure It Out” series, all aimed at better maths teaching and learning in our intermediate schools (years seven and eight).

“A few years ago, international surveys of maths learning showed that New Zealand had to lift its game. This series is helping us improve standards across the board,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This is a key element of the Literacy and Numeracy strategy. The recent National Education Monitoring Project report showed that the numeracy project is working and that achievement in mathematics is improving.”

The series started in 1999 and the aim is to have another 20 books published by 2003.

These latest books focus on understanding and dealing with numbers.

Trevor Mallard said the feedback he was receiving showed that teachers, pupils, and parents were all impressed with the “Figure It Out” series.

The books are being delivered to schools now.
