The launch of a new dairy biotechnology company demonstrated the rural sector’s grasp of what was required in a knowledge society, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton welcomed the formation of boviQuest, a joint venture between Fonterra’s biotechnology company ViaLactia and Livestock Improvement.

“Biotechnology was one of the three key areas identified in the Government’s Growth and Innovation Strategy, and boviQuest is an exciting development in this field.

“By no means all of biotechnology research involves genetic research, and by no means all of the latter involves genetic engineering or modification.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand was a leader in the international dairy market, and this development would be an important part in maintaining that leadership.

“The dairy industry is a vitally important one for New Zealand. Dairy products account for about 20 per cent of all our export earnings. Therefore, it is crucial for all New Zealand that dairy industry participants grasp the full potential of the knowledge economy. BoviQuest is a demonstration of the dairy industry’s willingness to do so, and I congratulate all involved.”
