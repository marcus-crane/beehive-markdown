The government’s new Gateway programme that enables senior school students to start national qualifications while on work experience is expanding to 38 new schools around the country.

A recent Skill New Zealand evaluation of the first year of the programme showed it has been very successful and was highly valued by employers, students, and schools. Gateway currently caters for over 1,000 students in 24 schools, and involves over 200 employers. An additional $1.8m provided in the Budget this year will allow Gateway to be expanded to a further 38 schools.

Speaking at the Northern Employers’ and Manufacturers’ Association Developing the Skills for Growth conference in Auckland this morning, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said Gateway demonstrates what can be achieved with some fresh thinking and a collaborative approach to skills issues between Government, business educators and the community.

“Gateway allows students to incorporate workplace learning with their school-based studies. The aim is to strengthen the linkages between schools and business and pave the way for students into workplace training.

“The programme has found a high level of endorsement for Gateway from the three main participant groups – employers, students, and schools.

“This year the programme is being expanded to a further 38 schools, taking the total number of participating schools to 62.

“The government believes that expanding the learning pathways available to young people is a critical if we are to ensure that we properly prepare all New Zealanders for an increasingly knowledge-based society and workforce,” Steve Maharey said.
