Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel today called demands by Act MP Stephen Franks to deport Gay Oakes, mere mischief-making.

“Mr Franks asked me an Oral Question in Parliament on 19 September about this case. The Hansard record clearly shows that I was not prepared to discuss Gay Oakes’ case publicly without her specific permission to do so.

“However, I did refer Mr Franks and other MPs to Section 112 of the Immigration Act.

“Prior to 1987, the Immigration Act did not provide for the deportation of convicted criminals if the offence was committed beyond five years’ residence in New Zealand.

“In 1987 the then Labour government tightened the law, requiring that deportation could occur where serious offences were committed within 10 years of residence in New Zealand.

“However, as is usual, the law change was not retrospective, and therefore did not apply to anyone who gained residence or who was exempt from holding a residence permit (eg, an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident) who was already in the country before the commencement of the 1987 Act (refer Section 112 – attached).

“I have already explained this in detail to Mr Franks following his question to me in Parliament some 18 days ago. I went and sat next to Mr Franks in the House and took him through the provisions of the Act. I even gave him a photocopy of Section 112 of the Act.

“Although I cannot comment explicitly on the Oakes case, it would not take a rocket scientist to work it out given the provisions of Section 112 of the Immigration Act 1987 and I find it galling that Mr Franks is still publicity-seeking over the matter,” Lianne Dalziel said.
