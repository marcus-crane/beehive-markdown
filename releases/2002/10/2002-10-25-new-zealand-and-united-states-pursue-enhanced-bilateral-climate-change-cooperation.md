Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky and Honorable Pete Hodgson, Convenor of New Zealand’s Ministerial Group on Climate Change, met in Washington today to exchange views on climate change and agreed to enhance bilateral dialogue and practical cooperation.

The United States and New Zealand agreed that climate change was a pressing issue that requires a global solution. Under Secretary of State Dobriansky explained the policy announced by President Bush on 14 February 2002, the steps that the United States is taking to achieve its national goals for mitigating projected emissions growth in the next decade and its approach toward international cooperation on climate change issues. Honorable Pete Hodgson reiterated New Zealand’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, and noted that New Zealand expected to complete the process of ratification by the end of the year and had developed a general framework of domestic policy to meet its Kyoto commitments. They decided that dialogue and cooperation would further both countries’ efforts in pursuit of the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Under Secretary of State Dobriansky and Honorable Pete Hodgson explored possible themes for enhanced cooperation. They agreed that practical science-based cooperation, building on existing links such as the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand, would be particularly valuable. Themes for potential enhanced cooperation might include: climate change science and monitoring in the Pacific; assistance to developing countries, particularly Pacific Island states; climate change research in Antarctica; cooperation in the development of emission unit registries; greenhouse gas accounting in forestry and agriculture; and technology development aimed at carbon reduction technologies. Specific areas and means of cooperation will be further considered and refined over the coming months by a working group of officials led by the State Department on the U.S. side and by the Climate Change Project, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet on the New Zealand side.

New Zealand and the United States declared their intention to continue to work together in the spirit of cooperation and partnership under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
