Approximately $27 million is to be spent redeveloping state housing bordering Talbot Reserve in Glen Innes, Housing Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

Mr Gosche, who visited the area today, said the current housing was dated.

“The area is poorly laid out and a number of surveys conducted with residents over the years have highlighted concerns about personal safety. The rejuvenation of this area is long overdue.

“This project will result in improved housing, new through roads and better use of the park and open spaces. Redesigning the under-utilised and poorly lit reserve for both play and sporting activities will make the park safer and increase community use. Reconfiguring the roads will give residents better and safer access to their homes.

“This proposal demonstrates good urban design and will make the area a better place to live. It will also help increase community involvement.”

Mr Gosche said Housing New Zealand would appoint a community development officer responsible for increasing social networks and building local community capacity as part of the project.

“Community Renewal Projects such as this one aim to help renew the community through bringing together community groups, government agencies, residents and the local council to tackle social issues in the area.”

The overall cost of the project is expected to be approximately $27 million, depending on the final plans following public consultation and feedback.

Over the next three years, houses on Apirana Avenue, Pilkington and Pt England Rds, Flanders St and Talbot Place will be replaced with new homes and nine existing Star Flat apartment blocks will be significantly refurbished.

The redevelopment will increase the number of state-owned properties in the Talbot Reserve area by 38 to a total of 205 to help meet current demand for social housing in Glen Innes.

Work on the Star Flat apartments is due to begin next March, with the other work to follow local authority approvals. Tenants today received information packs on the proposed changes.

Mr Gosche said that the intention was to build a mixture of housing types and sizes around Talbot Reserve, to meet the demand for larger family homes as well as one and two bedroom properties.

“We will also rearrange the layout of properties to maximise the building’s exposure to the sun’s light and warmth. This north-facing orientation was overlooked when these properties were built in the 40s and 50s.”

Housing New Zealand Corporation is requesting that Auckland City Council initiate a public plan change to enable the overall proposal to go ahead. This would provide tenants and local residents with the opportunity to make submissions on the proposal.

Talbot Park is the fourth Housing New Zealand Community Renewal project to be launched, following projects in Christchurch, Rotorua and Clendon in South Auckland.
