Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson says he is satisfied that allegations of corruption and/or wrongdoing against two senior Ministry of Fisheries officials are baseless.

The allegations were first raised publicly in Parliament by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. The material behind them has been reviewed by the Serious Fraud Office, which decided it did not merit investigation. An independent barrister engaged by the Solicitor-General on behalf of Ministry chief executive Warwick Tuck to examine the same material has now reported to Mr Tuck, who has concluded as a result that the allegations are baseless and support no further action.

"I am satisfied that these allegations have been thoroughly examined and justifiably dismissed," Mr Hodgson said. "I regret that committed public servants have been subjected to such baseless claims. They and the Ministry of Fisheries as a whole continue to have my confidence."
