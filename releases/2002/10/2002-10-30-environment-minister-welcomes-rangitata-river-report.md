Environment Minister Marian Hobbs has welcomed the release of the Special Tribunal’s report on the Rangitata Water Conservation Order application.

"I applaud the work of the Tribunal and thank the members for their efforts. The Tribunal has produced a very rigorous and comprehensive report," Marian Hobbs said.

The application for the Rangitata water conservation order was lodged towards the end of 1999. The tribunal received more than 1100 written submissions and held hearings during October – December 2001.

Submitters to the Special Tribunal now have 15 days to lodge any submissions about the report with the Environment Court. Following this, the Minister will decide whether or not to recommend making the order.

Marian Hobbs said she would examine this report in detail and assess its implications before responding formally.
