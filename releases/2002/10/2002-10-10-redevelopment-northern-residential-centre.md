Redevelopment of the Northern Residential Centre for only children and young people in need of care and protection moved a step closer today with the lodgement by the Minister of Social Services and Employment of the notice of requirement for a new designation on the site.

Lodging the notice marks the start of the formal process in accordance with the Resource Management Act. The Manukau City Council will now review the information provided in the notice and if satisfied with its completeness, publicly call for submissions on the proposed redevelopment.

Steve Maharey said the Northern Residential Centre currently caters for both care and protection and youth justice activities.

“The redevelopment of the Northern Residential Centre is part of the government’s comprehensive $75 million Residential Services Strategy to create nine purpose-built residential facilities throughout New Zealand for children and young people in care, custody or the guardianship of Child, Youth and Family.

“The new designation we are seeking will restrict the use of the redeveloped Northern Residential Centre for only children and young people placed with the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services under the care and protection provisions of the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act.

“The youth justice children and young people currently catered for at the Northern residential Centre will be relocated to the new Youth Justice Residential Centre being established on Roscommon Road near the Visy Board factory. Builders are now on site and construction of the new Youth Justice Residential Centre is underway.

“The builders have a very tight programme to meet, to complete the new Youth Justice Residential Centre by July next year, but I am committed to removing the youth justice activities from the Northern Residential Centre and redeveloping it for only care and protection as quickly as possible”, says Steve Maharey.
