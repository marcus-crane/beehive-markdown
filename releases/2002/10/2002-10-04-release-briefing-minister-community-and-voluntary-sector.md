The government will continue to develop a more effective relationship with volunteers, and the communities they support, over the next three years, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia said today.

The Minister has released the post-election briefing prepared by the Department of Internal Affairs on the Vote: Community and Voluntary Sector. The portfolio was established by the Labour-led government in 1999.

“The Brief notes that having a Minister to champion the community ensures there is leadership and accountability across the government's community strategies and initiatives,” said Tariana Turia. “This portfolio ties in well with my other social development responsibilities.”

Key themes noted for the Community and Voluntary Sector Portfolio over the next three years include:  
·improving the ability of government to respond to communities;  
·amalgamating key government funding and programmes;  
·supporting Maori self-determined development;  
·supporting Pacific peoples to achieve economic development;  
·ensuring effectiveness for ethnic communities; and  
·evaluating community outcomes.

"The government's focus on these issues will benefit everyone, including Maori, Pacific people and all communities," Tariana Turia said.

More than a million New Zealanders undertake some form of voluntary work in the community. Over $1.3 billion of taxpayer and other funds are invested annually in the services provided by community sector organisations. There are approximately 23,000 incorporated societies and 10,000 charitable trusts operating in New Zealand.
