Dr Ross Armstrong's resignation from the chairs of Television New Zealand and Industrial Research Ltd is unfortunate but appropriate, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Crown Research Institutes Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

"Dr Armstrong accepts that his positions on the boards of TVNZ and IRL are no longer tenable and that the only honourable course of action is to resign," the ministers said. "Dr Armstrong recognises that he has made a serious mistake, but we understand it was an honest mistake that does not call his integrity into question. We accept his resignations with regret and freely acknowledge the significant contributions he has made to the governance of both TVNZ and IRL."

Dr Armstrong will not be eligible for any form of severance payment as a result of his resignations.
