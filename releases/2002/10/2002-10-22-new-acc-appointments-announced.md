ACC Minister Ruth Dyson has announced three new government appointments to the Accident Compensation Corporation Board.

They are Gregory Fortuin, Brenda Tahi and Eion Edgar.

Gregory Fortuin, the previous Race Relations Conciliator and former AXA Corporate Superannuation Services (NMCSS Ltd) New Zealand managing director, began a three-year term on the ACC board on 18 October 2002.

Brenda Tahi (Te Whanau a Ruataupare, Ngati Porou) is the director of her own strategic management consultancy, and Eion Edgar is chairman of retail sharebroker and investment banker, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd. Both will take up their appointments on 1 November 2002. Ms Tahi’s term runs until 1 April 2005, and Mr Edgar’s till 1 June 2005.

Ms Dyson said the three board members would bring significant experience and a fresh approach to governance of the ACC scheme that had been invigorated through a new focus on injury prevention, rehabilitation and compensation.

“Before he served as Race Relations Conciliator, Mr Fortuin had extensive senior management experience in the New Zealand and Australian superannuation and life insurance industry. His involvement in community activities is ongoing.

“Ms Tahi has had several senior roles in public sector strategic management and policy development, and combines her private sector consultancy work with an interest in her iwi’s treaty claims and other community activities.

“Mr Edgar is also Chancellor of the University of Otago. He has extensive experience in advising on equities and corporate matters, and his community interests include serving as the President of New Zealand Soccer.”

Ms Dyson thanked retiring ACC Board members George Hickton, June McCabe and Trevor Janes for their contributions.
