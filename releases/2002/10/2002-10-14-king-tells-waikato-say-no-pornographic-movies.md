Health Minister Annette King says the Government intends to direct Waikato District Health Board not to allow video footage to be shot for commercial pornographic purposes.

Ms King said today she also intends to direct all other District Health Boards that the only video footage of births to be allowed are videos shot for genuine family or hospital purposes.

The Minister asked for an urgent legal opinion from the Ministry of Health this morning, after the High Court ruled last week that a woman, known as Nikki, could be filmed giving birth provided the baby was not shown.

Ms King said she had now received a preliminary legal opinion that though Nikki had a right to birthing services like all eligible women in New Zealand, and women had generally been allowed videoed births for their own genuine family or personal purposes, Nikki’s case was different to the norm.

“It seems there is a clear non-personal aspect to the videoing, involving use of footage for a commercial pornographic film.”

“I will not receive formal legal advice until tomorrow, but I am satisfied that sufficient justification exists for me to direct the Waikato Board to say no to pornographic filming in public facilities, and only allow filming where videos are shot for genuine family or hospital purposes.”
