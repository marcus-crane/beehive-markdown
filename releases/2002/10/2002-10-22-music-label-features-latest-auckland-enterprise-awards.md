Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says more than a third of the successful applicants in the latest round of Enterprise Awards are businesses and entrepreneurs in the Auckland region, including the electronic music label Kog Transmissions.

Nineteen of the 53 Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards have gone to Auckland region applicants.

“Aucklanders are continuing to come up with innovative ideas, new businesses, and new opportunities for expanding those businesses,” says Judith Tizard.

“The Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy, released last week, sets out how government agencies, business and local government can help Auckland regional businesses develop overseas markets, grow exports and attract investment. The Enterprise Awards scheme is one of the tools that will help these businesses to grow.”

As Acting Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, Judith Tizard says she is pleased that Kingsland record label Kog Transmissions received the maximum $20,000 for prototype development & market investigation.

“An Industry New Zealand report on the growth of the creative sector shows the sector is growing faster than the rest of the economy. Kog Transmissions, which releases high-profile artists such as P-Money and Concord Dawn, is a prime example of creative industry growth.

“In its five years of business, Kog Transmissions has released 34 albums, opened offices in Melbourne and London, and achieved chart success in the UK. I hope this Enterprise Award will help Kog expand its business even further.”

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.
