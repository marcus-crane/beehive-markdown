Two Police inspectors are on their way to Bali to assist Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff on the island.

Police Minister George Hawkins said the Inspectors will help MFAT staff currently working at the site of Saturday’s bomb blast at Kuta Beach, as well as assess how New Zealand police could further assist.

The inspectors are currently based in Sydney and Bangkok, where they fill police liaison roles.

“New Zealand’s Commissioner of Police, Rob Robinson and Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty, are in constant contact on ways New Zealand can help,” Mr Hawkins said.

Foreign Minister Phil Goff said this builds on other assistance the Government is providing to help deal with the attack.

“The Government will cover the cost of repatriation of the badly wounded and deceased New Zealanders where insurance is not provided due to terrorism exclusion clauses.

“Later today a package of medical supplies will be sent to Bali. The supplies will include advanced pain relief, intravenous fluids and surgical dressings. Further medical assistance will be provided as required.

“A RNZAF Hercules C-130 will also be operating out of Darwin assisting the Australian operation.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs now has four staff in Bali and they continue to work through ascertaining the whereabouts and status of New Zealanders,” said Mr Goff.
