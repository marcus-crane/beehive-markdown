New Zealand's to provide an initial package of medical assistance to authorities in Bali, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Marian Hobbs, announced this evening.

"We have all been shocked by the tragic events of last Sunday," Marian Hobbs said. "The Balinese medical system has had to cope with a huge number of casualties, both foreigners and Indonesian. We recognise that even after the evacuations of the last few days a large number of burns victims remain in Bali and will require intensive and ongoing treatment."

The package will include essential medical supplies such as advanced pain relief, intravenous fluids and surgical dressings. Assistance will also be provided to support the work of the Indonesian Red Cross.

Further assistance will be provided following a fuller assessment of requirements on the ground.

This assistance comes on top of the earlier dispatch to Australia of an RNZAF Hercules with a medical team on board.
