Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard today announced of the release of a discussion paper prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development on the regulation of the patent attorney profession.

The discussion paper “Review of the Regulatory Regime for the Patent Attorney Profession in New Zealand” looks at the role of a patent attorney in New Zealand’s innovation framework and how the profession is currently regulated in New Zealand. The paper discusses a range of issues surrounding the profession and possible options for reform of profession to overcome those issues and seeks comment from interested parties.

The patent attorney profession is a relatively small profession, regulated under the Patents Act 1953. This review of the profession forms part of government’s current overhaul of the Patents Act.

“The patent attorney profession is one of the important links in our innovation framework,” says Judith Tizard. “Patent attorneys provide advice on the obtaining, protection and exploitation of patents, trade marks and designs, and deal with other aspects of intellectual property law such as copyright, trade secrets and plant variety rights.

“It is essential for the profession to be able to operate in a manner that best enables entrepreneurs and innovators to receive the fullest value for their innovations.”

The release of the discussion paper represents the first step in public consultations concerning the regulation of the profession that have been undertaken with stakeholders in nearly 50 years.

“I would welcome submissions from the profession, inventors, researchers, entrepreneurs, other users of patent attorney services and members of the public on matters discussed in the paper,” said Judith Tizard.

Submissions will be considered in the development of policy recommendations to the government on possible legislative reform.

The closing date for submissions on the discussion paper is Monday, 16 December 2002.

Submissions on the respective discussion paper should be sent to:
