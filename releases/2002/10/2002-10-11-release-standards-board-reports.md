State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today released four further reports from the State Sector Standards Board.  
Established in November 2000, the State Sector Standards Board is an advisory board to the Minister of State Services.  
The reports released include The Ethos of the State Sector Report as at June 2002, as well as specific reports on Education, Parliament and the State Sector and the Official Information Act 1982, Privacy Act 1993, Protected Disclosures Act 2000 and Associated Matters.  
The annual Ethos report outlines the Board’s view of the current state of State sector organisations.

Trevor Mallard said the Board’s report acknowledges the “very substantial improvement in many aspects of the State sector” over the past 15 years and the generally high standards of behaviour.

Work is already underway at the State Services Commission and elsewhere to address many of the issues the Board has raised in these and previous reports, the Minister said.

Trevor Mallard asked the Ministry of Education to consider and report on the Board’s specific recommendations in the area of education. A copy of that report is attached.

“As the State Sector Standards Board report notes, this is a difficult area to cover, despite many examples of “good performance” in the sector,” he said.

The reports are available on the State Services Commission website www.ssc.govt.nz

State Sector Standards Board members are: Kerry McDonald (Chairman), Angela Foulkes, John Martin (resigned June 2002), Rangimarie Parata Takurua, Elmar Toime and Jim Turner.
