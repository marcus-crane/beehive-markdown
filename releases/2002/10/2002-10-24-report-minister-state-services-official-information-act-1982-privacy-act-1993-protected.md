THE STATE SECTOR ETHOS - OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1982, PRIVACY ACT 1993, PROTECTED DISCLOSURES ACT 2000 AND ASSOCIATED MATTERS

‘Access to information about government . . . is a prerequisite to effective democracy and participation in it’ (Law Commission, 1997, p. 1)

1.INTRODUCTION

·The second report of the Standards Board foreshadowed further work on the implications for the ethos of the State sector of experience with the Official Information Act 1982 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2000. The Minister agreed to this.

·There is a range of issues around confidentiality, privacy, disclosure and 'open government' that have an important influence on the ethos of the State sector. They are of concern to State sector employees, organisations and citizens. Recent cases pointing up the salience of these issues include: the sale of personal information by IRD and WINZ (SSC, 1999); the unauthorised use of confidential information by a CCMAU employee (the Oughton Report, 2001); and concern about 'leaking' of information by the Defence Force.

·There is also a generalised concern among the public about the insecurity of information held by both public and private organisations (see the UMR survey conducted in September 20012 and the series of articles run by the Herald in May 2001).

·The increasing movement to electronic storage and transmission of information highlights these concerns. Aside from these specific instances, there is an inherent tension between the objectives of availability of information, on the one hand, and, on the other, protection of the privacy of citizens and the other interests recognised in the statutes.

·In this report the Board draws attention to a number of issues of current interest and highlights the importance of State servants being well-informed about, and assiduous in their administration of, legislation that is at the centre of the relationship between the ‘governors and the governed’.3

2.BACKGROUND

·In 1980 the report of the Danks Committee, Towards Open Government was published. The subsequent enactment of the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) reversed the presumption that had previously guided the State sector's approach to information (buttressed by the Official Secrets Act 1951). From the coming into force of the OIA access to official information was governed by the ‘Principle of availability (S5), viz., ‘that the information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it’. This fundamental change was designed to ’increase progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand’ in order to promote accountability and enhance participation’.

·The result is a system of government marked by quite remarkable openness. While there have been other relevant major changes in public management since 1982 (such as the deregulation of the economy and, of course, the public sector reforms of the late '80s), the OIA has unquestionably had a major influence on the way the New Zealand Government does business.

·In 1993 the passage of the Privacy Act complemented the OIA (in the State sector) by putting in place procedures assuring citizens of rights of access in respect of information held about them and providing remedies for unwarranted disclosure of information by public officials which adversely affect individuals. Subsequently, the Protected Disclosures Act 2000 (which came into force on 1 January 2001) recognised that there may be occasions when employees, in accordance with prescribed procedures, may be justified in ‘blowing the whistle’ on ‘serious wrongdoing’ in or by their organisations and fellow employees.

·The Privacy Act and the Protected Disclosures Act (unlike the OIA) apply to both the public and private sectors (although with differing procedural provisions). So far as the State sector is concerned, these three statutes constitute as the Controller and Auditor-General described it to us: “an overarching framework of policy on information and disclosure and protection”. (Indeed, one source of difficulty for State servants can be confusion about the applicability of the OIA or the Privacy Act in particular circumstances if the relationship is not clearly understood.)

·In addition to the legislation and the guidance4 provided by the Ombudsmen and the Privacy Commissioner, the State Services Commissioner's Code of Conduct (revised 2001) — and no doubt individual agencies' codes — is relevant to these issues as are the Public Service Principles, Practices and Conventions (1995). The SSC has also issued the Policy Framework for Government Held Information (1997) that is built around the principle that:

Government departments should make information available easily, widely and equitably to the people of New Zealand (except where reasons preclude such availability as specified in legislation).

·The right of access to information is not unqualified. The OIA identifies a number of reasons for withholding information, broadly to facilitate the governmental process and to protect individual privacy. But before withholding information for any of these reasons, the question must be asked: are there are any other public interest considerations which outweigh the need to withhold? It is also necessary to record that the handling of requests for information is not costless. Resources, particularly of staff time, must be allocated to this aspect of agency management. This point needs to be borne in mind by those who direct substantial and frequent requests to State sector organisations.

3.EARLIER REPORTS

·In 1997 the Law Commission published Review of the Official Information Act 1982 (Report 40) in response to a reference from the then Minister of Justice in 1992. In 1998, the Privacy Commissioner, in accordance with s.26 of the PA, submitted a major report Necessary and Desirable: Privacy Act 1993 Review.5

·We are informed that there has been no formal response to either of these reports by successive governments. Without expressing a view on the specific proposals made in these reports we would suggest that the issues raised are of sufficient significance to warrant consideration by Ministers in the light of developments since their submission.

4.ISSUES

(a)The OIA

·Three distinctive characteristics of the OIA are worthy of note:

(a) unlike other countries, classes of information (e.g. Cabinet papers) are not automatically protected; each case is to be treated on its merits in accordance with the criteria in the statute.

(b) the Ombudsmen's decisions on the release of information (since 1987) impose a public duty on Ministers (and other authorities) unless overruled by Order-in Council. (There has been no case.)

(c)the OIA applies to a very wide range of public authorities including State enterprises (SOEs)— this last was strongly opposed by SOEs in 1986 and again in 1990 when, after a statutory review, Parliament was firm in continuing this regime. The legislature, despite some opposition, has also applied the OIA to health and educational organisations.

·The Law Commission in its 1997 report was “satisfied that, in general, the Act works relatively effectively to further its stated purposes. Since 1982 there has been a substantial increase in the availability of official information. Public participation in the making of laws and policies, and the accountability of Ministers and officials, has been enhanced.” The Commission, nonetheless, identified a number of problems:

-the burden caused by large and broadly defined requests — described by the Ombudsmen as ‘empty your pockets’ requests6;  
\-tardiness in responding to requests;  
\-resistance by agencies outside the core State sector; and  
\-the absence of a coordinated approach to supervision, compliance, policy advice and education regarding the Act and other information issues.

·The Commission spoke of “friction between those requesters who complain that official information is disclosed reluctantly, belatedly, or not at all, and the holders of information concerned about the time and cost incurred in dealing with requests”. Our inquiries suggest that while officials genuinely seek to comply with the principles of the Act, there are still problems about disclosure, including:

-failure to reply until the limit of the 20 day ‘grace’ period; S15(1) of the OIA requires organisations to respond “as soon as reasonably practicable”, and in case not later than 20 working days after the day on which the request is received;

-failure to record advice in writing, thus hindering requests to obtain information;  
\-the “yellow-sticky” problem, whereby comments are occasionally written on sticky notes that can be removed if a request or disclosure is made;  
\-inappropriate directions from Ministers for all requests under the OIA to be referred to the Minister’s office (S 14 of the OIA establishes circumstances whereby requests may be transferred but does not provide for a blanket direction); and  
\-the temptation to “write for the record”, for example, to ensure that the agency “line” is discoverable even though it might be at odds with the policy of the government.7

·We are in no position to know how widespread these problems are. Essentially, they point to the desirability of State servants acting in accordance with the spirit of the law as much as its provisions. Often, we suspect, problems stem from a lack of familiarity with the Act rather than an intention to obstruct (see Conclusion).

·A difference between the Privacy Act and the OIA is that the former provides for penalties for non-compliance but the OIA does not. Professor Matthew Palmer, Dean of Law at Victoria University of Wellington has recently proposed that if Ministers or officials breach their obligations under the OIA penalties should be ‘increased and made politically and bureaucratically real’.8 Views expressed to us were divided on this suggestion. It warrants further consideration.

(b)The Privacy Act 1993 (PA)

·The Privacy Act is an Act “to promote and protect individual privacy” and establishes 12 principles (s6) to govern the collection, use and disclosure, by public and private sector agencies, of information relating to individuals; and access by each individual to such information relating to that person. The Privacy Commissioner is enabled to issue codes of practice, after due consultation, and has so far issued four such codes, including the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 and the Justice Sector Unique Identifier Code 1998.

·When exercising his functions under the Act the Privacy Commissioner is required to have regard to ‘the protection of the human rights and social interests that compete with privacy. This includes the general desirability of a free flow of information and the recognition of the right of government and business to achieve their objectives in an efficient way’.9

·Of the complaints received by the Commissioner about access to personal information over the past four years rather more than 50 per cent have concerned the public sector. Complaints about unauthorised disclosure, on the other hand, lie largely against private sector organisations. Overall, government agencies including the Police, Work and Income, and the ACC— not surprisingly, given the nature of the information that they hold and gather — make up the organisational grouping with the largest number of complaints against them. The health sector is the next largest grouping. The Commissioner in his recent reports has drawn attention to ‘less than satisfactory dealings’ with one agency. It is our impression, generally speaking, that any problems in the administration of the Act in the State sector result from the failings of institutional memory that result from frequent staff changes and the absence of an agency-wide information policy (points to which we return).

·An issue of increasing significance is the trend to information (or data) matching. This usually involves “the computerised comparison of two or more sets of records with the objective of seeking out any records which relate to the same individual in order to detect cases of interest”.10 Examples include Work and Income/IRD, Work and Income/Courts, IRD/Ministry of Education and Customs/Work and Income.

·There are clearly gains in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in the capacity of State sector organizations to match data. This is a practical manifestation of the ‘whole-of-government’ approach supported by the Board in previous reports. There are, however, legitimate concerns about the perceived threat to privacy such procedures may constitute. The Privacy Act authorises and regulates the practice of information matching and the Commissioner reports extensively to Parliament on the authorisation, operation and evaluation of programmes. While there are reported example of inaccuracies in the matching data bases and unauthorised matches, the Commissioner in his 2001 Report was able to conclude that the programmes had generally been conducted in accordance with the requirements of SS. 99 to 103 of the Privacy Act and the information matching rules (which have recently been reviewed).

·Widespread concern has been expressed about privacy issues associated with highly publicised incidents involving people with serious mental illness. Much criticism has been directed towards the Privacy Act — broadly speaking there has been a perception that the Act has been inhibiting the provision of information to family, friends and other mental health agencies that came into contact with a patients. In February 2002 the Mental Health Commission released a report11calling for a nation-wide information policy protocol in the mental health sector. The Minister of Health has directed that such a protocol be in place by 30 June 2002. There seems now to be greater readiness to acknowledge that problems stem not from the Privacy Act itself— that has on occasion has clearly been a convenient shelter for refusal to provide information — but from confusion about the Act and the Health Information Code.

·In summary, it is the Board’s view that the Privacy Act (and its administration) contributes to the ethos of the State sector and supports the emphasis on ‘open government’ by:

-encouraging respect for the citizen;  
\-building public confidence and trust (for example, through supervision of data matching); and  
\-ensuring that State sector agencies are accountable to citizens for the way in which they collect and manage information about individuals.

(c)The Protected Disclosures Act 2000

·This Act, in force only since 1 January 2000, aims to facilitate the disclosure and investigation of “serious wrongdoing” in or by an organisation, by protecting employees who make such disclosures in accordance with the Act. The Act followed a lengthy period of consideration after the Pugmire case of 1993 and a committee of inquiry. It is not a “whistleblower's charter”; there are limitations on both the substance of “serious wrongdoing” and the freedom given to those who feel disclosure of wrongdoing is justified. Essentially “disclosure” under the Act is expected to be a last resort. Hence the importance of “public sector organisations” having “in operation appropriate internal procedures for receiving and dealing with information about serious wrongdoing in or by that organisation” (S5).

·There has been little reported resort to the Act over the last year (the Ombudsmen have received less than 20 inquiries and the Controller and Auditor-General has received two disclosures). This does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Act was unnecessary. The very existence of procedures that allow employees to depart from the usual rule of confidentiality (as laid out in the Public Service Code of Conduct (revised 2001) under prescribed conditions can be expected over time to reinforce the integrity of the State sector.

·The Minister of State Services is required to review the operation of the Act “not sooner than 2 years after the commencement of this Act”. Quite separately, we understand that the Audit Office as part of routine annual auditing activity will be checking that State sector organisations have appropriate internal procedures in place as required by S11 of the Protected Disclosures Act. We are aware of the guidelines promulgated by some organisations, e.g. the Circular of 27 November 2000 issued by the Ministry of Education to boards of trustees.

5.CONCLUSION

·Transparency in the State sector, as a principle of good governance, is increasingly being adopted world-wide.12 New Zealand is fortunate in having a statutory framework (in the Official Information Act and Privacy Act) that is solidly in place and supported by external institutions in the Ombudsmen and Privacy Commissioner. The Protected Disclosures Act is a welcome buttressing to that framework that should be regarded as an integrated structure. The essential underpinning is the statutory balance between citizens’ rights of access to official information and the protection of the government’s capacity to govern and the legitimate privacy of individuals.

·Although we have noted above the proposals for legislative change made some time ago by the Law Commission (in respect of the Official Information Act) and the Privacy Commissioner — and we believe that these reports should be revisited in the light of experience over the past few years — we consider that in the short term the solution to any problems is to be found in administration rather than changes in the law.

·A frequent call from those whom we have consulted was that there is a pronounced need for responsibility to be vested in one Public Service department for centralised guidance and especially education and training in the implementation of the OIA and PA. The Ministry of Justice has been suggested13. Our preference is for the State Services Commission. The duty of administering the legislation on a day to day basis rests squarely with individual organisations. Nonetheless, there is a place for locating centrally an overall responsibility for guidance about — some would say ‘championing’ — the legislation; and ensuring that there is adequate education and training. Such a responsibility would not be inconsistent with the role currently envisaged for the SSC in terms of ‘the centre’.

·In the same vein, we have been told that, especially in large organisations with significant staff turnover, interpretations of the State sector’s obligations under the Official Information Act and Privacy Act show an inconsistency that can only be remedied by well developed information policies accompanied by a commitment at the top of agencies to the spirit as well as the letter of the statutes.
