Education Minister Trevor Mallard is calling for feedback on the proposed  
export education levy that will be used to strengthen, develop and promote  
the expanding billion-dollar export education industry in New Zealand.

Trevor Mallard today released the Ministry of Education consultation  
document, entitled "Developing Export Education - the Export Industry  
Development Fund and Levy". It looks at options for an export education levy  
which will establish a ring-fenced industry development fund, worth $3.9  
million annually.

"The proposed levy is one of a raft of measures being put in place to help  
open up markets and opportunities for what has become an important, exciting  
and rapidly growing billion-dollar industry in New Zealand," Trevor Mallard  
said.

"These initiatives will also ensure students receive world class service, and  
help guard against the risk of a few bad incidents spoiling the image of the  
whole industry."

The export industry development fund would pay for a proposed work  
programme encompassing promotional activities in key markets, professional  
development, research and quality assurance in both pastoral care of  
students and academic qualifications.

The discussion document seeks feedback on the following:

\- proposal to set the levy at an initial level of 0.5 percent of the gross  
tuition fee income received from foreign fee paying students. This equals $5  
per $1000 of tuition fee.  
\- proposed work programme that the levy will fund  
\- how to allocate funding  
\- development of an industry-wide body

"I encourage people interested in the export education industry to engage  
constructively with the proposals. By working together and sharing ideas,  
experience and viewpoints, we can ensure continued sustainable growth for  
this important knowledge industry," Trevor Mallard said.
