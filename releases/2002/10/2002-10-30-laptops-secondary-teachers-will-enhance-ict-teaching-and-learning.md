Secondary teachers will soon have access to laptop computers for around $7 a week under a leasing scheme to improve learning outcomes, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“The Government has committed $6.5 million per year to this scheme, enabling around 9,000 secondary teachers to have the opportunity to benefit from it,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Evidence shows that learning opportunities for students are improved in schools that use Information and Communications Technology (ICT) effectively.

“The Government is committed to increasing the use of ICT in schools to help improve student achievement and teaching practice.

“The objective of this scheme is to encourage teachers to develop greater confidence and competence in the use of ICT for teaching and learning, class management and administration.”

Trevor Mallard said successful New Zealand experience through the Te Hiringa i te Mahara programme for Maori secondary teachers, has shown that access to laptops can provide the opportunity and stimulus needed to motivate teachers to become effective users of ICT.

“This scheme offers secondary teachers access to quality laptops for a very small cost – around $7 per week. This amount is about one third of the actual leasing cost.”

The laptops will be leased for teachers through their schools. Schools have indicated that many teachers would be keen to take up the opportunity of low-cost access to laptops, Trevor Mallard said.

“Secondary teachers do not often have computers readily available for their use, so the opportunity to have their own laptop is very appealing. It will help teachers to improve the quality of their teaching as well as helping them deal with their administrative responsibilities.”

Teachers will have a choice of an Apple, Compaq/hp or Toshiba laptop. Trevor Mallard thanked all the companies involved in providing the laptops.

“They have shown a real commitment to the education sector and that is appreciated.”

A trial of the implementation process begins this week in ten schools around the country. All schools will receive full information about the scheme next month, with the first laptops to be delivered to schools early in Term 1 next year.

Funding for the scheme was provided in this year’s Budget.
