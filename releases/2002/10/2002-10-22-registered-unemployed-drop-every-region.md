New regional statistics from the Ministry of Social Development show that unemployment numbers have dropped in every region in New Zealand, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

“In some regions the numbers of registered unemployed have dropped by over 60% in the past three years. For example in Marlborough the numbers have dropped by 76% and in Otago by 62.5%,” says Steve Maharey.

These figures are released on the same day that Steve Maharey launched the 2002/2003 regional plans for each of the Ministry’s 13 regions.

Regionalisation of the Work and Income service of the Ministry of Social Developement was introduced by the government in 2000 to marry its employment expertise with the different skill needs of each region.

“Unemployment is at its lowest in 14 years, at 5.1 per cent. Despite this, young people and long-term unemployed are groups that remain the most difficult job seekers to place in work. In the coming year Work and Income Regional Commissioners intend giving particular focus to supporting these beneficiaries to get into paid employment.

"Around the country regionalisation of the Ministry has seen some innovative local employment initiatives. Examples include:  
·an Auckland initiative to prepare long-term unemployed Pacific job seekers for entry into the NZ Police. To date all participants have passed the pre-entry exams;  
·the Jack Links Manukau Factory in Auckland. The Ministry sourced 400 workers who were then trained by Industry New Zealand to work in a factory;  
·a Northland training programme for the hospitality industry, now supplying trained staff to local hotels and restaurants.

"Getting more people into real paying jobs is the Ministry’s biggest challenge. These plans give us the confidence that it is fully focused on this issue which is a key priority for the government," Steve Maharey said.
