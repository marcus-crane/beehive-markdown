Minister for Auckland Issues Judith Tizard has welcomed the launch of the Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy as the next step in realising Auckland’s economic potential for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

Judith Tizard attended the launch of AREDS tonight at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, where Prime Minister Helen Clark handed the strategy to the Establishment Group charged with overseeing its implementation.

“The Auckland region has the greatest capacity to increase New Zealand’s GDP earnings,” said Judith Tizard. “This strategy sets out how government agencies, business and local government can help Auckland regional businesses develop overseas markets, grow exports and attract investment.

“Three years ago Prime Minister Helen Clark and I attended the launch of the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy, Land Transport Strategy, and Passenger Transport Action Plan.

“That was the first time in 25 years that the Auckland region developed forward-looking strategies that provided a vision for the future and a commitment to work in partnership with each other, with Auckland’s communities and with the government to ensure the region gets its fair share of infrastructure and development money.

“AREDS is the next major step. The strategy sets out a clear plan for getting Auckland onto the global stage as a great place to live and work. Its implementation is crucial and the momentum is clear in the Auckland region.

“It must be done with maximum community consultation and co-ordination across the region between local government, business, Maori, and government agencies.

“This strategy contains a message for central government departments and agencies: that a whole-of-government approach is essential for the Auckland region to achieve its economic potential.

“As Minister for Auckland Issues I will continue to work across government to ensure the Auckland region has all the assistance it needs to implement the strategy.”
