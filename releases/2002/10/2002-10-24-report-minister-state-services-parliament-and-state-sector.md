PARLIAMENT AND THE STATE SECTOR

1.INTRODUCTION

·“Respect for the institutions of democracy” is among the values included in the Statement of Expectations of the State Sector adopted by the Government in March 2001 – Parliament is at the centre of those institutions. The relationship between the legislature and the executive is crucial to the functioning of our system of government. The place of the state services (defined to include Crown entities, SOEs and the health and education services) in that relationship, it sometimes seems, is not as well understood as it might be — on either side of the fence or among citizens.

·Parliament has been the subject of much criticism in recent years, mostly focused on behaviour in the House. This report is, however, concerned only with matters that directly concern behaviour of State servants.

·Among the legislature's fundamental roles is the provision of supply — the funding that enables the executive government to function — and the scrutiny of the executive: Her Majesty's Mnisters and the agencies for which they are responsible (in differing degrees). Officials have an important part to play both in supporting their Ministers and in dealing directly with the Parliament. The principal procedures through which officials play their parts are:

-Parliamentary Questions (PQs)  
\-Consideration of Bills  
\-Estimates and financial review (Public Finance Act 1989)  
\-Select committee inquiries.

·This report focuses on the three latter procedures — essentially the participation of officials in the work of Select Committees. There are no particular issues relating to PQs that warrant comment; there is no evidence that officials do other than regard as axiomatic the importance of enabling their ministers to answer PQs in accordance with Parliament's rules. On the other hand, a number of cases involving officials' dealings with Select Committees have attracted public attention in the last few years.

·There is no suggestion that this is a major issue of New Zealand governance. Given the Board’s mandate to report on the ethos of the State sector it does, however, seem to be timely to review the nature of the relationship between officials and Select Committees in terms of the behaviour that may legitimately be expected.

2.THE NATURE OF SELECT COMMITTEES

·Select Committees are a distinctive element of New Zealand's parliamentary system. They play a larger role than in other jurisdictions, especially in the “interchange between parliamentarian and public” (McGee, 1994, p. 207). Under MMP the composition of Select Committees has markedly changed: they represent the larger number of parties in the House; they no longer necessarily have a Government majority.

·The way in which committees operate has unquestionably been changed by the necessity of the Government to work to ensure a parliamentary majority (and it does not always succeed); and the accompanying tendency of committees to follow their own path that may not always be the Government's. The associated turbulence does not leave officials unaffected.

3.THE ROLE OF OFFICIALS BEFORE SELECT COMMITTEES

·Public servants appear before Select Committees in two capacities:

-as witnesses in relation to the annual consideration of departmental estimates and reviews of departmental performance. They may also be called to appear in respect of inquiries initiated by a committee. In these appearances they are representing the Minister and assisting in the discharge of the obligations of the executive to account to Parliament.  
\-as advisers to the select committee, usually in respect of legislation. In this capacity they are present at meetings of the committee from which the public are excluded. This role of committee adviser is not usual in overseas jurisdictions. In this case too, officials remain responsible to the Minister. But they also have a duty to advise the committee with “utmost good faith” (McGee, 1991, p. 54). This situation presents the possibility of a conflict of interest for the official. In the words of the Clerk of the House, “I find the practice \[of departmental officials acting in a dual capacity] difficult to defend in principle, but acceptable in practice” (ibid).

·Officials can sometimes be placed in a difficult situation when asked by Select Committees to comment on matters of government policy — perhaps the nature of the advice tendered to the Minister, how a policy was developed, or commenting on alternative policy options. Constitutionally, these are matters that are the responsibility of ministers. The advice to public servants is that, if pressed, they should suggest that the matter should be taken up with the Minister – Ministers are not members of Select Committees but may appear before them — or that they be given leave to consult the Minister (SSC, 2002). Select Committees will usually agree.

·Similarly, it would not seem to be appropriate for officials to decline to provide details of arrangements entered into on behalf of the Crown on the grounds that they were the subject of a confidentiality agreement. In such circumstances, a decision to decline might be expected to be the responsibility of a Minister. In principle, when giving evidence to a committee, officials are obliged to answer all questions and can be held in contempt of Parliament if they do not do so (McGee 1991, p. 55).

·The effective functioning of these longstanding Select Committee arrangements depends on officials working closely with their Minister, acting responsibly and in good faith as advisers to committees. The attitude of Members is also important — in respecting the primary constitutional allegiance of the public servant to the Minister.

4.CROWN ENTITIES, PUBLIC ORGANISATIONS, STATE ENTERPRISES

·The relevant legislation requires Crown entities (as defined in the Sixth Schedule to the Public Finance Act 1989, and including district health boards and school boards of trustees), public organisations (as resolved by the House — e.g. the Reserve Bank), and State Enterprises (within the meaning of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1989) to lay before the House a number of documents as part of the accountability process. These are considered by Select Committees in accordance with the procedures for financial review of the performance and current operations. Representatives of the boards (where appropriate) and senior management will appear before the select committee in the same way as officials of Public Service departments. Similarly, they may be required to appear as witnesses when Select Committees are conducting other inquiries.

·Ministers have responsibility for state enterprises and Crown entities although the precise nature of this responsibility depends on the terms of the enabling legislation. Broadly, however, the representatives of these state sector organisations have the same obligation as other witnesses to provide the committee with such information as is sought, subject to the measures of protection discussed below.

5.NATURAL JUSTICE BEFORE SELECT COMMITTEES

·Witnesses — including the representatives of state sector organisations — can at times feel that they are ‘at risk’ from the activity of Select Committees in respect of scrutiny of their personal conduct. This may occur when they are appearing during reviews of departmental performance, or during a special inquiry. Parliament has made provision in Standing Orders to give some protection to persons who appear before a select committee or whose reputation may be impugned by the proceedings of, or evidence given before a committee.

·These provisions are set out in the publication of the Office of the Clerk of the House Natural Justice Before Select Committees: A Guide for Witnesses (1997). Whether officials should avail themselves of the right of response under these provisions is a matter for judgment in each case on which the individual might be expected to consult their chief executive.

6.PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO SELECT COMMITTEES

·Select Committees draw on the state sector for much of the information that forms the basis of their reports . There are, however, some limits on the requests that Select Committees can make. Standing orders, for example, say that inquiries are to be “well focused and do not waste the time or resources of the departments which fall within their jurisdisction”.3

·For their part, officials appearing before Select Committees may be guided by the criteria of the Official Information Act 1982 — although the Act does not apply to Parliament and cannot bind a select committee. That Act “contains a set of interests which may warrant the protection of information (ss6 and 7) and these are relevant in discussions with committees about their information requests” (SSC 2002, p. 6). Among these criteria are: protecting the security and international relations of New Zealand; protecting the maintenance of the law; protecting the privacy of individuals; protecting commercially sensitive information; and “maintaining constitutional conventions relating to the confidentiality of advice, ministerial responsibility and the political neutrality of officials”.

·It is our understanding that a number of conventions — for instance that Cabinet papers should be treated as confidential to the Government — are now generally accepted by Select Committees without constraining the ability of the House to require information to be produced.

·The presumption for State servants appearing before Select Committees must always be that information should be provided to Parliament — that respects the preeminent role of Parliament and the strong tendency to ‘openness’ in New Zealand government (see the accompanying report).

7.PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

·Select Committees have power to hear evidence in private sessions and may be prepared to do so on representation. Evidence presented to a private session — from which ‘strangers’ are excluded — will remain confidential to the committee until it reports to the House. It will then be publicly available. A committee may, however, in advance, declare evidence to be ‘secret evidence’. This might be on the grounds of protecting a person’s reputation (including third parties) or because, in the judgment of the committee, information will be available only if an assurance of confidentiality is given. (Secret evidence remains in the custody of the Clerk of the House unless released by order of the House.) Such assurances would not be lightly given and secrecy would also bind the individual who supplies the evidence.

·In summary, the overriding presumption of openness is to be seen against the availability of procedures that can protect confidentiality in certain circumstances — for example, provision of information in summary or abridged form.

8.ISSUES

·In our first report we made a general reference to respect for the institutions of democracy. That is an important element in the ethos of the state sector. It follows that a constructive relationship between Parliament and officials is an integral part of the accountability of the executive.

·There have been a number of cases recently where officials have been seriously criticised by Select Committees for being inadequately prepared or obstructive. We have also noted the robust questioning to which officials appearing before committees have experienced on occasion; the appropriateness of such questioning is a matter of judgment for those concerned.

·We recognise that advice is available (in addition to the Standing Orders and the invaluable Parliamentary Practice in New Zealand by David McGee (1994)) to those who participate in the business of Parliament — Members, officials and citizens — for example, the various guides published by the Office of the Clerk and the recently updated (February 2002) publication of the State Services Commission, Public Servants and Select Committees — Guidelines. The crucial question remains, however, the extent to which the participants are familiar in their day-to-day business with the functioning of the parliamentary process.

9.CONCLUSION

·The relationship between the State sector and Parliament, like other institutions of New Zealand’s governance, has been affected by the introduction of MMP. We therefore regard as timely the attention directed at this aspect of public management by the SSC. With advantage, and by arrangement, this could be extended elsewhere in the State sector. As in other respects, there is a clear need to ensure on a continuous basis that all State servants are fully aware of:

-the rules of the House (including the procedures for the enactment of legislation);  
\-the need to be prepared and briefed when appearing before Select Committees; and  
\-the presumption of openness while recognizing that public servants in almost all cases are the agents of the minister in their dealings with Parliament.

·This obligation is the responsibility of the leadership of the State sector — in all organisations. In this respect, the Board welcomes the initiative of the State Services Commission with the Office of the Clerk, in promoting training and education about the relationship of public servants with the Parliament.
