Mark Burton, Minister of Defence, today said the three members of the NZ SAS injured yesterday in Afghanistan when their patrolling vehicle ran over a landmine were doing an important job under demanding environmental and operational conditions.

“The Chief of Defence Force, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, has released detail as appropriate at this time.

“I extend the Government’s sympathies to the soldiers and their families.

“I want to reinforce Air Marshal Ferguson’s message that there are always risks associated with any operational deployment.

“All New Zealanders should take great pride from the fact that the members of our Defence Force serve with such professionalism in the face of these risks.

“The NZ SAS has an enviable reputation and their efforts on this important deployment have enhanced theirs, and New Zealand’s, standing with the nations that are cooperating in combating international terrorism.”
