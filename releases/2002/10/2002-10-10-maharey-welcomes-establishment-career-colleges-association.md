Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming the launch today of the Career Colleges’ Association – a new grouping of private training establishments.

Steve Maharey formally launched the Association this evening at a function held at the offices of Business New Zealand held in Wellington. He said the government’s tertiary education reforms provide a strong on-going role for the private training sector and that the government looks forward to working with the Association during and after their implementation.

“The thrust of our tertiary education reforms is to harness the important contribution of PTEs in ways that complement, rather than compete with, public tertiary education institutions.

“We want to arrive at a point where the whole sector is working together as one, but each with different roles.

“The Career Colleges’ Association will have an important role in fostering good practice in the sector. In particular its stated intention to work together to measure and improve completion and placement rates is very welcome.

“I also know that the Tertiary Education Commission will welcome your ambition to work constructively with government agencies, and will look forward to developing a relationship with you.

“This Association is the first new grouping of tertiary education organisations to be formed since the elements to the tertiary education reforms were decided upon and, for this reason as well, I am very pleased to welcome the formation of the Career Colleges’ Association,” Steve Maharey said.
