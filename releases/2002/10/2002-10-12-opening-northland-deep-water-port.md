Thank you for inviting me to participate in this historic event.

This is a significant day for Northland as this port opens the region to the significant economic and social benefits which bigger vessels and cargo can bring.

Before going any further, I need to acknowledge the hard work and foresight of the many people and organisations involved in creating this deep water port.

These are:

·The chairmen – Mike Daniel and Fraser McKenzie – and the directors of Northland Port Corporation and Port of Tauranga,  
·The team at Carter Holt Harvey,  
·John Palmer and his project management team,  
·Northland Regional Council chairman Mike Farnsworth and his staff,  
·The mayors of the Far North, Kaipara and Whangarei district councils – Yvonne Sharpe, Graeme Ramsey and Craig Brown – and their teams,  
·And last, but not least, the staff and members of the Northland Port Corporation and Harbour Boards who, over the past fifty years, acquired and designated this land for port development.

This port opens at a critical time in the development of Northland.

This region’s economy is now growing at a faster rate than the rest of New Zealand, turning in a stunning growth rate of 4.2 per cent in the last financial year.

Growth brings new challenges – and some headaches! - but they are the problems we like to have!

With growth comes opportunity for Northland’s people, after a long period of high unemployment and seeing young people and whole families move away from the region.

A major contributor to the rapid growth in Northland is the forestry industry.

Many New Zealanders are now familiar with the term “the wall of wood” – referring to our greatly expanding forests which are coming on stream for harvesting.

Overall our wood supply will double by 2015 – and the effects are particularly dramatic in Northland and the Gisborne district.

Getting forestry out for processing and marketing requires infrastructure. Our country is now running to catch up with the infrastructure required.

We need new investment in processing capacity.

We need many more skilled people in forestry; and we need the road, rail, and port infrastructure to cope.

Back in year 2000, Jim Anderton as Minister for Economic Development brought the forestry industry together to begin work on a wood processing strategy for New Zealand – focusing on investment, skills, and infrastructure – and a lot of progress has been made.

The government is working with the private sector to attract investment.

The industry is making a big contribution to training, and over four years government is trebling its contribution to industry training.

And there are also some exciting developments in infrastructure.

The planning and development of this new port precedes the work on the strategy, but is totally consistent with it.

Carter Holt Harvey is part of the joint venture running the on-shore facilities here at Northport, because of the importance of this development for getting its product out to market.

The Port of Tauranga is a key investor in the port, and brings to the joint venture its considerable experience in running a major forestry facility at Tauranga itself.

Together with the Northland Port Corporation, they have enabled this major deep water port to be developed.

Initially the main products to go through the port will be logs and processed forestry products. Within five years Northport is expected to be the second largest forestry port in New Zealand.

In time the port is expected to handle other commodities, and I understand will eventually replace the cargo activities at Port Whangarei.

Thus, this is a very important regional development initiative, and another piece of the jigsaw in taking Northland ahead.

But we know there is much more to do. I am pleased to say that Northland was one of the first to sign up to the Regional Partnerships Programme with the government and it is encouraging to see this relationship continuing and developing.

In the Partnership, the Mayors of the Far North, Kaipara, and Whangarei districts and their councils are working with the Northland Regional Council, local iwi, business and community representatives, to address a wide range of issues.

Poor rural roading and inadequate rail networks have hampered regional development.

To address that, the Northland Regional Council and local councils have been working with government agencies and the forestry industry to produce the Northland Integrated Transport Study. Facilitated by the Ministry for Economic Development and Industry New Zealand, the end result is an agreed transport plan for the region over the next five to ten years. This has been forwarded to Transfund New Zealand.

As part of the major government transport announcements in February, $30 million was allocated to land transport related regional development projects. This is the first time that funding has been dedicated in this way and it will be administered by Transfund.

The funding has yet to be allocated but this week the Minister of Transport, Paul Swain, announced a critical decision.

The government has directed Transfund to increase Northland’s financial assistance rate under this programme to one hundred per cent for roading, and alternatives to roading projects such as rail.

Usually funding for such projects is shared between government and councils, and a rate is worked out on the council’s ability to pay. That is, on average, fifty five per cent. Northland will do far better than that, recognising the huge regional developments needs here.

This direction applies to the Far North, Kaipara and Whangarei district councils as well as to the Northland Regional Council. These councils of course, will be expected to maintain their own contribution to land transport investment in the region.

The funding application process which requires submitting a project proposal to Transfund will continue and these will still be assessed against applications from other councils in New Zealand.

The difference is that now successful applications from Northland councils, for land transport projects that assist regional development, will receive full government funding rather than a percentage.

Road and rail links to Northport

The challenge now is to get better transport links into Northport – and to that end a lot of work is being done.

Road

The $5.4 million upgrade of the existing local road linking Northport to State Highway 1 is expected to be finished by June. It also includes four kilometers of new roading.

Transfund has contributed fifty five per cent of the funding and Whangarei District Council has met the balance, with a contribution from Northport and Carter Holt Harvey.

The Whangarei District Council has applied for the road to be designated a State Highway as it will be a strategically important link road. If it qualifies to become a State Highway, Transfund would completely fund its maintenance, rather than funding at the current fifty per cent rate.

In addition, Transit is designing several passing lanes on State Highway 1 to the north and south of the turn off to Marsden Point. They are expected to cost a total of $2 million to construct. Transit is also in the process of improving the State Highway intersection.

Rail

Northland Regional Council recently applied to Transfund for funding to investigate a $40 million proposal to build a nineteen kilometer railway line from the Northland railway line to Northport.

At its September meeting the Transfund Board agreed to fund seventy five per cent of the $800,000 investigation stage. The investigation will provide critical information for the Council and Transfund on this important rail link.

At the national level, the draft New Zealand Transport Strategy was released in June, and the Minister of Transport expects to release it before Christmas. It aims to link what happens in transport with New Zealand’s wider economic, social and environmental goals.

Conclusion

Today’s opening celebrates the new port and the partnerships which have made it possible. It is a step further along the way in Northland’s development.

It is my pleasure to now declare this port formally open.
