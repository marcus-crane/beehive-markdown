Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor today said that just over $2.5 million dollars will be allocated over the next two years to rural doctors and nurses working in isolated areas to help relieve their onerous rosters.

The first allocation of funding for this has been distributed to district health boards now, following applications in August.

Mr O’Connor said this first round of funding was especially targeted at largely isolated areas where a doctor or nurse might be on-call every night and weekend.

"Over time, the aim is to provide more reasonable on-call rosters for all rural areas with onerous rosters now.”

The $2.5 million is part of the rural component ($32 million over three years) of the $400 million, three-year primary health care funding package Health Minister Annette King announced in March this year.

The Health Ministry will allocate an additional $1.6 million in three further rounds after which Primary Health Organisations will take over. The PHOs will have a further $2.6 million for improving on-call rosters in the 2004/05 financial year.  
"We envisage that by 2004/5 most if not all rural areas will be receiving their funding through PHOs," Mr O’Connor said.

He said rural practice could provide a rewarding lifestyle for doctors and their families. However it is important they had time to enjoy it.

“This money, along with a further $13.5 million District Health Boards have been granted to help recruit and retain health professionals in rural areas, should help rural practices overcome problems with staff shortages."

Applications for the reasonable roster funding included proposals to up-skill nurses to share rosters, employ weekend locums and provide nurse triage services.

Applications were made through DHBs to the Health Ministry, where they were assessed by a working group of Ministry and rural sector representatives. Two-thirds of applicants have been funded in the first round to ensure the most difficult areas get enough money to make a difference. Applications not funded this round will be considered in the remaining three funding rounds.

The closing date for the next round of applications is 31 October 2002, with further closing dates at the end of February and April 2003.
