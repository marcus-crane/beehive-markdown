Liz Coutts has been appointed acting chairperson of the Crown Research Institute Industrial Research Ltd (IRL).

Ms Coutts' appointment by Crown Research Minister Pete Hodgson today follows the resignation of Dr Ross Armstrong from the chair of the Lower Hutt-based institute. Ms Coutts' appointment takes effect from midnight next Monday, when Dr Armstrong's resignation takes effect.

Ms Coutts, an Auckland-based company director, has been a director of IRL since 1998.

Her other directorships are with Public Trust (deputy chair), Skellmax Industries Ltd, Sport and Recreation New Zealand and Pharmac. She also chairs the Ministry of Health's Audit and Finance Committee and is on the Hillary Commission.

Ms Coutts is a past member of the former Health Funding Authority, a former Commerce Commissioner and former chief executive of the building supply company Carters, a division of Carter Holt Harvey.

"Liz Coutts is a very capable company director and chairperson and I am grateful that she has agreed to act as chairperson of IRL," Mr Hodgson said. "I will be looking to appoint a permanent chairperson in the next few weeks."
