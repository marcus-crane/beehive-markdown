A discussion paper released today by Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson sets out the framework for a New Zealand Biotechnology Strategy.

“The Government is committed under its Growth and Innovation Framework to supporting biotechnology as a key growth sector," Mr Hodgson said. “New Zealand has a strong track record in adding value to natural products through biological innovation. We have world-class biological knowledge and skills to build on. A stronger biotechnology sector has the potential to accelerate growth in other sectors, including forestry, agriculture, food production and pharmaceuticals.

"This discussion paper offers a vision, goals and guiding principles for the development and use of biotechnology in New Zealand. With new biological knowledge and techniques the opportunities are multiplying rapidly. A sound strategy will help us use biotechnology responsibly in pursuit of those opportunities."

The discussion paper outlines the current state of biotechnology in New Zealand. It notes that although New Zealand has excellent research, with a growing range of applications, the sector is underdeveloped relative to its potential.

Three goals are proposed to support the vision for responsible development of biotechnology:  
·build understanding and positive connections between the community and the biotechnology sector;  
·manage the development and introduction of new biotechnologies with a regulatory system that optimises opportunities and innovation while safeguarding health and the environment; and  
·grow New Zealand's biotechnology sector.

Specific targets and actions for growing the sector are being identified by the Biotechnology Taskforce, a group of ten top biotechnology entrepreneurs, academics and business leaders established in May this year. The discussion paper identifies challenges including retaining and developing talent, funding expensive R&D, commercialising research, supporting clusters, attracting overseas investment and increasing Maori participation.

Development of the Biotechnology Strategy, which was recommended by the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, is being led by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology. The ministry will collect and analyse submissions in response to the discussion paper and the Government aims to have a final strategy in place by early 2003.

“All sectors of the community are invited to comment on the development and direction of this strategy," Mr Hodgson said. "Its quality will be directly affected by the quality of the response to this discussion paper, so I encourage everyone to have their say.”

Copies of the discussion document are available at www.morst.govt.nz or by phoning 0508 400 805. Submissions close on 30 November 2002 and can be made through the website.
