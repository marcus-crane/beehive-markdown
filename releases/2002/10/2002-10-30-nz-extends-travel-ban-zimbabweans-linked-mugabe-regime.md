The Government is extending its ban on travel to New Zealand by key members of the Zimbabwe Government and administration, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“The list of Zimbabwean nationals whose entry into New Zealand is restricted was originally put in place in April and included President Mugabe, many members of his Cabinet as well as a number of top public servants.

“The list is now being expanded to 142 to reflect a recent Zimbabwe Cabinet reshuffle and include businesspeople who have profited from their association with the Zimbabwe Government.

"President Mugabe has continually failed to respond to the international community's profound concern about human rights abuses and subversion of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. Accordingly, New Zealand has decided to extend its travel restrictions against the Mugabe Government.

"The ban has been placed on individuals implicated in a serious way in undermining the rule of law and promoting or allowing human rights abuses. It is now being widened to include those profiting from their commercial dealings with the Mugabe regime.

“It follows closely the list of individuals banned by the European Union, Canada and the United States.

“The Zimbabwe travel ban underlines New Zealand’s commitment to work with the international community to apply greater pressure on the Mugabe Government to restore democratic norms and the rule of law in Zimbabwe,” Mr Goff said.
