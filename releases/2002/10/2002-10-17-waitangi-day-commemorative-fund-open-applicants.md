Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that applications were being invited from local government and the community for events associated with Waitangi Day next year.

The Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund 2003 supports activities which acknowledge the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and which promote nation building and community building.

“The Treaty of Waitangi is central to the understanding of our nation’s history,” Helen Clark said. “The government supports events and activities which bring communities together on 6 February when we mark the signing of the Treaty.”

Helen Clark said that grants given in previous years have ranged from $200 to $15,000, and have averaged about $5000. Grants have enabled a wide range of activities which have provided positive experiences for people on Waitangi Day. Projects run in partnership between local authorities, community groups, and tangata whenua are particularly encouraged.

“For 2002, the funding covered 44 events ranging from information workshops to historical enactments and cultural festivals. The diversity of activities held across the country broadens the understanding and appreciation of Waitangi Day,” Helen Clark said.

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage administers the fund. Applications close on 22 November 2002.
