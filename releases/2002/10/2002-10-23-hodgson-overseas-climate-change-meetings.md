Pete Hodgson departs New Zealand tonight for New Delhi to represent New Zealand in international climate change negotiations.

Mr Hodgson, the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, will lead the New Zealand delegation to the eighth conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, taking place in New Delhi from Wednesday 30 October to Friday 1 November.

Before the conference Mr Hodgson will visit Washington DC and London to take part for four days in a two-week climate change study tour by a group of officials and New Zealand industry representatives. The delegation includes representatives of leading New Zealand businesses. They are funding their own travel to study world's best practice in the management of greenhouse gas emissions, and how Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements have been implemented in other countries.

While in Washington Mr Hodgson will also have discussions at the US State Department and the Pew Centre – the leading US non-governmental organisation promoting a business response to climate change – on possible areas of cooperation between New Zealand and the US on climate change issues. While in London he will meet with Hon John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has had extensive involvement with Britain's climate change policy.

Mr Hodgson returns to New Zealand on Sunday 3 November.
