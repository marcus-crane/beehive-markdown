21 October 2002Media Statement  
Armstrong resigns from chairpersonships

Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed Dr Ross Armstrong’s decision to resign as chair of both Television New Zealand and Industrial Research Ltd.

The resignations are effective from midnight this coming Monday and follow the embarrassment caused to the government by Dr Armstrong’s activities around the Public Private Partnership issue.

“Dr Armstrong has assured me that his intentions were good and I do not doubt that. However he has accepted responsibility for the paper leaked to the media which created the impression that members of his group would get the inside running for PPP contracts.

“That ran to the heart of the integrity of the New Zealand government, and carries implications that no government can tolerate,” Dr Cullen said.

Dr Armstrong advised the government of his intention to resign when he met today with Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton, Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, and Crown Research Institutes Minister, Pete Hodgson.
