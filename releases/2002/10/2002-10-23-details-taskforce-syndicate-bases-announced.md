Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard today announced the membership and terms of reference for the taskforce that will consider options for the provision of sites for syndicate bases for the 2005-6 America’s Cup regatta, and subsequent regattas.

The taskforce is to carry out a $250,000 privately-funded feasibility study into options for syndicate bases, with the aim of selecting the best option by mid-December.

“Four current syndicate bases will not be available for future regattas because of commercial development,” Trevor Mallard said.

“If Team New Zealand retains the America’s Cup, there will be an immediate demand for sites from current and new competitors. It’s important that we have a plan in place to manage that demand.”

The taskforce will be chaired by Trevor Mallard. Other taskforce members are Auckland City Councillor Scott Milne, America’s Cup Village Ltd chairman Peter Kiely, Ports of Auckland CEO Geoff Vazey, Viaduct Holdings Ltd’s Rob Campbell.

It will also include two representatives from America’s Cup yachting syndicates.

Options that will be considered by the taskforce include: -  
·a reconfiguration of existing sites leased by America’s Cup Village Ltd  
·provision of a multi-use launching facility using an existing America’s Cup Village Ltd site along with the provision of off-water sites for syndicate bases in and around Halsley St,  
·extension of Halsley St wharf to provide for extra sites for syndicate bases,  
·provision of sites in or around the Tank Farm,  
·a combination of above options

“The taskforce will consult with other stakeholder groups, including fishing and marine interests, and it is possible that other options could emerge during this process,” Trevor Mallard said.

Under its terms of reference, the taskforce must take into account: -

·compatibility with long-term plans for the Auckland waterfront,  
·compatibility with the site requirements of the America’s Cup syndicates,  
·location within Viaduct Harbour,  
·ability to meet the needs of at least 12 syndicate bases,  
· technical feasibility, commercial and financial viability, legal certitude and timescale
