Aucklanders Janet Scott and Marija Urlich along with Ken Raureti of Rotorua have been appointed to the Employment Relations Authority for three-year terms, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson announced today.

The trio, who will sit in Auckland, represent a good mix of skills, experience and talents, she said.

Janet Scott is currently a Mediator with the Department of Labour, a position she has held since October 2000. She previously spent eight years as a Mediator and Adjudicator Member of the Employment Tribunal.

Marija Urlich has been employed since 1996 as a Legal Officer with the Service and Food Workers Union. She has extensive knowledge of employment law and practice and has been involved in helping employees with employment relationship problems through the Mediation Service and Employment Relations Authority. She has also produced educational material and training in employment relations to union organisers and members.

Ken Raureti has been the Rotorua and Lakes District Manager for the Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA) for the past seven years. From 1994 to 1995 he was an employment relations consultant with EMA.

The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand were consulted and agreed to the recommendation of these candidates, Margaret Wilson said.
