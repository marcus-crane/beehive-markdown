MP for Te Tai Hauauru, Tariana Turia, congratulates Te Puni Kokiri for leading a whole-of-government approach to supporting the community in Highbury.

“By convening the Regional Intersectoral Forum, Te Puni Kokiri has invited central and local government agencies to support a community development plan, which is to be drawn up by the people of Highbury in conjunction with the forum,” said Tariana Turia.

Tariana Turia is Associate Minister of Maori Affairs for social development, Associate Minister for Housing and Health, and Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector.

Earlier this week it was reported that Te Puni Kokiri planned to spend $80,000 on research. Some City Councillors suggested that money should be spent instead on employing people on the street to run programmes.

“Sometimes, official agencies feel they are dealing with a problem by ad hoc funding in response to crises. Te Puni Kokiri is taking a long-term community development approach, empowering the community to deal with their own issues. The final cost can not be estimated until a proposal is properly developed.

“There are good things going on all the time in any community. We must not allow a crisis to blind us to that.

“Te Puni Kokiri’s approach is to identify and support positive initiatives. This type of research produces immediate benefits, and builds towards long-term solutions.

“The Regional Intersectoral Forum works in conjunction with the Highbury Focus Group to co-ordinate government funding and programmes that will foster the social, cultural and economic development of the whole community. The Council’s community development Unit will be involved, and the mayor is kept informed.

“This is the right approach to be taking,” said Tariana Turia.
