Teaching and learning about information and communication technology was given a big push today with Education Minister Trevor Mallard’s announcement that another 147 schools will be brought into the Government’s ICT programme.

This brings the total number of schools involved in the ICT professional development programme up to 798.

The schools will be grouped into 21 clusters, including two clusters involving Kura Kaupapa Maori. The group also includes several areas of New Zealand where there were no clusters – Taupo, Horowhenua/Kapiti, Southland and Ruapehu.

Each cluster has a lead school responsible for leading and managing the programmes.

“Nation-wide, lead schools are distinguished by their vision for teaching and learning and are already successfully using ICT in innovative ways to enhance this.”

The 21 clusters selected represent a wide range of geographical locations and decile ratings throughout the country. Each cluster has been given a three-year contract, subject to annual review, and will have $120,000 (incl. GST) available per year to support their ICT professional development activities.

“The diverse and innovative ways that the schools in these clusters have responded to the challenges of this programme is a good reminder that energy and enterprise is alive and well. It’s helping to give all our students a quality education,” Trevor Mallard said.

The cluster programme - strongly focused on teaching and learning - will:

·Provide professional development for all teachers in participating schools on the use of ICT for teaching, learning and administration;

·Develop activities that integrate ICT into teaching and learning, and meet important learning outcomes of the NZ curriculum;

·Explore innovative ways of using ICT in educational activities, especially using the education website Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI), for students, teachers and their communities;

·Develop printed and digital resources for dissemination by the Ministry of Education that reflect good practice in the use of ICT in teaching and learning;

·Use ICT to meet administration needs;

·Develop systems and strategies for the technical support of ICT;

·Formulate integrated policies and sustainable development plans for ICT.
