A Police trainee programme designed for Auckland is progressing well, Police Minister George Hawkins and Police Commissioner Rob Robinson said today.

Over 350 curriculum vitae are being considered for the 90 place course, which is scheduled to begin in January 2003.

“It is expected 80 will progress through to the recruit course after six months of study,” the Commissioner said.

Mr Hawkins said the scheme was an excellent way for young people in the 17 to 22 year age range to extend their educational qualifications, while at the same time working towards employment.

“Policing is a varied career where officers know they make a real difference to the communities where they are stationed, “ Mr Hawkins said.

“It has been gratifying to see such a strong response from so many young people.”

Of those applying under the scheme, more than 40 had been referred on to the mainstream Police recruitment programme, Commissioner Robinson said.

The tertiary study component of the scheme will be offered through Manukau Institute of Technology, working with Victoria University of Wellington as part of the Victoria-Police Education Programme.
