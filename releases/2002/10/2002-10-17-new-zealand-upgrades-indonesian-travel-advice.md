New Zealand is upgrading its Ministry of Foreign Affairs travel advisory for Indonesia, Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff said.

“Short term visitors in Indonesia who are not there for essential purposes are advised to depart.

“This is in addition to the already comprehensive travel advisory which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has in place which includes a warning not travel to Bali and certain parts of Indonesia and to defer all tourist and non-essential travel to the rest of Indonesia.

“New Zealand has consulted with the Australian Government over its decision to upgrade its travel advice and understands the reasons for making the change.

“New Zealand’s upgraded travel advisory is consistent with information discussed with Australia which suggests erring on the side of caution relating to the security of foreign nationals in Indonesia.

“The reasons for the change in travel advice relates to specific information which I am not at liberty to disclose.

“The full text of the travel advisory will be available on the Ministry’s website at www.mfat.govt.nz,” Mr Goff said.
