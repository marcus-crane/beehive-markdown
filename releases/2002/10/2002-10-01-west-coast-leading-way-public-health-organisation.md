The West Coast is leading the way with the formation of a Public Health Organisation today, West Coast-Tasman MP Damien O’Connor said.

Mr O’Connor said the West Coast District Health Board’s Public Health Organisation was one of four starting from today. The others are in the Hutt Valley and Tairawhiti.

PHOs give low-income, high health needs people access to free or low-cost primary health care, and nearly all the country’s 21 District Health Boards have indicated they are likely to have at least one PHO established by early next year. The Government has put aside up to $4 million to help get PHOs established.

Mr O’Connor said the West Coast Public Health Organisation providers included all the GP practices on the West Coast – about 22 GPs, 20 practice nurses, and eight other health providers – and would cover all 32,000 people on the coast.

“I am very pleased to see all the GPs in behind this new organization. In my view, the Public Health Organisation will provide the necessary support and relief for GPs in our region, and will increase overall the attractiveness of the coast for GPs.”

The increased level of funding allows PHOs to charge patients less. Cheaper services will be extended to more people over the next few years, as more funding becomes available.

“It is sensible for the West Coast to have one public health organization, given our small population and the need to keep administration costs to a minimum.

Mr O’Connor said it was important for the distinction to be made between the PHO’s focus on improving the health status of the West Coast through primary health care initiatives and the DHB’s provision of health services in a more reactive way.

“I will be working to ensure that there is adequate accountability on this.”

As many as 1.7 million to two million New Zealanders could belong to PHOs by July next year.

“PHOs are crucial to achieving better primary health care in our communities, to help turn around some of the poor health statistics, particularly those with high health needs and low income,” Mr O’Connor said.

The Government has allocated a total of $400 million over three years for primary health care.
