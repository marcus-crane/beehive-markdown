Craig Boyce has been appointed acting chairperson of Television New Zealand Limited.

Mr Boyce’s appointment by the Minister of Broadcasting, Steve Maharey, today follows the resignation of Dr Ross Armstrong from the chair of TVNZ. Dr Armstrong’s resignation takes effect from midnight on Monday when Mr Boyce will assume the temporary role.

Mr Boyce, a Christchurch-based company director and chairman of Smiths City Group Ltd and Connexionz Ltd, has been a director of TVNZ since 2000.

His other directorships are with Advanced Foods of New Zealand Ltd, Industry New Zealand Ltd, Christchurch Arts Centre, Datacom Group Ltd, Wairau Park Ltd, Christchurch City Holdings Ltd, and Orion Group Ltd..

Mr Boyce is a past director of Transpower NZ Ltd.

“Craig Boyce is a very able chairperson and I appreciate his willingness to lead TVNZ during this time of transition,” Mr Maharey said. “I have no doubt that he and the other members of the board have the skills to provide TVNZ with sound leadership.”

Mr Maharey said a new chairperson will be appointed after the passage of the Television New Zealand Bill which is currently before the House.
