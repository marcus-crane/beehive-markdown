A ceremony for the initialling of a Deed of Settlement between the Crown and Ngati Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), also known as Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau, will take place on Thursday, 17 October between 3.30 and 5pm in the Maori Affairs Committee Room, G.006, Parliament Buildings.

The ceremony is a significant negotiation milestone for Kawerau-based Ngati Tuwharetoa and the Crown as it will enable the group to put the settlement package to their people for a vote. If the settlement is ratified, a final Deed of Settlement will be signed.

About 30 to 40 Ngati Tuwharetoa representatives are expected to attend the ceremony.

A media statement and summary of the settlement will be released tomorrow morning under embargo.
