State Sector Standards Board: Report on Education Sector

Proposal  
1Your office has requested comments on the State Sector Standards Board’s draft report on the Education sector (April 2002). This note provides a brief analysis of the issues raised by the report. The Ministry of Education would welcome an opportunity to discuss with you and/or the Board the issues raised – in particular the best approach to constructively promulgating the Government’s Statement of Expectations within the sector.

Overall comments on the Draft Report  
2The draft report provides some valuable assessments on the state of the sector and options to address problems of ethos in the sector. These comments are informative, but overall the report could be strengthened with clearer problem definitions backed by evidence and examples, and by ensuring a balanced reporting of current system performance.  
3Key issues raised by the Board’s report reflect concerns Ministers, officials and sector representatives have shared. These include the need to strengthen the professional ethos of the teaching profession; to ensure that educational institutions at all levels are governed and managed effectively and ethically; and that education sector agencies and public education providers are responsive to their communities and to Government priorities. Much work is already underway across the system on these and related issues, and any new efforts should build on progress made to date.

4The report’s key recommendation is that the Government Statement of Expectations be promulgated more widely in the education sector. The Ministry would welcome an opportunity to discuss with the Standards Board how this could best be managed to achieve a positive result in a sector with varying degrees of institutional autonomy, a range of change processes underway that are putting pressure on providers, and with the current industrial climate.

Discussion  
Problem Definition  
5The report lists a range of issues and problems within the education sector, many of which the Secretary for Education discussed with the Board when they met in November last year. Particular attention is paid to the issue of governance structures and fragmented control across different levels of the sector. These are significant issues the impact of which is reflected in current debates about the appropriate degree of institutional autonomy; Crown ownership; the implementation of change strategies; and ongoing industrial negotiations.  
6The report would offer more guidance for action if problems were more clearly defined and supported by evidence. It would provide a more balanced view of the state of the sector if some of the many positive outcomes across the sector were also reported. For example the report states:  
·that New Zealanders are not adequately concerned with quality and raising standards in the sector (p3);  
\-New Zealand secondary students’ strong results in international studies such as PISA (15 year olds) and TIMSS (school leavers) suggest many New Zealanders have reason to be satisfied with the quality of education their children receive – although persistent disparities show the national imperative of improving outcomes for groups such as low-SES, Maori and Pacific students;  
·that it is not clear that New Zealanders are committed to the need for lifelong learning (p3);  
\-New Zealand’s very high participation rates in tertiary education (including growing participation in adult education and industry training, and by Maori at all levels) suggest the contrary;  
·that Boards of Trustees have control of only 30% of school expenditure (p4)  
\-The majority of school resourcing is for staff salaries. While teachers’ and principals’ salaries are negotiated and paid by the Ministry, schools have a much greater degree of control over staff recruitment, deployment, performance management, etc. than in many OECD countries. Recent policy changes have given schools further discretion over their use of resources (eg: banking staffing, use ops. grants for staffing, 5-year property plans).  
7Some of the problems noted in the report are enduring trade-offs that must be faced in the system, where addressing one problem is likely to create or increase others. For example, the report notes the trade-off between centralised and devolved governance arrangements.  
8The report states (p4) that there is a “serious structural vacuum” in the education system. It would be useful if this statement could be clarified and elaborated, as this would assist in identifying options and trade-offs to be faced in addressing the problem.

Current Work to Address Issues and Pressures Raised in the Draft Report  
9The report raises many issues that the Government is currently working to address. In considering the report it would be useful to identify these in some detail to ensure that any recommendations for further action recognise and align with current activity.  
Developing Integrated Strategies  
10The Report expresses a concern about a lack of clear strategy across the sector. Current activities aiming to clarify strategic priorities and improve alignment of effort across the system include the development of the Tertiary Education Strategy and the Early Childhood Education Strategic Plan, and work in the school sector to clarify priorities through the NAGs and Planning and Reporting. We have discussed the potential benefits of developing an integrating framework of outcomes goals for the education system, and of bringing together an overarching strategy for the schools sector, and we will continue to develop our advice on these issues over the coming months.  
Funding Systems  
11The report notes several concerns with funding systems including the autonomy of schools (discussed in para 5 above) and the incentives created by the EFTS funding system in the tertiary sector . Funding systems in many parts of the education system are currently being reviewed, or are planned for review. This includes redesign of tertiary funding systems to reflect the Tertiary Education Strategy, the planned review of Early Childhood Education resourcing in 2002-03, and the ongoing work on schools resourcing such as the assessment of decile resourcing. A priority in any policy work on funding systems is to ensure greater flexibility to support a greater diversity of learning pathways, organisational arrangements and educational contexts.  
Teaching Workforce Issues  
12The report notes concern with morale and retention/recruitment issues in the school sector teaching workforce (p7-8). While the issue is tied up with industrial negotiations and remuneration issues, a range of current initiatives and activities are seeking to address workload, recruitment and retention and professional morale and ethos. This includes the establishment of the Teachers Council, TeachNZ scholarships and other supply initiatives, implementation of the Staffing Review recommendations to lift staffing levels, professional development programmes, etc.  
13Other concerns raised by the Board’s report are also the subject of current work:  
·work under the Export Education Strategy to ensure the growth of international student numbers is managed sustainably (p6);  
·the Curriculum Stocktake and related work to address issues of relevance and crowding in the curriculum (p6);  
·support for schooling innovations and expansion of alternative education opportunities to meet the needs of those students not well served by mainstream schooling (p7);  
·a variety of initiatives to address disparities in achievement by Maori students – including increased support for Maori Medium education and professional development for schools and teachers to improve capability and responsiveness to Maori (p7); and  
·school support interventions and support for TEIs where there are concerns with educational quality and financial viability (p8).

Promulgation of the Government’s Statement of Expectations to the Education Sector  
14The draft report notes that the Government’s Statement of Expectations have not been widely promulgated or discussed within the education sector, and it recommends that promulgating the Statement of Expectations be given high priority.  
15The Ministry of Education would welcome an opportunity to discuss with you and/or the Standards Board how this could be done in a way most likely to effect positive change. The Ministry agrees with the Board’s assessment that the values and principles set out in the Statement of Expectations are important and relevant across the public education sector as they are within the core Public Service.  
16However, as the report notes, the education sector is comprised of many institutions with varying degrees of autonomy, state ownership and regulation. In this context, and in the climate created by current industrial negotiations and the implementation of major change strategies across the sector, a range of approaches different to those used with the core Public Service would be needed to ensure that the Government Statement of Expectations can play a positive role in addressing the issues raised by the Board in its report.  
17In the schools sector this needs to be managed alongside implementation of Planning and Reporting, and the development of professional standards and codes of ethics by the Teachers Council. The NZ School Trustees Association will also play an important role in any promulgation of standards to Boards of Trustees and this could be developed within their existing (contracted) work in Trustee training. In the tertiary sector it may need to be considered alongside the development of charters and profiles, and promulgation may best be considered by the Tertiary Education Commission.  
18I recommend that you agree that the Ministry of Education consult with the State Services Commission and report back to you with options for wider promulgation of the Government Statement of Expectations within the education sector.
