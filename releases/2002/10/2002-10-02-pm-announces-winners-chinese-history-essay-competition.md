Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced winners of the student essay competition on the history of the Chinese in New Zealand.

The three winners are Sienna Smale-Jackson (Otago Girls’ High School, Dunedin), Christopher Burns (Rosmini College, Auckland) and Bevin Gee (Waitaki Boys’ High School, Oamaru).

Sienna and Christopher’s essays outlined the differences between the experiences of Chinese from other New Zealanders between 1865-1965. Bevin’s entry was written from the perspective of a Chinese person living in Tuapeka in 1872.

The essay writing competition follows the government’s formal apology for discrimination imposed by statute on Chinese people in the past. The Prime Minister will today present the winners of the essay competition with copies of James Ng’s Windows on a Chinese Past at a function in Parliament.

A further ten highly commended competition entrants will receive copies of Manying Ip’s Dragons on the Long White Cloud.

In February when the government tendered the formal apology, the essay competition was announced as a way of ensuring that younger New Zealanders knew more about this unfortunate aspect of New Zealand history.

“While the governments which passed these discriminatory laws acted in a manner which was lawful at the time, their actions are seen by us today as unacceptable,” Helen Clark said. “We believed an act of reconciliation was required to ensure that full closure can be reached on this chapter in our nation’s history.”

“The Chinese community makes a huge economic and social contribution to our country. The many new Chinese migrants are bringing new ideas, a strong work ethic, and valuable contacts with their countries of origin.”

“Modern New Zealand has a bicultural foundation, and today is home to many peoples. It is important that we value, honour, and respect all our communities and see our diversity as a great strength,” Helen Clark said.

The Speaker of the House and former history teacher Jonathan Hunt judged the essay competition.
