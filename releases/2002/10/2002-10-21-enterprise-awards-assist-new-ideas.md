“New Zealanders continue to come up with brilliant new ideas which are creating jobs and new businesses,” says Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton announcing 53 Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards totalling $636,265.

“This is the second anniversary of the Enterprise Awards and it is heartening to see that some companies that received support in the first few months are now larger businesses receiving Business Growth Grants to expand to the next level.

“There have been 641 grants totalling $5.55 million since October 2000 and the scheme has been highly successful, although we are always looking for ways to better assist businesses.

“I will be looking for ways to improve Enterprise Awards. We want to assist new ideas so that we can take New Zealand back to the top of OECD countries and again have New Zealanders enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world.

“This Labour Progressive Government has a number of ways of assisting and working with regions, industries and businesses and these have contributed to booming regions and the lowest national and regional unemployment for 14 years. All of our regions are in positive growth mode and most at over four per cent annually,” said Jim Anderton.

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
