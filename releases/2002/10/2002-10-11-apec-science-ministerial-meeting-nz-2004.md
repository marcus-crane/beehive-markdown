New Zealand will host the 4th APEC Ministers’ Conference on Regional Science and Technology Cooperation in Christchurch in March 2004, Minister of Research Science and Technology Pete Hodgson said today. A New Zealand innovation showcase will run alongside the conference.

"The APEC Ministerial Conference is a very significant opportunity for New Zealand to take a lead in shaping international cooperation in research and innovation," Mr Hodgson said. "It will also allow us to promote the capability of innovative New Zealand businesses and research organisations to an international audience."

Mr Hodgson said the conference would examine science and innovation policy in four principal areas: development of international science networks, technology cooperation in APEC, human capacity building, and connecting research and innovation.

"Aside from addressing global cooperation in research and innovation, the conference provides us with a real opportunity to advance New Zealand’s research and innovation relationships with the participants on a bilateral, or country to country, basis," Mr Hodgson said. "Ministerial delegations will include business representatives, adding an important commercial dimension to the conference. New Zealand companies and research organisations participating in the innovation showcase should be able to develop valuable new international relationships."

The conference is being organised by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, with planning already under way.

The last APEC science ministers’ conference was in Mexico in 1998. APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) is a regional trade and economic forum involving 21 countries including Japan, Korea, China, Chinese Taipei, Malaysia, Hong Kong China, Singapore, the USA, Canada and Australia.
