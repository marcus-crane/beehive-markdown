Prime Minister Helen Clark says that the New Zealand government is appalled by the cold-blooded terrorist attack in Bali, Indonesia.

She announced that the Cabinet had today made available a Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules and medical evacuation team to assist in the evacuation of casualties. The Hercules is due to leave from Whenuapai for Darwin at 7pm.

The RNZAF C-130 Hercules and medical evacuation team is available to assist the Australians in the evacuation of dead and injured people from Bali to hospitals in Australia.

"Our thoughts are first and foremost with those caught in this tragedy and their the families, friends, and communities," Helen Clark said.

"We are deeply concerned about the fate of the missing and injured New Zealanders and citizens of other nations who have been caught up in this horrific violence. New Zealanders’ thoughts today are with all those who have borne the brunt of this outrage, particularly Australia and Indonesia.

“Last night I spoke to Prime Minister John Howard to convey our sympathy to Australia for the heavy toll of injuries and death it has sustained.

"There can be no tolerance of such deliberate and cowardly acts of terrorism. It is important that the international community continues to work together to counter terrorism. New Zealand will do whatever it can to help.

“New Zealand diplomats are in Bali endeavouring to locate missing and injured New Zealanders. The government is liaising with the Australian Government regarding evacuation of the dead and injured, particularly those who might be badly hurt.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s toll-free phone number \[0800 432 111] has attracted many hundreds of calls from New Zealand families. We are also advising New Zealanders to not travel to Indonesia until further notice,” Helen Clark said.
