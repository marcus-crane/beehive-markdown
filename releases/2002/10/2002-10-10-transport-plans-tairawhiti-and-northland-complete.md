Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced that integrated transport plans for both Northland and Tairawhiti are complete.

“I am pleased that regional development transport plans based on integrated transport studies have now been completed and signed off by local councils and industry in Tairawhiti and Northland. These plans have emerged from the direction provided by the regions’ regional development strategies and the wood processing strategy.

“The wall of wood and other economic development priorities in regions require adequate transport systems and this Labour Progressive Government has committed to meeting this need.

“Local government, the Ministry of Economic Development, Industry New Zealand and industry groups have worked closely to ensure that the Northland and Tairawhiti Integrated Transport Studies have potential solutions in both regions. Transit NZ has also been involved in the process.

“These regions have now identified priority roading and non-roading projects that will assist local government in preparing transport proposals for the next 5-10 years.

“Northland and Tairawhiti were some of the first partnerships to form under the Regional Partnerships Programme and it is encouraging to see this partnership continuing and developing.

“Having the Mayors in the two regions and their respective councils working collaboratively along with the local iwi, business and community representatives has enabled a wider breadth of issues, such as transport and infrastructure, to be considered and addressed,” said Jim Anderton.

Around $30 million has been allocated in the Land Transport Funding Package of February 2002 for regional transport in regions.
