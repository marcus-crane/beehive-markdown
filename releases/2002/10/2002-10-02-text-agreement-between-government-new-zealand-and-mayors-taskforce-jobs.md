MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
MAYORS TASKFORCE FOR JOBS  
AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

1.This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the process by which Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs will cooperate towards the achievement of the shared goal, that:  
By 2007, all 15-19 year olds will be engaged in appropriate education, training, work, or other options which will lead to long term economic independence and well-being.  
2.This agreement also acknowledges the contribution that this common goal makes to the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs commitment to working towards:  
·all young people up to age 25 being in employment or education and training; and ultimately  
·all people in our communities having the opportunity to be in work or training;

and to the wider employment, education, social and economic development goals of the New Zealand Government.  
3.The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding are renewing their public commitment to addressing these issues and pledging to co-operate on future initiatives. We recognise that we need to act strategically and effectively and to think long-term.  
4.This Memorandum also signals the intentions of both parties to cooperate in the development and achievement of employment goals which will contribute to improved opportunities for all New Zealanders.

BACKGROUND  
5.In February 2000, a group of Mayors from throughout New Zealand met in Christchurch to establish a MAYORS TASKFORCE for JOBS, which would be a national focus for Mayors concerned about the future of work and livelihood in our communities.  
6.Since the launch the Taskforce has gained increasing support and Mayors from around the country have seen the Taskforce as a way to provide leadership on the crucial issue of employment and livelihood in their communities, to support local initiatives and to work together to share successful projects and solutions. This is the first time in New Zealand that Mayors have joined together on a social issue. By September 2002 50 Mayors (67% of all Mayors) have joined the Taskforce.  
7.The objectives of the MAYORS TASKFORCE for JOBS are:

·to provide a national focus of leadership on the jobs issue through co-operation between Mayors concerned about employment issues in their communities,  
·to share best practice on what we can achieve on employment at the local level,  
·to create local and national forums which address the big picture' of trends on the issues of income and work,  
·to link with imaginative private sector initiatives that are addressing unemployment.  
8.The Government’s vision is that New Zealand is:  
·a land where diversity is valued and reflected in our national identity  
·a great place to live, learn, work and do business;  
·a birthplace of world-changing people and ideas;  
·a place where people invest in the future  
9.In helping to achieve this vision, Government will be proactive in supporting growth, will work co-operatively with other sectors to achieve that, and will emphasise the importance of sustainability.  
10.The Government is committed to developing the skills and talents of New Zealanders, and to promoting increased opportunities for participation through social and economic development.  
11.The Government’s Employment Strategy framework seeks to minimise persistent disadvantage in the labour market and maximise the number of jobs and level of earnings for all.  
12.The Tertiary Education Strategy will also contribute to raising the skills and capabilities of New Zealanders, so that they are able to participate in the knowledge economy. The Government is seeking to foster a tertiary education system that contributes to economic and social development through the development of skilled and adaptable people and through research and scholarship that create new ideas.  
13.The Government also has a vision of New Zealand as a country where young people are vibrant and optimistic through being supported and encouraged to take up challenges. The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa provides a policy platform for developing policy advice and initiatives which will contribute to this goal.  
14.The key principles of Government involvement in regional development are:  
·Making the most of what a region has to offer rather than making transfers from prosperous regions to less prosperous regions  
·Partnering with the local community to facilitate the development of local strategies that respond to local opportunities and that integrate social, environmental and economic concerns.  
·A 'whole of government' response where the activities of Central Government are integrated into regional strategies together with local stakeholders.  
THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CHALLENGE  
15.Household Labour Force data indicate that as at June 2002 100,000 people were unemployed and more than 170,000 jobless in our communities. Of particular concern is that 11.1% of young people aged 15 to 24 years are currently unemployed.  
16.What we are most concerned about are the long-term trends for work and income in our communities. The parties to this Memorandum affirm that there is no continuing justification for the ‘waste of New Zealanders’ through unemployment. There needs to be a concerted leadership effort at both local and central government levels about the quality of work and the creation of more opportunities for our children and our children’s children.  
17.The jobs of the future will certainly still come from new business opportunities. However, we also need to be concerned about the quality of people’s working lives. We also need to ensure that all people, including Mäori and Pacific Island people, have access to existing and new work opportunities. The parties to this agreement can play an important governance role in leading and facilitating the future direction on behalf of our communities.

PRINCIPLES OF APPROACH  
18.Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs are committed to building a working partnership to work towards this goal at the local level, through fostering co-operative relationships across all sectors.  
19.Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs recognise the need for sustainable development to provide long-term solutions for communities.  
20.Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs are committed to working together to address the issues that have caused disparities between different groups in society, including between ethnic groups and between regions. This includes a specific commitment to addressing the disparities that exist between Maori and Pacific communities and others.  
21.Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs are committed to reducing long term unemployment.  
22.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government recognise the importance of co-ordination and collaboration to address complex social problems.  
23.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government recognise that local solutions have the greatest chance of success where there is local leadership and community ownership.  
24.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government recognise the value of sharing information on labour market trends and future needs, and recognise the importance of information held by local authorities.

UNDERTAKINGS OF THE PARTIES  
25.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government will work together to facilitate community development initiatives, and develop and support community entrepreneurs. This package is likely to include:  
·Building the capacity of local people and community development agencies  
·Obtaining advice or expertise to assist in regional/community strategic planning initiatives  
·ensuring Government expenditure in the regions contributes to improved outcomes  
·Funding for specific community/regional development initiatives  
26.Mayors will participate in the development of regional/local action groups, which will develop clearly articulated long term strategies to work on whole of government solutions in their areas. Wherever possible these groups will build on existing mechanisms for central and local government, community and business partnership around employment creation and community development. The parties will work together to ensure that, where appropriate, innovative and flexible decisions can be made at the local level.  
27.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs will promote close co-operation between the Central Government and local economic and employment development organisations to minimise duplication and build on successful structures.  
28.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government will work together to promote new solutions to unemployment which reflect the changing nature of work in our country.

31.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government will work together on the further development of common goals.

PARTNERSHIP PROCESS  
32.Central Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs are committed to working in partnership and agree to ensure processes are in place to facilitate this positive working relationship.  
33.This process will include quarterly meetings, or as necessary, with the Ministers of Social Services and Employment, Economic Development, Local Government, and other Ministers as appropriate.

34.The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and Central Government agree that progress towards agreed common goals will be reviewed annually.
