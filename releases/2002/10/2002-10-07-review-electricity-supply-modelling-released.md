Electricity supply forecasts released today by industry consultant Bryan Leyland appear to err on the side of pessimism, according to an expert review released by Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

“Mr Leyland’s findings come as no surprise,” Mr Hodgson said. “He has been releasing his forecasts every two years for nearly a decade now and they invariably predict an imminent power crisis.”

Mr Hodgson released a review by analyst Tom Halliburton of Mr Leyland’s electricity supply and demand modelling and modelling done by Transpower, the national grid operator.

“Dr Halliburton concludes that Transpower’s forecasts of system security appear somewhat optimistic and Mr Leyland’s rather too pessimistic,” Mr Hodgson said.

“Dr Halliburton also concludes that the models used for these forecasts are quite crude. They model supply and demand in yearly blocks, which means they are unable to model accurately events measured in weeks or months, such as a six-month drought, higher demand in a cold winter or a three-month power station shutdown. We need to do better than this and I have asked officials to report to me promptly on options for securing better quality modelling.”

Mr Hodgson said New Zealand’s electricity generation capacity obviously had to keep pace with growth in demand. “It is always true that if we do not build new capacity in a timely manner we will run into supply problems. The key issue is whether new capacity will be built in time and the risk of shortage in a dry year is adequately covered.

“New Zealand needs new generation capacity at the rate of around 150 megawatts a year to meet demand and maintain an adequate dry year reserve. This is well within the industry’s capability. Publicly available information on plans for new generation, along with information given to the government in confidence, satisfies me that more than enough capacity is likely to be available for the next ten years or so.”
