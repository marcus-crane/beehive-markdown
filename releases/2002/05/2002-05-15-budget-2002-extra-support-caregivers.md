Additional support will be provided in Budget 2002 for caregivers and the organisations which support them, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

An additional $2.339 million is being invested over four years to enable foster parent organisations to offer better services and to establish a new payment to help recruit additional caregivers. The new funding will go to three community agencies (all figures over four years):  
\* the New Zealand Family and Foster Care Federation ($800,000);  
\* Grandparents raising Grandchildren Charitable Trust ($45,000); and  
\* the New Zealand Association of Child and Family Support and Community Services ($400,000).

Steve Maharey said caregivers provide a vital service in our community and deserve effective support.

“Caregivers are a vital part of the network of assistance the community sector provides to support the needs of children - but caregivers also need support themselves because taking care of children is a tough job. This can be especially so for foster children.

“The additional funding will mean the three advocacy groups can provide better professional development and support to caregivers.

“The funding will also be used to assist Child, Youth and Family to recruit a further 250 to 500 caregivers a year over the next four years.

“A larger pool of caregivers provides the department with greater choice when looking for a placement for a child and a better opportunity to more actively match the caregiver with the individual needs of the particular child,” said Steve Maharey.
