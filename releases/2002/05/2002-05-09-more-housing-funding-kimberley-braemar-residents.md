Another $20.53 million is to be provided to house Braemar Hospital and Kimberley Centre residents in the community, Housing Minister Mark Gosche and Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.

The funding will allow Housing New Zealand to purchase and modify appropriate community homes for former residents.

The first five houses are expected to be bought by next month for residents moving out of Braemar, with the remainder to be purchased over the next three years, Mr Gosche said.

In October 2001, the government announced initial funding of $2.9 million for these house purchases.

Ms Dyson said the latest funding commitment would ensure that all former residents of Nelson’s Braemar Hospital and Levin’s Kimberley Centre could live in the community.

“Caring for people with disabilities in large institutions is no longer appropriate. The residents of Kimberley and Braemar have the right to live in the community like everyone else, with the necessary support to meet their personal, medical and social needs.”

No residents would leave Kimberley or Braemar until appropriate support was in place, she said.

“We will provide 24-hour care, and a range of specialist services for those who need them. Each resident's personal friendships, gender, skills, age and preferences will be taken into account when deciding where they will live.”

Approximately 375 Kimberley residents will be resettled in the community over the next three years, while 80 Braemar residents will be resettled over a 14-month period. Residents will begin moving into the community in July.
