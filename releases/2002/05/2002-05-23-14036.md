A programme that boosts the skills of teachers of science, mathematics and technology is being extended with $5.1 million of new funding over three years.

The Science, Mathematics and Technology Teacher Fellowships give primary and secondary teachers experience in pure or applied science work in a research organisation, or practical technology experience in a business. The new funding of $1.7 million a year from 2003-04 to 2006-07 extends the programme, which otherwise would have reduced in 2003-04.

"The social, economic and environmental success of New Zealand depends heavily on the sciences, mathematics and technology," said Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson. New Zealand needs young people well taught in these disciplines and the fellowships are an important part of the drive to achieve this.

"Teachers of the sciences, mathematics and technology have a crucial role to play in preparing young minds - to be innovators and researchers, but also to be citizens who understand the value of science and technology. The evidence shows that fellowship teachers return to the classroom rejuvenated and inspired, and pass on the benefit to their students."

There are 48 teachers on fellowships this year and to date a total of 233 from throughout New Zealand have experienced the benefits of a fellowship.
