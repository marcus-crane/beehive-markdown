Auckland region tertiary institutions will received $9.66 million funding for projects to help them respond more effectively to economic growth and social development needs, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey and Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

The funding comes from the Tertiary Education Strategic Change Fund established last year to provide one-off grants for tertiary institutions to adapt to the changing tertiary education system. Public tertiary institutions were invited to submit applications for funding from the Strategic Change Fund and the funds were allocated according to their share of the overall student roll.

The Ministers said that an additional $10 million is provided for in next week’s budget to ensure continuous improvement in future years. A share of this funding will be available to tertiary organisations and others on a contestable basis.

“Auckland needs a more coordinated and coherent tertiary education sector, strongly linked with local industries and the community. The funding announced today supports tertiary institutions in our region to achieve this goal.

“The tertiary education sector has been through a difficult decade of declining public investment and a single-minded focus on student enrolments. The time has long since come to get some strategy back into the system,” Judith Tizard said.

The funding is being used for a number of specific projects:  
\- Auckland College of Education (total allocation: $526,879) will focus on programmes with identified growth potential for under-represented groups. The funding will enable Pasifika Teacher Education and Social Work programmes, which have high participation by Maori and Pacific peoples, to have facilities that encourage participation and provide an appropriate learning environment for students;

\- working together, the University of Auckland and Auckland College of Education will establish an Institute of Education, a vehicle for the two institutions to work collaboratively to achieve excellence in teacher education and research in education. Through the Institute of Education the two institutions will work together to develop joint programmes and reduce duplication of courses;

\- the University of Auckland (total allocation: $5,186,349) will use some funding for its Fale Pasifika buildings to house its new Pacific curriculum and act as an outreach centre for Pacific Island communities;

\- Manukau Institute of Technology (total allocation: $848,554) will establish a Teriary Education Pathways project, supported by local schools, to align programmes and enable students to progress seamlessly into tertiary education;

\- the Auckland University of Technology (total allocation: $1,871,426) is working on a new information management system for its faculties, students and staff with other universities; and

\- Unitec (total allocation: $1,230,826) is establishing high quality environmental science and design laboratories and studios for its Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, the first part of a major capital development to upgrade teaching and research facilities in these fields. In another project, Unitec’s senior students and staff will benefit from the installation of equipment which will allow 24 hour access to computer and research facilities.

Steve Maharey said projects funded by the Strategic Change Fund will support the goals of New Zealand’s first Tertiary Education Strategy, which was released earlier this week.

“These funding decisions demonstrate that the Government is prepared to back the Strategy with significant additional funding,” Steve Maharey said.
