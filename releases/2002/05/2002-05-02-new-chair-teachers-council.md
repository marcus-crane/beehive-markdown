Acting Education Minister Steve Maharey today announced the appointment of Stan Rodger as the chair of the New Zealand Teachers’ Council.

Speaking on behalf of Education Minister Trevor Mallard, who is on official business overseas, Steve Maharey said that the Teachers’ Council is a fairly new organisation and that Stan Rodger has the background and experience to ensure that its establishment years run smoothly.

“Members of the council have strong education backgrounds from the early childhood, primary and secondary sectors – its key stakeholders. The new chair will have the opportunity to knit their concerns and ideas together to form a common view to advance the teaching profession.

“In the last two years Stan Rodger has chaired the Ministerial Kindergarten Teachers’ Pay Parity Working Group and the Ministerial Committee Reviewing the Education Review Office. These were important and complex areas of education policy development. In particular the recommendations from the ERO report have resulted in significant and popular changes to the way schools are reviewed.”
