Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard has put her annual New Zealand music quiz to all Members of Parliament in recognition of New Zealand Music Month which takes place during May 2002.

“Once again, I'll be testing them on their knowledge of the local music scene with a twenty-question New Zealand Music Quiz. This year every MP who returns the quiz by Wednesday 15 May, no matter how many questions they answer, will get an album of New Zealand music just for trying.

“Music industry experts from the New Zealand Music Industry Commission, New Zealand On Air, Creative New Zealand and APRA helped me with a broad range of questions. We’ll also find out about each MP’s favourite New Zealand song.”

The New Zealand Music Industry Commission, set up with funding from the government’s cultural recovery package, coordinates New Zealand Music Month with the support of New Zealand on Air, APRA, RIANZ and the Radio Broadcasters' Association.

"The Music Industry Commission has been doing excellent work for New Zealand music on top of coordinating New Zealand Music Month. In January it led a successful delegation to Midem, the world’s largest music industry expo, and it has recently completed a fantastic Pacific Island Music Handbook that will be of great use to young musicians in developing their careers.

“Meanwhile New Zealand On Air continues to help New Zealand musicians achieve airplay and international attention through its ‘Phase Four’ scheme, and the Radio Broadcasters’ Association’s Code of Accelerated Growth for New Zealand music will see more of our own songs on commercial radio.

“Commercial radio, the b.net radio network, television, record stores and venues have plenty of events planned, so it won’t be hard to be aware of New Zealand music during the month. Last year we had a record seven New Zealand albums reach Number One. It’s an exciting time to be celebrating New Zealand music and everybody benefits from the ongoing effects of the month.”
