Social Services and Employment and Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey officially launched the report of the Review of the Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes this evening.

The function was held at Kokiri Marae in Seaview, a leading training provider in the Hutt Valley.

Training Opportunities and Youth Training are programmes targeted at people with low or no qualifications and, for Training Opportunities, who have histories of unemployment. Approximately 22,000 people will participate in Training Opportunities this year, with 13,000 young trainees participating in Youth Training.

Steve Maharey said the review provided an opportunity to consider the objectives for the programmes, how well they are working, and to identify changes that might improve their responsiveness and effectiveness.

“The review of TOP and youth training was an important opportunity to assess these programmes in the light of the Labour-Alliance Government’s interlinked social and economic development strategies, and the programme of tertiary education and training reforms.

“The Review Team has made a number of recommendations. These reflect three key directions for the future of these initiatives:  
\* that programme delivery should be flexible to meet the changing needs of learners and the labour market;  
\* that programmes should be better integrated within the range of educational opportunities and employment assistance, with better co-ordination between government agencies; and,  
\* that programme outcomes should be better specified to focus on sustainable employment, and/or further education and training.

“I welcome the Team’s recommendations, which Cabinet has now endorsed. The Government is implementing the recommendations progressively and the majority of the recommendations are likely to be in place in 2003.

“The Tertiary Education Strategy, which I released on Tuesday, emphasises the importance of raising foundation skills and supporting foundation education and training initiatives. TOP and youth training programmes are important programmes to help us achieve these goals.

“The government agencies involved in the review have now been directed to work on the development of policy and its implementation in relation to foundation skills, eligibility changes, enhanced delivery, and outcome measurement.

“The Tertiary Education Commission will be tasked with continuing to develop this important element of our social development and post-compulsory education and training initiatives,” said Steve Maharey.
