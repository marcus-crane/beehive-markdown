National's law and order policy is a slap in the face with a wet bus ticket, says Corrections Minister Matt Robson.

"There is nothing new or exciting here. It's the same old tough talk, but when it comes to real solutions, the Nats just can't deliver."

"Under the Sentencing and Parole bill we already have the tools to keep the worst offenders in prison for life if necessary - at the very least seventeen years.

"We also have effective measures to intervene with problem kids as early as possible so that they don't grow up to become tomorrow's criminals.

"We recently announced a new youth offending package for example. This will mean:

- Youth offending teams across the country made up of police, social workers and other professionals
- Day Reporting Centres for first time teen-offenders, before they commit an imprisonable offence
- More funding for school programs and family help projects

"The Nats on the other hand, have failed to present any new ideas on crime prevention.

"The only thing tough about their policy is the headline on their press release," says Matt Robson.
