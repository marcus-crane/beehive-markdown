The Attorney-General Hon Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of the Hon Justice Susan Glazebrook to the Court of Appeal.

Justice Glazebrook has been a Judge of the High Court in Auckland since June 2000.

Margaret Wilson said this High Court experience coupled with Justice Glazebrook's considerable taxation expertise will be a real asset to the bench of the Court of Appeal.

Between 1988 and 2000, Justice Glazebrook was a partner in the law firm, Simpson Grierson and also a part-time lecturer in the Department of Commercial Law at Auckland University. She is a leading specialist in taxation and finance law.

Justice Glazebrook has been a member of a number of committees providing advice to the government and the commercial sector on taxation and public policy matters. In 1991 she was a member of the State Sector Reform steering committee, responsible for the review of the state sector reforms and in particular the State Sector Act and the Public Finance Act.

Justice Glazebrook has published extensively, including co-authorship on two editions of a leading commercial text entitled "The New Zealand Accrual Regime - A Practical Guide".

Justice Glazebrook graduated from Auckland University with a LLB (Honours) degree and MA degree with first class Honours in History. In 1988, she completed her doctorate in French Legal History at Oxford University.

The appointment will take effect shortly.
