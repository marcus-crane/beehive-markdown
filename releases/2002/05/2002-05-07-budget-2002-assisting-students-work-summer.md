Budget 2002 will contain funding to continue supporting tertiary students into work with businesses this coming summer. The SNAP programme which was successfully piloted over the 2001/02 summer holidays is to be refined and run again.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today announced that the programme matching students with business skill shortages, operating through Student Job Search, will receive $484,000 for the 2002/3 summer in Budget 2002.

Jim Anderton sees the programme as helpful to business and students. “This budget announcement confirms the Government’s commitment to small and medium sized business accessing student skills this coming summer. In some cases this programme should result in students having jobs in that enterprise to go to when they graduate.

“Regions and industries up and down New Zealand are facing acute skills shortages. Assisting tertiary students to work in business is one way for companies to train new staff and benefit from the talent of New Zealanders who are studying,” said Jim Anderton.

Steve Maharey said he is keen to promote students having greater opportunities to develop course-related work experience while earning saving for the year ahead.

“This is a win-win package. Students can benefit considerably from taking a summer job related to their field of study. It gives them an introduction to workplace skills and disciplines and a chance to apply practically what they have learned during the year.

“The government has an annual contract with Student Job Search (SJS) for summer employment services worth $2.401m. The additional funding will enable SJS to further enhance their summer job finding services,” said Steve Maharey.

The new spending of $484,000 one off allocation comes from unallocated 2002/03 Vote Industry and Regional Development appropriations.

Funding comes from the $331.875 million set aside by the Government for industry and regional development over a four year period from 2000/01.
