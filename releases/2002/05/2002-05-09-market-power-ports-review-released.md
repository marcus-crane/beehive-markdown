Commerce Minister Paul Swain and Transport Minister Mark Gosche released an independent study into the market power of New Zealand’s seaports today.

The study, initially prompted by concerns most recently raised in the report of the Shipping Industry Review, concludes that “the New Zealand ports industry is generally competitive, and the market power of ports is limited”. However, it also identifies certain instances in which some customers may be ‘captured’ by a particular port.

The Ministers will now give detailed consideration to the study’s findings and recommendations before announcing the Government’s policy response – expected towards the end of August. Interested parties wishing to express their views on the report may send comments to the Ministries of Economic Development and Transport by 10 June.

Charles River Associates, the company that carried out the study, held 25 interviews with industry stakeholders and received 36 submissions as part of the study.

An electronic copy of the report is available from the Ministry of Transport website: www.transport.govt.nz/html/03\_news.shtml
