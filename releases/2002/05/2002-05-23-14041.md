$10.7 million will be spent this year to strengthen prison perimeter security and $24 million over the next three years to bring prisons up to statutory health and safety standards, Corrections Minister Matt Robson said.

"The Corrections Department takes a no-tolerance stance to drug use in New Zealand prisons as part of the government's commitment to building safer communities.

"New perimeter fences at Rimutaka, Hawke's Bay, Wanganui and Invercargill prisons will make it much harder to get illegal drugs onto these sites and will provide a further barrier against escapes."

Matt Robson said the increase in the prison muster over recent years meant maintenance had lagged behind, putting a strain on some prisons.

"The bulk of the maintenance funding will be spent at Wanganui, Auckland, Manawatu and Christchurch Women's prisons. But a considerable amount of upgrading and refurbishment at other institutions will also be possible," said Matt Robson.
