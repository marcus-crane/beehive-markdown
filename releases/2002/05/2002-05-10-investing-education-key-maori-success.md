Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia says the government is continuing its commitment to investing in education for Maori in this year's budget, as well as building in previously allocated funding, which is already resulting in positive change.

Parekura Horomia said Budget 2002 contained new initiatives for Maori education as well as a continuation of programmes under the reducing inequalities programme.

New initiatives in this year's budget for Maori specific education include:

- $366,000 over four years for scholarships to increase Maori speech language therapists
- $225,000 over four years for scholarships to increase the number of sign language interpreters fluent in Maori
- $2.1 million over four years for study awards to enable kura kaupapa Maori teachers and principals to study for teaching qualifications

"Maori education will also benefit from some of the more general initiatives like the $3 million boost to secondary school literacy programmes.

"We have already made a start on our aim to have more Maori children taking part in good early childhood education. We are continuing to build on this in Budget 2002. In particular, government will also take a much more active role in putting early childhood education services in place, especially working in isolated and low income communities. This year's budget has $10 million for this purpose.

"In the 2002-03 year, more than $30 million of this new funding allocated in our previous budgets will be spent on initiatives to boost the educational achievement of Maori.

"For example, there is $3 million available this year for initiatives to increase the supply and quality of Maori teachers including scholarships for trainees. So far more than 200 Maori have taken up scholarships to help them train to be teachers.

"We're entering into partnerships with iwi to improve schooling in their rohe. There will be $2 million in the 2002-03 year to fund iwi partnerships and hope to increase the number in each of the next few years.

"Funding for the suspension reduction initiative continues with more than $1 million each year. In its first year, that had an immediate impact in the 86 secondary schools involved with Maori suspensions dropping from 76 per 1000 in 2000 to 56 per 1000 in 2001.

"Like other areas in the education sector, the government places a strong emphasis on professional development for teachers. In order to improve standards, 10 clusters of schools have been established to develop models of professional development for teachers of Maori students in mainstream schooling. The $2.5 million project is in its final year and we're expecting to be able to use some of the lessons learnt to influence classroom practise throughout the country.

"Budget 2002 reflects the discussions with Maori and the government commitment to Maori people having a greater stake in how improvements in education will happen.

"We have actively gone out to the people to listen and discuss the ways ahead through things like the Hui Taumata Matauranga working with Te Ariki Tumu Te Heuheu Paramount Chief of Tuwharetoa and through partnerships with iwi," Parekura Horomia said.
