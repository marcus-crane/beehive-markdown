On East Timor’s independence, New Zealand formalised its diplomatic relations with East Timor through the establishment of a Consulate-General in Dili, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

The new Consulate-General has replaced the old Office of the New Zealand Representative.

“We look forward to developing normal, friendly relations with East Timor building on the ties we have already established through our peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance since September 1999.

“Over the next four years we will support East Timorese development efforts with the implementation of a $10 million Official Development Assistance programme focussed on basic education, community and natural resource development, and governance capacity building.

“From 1 June, Susannah Gordon will replace Jonathan Austin as New Zealand’s Consul-General in East Timor. Ms Gordon has previously been posted to Ha Noi, and for the past two years has been working on disarmament issues in the International Security and Arms Control Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,” Mr Goff said.
