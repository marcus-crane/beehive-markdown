Tourism Minister Mark Burton congratulated the New Zealand tourism sector for its successful response to the challenges of the post-September 11 global tourism market, when opening the TRENZ trade show at the Auckland Showgrounds this evening.

This year's TRENZ (Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand) is New Zealand's biggest ever tourism business event, with a record 415 exhibitors, and more than 425 international buyers from 36 countries.

Mark Burton told those buyers at this evening's official opening that they would get to see a very optimistic New Zealand tourism industry over the course of the next few days.

"Globally, the tourism sector has faced a challenging period following the terrible events of September 11. New Zealand didn’t escape from the unprecedented disruption and uncertainty that these events presented. However, we rose to the challenge, and by highlighting our competitive advantages – a safe, secure, friendly destination, offering a wonderful combination of outstanding natural environments, adventure, people, and artistic and cultural richness - New Zealand tourism has already rebounded and is back on a strong growth track."

Mark Burton said innovation was a feature of the New Zealand tourism sector.

"There is a record number of exhibiting companies who are making their first appearance at TRENZ this year. Their innovative new products are contributing to the success of the industry."

The Minister congratulated Air New Zealand for announcing a significant increase in its international flight schedule, in particular to Sydney and Los Angeles. "This will be widely welcomed, and is another indication of the buoyant nature of the New Zealand tourism sector."

Mark Burton also congratulated the finalists in the New Zealand Tourism Awards, which were announced this evening.

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy highlights the importance of quality in tourism, and all of the award finalists have demonstrated quality and excellence in their business," Mark Burton said.
