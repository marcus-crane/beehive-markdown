Ten of the 21 recent Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards went to Auckland businesses and entrepreneurs, including the fashion design label DNA Clothing in Poynton Terrace, behind Karangahape Road.

DNA Clothing has been in business for seven years and took part in the inaugural New Zealand Fashion Week last October. DNA combines the fabric design talents of Adrienne Foote with the garment design talents of Doris de Pont.

“I’m delighted that Doris and Adrienne have received this award, which will enable them to undertake market research and strategic planning for the future,” says Judith Tizard, also Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage.

“This award is recognition that fashion is a legitimate business, not just a hobby that people do. The government’s Growing an Innovative New Zealand strategy recognises the importance of the creative industries in contributing to New Zealand’s economic growth. To March 2001, the fashion industry's annual export value was $247 million.

“Doris de Pont tells me that it’s important at crucial stages for those in the creative industries to be able to turn to people with business expertise to help them develop their business further. They have used the New Venture Trust and BIZ – the government’s business development programme - and now Industry New Zealand’s Enterprise Awards.

“Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton said the number and standard of applications for enterprise awards now is much higher than the first rounds, so it’s impressive that DNA Clothing have received this award. The Indian Ink Theatre Company received an award early on in the scheme, and I encourage more businesses in the creative industries to apply."

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project: www.industrynz.govt.nz
