Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today called on all exporters and potential exporters to get hold of a copy of a new publication by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The publication, a "user's handbook" to the Singapore Closer Economic Partnership agreement, is available as a booklet and is also published on the ministry's website: [www.mfat.govt.nz](http://www.mfat.govt.nz).

The Closer Economic Partnership trade agreement between Singapore and New Zealand came into force on January 1 last year.

Mr Sutton said the closer economic partnership agreement committed New Zealand to exploring ways to reduce make it easier and more profitable to do business with Singapore and to encourage two-way investment.

"This guidebook explains what the CEP means in practice. It also describes some of the new opportunities under the CEP and asks feedback on how these could be improved."

He said that in order for the agreement to remain relevant and to help the Government to address problems as they crop up, exporter feedback was very important.

"MFAT can open the door for you by negotiating deals of this nature, but you can help to identify the obstacles cluttering that doorway and tell MFAT when the hinges are starting to squeak."
