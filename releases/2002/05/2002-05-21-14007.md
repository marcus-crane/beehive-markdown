Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the appointment of Simon Murdoch as the new Chief Executive and Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“Mr Murdoch brings the requisite intellectual capability to the role of head of New Zealand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry.

“In the global environment the Ministry has the pivotal task of advancing New Zealand’s interests – a job Mr Murdoch is well suited to undertaking.

“With MFAT and as the former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet he has been an exemplary public servant and diplomat.

“Mr Murdoch has the qualities required for such a position with leadership, management and diplomatic abilities. He is known for his practical and common-sense approach.

“I look forward to working with him and his continuing the good work of departing Secretary Neil Walter,” Mr Goff said.
