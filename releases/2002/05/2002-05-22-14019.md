A new website providing information for New Zealanders who care for family members is part of a wider package of government support for informal carers throughout the country, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Launching the Carers New Zealand website in Wellington, Ms Dyson said one in five New Zealanders are estimated to have caring responsibilities for family members who have a disability, mental illness, chronic condition, age-related illness or are recovering from serious injury.

“Many carers feel isolated, ill-informed and undervalued. This website, funded by the Ministry of Health, will provide a raft of health and disability information that carers need about such things as financial assistance, support services, and how to cope with medical and personal needs. It will also link carers to each other, enabling them to share ideas and experiences throughout the country.”

Ruth Dyson said the website was part of a partnership that had been set up between the Ministry of Health and Carers New Zealand to support carers, in line with the New Zealand Disability Strategy’s objective to ‘value families, whanau and people providing ongoing support’.

She said that the government was also implementing a range of other initiatives to support carers, including:  
·training programmes for carers, including a ‘by Maori for Maori’ programme providing training and access to information and support networks;  
·a review of needs assessment services to ensure that carers’ needs are recognised;  
·a review of government policy regarding families who apply to be paid caregivers for family members; and  
·establishing national networks of carers, including a network for those who provide care for people with high and complex needs.
