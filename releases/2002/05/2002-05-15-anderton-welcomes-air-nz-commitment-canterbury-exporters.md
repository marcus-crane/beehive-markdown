“The reinstatement of an Air New Zealand 767 flying out of Christchurch is excellent news for Canterbury exporters and I welcome Air New Zealand’s commitment to reinstate the service on a trial basis,” said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today.

The 767 aircraft which were used for the Christchurch to Sydney route until late last year are able to transport significantly more cargo to Australia than the 737’s which replaced them.

Air New Zealand has announced resumption of 767 flights from October on a trial basis.

“I have met with Canterbury producers and manufacturers who were clearly disadvantaged by the reduction in freight capacity. Now it is up to Canterbury exporters to use the service and therefore ensure that it continues,” said Jim Anderton.
