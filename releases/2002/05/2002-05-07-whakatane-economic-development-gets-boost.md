Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton and local list MP Margaret Wilson today announced that businesses and residents in Taneatua, near Whakatane, will benefit from a Ministry of Economic Development contribution of $22,500 toward investigating options for sustainably managing the waste products from Bay Processing Ltd.

The funding is a part contribution for a study on the options for future waste disposal from Bay Processing Ltd in Taneatua. Bay Processing is the only significant employer in Taneatua, a small town with extremely high unemployment, and has 40 full time and 120 seasonal workers who process and pack the locally produced asparagus.

“The local economy relies heavily on Bay Processing but if a long term waste management option cannot be found the company is likely to move or close,” said Jim Anderton.

Local list MP Margaret Wilson said, “The people in Whakatane and Taneatua need the opportunity to build local businesses and create jobs. Right now they are trying to improve the economy of the area with one hand tied behind their back and helping the local council to investigate better waste options will make a big difference for local people.”

The funding comes from the Regional Initiatives Fund which is available to help with local projects in acute regions which have local support and which have economic benefits.
