A number of top design entrepreneurs and academics are on a new Design Industry Taskforce announced by Jim Anderton today.

The Taskforce aims to build on New Zealand’s innovative design capabilities.

It was foreshadowed in the Government’s announced Innovation Framework, and will set growth and development goals for the industry.

“The list of Taskforce members includes leaders in the industry who have been selected because of their knowledge and practical experience,” said Jim Anderton.

The members of the Design Industry Taskforce announced today are:  
\* Richard Cutfield - Pencarrow Investments  
\* Mary Davy – Director and Partner, Maxim-Group Limited  
\* Neville Findlay – Designer, Zambesi  
\* Simon Fraser – Professor of Design, Victoria University  
\* Peter Haythornthwaite – Designer, CEO, Creative Lab  
\* Ray Labone – Chairman, Designworks Limited  
\* Jeremy Moon – Managing Director, Icebreaker  
\* Mark Pennington – Director, Formway  
\* Henare Walmsley – Architect/Designer, Tawhiri Architects  
\* Professor Leong Yap – Massey University Design School

“I am pleased we have principals and senior executives of design-focused companies, and leading design houses. The design schools are also represented. They will bring their knowledge of future trends and opportunities, and innovation to the discussion. This will strengthen the use of New Zealand’s creative designers in developing products for the global marketplace.

“We already know that there are some areas of the design industry where New Zealand has the ability to become a world leader. What we need to understand is what conditions have to be created to allow those companies to reach their full potential,” said Jim Anderton.

The Taskforce will meet monthly over six months with a review at the end of that period. During that time it is envisaged that Special Interest Groups will be developed with other associated organisations and experts, to facilitate research and/or action plans for specific industry issues.

The Taskforce is to be co-ordinated, facilitated and supported by the Sector Specialist from Industry New Zealand, responsible to the Minister of Economic Development.

The Innovation framework announced by the Prime Minister in February identified three key industry sectors, ICT, biotechnology and creative industries, as those that the government will focus on to help lift New Zealand’s international competitiveness. The Screen Production Industry and Design Industry Taskforces are part of the work being done in the creative industries sector.
