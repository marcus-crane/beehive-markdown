Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today he was delighted Wayne Brown has agreed to remain on the board of the Maori Television Service for another month.

"On Monday, I received a letter of resignation from Wayne Brown relinquishing his position on the board.

"As Mr Brown has stated in public, his resignation was due to his work commitments, especially as Chair of Auckland District Health Board.

"Since that time he was contacted to ascertain whether he would be prepared to stay on the board for another month to which he has agreed.

"Mr Brown was a government appointee to the board, chosen for his particular governance experience, business acumen and knowledge of broadcasting transmission platforms required to set up a television channel.

"I am pleased that he will continue to be involved with the development of Maori Television.

"Maori Television is an exciting new service that provides the opportunity for Maori perspectives, heritage, culture and languages to be far more accessible than ever before. It will be a vital component of future Maori social and economic development," said Parekura Horomia.
