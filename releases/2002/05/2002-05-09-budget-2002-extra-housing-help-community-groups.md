An extra $11 million will be spent providing more community housing over the next four years, Housing Ministers Mark Gosche and Tariana Turia said today.

Mr Gosche said the extra funding would be used to provide another 50 community houses, and was in addition to the $20 million already allocated for community housing in the next four years.

"These houses are used by groups helping some of the most vulnerable members of our community - including women and children seeking refuge, people with physical or intellectual disabilities, and those with a mental illness.

"Under this government about 280 extra community houses have already been added to the stock. This funding will take the total number of community houses to about 1400.

"Very few private landlords provide community housing. But the move to community based social and health services means we need more community based housing to support the delivery of those services."

Mrs Turia said that the government was also providing approximately $4.5 million a year to community groups who have difficulty meeting normal rent payments.

"These community groups provide valuable services that this government is keen to support. Providing rent relief, and more community houses, are two ways we are doing that."

The $11 million funding includes $10 million in capital funding.
