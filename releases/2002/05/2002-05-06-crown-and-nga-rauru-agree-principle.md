The Nga Rauru Iwi Authority has approved an agreement in principle, which sets out the Crown’s settlement offer for the historical claims of Nga Rauru Kiitahi, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Hon Margaret Wilson said today.

This Agreement in Principle between the Crown and Nga Rauru (of South Taranaki) will be signed on May 16 at Kaipo Marae, Waitotara, she said. Details of the agreement will be released at that time.

The Crown and Nga Rauru negotiators will now work intensively on preparing a draft Deed of Settlement, which will then be put before the people of Nga Rauru for their approval.

“I have been impressed with how well the negotiators have represented the interests of their people during the settlement process,” Margaret Wilson said. “They have challenged the Crown throughout, but by working together we have been able to arrive at this point in a relatively short space of time.”

The mandate of the Nga Rauru Iwi Authority to represent Nga Rauru in negotiations was recognised in April 2000. Terms of Negotiations were signed in October 2000.

Margaret Wilson said the Nga Rauru Iwi Authority approval is a further illustration of Treaty settlement progress in Taranaki and follows last year’s signing of Deeds of Settlement with Ngati Ruanui and Ngati Tama.
