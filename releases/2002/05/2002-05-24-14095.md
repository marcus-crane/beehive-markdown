**Amendment to the Medicines Act 1981: Options**

Previous Decisions on Pharmacy Ownership

1. **noted** that on 13 August 2001 Cabinet:
   
   1.1
   
   agreed to amend the Medicines Act 1981 to include the current section 41 of the Pharmacy Act 1970, which provides that pharmacies must always be under the supervision and control of a pharmacist when open to sell medicines;
   
   1.2
   
   noted that any person, including a person who is not a pharmacist, may currently manufacture medicines, pack medicines or sell medicines by wholesale if they have a licence to do so issued under the Medicines Act 1981;
   
   1.3
   
   noted that the current pharmacy ownership restrictions in the Pharmacy Act 1970 are that:
   
   1.3.1
   
   no individual, apart from a pharmacist, may own a pharmacy, and no individual pharmacist may own more than one pharmacy;
   
   1.3.2
   
   a company may own a pharmacy if at least 75% of the share capital is held by a pharmacist(s), effective control is invested in that pharmacist(s), and no member of the company holds an interest in another pharmacy;
   
   1.4
   
   agreed that the current restrictions on multiple pharmacy ownership not be reinstated in the Medicines Act 1981;
   
   1.5
   
   agreed to repeal the current restrictions on non-pharmacist ownership and amend the Medicines Act 1981 to introduce a licensing regime for pharmacies, which would replace the registration of pharmacies under the Pharmacy Registration Regulations 1972 and create improved powers for controlling pharmacy owners;
   
   1.6
   
   agreed that the licensing regime include a transition pathway to open ownership up;
   
   \[CAB Min (01) 25/12];

**Changes made by POL (with Power to Act) on 22 May 2002 to pharmacy ownership requirements**

1. **agreed** that the licensing regime provide that non-pharmacists be able to own up to 49 per cent of a pharmacy and that, in some circumstances, primary health organisations could own more than 49 per cent;
2. **agreed** to add the following additional criteria to the already agreed licence criteria to be set out in the amendments to the Medicines Act:
   
   3.1
   
   the applicant for a licence to own and operate a pharmacy must be a pharmacist certified as competent to own a pharmacy by the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand;
   
   3.2
   
   the maximum number of licences that can be granted to one owner is five;
3. **agreed** to introduce a mechanism to allow the Minister of Health to permit exemptions to the restrictions on non-pharmacists obtaining licences to own and operate pharmacies, where, in her opinion, health services or access to health services would be enhanced;
4. agreed that the transition pathway referred to in paragraph 1.6 above is no longer necessary;

**Amendments for inclusion in the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Bill**

1. **noted** that amendments to the Medicines Act 1981 concerning pharmacy ownership will be included in the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance (HPCA) Bill;
