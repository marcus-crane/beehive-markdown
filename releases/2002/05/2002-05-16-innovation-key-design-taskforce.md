New Zealand’s top design experts are meeting today to form a Design Taskforce to help shape New Zealand’s future as a country of design excellence.

The Innovation framework announced by the Prime Minister in February this year identified three key industry sectors, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), biotechnology and the Creative Industries (including Design and Screen Industries), as those on which the government will focus to help lift New Zealand’s international competitiveness.

Jim Anderton will today chair the first meeting of the design industry taskforce, one of the four taskforces which is progressing the Government’s innovation strategy.

Jim Anderton said he was looking to the Taskforce to identify the key priority areas for the design industry, and to create a process for continuing Government and industry partnership.

“I am impressed with the calibre of the design industry representatives who are willing to be involved.

“I am looking forward to constructive engagement with this industry.

Jim Anderton will ask the Taskforce to address seven questions:  
·How does a New Zealand based design company build a successful global business?  
·What are the necessary conditions and required steps to achieve global business growth?  
·What should be the extent and nature of Government and other stakeholder involvement in the design industry sector?  
·What is the best methodology to adopt to achieve growth and innovation?  
·What are the skills and talent needs of the design industry?  
·What is New Zealand’s unique value proposition to the world from a design led process?  
·How does the design ethos contribute to leveraging creativity and innovation across sectors?

Industry NZ will provide support and facilitation for the process.
