Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said the Government was concerned  
that the United States has included New Zealand on its 2002 Special 301  
watchlist.

Mr Sutton said the United States action had been taken as a result of  
perception that our parallel importing policy constituted a threat to  
copyright protection, which was not true.

"New Zealand accords the highest importance to the protection of  
intellectual property rights and to adhering to our obligations under the  
WTO-TRIPs Agreement (Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual  
Property Rights). New Zealand's intellectual property rights regime is  
entirely consistent with WTO TRIPs provisions. This includes our  
legislation allowing for parallel importing.

"The government enacted legislation in 1998 (Copyright Act) for sound  
domestic policy reasons, including improved openness, competitiveness of  
the economy, and significant consumer benefits.

"Japan, Singapore and Australia all allow some parallel importing, as do  
the EU and the United States between their own states."

Mr Sutton said the government had undertaken an extensive review of the  
implications of parallel importing which included careful consideration of  
piracy and counterfeiting.

"The government treats the theft of intellectual property seriously. The  
Trade Marks Bill, which is likely to be passed into law later this year,  
introduces new offences and penalties to deter piracy and counterfeiting."

That: makes it an offence (ie a criminal matter) to counterfeit a  
registered trade mark, to falsely apply a registered trademark to goods and  
services, to make copies of a registered trade mark, import or sell  
goods with a falsely applied trade mark; amends the Copyright Act 1994 to  
increase the maximum imprisonment penalty for conviction of piracy from the  
current 3 months to 5 years; introduces the same penalty for counterfeiting  
a trade mark; and introduces monetary penalties for counterfeiting offences  
specified at the same level as currently in the Copyright Act.
