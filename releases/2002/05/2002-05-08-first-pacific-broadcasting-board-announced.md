First Pacific Broadcasting Board Announced

The first board of trustees for the new national Pacific radio network was announced today by Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche and Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs.

The seven-member board will provide strategic direction for the national Pacific radio network, due to begin broadcasting later this year on the FM frequency band (100-108 Mhz). The government is providing almost $7.7 million to establish the network, which will have regional input and be run on a not-for-profit basis.

Leatigagaeono Simativa Iupeli Perese will chair the board. Simativa is a South Auckland barrister with extensive broadcasting experience, including 11 years with Radio New Zealand.

The board members are: journalist Sarona Aiono-Iosefa, IT consultant Sina Moore, broadcaster Fa’amatuainu Tino Pereira, qualified accountants Caren Rangi and Peter Ropati, and strategic business adviser Sifa Tamoepeau.

All have been appointed by the government for four years, based on nominations from Pacific peoples.

“There has been extensive community consultation involved. We are very confident that we have the right mix of people and skills to create a vibrant, successful network,” said the Ministers.

Mr Gosche said the board would be responsible for appointing a radio network provider and for ensuring that the conditions of the network’s trust deed are met.

“Those conditions include helping to maintain and strengthen Pacific languages and promoting Pacific artists, music and culture.

“Today’s announcement is a significant milestone in making the long-held dream of a network a reality. The new network will help Pacific communities organise more effectively as well as strengthening our languages and our culture.”
