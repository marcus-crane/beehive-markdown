Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs has welcomed the Commerce Committee's positive report on Radio New Zealand's financial performance and operations.

"The committee considered RNZ received a good assessment from the Audit Office," Marian Hobbs said.

The committee expressed concern about Radio New Zealand International's "ongoing lack of funding".

Marian Hobbs said she is aware of the problem and is investigating options.

The committee also recommended against the government funding a youth radio network.

Marian Hobbs said no final decision has been made. An advisory group is considering the issue and Ministers will consider their work and other advice in the near future.
