Corrections Minister Matt Robson and Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey have launched Start Over – a new initiative developed by the Department of Corrections and the Ministry of Social Development to help people who have offended into employment.

Offenders are less likely to re-offend if they find and maintain employment when they finish their sentences.

Start Over encourages employers, as members of the community, to employ ex-offenders.

Employers can call 0508 Start Over (0508 782 786) to register vacancies with Work and Income and be linked with suitable Start Over job seekers. Employers could also be eligible for subsidies, grants and additional support from Work and Income.
