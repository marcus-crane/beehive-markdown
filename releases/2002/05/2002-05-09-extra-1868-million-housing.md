Nearly $187 million in extra funding for housing low income people and those at risk was announced by Housing Ministers Mark Gosche and Tariana Turia today.

The funding, part of Budget 2002, consists of:

- $71.99 million for an extra 360 state houses in the next four years;
- A $53.34 million boost to the government's plans to tackle substandard housing in Northland, East Coast and the Eastern Bay of Plenty;
- $29.98 million more for the "Healthy Housing" Programme, to modernise and renovate houses to reduce overcrowding and disease;
- $20.53 million to house former residents of Braemar Hospital and Kimberley Centre; and
- An extra $11 million for community housing used by groups such Women's Refuge and disability service providers.

"These initiatives total $186.84 million. This adds to our significant investment in the previous two Budgets that has seen 1600 extra state houses.

"We have also reinstated low rents for eligible state house tenants, and continued support for those low income earners in private rental housing through the accommodation supplement.

"This government is committed to decent affordable housing for all New Zealanders. This new funding demonstrates that commitment."
