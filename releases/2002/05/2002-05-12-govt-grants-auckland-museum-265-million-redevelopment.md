Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today that the government is contributing $26.5 million over five years towards the development of ‘world class’ facilities at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

Speaking at a function celebrating the museum’s 150th birthday, Helen Clark said the investment was required given the national and international significance of the Auckland Museum’s collections.

The government will provide $5.3 million a year for the next five years towards the redevelopment project. The Auckland Museum will fund the balance of the $52.7 million total project cost.

The grant is to be made under the Regional Museums Policy. The government had previously announced that the funding available for regional museums was to increase from $5 million per year in 2002-3 to $7.5 million per year in 2003-4. Funding available under the Regional Museums Policy will now increase by another $2.8 million to $10.3 million per year from 2003-4.

Helen Clark said the redevelopment will enable the Museum to display, protect and conserve its highly significant collections better. They are currently at risk from ageing storage conditions.

“Auckland Museum’s collections – and in particular its Maori and Pacific collections which are second to none in the world – are part of New Zealand’s heritage and need to be conserved and protected for all New Zealanders to enjoy. The redevelopment project will enable the Museum to house the collection much better.

“It is appropriate that the government make this contribution to the Museum’s redevelopment on behalf of the whole country. The Auckland Museum is a key component in our country’s cultural framework.

“The project will see a new six floor building created, containing exhibition spaces, storage facilities, work areas, education facilities, and other public areas.

“Once completed, the redeveloped Auckland Museum will not only have world class collections, but also have world class facilities. It will be a tremendous asset for the people of Auckland, and for New Zealand as a whole, as well as engaging visitors from around the world.”

Helen Clark said further announcements on funding for regional museums and galleries from the Regional Museums Policy would be made in the upcoming budget.
