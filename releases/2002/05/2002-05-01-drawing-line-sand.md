“The Sentencing and Parole Bills are a line in the sand,” Corrections Minister Matt Robson says.

“Now, if a brutal and heinous crime is committed, the power exists to keep the offender in prison for life, if community safety would be compromised by release.”

The Sentencing and Parole Bills had its final reading this evening in parliament.

The Sentencing Bill increases the minimum sentence from ten years to seventeen years for the most brutal murders. Preventive detention (life means life) will now be available for a wider range of sexual and violent offending.

The Parole Bill introduces a new professional body, the New Zealand Parole Board. For the first time the Parole Boards will have the protection of the community as its overriding consideration.

“Having drawn that line, we now ask New Zealanders for their support for a co-ordinated approach to crime prevention,” says Matt Robson.

“Most people in prison are not the terrible few we see on the 6 0’clock news after a brutal attack: they are the sad many.  
.  
29% of offenders are in prison for property offences, 22% for traffic offences and 20% for other offences including drugs

“This legislation makes a number of changes to community sentences to make them tougher and more effective.

“If a judge does not think a prison sentence appropriate, now he or she has a range of alternative options,” says Matt Robson.
