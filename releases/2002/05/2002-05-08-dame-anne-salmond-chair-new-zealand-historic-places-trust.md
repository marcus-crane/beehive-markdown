Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of Professor Dame Anne Salmond as Chair of the Board of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Dame Anne replaces Dame Catherine Tizard who has served as Chair since January 1997.

“I would like to thank Dame Catherine for her enormous contribution to the Historic Places Trust. The energy, enthusiasm and huge commitment she brought to the role has been very much appreciated,” said Judith Tizard.

“I am delighted Dame Anne has agreed to serve as Chair of the Board. She brings an impressive range of skills and experience to the position.”

Dame Anne has already completed a year as an invited member of the Historic Places Trust Board and has long experience as a board member of Te Papa.

Dame Anne is a highly respected scholar specialising in Maori history and early Maori-European contacts. She is a distinguished Professor in Maori Studies and Social Anthropology at the University of Auckland. Dame Anne brings a strong bi-cultural perspective and understanding to the position, and has broad heritage interests.

The term of appointment is effective from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2005.
