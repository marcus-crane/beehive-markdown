The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations the Hon Margaret Wilson will establish a Ministerial Group to progress central North Island forestry claims.

The government has received a number of proposals from various groups seeking to advance discussions.

The Crown is committed to moving the claims forward.

Many issues need to be resolved before actual settlement negotiations can begin. In order to progress, the Ministerial Group comprising the Ministers of Treaty Negotiations, Maori Affairs, Finance and Regional Development will be convened to discuss these matters.

The group will meet in the next month or so.

It should be noted that the Crown has settled a forestry claim in the Kaipara District and is close to settling two more in the Bay of Plenty.
