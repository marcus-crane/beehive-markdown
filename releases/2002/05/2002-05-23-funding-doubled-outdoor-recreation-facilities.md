Budget 2002 contains the largest increase in funding for outdoor recreation on public conservation land ever agreed to by any government.

Conservation Minister Sandra Lee said the $349 million increase over ten years \[$265 million on the capital budget, $84 million on the operating budget] would effectively double the Department of Conservation's funding for the maintenance of huts, tracks and other facilities.

The money will go to:

- increase DOC's annual operating budget for recreational facilities (including maintenance) in stages until 2012 when it reaches an additional $24 million a year.
- provide an average of $21.2 million a year for annual depreciation (to replace facilities), starting in 2002-03. The Department will receive $3 million cash for replacement in 2002-03, rising to almost $25 million in 2007-08.
- begin paying depreciation, accumulated since DOC's creation, from 2007-08 at a rate of $18 million a year for 15 years, a total of $270 million.

"Many huts are now reaching the end of their useful lives. Past governments often deferred maintenance as a cost-saving measure while other factors, such as more rigorous building standards for the backcountry, have also impacted on costs.

"This government is the first to have taken a long hard look at the long term sustainability of recreational facilities. We have rejected drastic cuts and instead put in place a funding package that allows DOC to more effectively manage the present network," Ms Lee said.

"Since the Labour-Alliance coalition took office in 1999, it has been enhancing access to the backcountry - from the creation of Rakiura National Park to the protection of Crown-managed West Coast native forests.

"Budget 2002 continues and consolidates that record. But not all huts and tracks can be maintained over the longer term, even with a very substantial boost in funding.

"I have invited key stakeholders to work in partnership with DOC in a review of all outdoor facilities, particularly tracks. I also want them to work closely together on the question of what facilities will be maintained in the long term," Ms Lee said.
