Minister of Labour Hon Margaret Wilson and Associate Minister of Labour Hon Laila Harre today released the second report of the Ministerial Advisory Group on the protection of employees' terms and conditions of employment in the event of sale or transfer of business, or where the work of employees is contracted out.

The first report of the Advisory Group was submitted in May last year. Following consideration of this report, the Ministers asked that a smaller group be convened to undertake technical development, assess the likely impacts of several options, and to make recommendations.

This group, which was made up of representatives from Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU) with an independent chairperson, heard submissions from employers, unions and employees in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland.

The Ministers acknowledge the work of the Advisory Group on what is clearly a complex issue.

"This was always going to be a difficult issue to resolve. The Advisory Group has now completed much of the groundwork for the development of policy to find an effective solution. They are to be commended for their efforts."

Despite a lack of consensus between the employer and employee representatives on the Advisory Group, the Government remains committed to working towards a solution, particularly in regard to vulnerable workers in some sectors, the Ministers said.
