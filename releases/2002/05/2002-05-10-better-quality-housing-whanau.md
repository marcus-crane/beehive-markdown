Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Associate Housing Minister Tariana Turia said major new funding initiatives in Budget 2002 will help more whanau into appropriate housing.

The new funding includes:

- Approximately $72 million for about 360 state houses in the next four years,
- A $53.34 million boost to the government's plans to tackle substandard housing in Northland, East Coast and the Eastern Bay of Plenty, and
- Nearly $30 million more for the highly successful "Healthy Housing" Programme in South Auckland.

"Most of the new state houses will be in Auckland where about a quarter of state tenants are Maori.

"Because the previous government sold about 11,500 state houses, many of our people are still having to wait far longer than we believe they should, to get a house.

"By the end of this calendar year we will have added about 1600 houses to the stock since we became government," the ministers said.

The $53.34 million to tackle substandard housing in Northland, East Coast and Eastern Bay of Plenty should see an extra 500 affordable rental homes provided in these areas over the next four years. Housing New Zealand was already planning 100 more houses in these areas, making a total of 600.

"Approximately 300 of the extra houses are expected to be in Northland, 200 in Eastern Bay of Plenty and 100 on the East Coast.

"The latest funding is also expected to generate local economic benefits through increased local employment and trades training opportunities," said Parekura Horomia.

"Our people on low incomes are particularly at risk of infectious diseases, and will therefore benefit from another housing Budget increase - $29.98 million for the Healthy Housing programme.

"The Healthy Housing scheme aims to reduce overcrowding levels in Housing New Zealand houses, with a range of initiatives, including extending existing homes to accommodate large families and modifying homes to improve ventilation and insulation," said Tariana Turia.

Community housing will also be increased as a result of Budget 2002. An extra $11 million will be spent providing more community housing over the next four years to provide another 50 community houses, in addition to the $20 million already allocated for community housing in that period.

"The latest Budget announcements are further evidence of the government's commitment to provide affordable housing to those on low incomes and those at risk.

"Many of our whanau are enjoying the benefits of income-related rents, introduced by this government to ensure that low-income state house tenants pay no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.

"On average we estimate that people have an extra $35 every week as a result, and in areas of Auckland that figure is between $50-$60.

"If our whanau lack secure, affordable housing, their family lives are disrupted. They move house more than they would otherwise. This has an impact on the children's achievement at school, and can start another cycle of disadvantage. Our housing initiatives are helping break that cycle.

"Late last year we opened the first state houses to be built on Maori land in nearly a decade. On the rare occasions the previous government did build state houses, they made those decisions on the basis of profits, not people's needs. Building on Maori land was viewed as uneconomic and therefore ruled out," the ministers said.

Designs of new state houses are being adapted to suit whanau needs. A Maori design guide is being developed by Housing New Zealand. It deals with issues such as having multi-purpose spaces to allow for marae-style sleeping and looking at semi-communal cluster arrangements for up to 30 houses.

"Developing partnerships is a priority for this government. Housing New Zealand is forging closer relationships with community organisations, local government, iwi and other agencies to improve the delivery of social housing," said Tariana Turia.

"We are working to not only improve the number and quantity of existing state houses but also to provide a range of housing solutions to better meet the needs of whanau," the ministers said.
