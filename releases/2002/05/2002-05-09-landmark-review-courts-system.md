The Minister responsible for the Law Commission the Hon Margaret Wilson encourages ordinary New Zealanders to take the opportunity to have a say on how the Courts system can be improved.

The Law Commission has today released the discussion document, “Striking the Balance,” as the first stage of a government-commissioned review of the system.

The discussion document uses plain language to describe how the Courts work, raises issues for consideration and provides a wealth of general background information.

Margaret Wilson says the Courts play a critical role in society but are often perceived as daunting, expensive and alien places catering more to judges and lawyers than to people who need to use the system.

The aim of the review is to ensure the courts provide a fair, timely and efficient way of resolving disputes, without sacrificing essential process.

“The courts are a cornerstone of democracy, so it is important that New Zealanders’ experience of the Courts is the best it could be.”

“I urge people to participate.”

Submissions close on 12 July 2002.

The Law Commission will report its recommendations next year.
