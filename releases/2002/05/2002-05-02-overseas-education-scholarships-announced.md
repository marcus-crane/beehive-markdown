Four secondary teachers are the first recipients of the International Student Programmes Visiting Scholarships scheme, an initiative under the Government’s Export Education Strategy.

The scholarships, administered by the Association of Colleges of Education in New Zealand (ACENZ) have been established to enable teaching, support and management staff to strengthen their ability to cater to international students through targeted placements in countries from which they typically draw international students for enrolment in their institutions.

Those to receive the scholarships are: Gloria McHutchon, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher and host co-ordinator at Blue Mountain College (Tapanui, West Otago); Sharon Van Wyk, ESOL teacher, New Zealand International College (Auckland); Janis Hannah, Director of Overseas Students, Long Bay College (Auckland); Pauline Godber, teacher, Hillmorton High School (Christchurch).

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the scheme will give New Zealand educationalists the opportunity to experience and understand the cultural and educational context their international students come from.

“The knowledge they gain from participating in the scheme will be invaluable not only for their institutions but for others as well to improve the effectiveness and relevance of the educational experience and the quality of pastoral care international students are offered,” he said.

Gloria McHutchon will be using her scholarship to take up a placement in Konohana Gakuin High School in Osaka, Japan. Blue Mountain College has been hosting full-fee paying students from Konohana Gakuin since 1995. She plans to study the teaching methods and learning environment of Konohana Gakuin to establish how school staff can best ease foreign fee-paying students’ transition into New Zealand schools and culture.

Sharon Van Wyk will be undertaking practical research into the curriculum and learning styles found in Vietnamese Schools.

Pauline Godber will be undertaking similar research in Thailand and China. She will also meet parents of students currently in New Zealand to improve her understanding of expectations for the cultural and pastoral care of the students.

Janis Hannah will be observing at a Korean High School and assisting as a teacher aid in English classes.

ACENZ is advertising a second scholarships round over the next month, targeting the tertiary sector.
