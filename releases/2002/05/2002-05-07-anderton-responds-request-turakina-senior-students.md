Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton was welcomed last year on his regional visit to Marton by senior pupils from Turakina Maori Girls College who invited him to return to the school, and talk about opportunities for young Maori women in regional New Zealand.

Jim Anderton is today responding to that request by returning to the school to talk with staff and pupils about sustainable job opportunities.

“What impresses me is that the students told me they think that all New Zealanders need to have economic opportunities.

“They want to talk about how economic development is being addressed in their region and around New Zealand.

“These young people are more aware than many New Zealanders that jobs and opportunities are vital to our future, and I am pleased to return and talk with them,” said Jim Anderton.
