A fall in total international visitor arrivals in April was predicted and underlying growth remains strong, Tourism Minister Mark Burton said.

"Easter, which this year was at the end of March rather than in April, has a major bearing on short-term visitor arrivals, especially from Australia," Mark Burton said.

"While April this year was down by 6 per cent on last April, March had been up by 14.5 percent. The yearly figure – 1.946 million visitors for the year to the end of April, up 5 per cent on the previous April year – gives a better indication of the growth track.

"But it is not all about numbers," Mark Burton said.

"As this week's highly successful TRENZ tourism trade show in Auckland is demonstrating, the tourism sector is enthusiastically developing new products and looking for ways to get visitors to come at different times of the year, to stay longer and to visit different regions.

"The exhibitors at TRENZ are demonstrating that every region of New Zealand can potentially be considered a real tourism region."
