Budget 2002 will recognise that transforming the New Zealand economy requires comprehensive support for New Zealanders’ skills and talent.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced that the Economic Innovation package in Budget 2002 contains funding of $2 million for a new network of regional case managers who will assist businesses that have high growth potential.

“This budget has a range of initiatives to support innovative ideas and businesses and among other initiatives I will be announcing an Economic Progress package.

“As part of this package I am pleased to announce that Industry New Zealand will now be able to roll their sleeves up and work even more closely with innovative small to medium businesses with high grow potential.

“Newly appointed case managers will get alongside companies and identify public and private support to which they need access. This will include assisting innovative New Zealanders to access a range of existing programmes and funds such as industry clusters, the business growth fund or networks.

“ Many innovative small and medium sized businesses have the ideas and potential to become world class companies. But high growth can impose its own stresses on a business. Fast Forward will ensure that businesses with high growth potential can access the resources, networks and expertise necessary to make that leap.

“I am pleased to announce this further adaption of the successful programmes already being run by Industry New Zealand,” said Jim Anderton.

The $2 million is ongoing operating funding which comes from unallocated 2002/03 Vote Industry and Regional Development appropriations.

Funding comes from the $331.875 million set aside by the Government for industry and regional development over a four year period from 2000/01.
