Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia says the increase in primary health care funding provides significant opportunity to improve the health of whanau.

The new primary health care funding announced by Health Minister Annette King in April included:

- An injection of more than $400 million over the next three years, as part of a 3 year package of almost $3 billion for health funding, and
- $50 million will be allocated in 2002-03 to begin implementing the Primary Health Care Strategy with $165 million in 2003-04 and $195 million in 2004-05.

"The government is committed to a system where whanau get affordable access to primary health care.

"The new funding will be targeted firstly to whanau with low-incomes and high health needs.

"To date hospital admissions and utilisation rates of primary health care show that currently primary care fails to deliver for whanau in a way that meets their needs.

"We are also increasing the general medical services subsidy from $32.50 to $35 for all GP services to children under six to adjust for inflation since the subsidy was introduced in 1997 and support free or low cost primary care for these children.

"Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) will be a key mechanism for District Health Boards to meet the needs of their populations. There is an expectation that iwi and Maori communities will be involved in the governance of all PHOs and involved in the planning, operation and evaluation of services.

"As more funding becomes available from 2003-04, it will gradually be applied to extend free or low cost access to primary health care services through PHOs. The priorities will be reducing costs for school-age children followed by the elderly and others with high health needs.

"Improving early access to health care is absolutely crucial if we are to make a real difference to the health of whanau," said Tariana Turia.
