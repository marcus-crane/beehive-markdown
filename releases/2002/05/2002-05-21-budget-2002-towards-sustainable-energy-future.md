Funding of $12.6 million over four years from Budget 2002 will support the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy.

The new funding is the result of a budget bid jointly promoted by Energy Minister Pete Hodgson and the Green Party.

The Strategy has set a national target of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2012. The Government is currently consulting on its preferred renewable energy target under the Strategy, which is a 22% increase (an additional 30 petajoules) in consumer energy from renewable sources by 2012.

“Implementing the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy will deliver a more productive and internationally competitive economy as well as environmental benefits,” said Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

“We waste hundreds of millions of dollars a year through inefficient energy use, while our increasing reliance on fossil fuels causes pollution and contributes to climate change. Moving towards a sustainable energy future is the answer.”

The new funding of $3.15 million a year will be used for initiatives including:  
·industry energy efficiency programmes - relaunching the successful EnergyWise Companies, with a stronger focus on sector initiatives including benchmarking, better practice opportunities and data analysis;  
·enhancing transport programmes - including demand management, promotion of efficient transport networks, vehicles and fuels;  
·enhancing energy supply programmes - including work with the electricity and gas sectors on efficiency improvements and support for renewable energy development.

“The strategy has the potential to deliver about $900 million of net benefits to New Zealand over the next 10 years through cost effective investments in technologies and better energy management. Improving energy efficiency is an investment that pays off many times over.”

Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said she was delighted that the strategy, required by energy efficiency and conservation legislation she introduced to Parliament, will receive more funding.

“After the good work EECA has done helping industry save energy and making homes warmer, drier, healthier and cheaper to heat, I’m really keen to see it move into transport – to help reduce our dependence on cars and encourage use of the cleaner vehicles that are becoming available.”
