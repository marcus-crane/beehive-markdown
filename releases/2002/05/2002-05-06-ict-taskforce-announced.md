A group of New Zealand’s top technology entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and business leaders have been named as members of the Government’s new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Taskforce.

The ICT Taskforce, unveiled today by the Minister for Information Technology and Communications Paul Swain, has been formed to identify ways in which the ICT sector can boost its already substantial contribution to the economy.  
It is one of three taskforces – the others are biotech and creative industries – announced by the Prime Minister Helen Clark in February, as part of the Government’s Innovation Framework.

“We have identified the ICT sector as critical to the growth of New Zealand’s economy,” said Mr Swain, who will co-Chair the taskforce. “In addition, a strong ICT sector is important to enable the growth of other industries,” he said. “We already know that there are some niche areas in the ICT industry where New Zealand has the ability to become a world leader. What we need to understand is what conditions need to be created to allow those companies to reach their full potential.

“Clearly those who are currently running leading edge ICT companies here in New Zealand are in the best position to identify the growth potential of the industry. They are the ones who can apply their commercial experience and understanding of innovation and business growth and their focus on future trends and international opportunities to give the government considered and robust advice.”

The ICT Taskforce has a range of goals including: setting a vision and developing a strategy for the ICT sector; developing a better understanding of NZ’s current ICT capability; identifying possible barriers to growth and the means to address these; identifying international ICT opportunities and trends; developing better focus and branding for the NZ ICT sector; developing a more strategic approach to export growth opportunities and identifying how the sector can contribute to the growth of other industries. The role of government will also be identified.

It will hold a series of concentrated meetings over the next two months and report back to government before the end of July this year. A secretariat, provided by Industry NZ, will support the taskforce in its work. The taskforce’s initial findings will be made available via a web site and input from the wider industry will be sought. An ICT forum may be held later in the year to bring the industry together to formalise the taskforce’s strategy.

Mr Swain said taskforce members were selected on the basis of a strong track record of ICT business development, strong international experience and a focus on export growth together with an appreciation of the business growth path of NZ ICT companies and critical issues in innovation, commercialisation and scaling-up.

“Choosing just eleven members from the scores of successful ICT business people in New Zealand was a difficult task,” said Mr Swain. “However this is just the start. The taskforce is intended to be the catalyst and we will be seeking continued input from the wider industry.”
