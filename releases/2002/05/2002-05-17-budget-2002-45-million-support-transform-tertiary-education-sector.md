A range of specially funded projects to help public tertiary institutions respond more effectively to New Zealand’s economic growth and social development were announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The $35 million funding for these projects comes from the Tertiary Education Strategic Change Fund, established last year to provide one-off grants to assist tertiary education institutions to adapt to the more strategically focused environment in which they must now operate. Public tertiary education institutions were invited to submit applications for funding from the Strategic Change Fund and the funds were allocated according to their share of the overall government tuition funding.

An additional $10 million of strategic development funding, which will be available from 1 July 2003, is provided for in next week’s budget to ensure continuous improvement in future years. The Tertiary Education Commission, once established, will advise on the criteria for the allocation of this funding.

Steve Maharey said many of the broad range of projects focus on hi-tech developments that support innovation and efficiency.

“The government wants to see a more coordinated and coherent tertiary sector, strongly linked with the industries and communities that it serves. This was the goal of New Zealand’s first Tertiary Education Strategy, which I released earlier this week.

“The projects being funded by the Strategic Change Fund will support tertiary institutions to make changes that advance this goal.

“Examples of projects funded from the Strategic Change Fund include:

- *Tertiary Education Pathways*, which will see Manukau Institute of Technology working with school groups in its region on ways to help students progress seamlessly into tertiary education;
- a *Technologist in Residence* scheme at Waikato Institute of Technology to broaden teaching, staff professional development and marketing resources; and
- funding to assist Dunedin College of Education to work with the University of Otago on enhancing teacher education training in the region.

“Following the success of the initial funding round, the government has set aside a further $10 million for a contestable round to occur again in 2003. We are aware that there is a need to address capability levels within the tertiary sector to support continuous improvement.

“I am also announcing today further details on the Collaborating for Efficiency project. The project, for which $500,000 has been provided, will be used to develop collaborative strategies across the sector. I have now called for nominations for the steering group that will guide the study.

"Sharing of library services is likely to be one area canvassed through the study. I’m pleased to note that the Waikato University initiatives being supported through the Strategic Change Fund directly align with the work that will be undertaken through the Collaborating for Efficiency project,” said Steve Maharey.

**Examples of projects receiving funding from the Tertiary Education Strategy Change Fund**

*Tertiary Institution* *Project* *Comment:* **Auckland College of Education**

- Repositioning of Pasifika and Applied Social Sciences to provide additional participation opportunities for under represented groups

**Focus on Pacific peoples' development and success**

Additional capacity for programmes with identified growth potential for under represented groups, particularly Pasifika, will be provided through this capital expenditure programme. It enables Pasifika Teacher Education and Social Work programmes which have high Pacific Nations and Maori participation to have facilities that encourage participation and provide a suitable learning environment for students.

**University of Auckland**

- Fale Pasifika contribution to new buildings

The University of Auckland will run its new 'Pacific curriculum' from this location. There is significant support from the Pacific community for this centre which will act as an outreach for the Pacific Island communities it will serve. **University of Auckland**

- Institute of Education Establishment (SCF funding to the University of Auckland and supported by Auckland College of Education)

**Focus on collaboration**

The Institute of Education is a collaborative arrangement between the University of Auckland and the Auckland College of Education. The Institute will be the vehicle for the two institutions working collaboratively to achieve excellence in teacher education, the disciplines of education generally and research in education. Both TEIs will work together to develop joint programmes and to reduce duplication of courses. One of the initiatives of the Institute is to establish a Pasifika committee to look at initiatives for Pasifika in teacher education and ongoing professional development.

**Manukau Institute of Technology**

- Tertiary Education PathwaysFocus on collaboration and skills for a Knowledge Economy

This project involves MIT working with school groups in the Manukau region so that schools and the polytechnic align their programmes to enable students to progress seamlessly into tertiary education. This project is supported by local school principals and enables the collaborative use of tertiary and school facilities in a spirit of co-operation as school students move into tertiary education during their schooling. **University of Waikato/others re shared library services** SCF funding will be used to support the University of Waikato working in the following three areas: **Focus on collaboration**  

- Collaboration with the Tertiary Alliance libraries (University of Waikato, BOPP, Tairawhiti Polytechnic, Waiariki Institute of Technology, Western Institute of Technology, Waikato Institute of Technology

Focuses on regional efficiencies for library services and enhancing/improving services to students through shared best practice. The library group focuses on improving access to library resources.  

- University Library Collaboration

Involves eight universities investigating ways of working together to maximise efficiencies for university library services and research capability. It aims to bring about greater efficiencies in regard to the total investment in New Zealand university libraries.  

- Shared System Project

This is a subset of the University Library Collaboration project above and involves the joint purchase of library information systems. The expectation is that services will be available to other public Tertiary Education Institutions over time. **Waikato Institute of Technology**

- "Technologist in residence"

**Focus on Connecting with Industry and Innovation - Strengthen knowledge creation and uptake**

"Technologist in Residence" is a Waikato Institute of Technology scheme to broaden teaching, staff professional development and marketing resources through the engagement of high profile technologists at the top of their industrial or artistic field. Waikato Institute of Technology will be engaging the technologists in the promotional and teaching programmes over periods of one or two semesters.

**TOPNZ**

- Open Mind Online

**Focus on E-Learning and Innovation -Strengthening System Capability and Quality**

Open Mind Online improves student access to tertiary programmes through a state of the art web-based delivery facility. The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand plans to make majors within two degree programmes and their associated Diplomas available via this delivery method to students by mid 2003.

**WelTec**

- Employer partnership for technology transfer

**Focus on collaboration, innovation and connecting with industry in a Knowledge Economy**

- This project involves the provision of an incubator at WelTec for the purposes of rapid prototyping of new ideas. Victoria University and Massey University are fully involved in this partnership with WelTec which aims to provide an opportunity for students and advanced manufacturing employers to work together to meet regional economic and employment needs.

**WelTec/Whitireia**

- Regional polytechnic partnership

**Focus on collaboration**

- ·Whitireia Community Polytechnic and WelTec have agreed to work collaboratively to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of polytechnic education provision to the Wellington region. The polytechnic Councils propose to establish a regional forum to explore regional needs.
