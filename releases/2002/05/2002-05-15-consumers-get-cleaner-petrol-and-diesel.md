New Zealanders will have access to higher quality petrol and diesel that is cleaner and more environmentally friendly as a result of changes agreed by the government, Associate Minister of Energy Paul Swain announced today.

¡§Cleaner fuel will help the environment in two ways. It will limit the amount of polluting vehicle emissions, and it will enable New Zealanders to use the newer, cleaner vehicles that are available overseas.

¡§The changes will ensure that the fuel we use suits our vehicle fleet and climate conditions, as well as providing health benefits.¡¨

The decision to amend the fuel quality regulations, called the Petroleum Products Specifications Regulations, follows a comprehensive review that began early last year. The Ministry of Economic Development led the review, with the assistance of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry for the Environment, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Transport. The process involved wide consultation with stakeholders and other interested parties.

¡§In making its decisions, the government balanced a range of considerations, including consumer, industry, health, safety, environmental, and quality issues,¡¨ said Mr Swain.

Timing

The changes will be phased in over the next three and a half years.

¡§While it would be ideal to implement all the improvements at once, the timetable we have chosen is the most realistic,¡¨ said Mr Swain.

¡§Our fuel comes from two major sources, the Marsden Point Oil Refinery and from overseas. The changes we have agreed to, allow sufficient lead time for the Marsden Point Oil Refinery to build the plant required to meet the new specifications. They also take into account the availability of fuel from other refineries in the Asia-Pacific region.

¡§It is essential to the security of our supply of petrol and diesel that we are able to import fuel that meets our standards. Accordingly, in many cases the timing of our specification changes is similar to that of Australia, which is a major regional influence on fuel quality.¡¨

The practice of phasing in fuel regulations to provide refineries with sufficient lead times to update plant and processes was common around the world, said Mr Swain.

Major Changes to Diesel

¡§For diesel, a major change to the quality standards is to reduce allowable sulphur levels progressively,¡¨ said Mr Swain. ¡§Last year, because of the traffic congestion problems in Auckland, the oil companies agreed that they would provide Auckland and Northland with diesel containing an average sulphur level of 1,000 parts per million (ppm). The oil companies have been doing this on a voluntary basis since January, as well as providing the rest of the country with lower than regulated diesel sulphur levels. These lower sulphur levels will now become part of the regulations with immediate effect.

¡§From 2004, maximum sulphur levels will be lowered for all New Zealand to 500 ppm average and from 2006 to 50 ppm. By mid-2005, the government will review the diesel sulphur levels, with a view to implementing a 10 to 15 ppm as soon as possible after 2006 but no later than 2009/10.

¡§Lower sulphur levels will reduce the amount of air pollution from vehicle exhausts, which will have a positive impact on people¡¦s health and the environment. It will also allow New Zealanders to use the newer, cleaner vehicles that are available overseas,¡¨ he said.

It is possible that lowering diesel sulphur levels below 500 ppm in 2004 will bring forward maintenance requirements in some vehicles, especially older, Japanese-imported light-duty vehicles. The government will coordinate a public information campaign at that time to help make consumers aware of any maintenance requirements they might need to take, said Mr Swain.

Another major change to the diesel standards is the introduction of a filterability standard, to help avoid the engine filter-blocking problems experienced last winter.

Major Changes to Petrol

Major changes to the petrol standards include:

„XReducing petrol benzene levels from 4.2% to 3% by 2004 and to 1% by 2006. This change will limit emissions of benzene, a known carcinogen.

„XLowering petrol aromatics limits from a maximum of 48% to an average of 42% immediately for regular grade and in 2006 for premium grade petrol. This change will reduce harmful emissions.

„XAllowing up to 10% ethanol blended into petrol. Ethanol, a renewable energy source, is used internationally as a blending agent for petrol.

„XDisallowing the use of the additive MTBE from March 2003. MTBE can be used to boost petrol octane, but if petrol containing MTBE is spilled or leaks, it can taint the smell and taste of groundwater.

„XRestricting the addition of manganese to petrol as a precautionary measure until research on its health effects is completed. The government will review available research on the addition of manganese to petrol by 2006.

¡§The Petroleum Products Specifications Regulations were first established in 1988 and reflected the nature of New Zealand¡¦s motor fleet and the technologies of the day,¡¨ said Mr Swain. ¡§Individual amendments since that time have removed lead from petrol and limited the aromatics content.

¡§The changes announced today represent the first comprehensive revision of the regulations since they were instituted and bring them up to date with widely accepted international standards. The improved petrol and diesel quality that results from these changes will benefit all New Zealanders through a cleaner, healthier environment,¡¨ said Mr Swain.
