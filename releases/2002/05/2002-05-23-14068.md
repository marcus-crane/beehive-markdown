Health Minister Annette King says increasing the GP General Medical Services subsidy for under-sixes is a positive step along the way to giving children access to free or very low cost primary health care.

Ms King said the government’s first priority in primary health care funding was to target low-income, high health needs New Zealanders, but it also wanted to ensure easier access for children.

“The first step toward achieving this priority will be increasing the General Medical Services subsidy for GP services to children under six to adjust for inflation since the subsidy was introduced in July 1997.

“This increase will apply to all GPs from 1 July 2002, and is expected to cost up to $8 million.”

The increased subsidy was announced as part of the Government’s $400 million new primary health care funding package on March 13.
