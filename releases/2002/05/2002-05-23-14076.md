23 May 2002Speech Notes  
Budget 2002

Mr Speaker,

I am proud of this Coalition Government’s third budget.

I want to congratulate my colleague the Minister of Finance.

This is the budget you get from stable, co-operative Government.

It is the result of hard negotiation inside the Government.

It makes progress for New Zealanders in jobs.

It invests in innovation.

The government is delivering in health.

The Government is delivering in education.

It is delivering for families, and it is delivering for businesses.

It is delivering strong and safe communities.

Two thirds of New Zealanders say New Zealand is on the right track.

New Zealanders believe this Government is headed in the right direction.

And this budget continues in that direction.

You make progress like this in a coalition government by hard negotiation to achieve the best possible policy outcome for New Zealand.

You confront difficult decisions and promote success, not failure.

You do not make progress like this by stamping your feet and flouncing out of parliament.

The progress this budget makes is the result of partnership.

My party colleagues in the Cabinet are proud of this budget.

We have won all that could have been won through argument and persistence.

We have punched above our weight and achieved more than 7.8 per cent of the vote would have suggested.

And there is still better to come.

We have invested in jobs.

And unemployment is lower than it has been since 1988.

The workforce participation rate is higher than it has been since records began.

Which party is against that?

We are investing in health.

An extra $3 billion over four years.

Our priority next year is free doctors visits for school age children and then for superannuitants after that.

This budget delivers the primary health care funding that will make it possible to achieve our goals.

This budget is delivering on our aim of strong and safe communities.

My colleague Sandra Lee is making outstanding and historic gains in local government and conservation.

This budget delivers $349 million over the next ten years in extra funding for visitor facilities.

Sandra Lee has achieved the largest ever funding increase for outdoor recreation on public conservation land.

Her achievement shows that we can deliver development that is kind to our planet and kind to our people.

The regional development implications of this funding are huge and I congratulate her.

My colleague Matt Robson has introduced early intervention policies to turn people away from a life of crime and reduce re-offending.

He recognises that the new prisons he is building are a tragedy, and that we can do much better.

We can protect New Zealanders, and he has pushed for the policies to make our communities safer.

This budget for the first time makes fiscal provision for paid parental leave.

The pressure on families to balance the demands of home and work is one of the most pressing issues of our time.

And in government we have begun to reduce the burden.

Laila Harre has worked hard, with the rest of us, for this policy.

I am committed to expanding our pioneering paid parental leave scheme next year.

This budget introduces funding for policies that will begin to make the difference.

There is still better to come.

I believe we have won the respect of our Labour colleagues.

We have made New Zealand a better place than before we took office.

This budget has put innovation and development at the centre of economic policy.

I am personally proud to be associated with the lowest unemployment rate in New Zealand for 14 years.

I have always said that we cannot have a strong national economy unless we have strong regional economies.

And they are stronger because of the partnership of this government, and because we are working in partnership with the regions.

This week the National Bank quarterly survey of regions again reported growth in all 14 regions.

Nationwide economic activity rose 1.4 percent in the March quarter.

The expansion was evenly spread between the urban and rural regions.

Southland topped the growth figures.

Southland grew by 7.8 per cent.  
The last government abandoned Southland.

They called it a basket case.

The only basket case in Southland is now the leader of the National Party.

The only regional growth the last government achieved was a growing rate of decline.

Nelson / Marlborough grew by 5.1 per cent last year.

That’s what it gets for throwing Nick Smith out of Government.

Manawatu / Wanganui grew by 4.7 per cent.

Northland grew by 4.3 per cent.

Regions, industries and businesses are growing.

This budget demonstrates again why this is the most successful and most popular Government in a generation.

This Government has maintained low interest rates and a stable competitive exchange rate.

We need to maintain those policies to ensure that economic development is not smothered.

This budget commits to our infrastructure.

Our communications and transport networks were neglected by the Opposition when they had the chance.

This Government has bought back the Auckland rail corridor.

We are building roads where they are needed, and investing in public transport.

It is a budget that continues partnership with the community and with business.

It is a balanced budget.

It balances the present and the demands of the future in new and innovative ways.

I believe we are among the most creative and talented countries in the world.

And we are confidently investing in the creativity and talent of New Zealanders.

Earlier this year I co-chaired the Innovation event in Christchurch.

At the event we had a school competition called the ‘game’ in which teams of high school pupils competed to develop and market a project.

The judges were astounded at the level of ingenuity of the students.

They were so successful that one of the winning teams sold a land yacht to one of the conference organisers.

This is the talent we have to believe in, invest in and foster.

This week Steve Maharey and I announced a Polytechnic Regional Development Fund.

It will ensure that polytechnics in the regions play their part in fostering skill in their regions in partnership with their communities.

We are investing in young talent with $1.7 million for enterprise in education programmes.

These will encourage young people to learn about business and develop innovative business ideas.

Our economy cannot deliver the incomes, the education and the health we want unless our productivity grows rapidly.

Productivity improvements will come from better use of the talents, energies and resources of New Zealanders.

That is why we are investing in talent.

That is why we are unleashing the energy of New Zealanders.

We want a job-rich, high-skill, high value economy and we are on the way.

We are transforming the industrial base of the economy in partnership with regions, businesses and communities.

Innovation is at the heart of Budget 2002 and the Coalition Government’s economic programme.

We must mobilise our resources more effectively to promote sustainable growth.

Industry and regional development measures in the budget come to well over $35 million, and make an important contribution to that framework.

Creative industries in New Zealand have demonstrated the level of growth we need nationally in order to lift our standard of living across the board.

The budget has a strong focus on partnership between the public and private sectors.

Already there has been success from working with wood processing, boat-building and manufacturing.

We are working with ICT, biotechnology and creative industry sectors.

We are removing the barriers to growth.

The Screen industry taskforce met for the first time this week.

It has set goals of having ten companies with revenues greater than $50 million and an additional twenty companies earning over $10 million a year, resulting in a doubling of this sector over the next five years.

There will be increased collaboration between Crown Research Institutes and the private sector.

There will be additional support for cluster development.

We are working with businesses, industries, local authorities, iwi, and communities.

This budget continues the ‘whole-of government’ approach.

Ministers and their agencies are working closely together to ensure government co-ordinates its activities.

Whole of government is smart effective government.

Here is an example of how agencies work together:

Industry and regional development funding has contributed to budget initiatives in Research, Science and Technology; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Work and Income; Education; Tourism and Te Puni Kokiri.

Industry New Zealand, Technology New Zealand and Trade New Zealand will be working together to create a one-stop shop for businesses seeking assistance.

This budget supports the development of a world-class investment promotion agency.

It will boost the level of new major investment from both offshore and within New Zealand.

There will be a programme to support high-speed internet access to the regions.

This is every bit as important as the development of road and rail networks was a hundred years ago.

Tomorrow I will be meeting with regional economic development agencies to outline the budget initiatives which are particularly relevant to regional New Zealand in greater detail.

The economic innovation measures in this Budget will continue the economic development advances this Government has started.

If we want free health, free education, and all the other essentials of a modern nation, then we need to increase the size of our economy.

We need to create lasting, sustainable growth.

And we need to make a priority of harnessing the gains to ensure all New Zealanders participate in the prosperity delivered.

This government is on the path to delivering gains for all New Zealanders.

This budget poses questions for the opposition.

Two thirds of New Zealanders support the direction of this country.

And the Opposition wants to change that direction.

The Opposition has exhausted its credibility on economic policy.

Before the last election, the Opposition claimed that a Clark Anderton coalition would never be able to deliver fiscal surpluses.

They were wrong.

They say they can spend a billion dollars on buying a fleet of fighter jets, a billion dollars on buying laptops for every school child, a billion dollars on new roads, and a billion dollars on tax cuts for the most affluent earners.

And they say they can do it all at once.

They are still wrong.

They said the regions of New Zealand were finished and told people to leave.

They were wrong.

They said mass unemployment was inevitable.

They were wrong.

They said we couldn’t afford high quality public health care and education.

They were wrong.

The Opposition is wallowing in negativity.

All they ever do is criticise.

The New Zealand Retail magazine gave the Government an open letter in a recent magazine.

The editorial asked politicians to avoid weakening business confidence to make political points.

“… fight the battles that count. At the election we will be looking for people who can run an entire country. If you harp on about furniture and coffee machines we’ll think you aspire to run a small office.”

That is the limit of the ambition of the Opposition.

They aspire to make New Zealand a small branch office.

This Government is ambitious for New Zealand.

I am ambitious for New Zealanders, for all our people.

I am proud of the ambition of this budget and the rich achievements of the Clark-Anderton coalition.

And I commend it to this House.
