Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today that Budget 2002 would off-set drops in Lottery Grants Board funding to Creative New Zealand, the Arts Foundation, the Film Commission, the Film Archive and Sport and Recreation New Zealand \[formerly the Hillary Commission].

The government was aware of the downstream effects on these organisations of the decline in lottery profits and has provided compensation for them for the 2002-03 year in the budget, Dr Cullen said.

Creative New Zealand and the Arts Foundation will receive a little over $2 million between them; the Film Commission $857,000 and the Film Archive, $63,000.

Sport and Recreation New Zealand will get another $3 million.
