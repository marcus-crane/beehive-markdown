Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey says that the new Forestry Centre of Excellence for education and training is a clear demonstration of the commitment of the Government to a better-connected tertiary education system.

"This is about the tertiary education sector working as a partner with industry, and working to anticipate and respond to emerging skills needs.

"The new Centre is not only consistent with the Tertiary Education Strategy, which I will release next week - it is a signal example of what that Strategy is all about.

"I am particularly pleased that the Centre links key tertiary institutions with an ITO - this kind of vertical integration within the post-compulsory education and training sector is something that we will see much more of.

"I was pleased to lend my support to this when the proposal was first raised with me. The Deputy Prime Minister and Industry NZ are to be congratulated,” Steve Maharey said.

The government's Tertiary Education Strategy which outlines the strategic direction for the whole post-school education and identify priorities for the next five years will be launched on Tuesday (14 May).
