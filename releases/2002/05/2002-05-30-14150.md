Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today paid tribute to retiring New Zealand Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission, Hon Jim McLay.

"He has undertaken with distinction the global advocacy of New Zealand's conservation approach to whaling during his nine years as our IWC Commissioner," Ms Lee said.

"When he has spoken out against commercial whaling in all its various forms at international forums, there has never been any doubt that he speaks for nearly every New Zealander."

Ms Lee said while New Zealand and other like-minded nations held the line against recent attempts by pro-whaling nations to secure IWC approval for the re-introduction of some form of commercial whaling, Mr McLay's successor would be hard-pressed to fill the shoes of "this conservation statesman for the great whales".
