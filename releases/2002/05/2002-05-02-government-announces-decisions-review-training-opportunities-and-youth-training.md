Social Services and Employment and Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey has released the Government's decisions arising out of the Review of the Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes.

Training Opportunities and Youth Training are programmes targeted at people with low or no qualifications and, for Training Opportunities, who have histories of unemployment. Approximately 22,000 people will participate in Training Opportunities this year, with 13,000 young trainees participating in Youth Training.

"This Review provided an opportunity to consider the objectives for these programmes, how well they are working, and explore changes that might improve their responsiveness and effectiveness. The Review took place against the backdrop of the Government's interlinked social and economic development strategies, and the programme of tertiary education and training reforms.

"The Review Team has made a number of recommendations. These reflect three key directions for the future of these initiatives:

- that programme delivery should be flexible to meet the changing needs of learners and the labour market;
- that programmes should be better integrated within the range of educational opportunities and employment assistance, with better coordination between government agencies; and,
- that programme outcomes should be better specified to focus on sustainable employment, and/or further education and training.

"I want to make particular mention of the contribution that providers of Training Opportunities and Youth Training make. The Review team was very impressed with provider dedication and commitment to meeting the needs of disadvantaged learners.

"I welcome the Team's recommendations, and Cabinet has this week endorsed the Team's directions and decided to move swiftly to implement the changes necessary to achieve the flexibility, integration, and focus on outcomes.

"The Review Team has done a superb job - and I thank Sally Munro, Tina Ratana, Liz Tanielu, Ngapo Wehi, Geoff Woolford, and officials from the Department of Labour, the ministries of Social Development and Education, and Skill New Zealand for the work that they have done.

"The Government's Tertiary Education Strategy, which I will release shortly, emphasises the importance of raising foundation skills and supporting foundation education and training initiatives. The Tertiary Education Commission will be tasked with continuing to develop this important element of our social development and post-compulsory education and training initiatives," said Steve Maharey.

The full review report will be available from 16 May from Skill New Zealand and the Ministry of Education.
