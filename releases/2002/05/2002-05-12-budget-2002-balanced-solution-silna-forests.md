The government will seek to protect key blocks of Maori-owned native forest in the South Island for conservation, under a Budget 2002 policy announced today by Forestry Minister Pete Hodgson.

The policy concerns native forests, mostly in Southland, allocated to Maori under the South Island Landless Natives Act 1906. They are currently exempt from Forests Act requirements for sustainable forest management and a ban on exports of native timber logs and woodchips.

The government is providing $19.7 million over seven years to fund the new policy. Of this, $16.1 million will be available to the Nature Heritage Fund for negotiated conservation settlements on SILNA forest blocks that are considered priorities for protection from logging.

For SILNA owners wishing to log their forests, assistance will be available to develop sustainable forest management plans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will meet reasonable costs for owners to secure the necessary expert advice.

Funding to the Ministry for the Environment will enable the provision of better support and advice for councils on the application of the Resource Management Act to forests on SILNA land.

The voluntary moratorium on logging begun in 1999, which provides a payment in exchange for forest protection, will be extended for three years to March 2005. This will allow time for SILNA owners to consider the options for the future of their forests.

Legislation will remove the exemption of SILNA forests from indigenous timber export controls. The exemption from the Forests Act sustainability requirements will remain, for the domestic market, except for those choosing to comply with the Act.

“This policy balances the need to protect some prime areas of native forest with a recognition of the history of the SILNA issue,” Mr Hodgson said. “The government looks forward to productive negotiations with SILNA owners now that a framework for the future has been established.”
