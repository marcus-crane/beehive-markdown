Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey will lead New Zealand's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in New York which opens on Wednesday, 8 May 2002.

The three-day Special Session on Children was orginally scheduled to take place in New York last September, but was postponed following the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Steve Maharey said the New Zealand delegation will include the young people selected to attend the Special Session last year - eighteen-year old Te Kerei Moka from Christchurch and thirteen-year old Jessica Dewan from Auckland. Other members are the Commissioner for Children, Roger McClay, Anne Hartley, Ministry of Social Development Manager of Child and Family Policy and Maraea Bellamy, Te Puni Kokiri Health, Welfare, Housing and Justice Manager. Trish Grant from the office of the Commissioner of Children will accompany and advise Te Kerei and Jessica.

"Te Kerei and Jessica stood out for their contributions to their communities and their commitment to improving the circumstances of those around them. They are both exceptional young people who I am certain will make New Zealanders proud when they contribute to this important forum on the rights of children.

"As well as participating in the main session, Te Kerei and Jessica will also take part in a Children's Forum aimed at celebrating children's rights and to identify ways to influence leaders on programmes designed to benefit children.

"The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children on 8-10 May is a follow-up to the 1990 World Summit for Children where the 10 year Action Plan for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children was agreed. The Special Session will focus on a renewed commitment and pledge for specific actions for the coming decade," Steve Maharey said.

Jessica and Te Kerei's attendance at the Special Session has been supported by a range of government agencies and their trip to New York has been funded by Save the Children NZ and Te Puni Kokiri.. The New Zealand delegation departs New Zealand on Friday afternoon.

Prior to his arrival in New York on May 7, Steve Maharey is visiting Ottawa for a series of meetings with social policy and tertiary education experts. He returns to New Zealand on May 13.
