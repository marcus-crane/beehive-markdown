The Budget will increase the funding available to television broadcasting in New Zealand by a total of $18 million (GST inclusive) per annum, Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

TVNZ will receive $12 million a year to meet costs associated with implementing the new charter.

"The Charter will help bring about a significantly improved public television service," Marian Hobbs said. "It will be a service that looks beyond purely commercial objectives and acknowledges the cultural and civic importance of public television."

Marian Hobbs also announced an increase of $6 million a year to NZ On Air, the Crown agency charged with allocating public funding to support New Zealand broadcasting. This will bring government funding of NZ On Air to a total of $97.121 million per annum. The agency received $93.621 million in the current financial year, incorporating a one-off $2.5 million allocation. It spent $62.7 million on television.

"The support made available through NZ On Air is essential in ensuring we have local content television," Marian Hobbs said. "The extra $6 million means that developments in this area will be maintained."

Marian Hobbs said that TVNZ would continue to be eligible to apply for NZ On Air funding.

"The government can be seen to be providing 'double strength' support to our state television broadcaster in its enhanced role," she said.

"The future of public television in new Zealand is very much brighter than was the case two and a half years ago."
