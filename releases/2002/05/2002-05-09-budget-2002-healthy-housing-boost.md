The government's "Healthy Housing" programme, aimed at reducing the spread of infectious illnesses such as meningococcal disease, is to receive nearly $30 million more over the next four years.

Housing Ministers Mark Gosche and Tariana Turia said that the $33 million already earmarked for the programme meant total spending over the next four years would be nearly $63 million.

The Healthy Housing scheme aims to reduce overcrowding levels in Housing New Zealand houses, and the subsequent spread of diseases, with a range of initiatives including extending existing homes to accommodate large families and modifying homes to improve ventilation and insulation. Housing New Zealand works in partnership with Counties Manukau and Auckland District Health Boards to also provide health support and information as part of the programme, said Mr Gosche.

"The new $29.98 million in funding will allow the programme to be expanded in those parts of Auckland where it is currently operating - Mangere, Otara and Onehunga. In addition it will be extended to other high-risk areas, including Glen Innes and Manurewa.

"This new funding nearly doubles the amount of money available for healthy housing, and could mean another 1350 families benefit."

Mrs Turia said infectious diseases were the cause of six per cent of all deaths and 11 per cent of all hospital admissions in the last decade.

"Children under five made up 30 per cent of admissions for infectious diseases. Overcrowded houses can act as incubators for infectious diseases such as meningococcal, tuberculosis and rheumatic fever, undermining efforts to reduce their spread.

"The government recently announced more than $100 million for a meningococcal vaccine. This increase for healthy housing complements those efforts to end this deadly epidemic."

The new funding consists of $29.5 million in capital funding and $480,000 in operating funding.
