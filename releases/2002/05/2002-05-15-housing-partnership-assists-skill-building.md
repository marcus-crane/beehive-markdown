Housing partnership assists skill building

Construction of a $5.4 million Housing New Zealand development for older people and those with disabilities in Auckland got underway today with Housing Minister Mark Gosche digging the first foundations.

The 38-unit complex in Ranui is being built in partnership with the Waipareira Trust, a provider of community, residential and training opportunities for unemployed youth in West Auckland.

“This is the first collaboration between HNZC and Waipareira Trust and will give 11 unemployed young people hands-on experience in residential construction and landscaping”, said Mr Gosche.

“This development is part of a wider government strategy to provide rental housing for low-income New Zealanders in areas of high demand, particularly in Auckland. By the end of this year we expect to have added 1600 state houses to the national stock.”

The 38 units are specifically designed for older people and those with physical disabilities. Each unit will include two bedrooms, open plan style living and decks.

The development will also have a communal village green, outdoor seating, covered off-street parking, security lighting, landscaping and perimeter fencing.

Mr Gosche said residents would be close to amenities such as a supermarket, public transport, the Ranui Shopping Centre, Larnoch Shopping Centre and Lincoln Mall.

The development is due for completion in November this year.
