Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia say that solid progress has been made on whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori community development.

"Over the last two years the government has been committed to a programme to accelerate Maori social and economic development.

"This included increasing the skill and capacity within whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities and improving the way government work with them to create development opportunities.

"This year, to build from that foundation Maori Development Worker positions within hapu, iwi and Maori communities have been created to further enhance flax roots development," said the Ministers.

Maori Development Workers will:

- work intensively in communities on development activities owned and initiated by Maori communities,
- be highly accountable to their communities,
- be drawn from and located within their communities of interest,
- be supported and resourced under a relationship of shared development vision and commitment between Te Puni Kokiri and Maori communities, and,
- contribute to more effective relationships between agencies and Maori communities

Maori development funding over the last two years has included, the Maori Business Facilitation Service, Capacity Building, local level solutions and initiatives across the government sector working with Maori communities.

*The Maori Business Facilitation Service* was established in 2000 to connect those wanting to develop sustainable quality businesses, or expand their current operations, with mentors who were able to provide expertise, support and guidance. There have been 2317 registrations of interest and 310 businesses established to date.

*Capacity Building* established in 2000 focused on developing and maintaining the breadth and depth of skills available within Maori communities. In the last 18 months there has been 1897 applications and $17.1 million has been provided to successful applicants.

*Local level solutions* are innovative self-identified solutions developed locally, by whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities and implemented to meet their own development priorities.

"These programmes are continuing this year with $12.284 million for Capacity Building in 2002-03 and $11.494 million in 2003-04, $5.901 for Local Level Solutions in 2002-03 and $8.985 million in 2003-04, and $2.813 million for Maori Business Facilitation Service for 2002-03 and 2003-04.

"Initiatives like these, along with the ongoing commitment to improve the focus and direction of Te Puni Kokiri, will assist in the acceleration of Maori development.

"Te Mangai Paho is to be provided with additional operating funding of $309,000 per anum in 2002-03 and 2003-04, to employ additional staff to assess the high number of funding bids received, due to the significant increase in Maori broadcasting funds.

"Ensuring that high quality, entertaining and informative programmes are funded is a priority, which will ensure the audience of Maori broadcasting services will benefit," said Parekura Horomia.

"Whanau is at the core of tangata whenua social structures, where the untapped potential for dynamic positive development and change will be found. Therefore we, as a government, have continually focused on initiatives that will assist in strengthening whanau," said Tariana Turia.

"Hapu, iwi and Maori communities are unlocking that dynamic whanau potential. Government will continue to support Maori development funding and work with them to unlock that door now and for future generations," said Parekura Horomia.

"The initiatives we have supported since becoming government have demonstrated that we will give whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities a hand up," the ministers said.

***Examples of Maori Business Facilitations Service (MBFS)***

**Vanessa Miller's DIVA DESIGNS, Manukau, Auckland**  
Website: [www.divadesigns.co.nz](http://www.divadesigns.co.nz/)

This business is to manufacture and sell clothing. The client came to the notice of MBFS on 24 May 2001. The service was explained and a completed client registration was forwarded to the Accredited Business Mentor (ABM) at Enterprising Manukau on 25 May 2001.

Two meetings to scope and define the business proposition were held. Following this a project plan was implemented and completed. Two feedback meetings between the client and the ABM were held during this phase.

The client completed a business plan on 31 October 2001. Again two client/ABM meetings took place, providing detail and resulting in the production of the business plan.

Business start-up was recorded on 05 February 2002. A further ABM/client meeting was held to discuss progress and provide further referral.

In general, the MBFS service provided focus, information, advice, mentoring and coaching. The client was also provided with some specialised financial analysis and advice. Assistance was provided to secure finance, which was achieved through a 'whanau' trust.

Following start-up, the client and her business exhibited at the 'Girls Day Out' held at the Epsom Showgrounds in Auckland. This was a success with much positive feedback and over 1000 physical enquiries including sales opportunities.

Diva Designs offers both a product and a service. The product is a clothing range for women and teen female sizes 16 - 24. The service is about business opportunities for direct sellers. Diva clothing will be marketed through direct selling. The product will only be available through Diva consultants, and not retail outlets.

This business has given the client an opportunity to secure income and spend time with her young pre-school child. The client also has an increased 'skill set' and a wider range of business networks that provide support as well as opportunity. Being a past employee of a well-known cosmetics company she is now in control of her own business.

Planning from the 'ground-up' will help to ensure sustainability. The client is motivated and has a passion for her business. This passion stems not from the business for the business's sake, but from the personal self and the belief that she is offering a product and service for a particular market niche. This client empathises with her target market (i.e. female sizes 16-24) seeking good quality fashionably garments.

**Ulva's Guided Walks, Stewart Island**  
Email: info@ulva.co.nz,  
Website: [www.ulva.co.nz](http://www.ulva.co.nz/)

Ulva Amos is a direct descendant of the first peoples of this beautiful island which is named after her. Her guided walks take place in and around Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island as well as Ulva Island, which is a unique predator-free open sanctuary in Paterson Inlet with beautiful native rainforest. Visitors are guided by Ulva Amos, the owner and local Maori eco-tourism guide. The majority of clients on Ulva's Guided Walks are overseas visitors and groups can number up to 50 per tour.

Ulva came to MBFS from a Biz Info referral. MBFS has assisted Ulva develop her idea through the business continuum from Project Plan phase, through Business Plan phase to start up and currently assistance with post-start up. Assistance and advice has been specifically helpful for Ulva in the Business Plan phase with financial, tax obligations, advice and information to develop her knowledge in the business environment. Other assistance provided was changing her balance date as well as how to manage the large tour groups as the walking tracks are narrow she was aware that not all the groups could hear her commentary, particularly those at the rear. In discussions with ABM, herself and AM it was suggested that a simple radio transmitter device, with transmitters and earphones attached for each client would enable them all to hear the commentary and still listen to the birds. The ABM has made enquiries regarding costs.

Clients comments: "The help from both the TPK account manager and mentor has been amazing; you think you might do it (the business) by yourself, but it is all the little things you didn't think of. The behind the scene things you have to work on. Both the account manager and mentor made it easier and my questions were always answered and resolved quickly. They came up with really good idea's to help me. MBFS helped me implement changes really well. It's like a one stop shop".

***Examples of Capacity Building***

**Pounamunui Marae (Houmaitawhiti Marae Komiti)**

* * *

The komiti marae of Pounamunui Marae identified a shortage within its ranks in many areas of the core functions of the Marae and identified a generation that no longer had an association or direct relationship with Houmaitawhiti. This initiative was the first real opportunity for Ngati Hinekura, Rongomai, Hinekiri and Hinerangi to take stock of their capacity. Their main objectives were to:

- locate all their marae affiliates, make contact and identify the whanau members,
- identify the human resource base of their marae, and
- initiate a hui to set guidelines for development.

The roopu wanted to open the lines of communication and encourage marae affiliates to re-affirm their whakapapa linkages as many now live away from the marae, scattered across the country and the world. To achieve these objectives the roopu held a hui targeting the wider whanau, including fun activities for tamariki.

A hui of this nature stood to benefit the families of Ngati Hinekura, Rongomai, Hinekiri and Hinerangi who support Houmaitawhiti by building and strengthening the relationships between whanau, hapu and Marae.

**Te Moni Whanau Trust**

* * *

This roopu sought funding to research and learn their whakapapa, moteatea, tikanga and kawa o te marae o Pikirangi and Ngati Uenuku Kopako. They chose to run a series of wananga as the appropriate way to strengthen their whanaungatanga and on-going retention of knowledge and traditions through to future generations.

The three wananga to date have been very successful, with active participation and interaction in discussions and waiata. Whanau have travelled from Wellington, Palmerston North, Hamilton, Auckland and Rotorua to learn more about their turangawaewae, their tupuna, their marae and themselves. Young and old have attended these hui. For some, the wananga sessions have brought back links and memories of the past and for others it has been an opportunity to link names and photographs of tupuna and whanaunga to themselves. Many are keen to learn more about their tupuna and their roles and responsibilities on the marae.

The increase in knowledge of tikanga, kawa and whakapapa of their marae enables a more active role in marae life and the future sustainability of Ngati Uenuku Kopako.

***Local Level Solutions***

**The Waiapu Work Trust**  
Waiapu Work Trust was established in 1987 as a Charitable Trust based near Tikitiki, on the East Coast of the North Island. It was created as a result of the corporatisation of New Zealand's Forestry Service, when 30 redundant forestry workers living in or around Tikitiki came together to create the Trust and donated $1,000 each to begin operations.

The core business of the Trust is the provision of employment opportunities for Maori from the East Coast, the income of which is based on silviculture and farm contracting with local iwi and farming communities. Work is the focus for reading and writing and healthier life styles.

What is exciting about the Trust who, while based in Rangitukia, draw their membership from Hicks Bay to Tokomaru Bay, is their single minded determination to support the whanau and communities of their members. They suggest that the profits they accumulate are not measured in dollars, but can be measured by the changes in the  
attitudes and self esteem of people, who have largely been ignored by the 'system'.

The Trust is one of the best examples of a "bottom up" solution to longstanding social and economic issues that have plagued the East Coast and its people since the 1980's.

Waiapu Work Trust will receive approximately $1.455 million over three years 2001-02 to 2003-04.
