Today we put in place another piece of the jigsaw that is the government’s intelligent strategy to make our communities safer, Corrections Minister Matt Robson said today at the launch of a new initiative to help released inmates into employment and reduce the likelihood of re-offending.

“Start Over places priority on helping people recently released from prison to find employment. The scheme presents an opportunity for community-spirited employers to make a real contribution by helping reduce re-offending – which means less crime and less victims of crime, says Matt Robson.

“Studies carried out by the Correctional Service in Canada show that typically two thirds of inmates experienced difficulty in obtaining work in the first six months of release. Furthermore, looking at the relationship between obtaining employment in the first six months and re-offending, the study shows that offenders who were employed were convicted at less than half the rate of unemployed offenders, and committed only one quarter as many new violent offences as unemployed offenders.

“These figures are a wake up call. They reinforce what we know instinctively – offenders released from prison who get the chance of a fulfilling, regular job are much more likely to turn their lives around and become decent citizens.

“The Sentencing and Parole legislation passed this week is one piece. Our new youth offending strategy is another piece. Our regional prisons policy is another. Our early intervention policy is yet another.

“Once the pieces are together we have for the first time a coherent strategy that promotes community safety: that links what judges do in our courts, what professionals do in our prisons, with what teachers do in the classroom and what parents do in the home.

“Today, we add employers as another link in that chain, says Matt Robson.
