Prime Minister Helen Clark and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced budget measures aimed at continuing the government’s programme of working with Maori to promote economic and social development.

Helen Clark and Parekura Horomia said the government’s focus on capacity building and opportunity had seen many initiatives in Maoridom across the health, education, housing, employment and business facilitation areas.

"Budget 2002 continues the process of funding capacity building in Maori communities so that their organisations can raise the aspirations and living standards of their people," the ministers said.

"Building the skills and talents of all groups in New Zealand is critical to efforts to creating a more knowledge-based and innovative society. Social inclusion and cohesion are also key themes for this government.

"The package we are announcing today covers initiatives such as improved support for education and training providers, Kura Kaupapa Maori teacher study awards, increased funding for Maori language speech therapists, measures to address substandard housing, and measures to better manage the growth of Maori broadcasting.

"The benefits to Maori from recent government announcements on primary health care are also being set out.

"We believe that one size fits all policies have failed New Zealand, and that is why the government is tailoring policies to meet the needs of our distinctive communities.

"Today’s announcements reflect the government’s commitment to that goal," Helen Clark and Parekura Horomia said.
