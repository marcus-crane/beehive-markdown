Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs has announced the appointment of former State Services Commissioner Don Hunn as chair of New Zealand on Air, the Crown agency charged with allocating public funding to support New Zealand broadcasting. He succeeds David Beatson who has completed two terms as chair.

"Don Hunn will bring both extensive experience in governance and knowledge of the public sector to the board," Marian Hobbs said. "He will also provide a neutral perspective to the board as well as his experience in developing consensus."

Marian Hobbs also announced the appointment of Edie Moke-Reid of Rangiora to the board of NZ on Air, replacing Hekia Parata, who resigned shortly before her term expired.

"Edie Moke-Reid has governance and management experience in the health sector and was a university lecturer in information systems, management and accounting. She will bring experience in business, strategic planning and governance to the mix of skills on the board," Marian Hobbs said.

Both appointments are for three years. The other board members are Albert Wendt, James Coleman, Judy Callingham and Gaylene Preston.
