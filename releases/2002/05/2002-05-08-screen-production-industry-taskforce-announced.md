The stars of New Zealand’s screen production industry are joining forces with the government to develop New Zealand’s innovative film and television industry.

Minister for Economic Development Jim Anderton, today announced the formation of the Screen Production Industry Taskforce and its initial membership.

The Taskforce, which was foreshadowed in the Government’s Innovation Framework, will set growth and development goals for the industry.

“I am expecting this Taskforce to come back with plans on how to develop the industry, particularly in the areas of skills development, intellectual property, international marketing and distribution, and raising capital,” said Jim Anderton.

“Taskforce members have been selected because of their knowledge and practical experience of the issues associated with the Screen Production Industry.

They members confirmed to date are:  
\* John Barnett - Managing Director, South Pacific Pictures Ltd  
\* Grant Bradley - CEO, Daybreak Pacific  
\* Julie Christie - Managing Director, Touchdown Productions  
\* Geoff Dixon - Managing Director, Silverscreen/Oktobor  
\* Ian Fraser - CEO, TVNZ  
\* Dave Gibson - Managing Director, Gibson Group  
\* Nigel Hutchinson - Director, Motion Pictures (Chairperson, Commercials Group)  
\* Robyn Laing - Preston Laing Productions (Chairperson, Independent Film Group)  
\* Diana Rowan - Nominated by Council of Trade Unions (CTU)  
\* Don Selwyn - Producer, He Taonga Films  
\* Michael Stedman - Managing Director, Natural History NZ Limited  
\* Richard Taylor - Director, Weta Workshop Limited  
\* Sue Thompson - CEO, The Film Unit (Chairperson, Post-Production Group)  
\* Ray Thompson - Chairman, Cloud 9

“The Taskforce includes the heads of the leading production houses in the NZ film and television industries and the chairpersons of the post-production, independent film and commercials industry groups. Maori language film production and broadcasting production interests are also represented.

“I am pleased we have been able to attract a team of strategic thinkers, focused on future trends and international opportunities. They have strong commercial experience and understand innovation and business growth processes. In combination they bring an understanding of foreign markets, and the positive effect design can have on other industries,” said Jim Anderton.

The Taskforce will meet regularly over six months with a review at the end of that period. During that time it is envisaged that Special Interest Groups will be developed to facilitate research and/or action plans for specific industry issues.

The Taskforce is to be co-ordinated, facilitated and supported by the Sector Specialist from Industry New Zealand, responsible to the Minister of Economic Development.

The Innovation framework announced by the Prime Minister in February identified three key industry sectors, ICT, biotechnology and creative industries, as those that the government will focus on to help lift New Zealand’s international competitiveness. The Screen Production Industry and Design Industry Taskforces are part of the work being done in creative industries.
