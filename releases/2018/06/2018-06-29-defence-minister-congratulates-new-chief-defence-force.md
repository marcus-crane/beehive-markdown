Minister of Defence Ron Mark has congratulated Air Marshal Kevin Short who today took over the role of New Zealand’s Chief of Defence Force.

“It was an honour to attend Air Marshal Short’s promotion and Change of Command Ceremony,” says Ron Mark.  

"He now begins a three-year term in charge of the NZDF and I’m looking forward to working with him.

“Air Vice-Marshal Short is an outstanding officer and will be an exceptional Chief of Defence Force.  He has a wide range of experience and has performed with distinction throughout his career.

“I have enjoyed getting to know him over the past few months and I believe he is well placed to enact our soon to be launched Strategic Defence Policy Statement.

“I’d also like to thank the outgoing Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Tim Keating. Since taking over as Minister of Defence I have been impressed with the talent, professionalism and motivation of the men and women of the Defence Force, and that’s a credit to Lieutenant General Keating’s time in charge,” says Ron Mark.
