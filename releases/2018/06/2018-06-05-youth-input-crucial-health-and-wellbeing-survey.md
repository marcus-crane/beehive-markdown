Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni and Minister for Youth Peeni Henare are urging young New Zealanders to have a say on the issues that affect their health and wellbeing.

Budget 2018 set aside up  to $4 million over four years for a Youth Health and Wellbeing survey.

This Government is committed to listening to our rangatahi so we can achieve the best outcomes for youth health and wellbeing,” Peeni Henare said.

“In recent years, this survey has lacked consistency and certainty of funding despite it being one of the few robust sources of information about our young people’s needs,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Our commitment to ongoing investment in this area shows the importance this government places on youth perspectives when developing government policy.

“We will be gathering crucial information from young people across Aotearoa. The survey will provide a youth voice and a range of unique data so we can make the best decisions based on the best evidence. We need to hear from our young people about what really matters to them,” Peeni Henare said.

“This survey will provide information covering a range of areas including culture and ethnicity, home and family life, the school environment, health, risky behaviours, injuries, employment, exposure to violence and community connectedness.

“In addition, the survey will explore expanding our youth health data to include emerging concerns such as internet safety in a mobile age, use of performance enhancing drugs in secondary school sports, and internet and gaming addiction.

The survey will be carried out once every three years, from 2018/2019 onwards.
