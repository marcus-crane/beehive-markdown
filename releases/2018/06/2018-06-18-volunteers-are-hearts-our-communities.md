Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Peeni Henare, is calling for Kiwis to be involved in the 2018 Te Wiki Tūao a Motu, National Volunteer Week, from 17-23 June.

“National Volunteer Week celebrates the millions of Kiwis who give their time, skills and knowledge to help others. This year’s theme *Heart of our Communities* captures the true essence of what volunteering is all about,” Peeni Henare said.

Recent figures suggest that each year about 1.2 million Kiwis volunteer.

“I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some of those volunteers from a range of different organisations, like the firefighters in central Auckland, to community representatives in Wairoa, and helping out in the Koha Kai kitchen in Invercargill.  I have seen first-hand the significant contribution they make to our communities.

“Volunteering is an integral part of our Kiwi culture, something I’m really proud of.

“Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the aroha to do something for their communities and whānau. In return, volunteers benefit by growing their skills, giving back, networking, and gaining new experiences,” Peeni Henare said.

This week Minister Henare is set to host Volunteering New Zealand to celebrate the contribution of volunteers and to launch “The State of Volunteering” report. This report aims to provide insights about trends and challenges faced by volunteer organisations in the last year.
