Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little has welcomed and acknowledged rangatira of Heretaunga Tamatea iwi who attended Parliament today to hear the third reading of their Treaty settlement legislation.

“I acknowledge the Heretaunga Tamatea negotiation team and the boards of He Toa Takitini and the Heretaunga Tamatea Settlement Trust who have worked tirelessly for Heretaunga Tamatea during the negotiations process,” says Andrew Little.

“This is an important occasion for the Crown and Heretaunga Tamatea as we see this legislation passed and the Heretaunga Tamatea Treaty settlement concluded. In the 1840s and 50s the Crown acquired land in Heretaunga Tamatea’s rohe using deception and secrecy. These actions contributed directly to the economic and social marginalisation of Heretaunga Tamatea.

“At $100 million in financial and commercial redress and with a further $5 million directed toward the sustainability of Te Aute College, this is the fifth largest Treaty settlement to date. The benefits of the Heretaunga Tamatea settlement will be felt, particularly in Hawke’s Bay, in this generation and in future generations as Heretaunga Tamatea roll out their plans in the near and long term. I understand this includes a grant of $1.1 million each to their 23 marae as part of a cultural revitalisation programme.

“Amongst the redress provided for past breaches of the Treaty is the gift to Heretaunga Tamatea of the Cape Kidnappers Gannet Reserve and the Cape Kidnappers Nature Reserve. Both reserves will be gifted back to the Crown for all New Zealanders. This arrangement acknowledges the importance of these sites to Heretaunga Tamatea and recognises the unique and enduring partnership between Māori and the Crown.

“The Heretaunga Tamatea settlement includes an agreed historical account, a Crown apology and commercial and cultural redress. The passing of this legislation marks the full and final settlement of all historical claims of Heretaunga Tamatea,” says Andrew Little.
