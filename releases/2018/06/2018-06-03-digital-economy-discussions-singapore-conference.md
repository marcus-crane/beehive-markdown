Digital Media and Government Digital Services Minister Clare Curran leaves for Singapore tonight on a four day visit to discuss the digital economy and digital transformation with Ministers and high level government officials from around the world.

Minister Curran is attending the invitation only Straits Digital Exchange 2018.

“The main topic at the Exchange aligns well with my digital transformation priorities for New Zealand. There’s a particular emphasis on digital economy, digital society and the management of data,” Clare Curran said.

“We have to do things differently in an increasingly connected world, using new technology and data to benefit people, government and the economy.

“This event brings together Ministers, high level government officials and industry leaders to share and discuss new and emerging issues and trends in digital and data. It’s an excellent opportunity to learn about digital transformation in nations and cities and to explore the future impact of technologies.

“I’m sure I’ll be able to bring back information and ideas to the Digital Economy Digital Inclusion (DEDI) group which is advising the Government on how it can build the digital economy and reduce digital divides by 2020.”

The Straits Digital Exchange is an event held within Singapore’s Smart Nation Innovations (SNI) week. Singapore is a leading nation in both digital government and digital economy, and the event usually attracts high-level participation.

“Two sub-topics will explore the ‘Power of Data’ and ‘Data and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence’ which supports work that’s underway on an urgent stocktake of how government agencies use algorithms to analyse people’s data,” Clare Curran said.

“With growing interest in, and increasing use of, technology such as artificial intelligence I’m acutely aware of the need for transparency and accountability. Discussions at the conference can also be used to inform New Zealand’s AI action plan and ethical framework.”

The Minister will also visit the Microsoft Cybersecurity Centre and Digital Crimes Unit, meet with senior representatives of companies like Netflix and Datacom and will speak to members of the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce at a function at the NZ High Commission.

Ms Curran flies out tonight and returns to New Zealand on Thursday, 7 June 2018.
