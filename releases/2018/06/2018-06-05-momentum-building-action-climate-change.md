The Minister for Climate Change has welcomed WWF-New Zealand’s Open Letter offering its congratulations on the Government’s goal of getting the country to net zero emissions by 2050.

Their support comes the day before public consultation on the proposed Zero Carbon Bill begins.

It has been signed by more than 200 people including business leaders from Z Energy, Les Mills gyms, DB Breweries, the Body Shop and Meridian Energy, as well as the mayors of Wellington, Whanganui, Christchurch, Gisborne and Auckland.

“Momentum is building for the Zero Carbon Bill and tomorrow the Government will begin a nationwide series of public meetings to hear peoples’ views, backed up with an interactive online engagement tool and some hefty policy analysis in a discussion document,” said James Shaw.

“The support we’re seeing for action on climate change shows that Kiwis don’t shy away from tackling the hard problems.

“We all know that making a plan for climate action now will pay off in the long term.

“Communities, businesses, farmers, iwi and ordinary New Zealanders up and down the country are already doing what they can to reduce emissions or are ready to get on board and help draw up our plan to reduce New Zealand’s impact on the climate.

“This is about doing our bit to ensure a stable climate for future generations and acting together with other countries to get climate change under control.

 “We will succeed through the efforts of all New Zealanders, and tomorrow we’ll be starting the official process of consultation for everyone to have their say on the key components of our net zero emissions plan,” Mr Shaw said.
