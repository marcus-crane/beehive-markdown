Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is pleased to announce $200,000 from the Provincial Growth Fund for the Hastings District Council to develop a feasibility and business case for a new Hawke’s Bay Food Innovation Hub.

“The planned Food Innovation Hub will be food and beverage agri-tech focussed, which is an innovative way of integrating agriculture and technology to strengthen productivity and sustainability in the region’s primary sector,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“I’m excited for Hawke’s Bay that this investment will support the creation of new innovative facilities and industries, and provide opportunities for further private sector and iwi investment. Ultimately this will lead to more jobs in the region.

“We’ve already had the announcement in February of $5.1 million from the PGF invested in the region, with the reopening of the Wairoa to Napier rail line and planting of Manuka trees to support a recirculating wetland filter in Wairoa,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

Minister of Employment Willie Jackson also announced in Hawkes Bay today $1.7 million in He Poutama Rangatahi initiatives. These are community led initiatives that set rangatahi on a lifelong journey of learning and earning.
