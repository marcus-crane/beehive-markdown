Minister of Civil Defence Hon Kris Faafoi has announced funding for five additional projects in regional New Zealand to enhance resilience to natural hazards.

The grants totalling $121,530 are awarded from the 2018/2019 Resilience Fund, an annual fund of $889,000 administered by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management. A supplementary application round was opened to disburse unallocated funds after the initial funding round in November 2017. In total, 12 applications were funded this year across the two rounds.

Mr Faafoi said he was pleased to now have fully allocated the Fund this year.

“New Zealand’s regions are leading innovative work to enhance our resilience, and this is an opportunity for the government to support projects that will benefit all of us.

“These successful applications will help New Zealand plan for events where large numbers of people are affected, support community engagement activities, improve our understanding of tsunami risk, and plan for disruptions to fuel distribution networks.

“All of these projects are worthwhile in their own right, with potential to make a real difference to their respective community rand to regional and national capability.”

The 2018/2019 supplementary grants are:

- $40,000 to Hawke’s Bay CDEM Group for Rapid Relief Planning
- $25,000 to Tairāwhiti CDEM Group for Fuel and Generator Plan
- $20,000 to Southland CDEM Group for Community Engagement Network development
- $20,000 to Southland CDEM Group for Southland/Otago Fuel Plan
- $16,530 to West Coast CDEM Group for West Coast Tsunami Modelling

Applications for the CDEM Resilience Fund 2019/20 funding round will close on 1 October 2018.

“I encourage anyone with a good idea that promotes New Zealand’s resilience to hazard risks, particularly those with an emergency management focus, to consider making an application for CDEM Resilience Fund support.”
