Education Minister Chris Hipkins has today announced his interim decision to close Tuturumuri School in rural South Wairarapa.

“[Earlier this year](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/consultation-begin-future-student-less-school), I asked the Ministry of Education to begin consultation on the possible closure of the school. The process includes Tuturumuri School’s Board consulting with its community and the Ministry consulting with the Boards of schools whose rolls might be affected,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Twenty eight submissions were received during the consultation period, and I have considered all the feedback provided to me to date.

“While the school’s roll has increased since consultation was first announced, my concerns about low student numbers at the school remain.

“The former Principal and acting Board Chair resigned at the end of last year, and a Limited Statutory Manager was appointed in February to support the Board.

“The school’s Board of Trustees now has up to 28 days to provide any further information in favour of Tuturumuri School remaining open. 

“I expect to make my final decision in August,” Chris Hipkins said.

**Note to editor:**

The Minister will not be making any further comments until the final decision is made.
