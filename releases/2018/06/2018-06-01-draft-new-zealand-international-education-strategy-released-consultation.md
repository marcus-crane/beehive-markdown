A world-class and sustainable international education sector is important for New Zealand to remain a thriving and globally connected country, Minister of Education Chris Hipkins says.

A final [draft](https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/consultation-on-the-draft-international-education-strategy) of the International Education Strategy 2018-2030 was released for consultation today. The draft strategy takes a broad look at the role of international education in supporting an equitable, high-quality, education system over the coming decade.

Mr Hipkins encouraged New Zealanders to engage through an online survey and sector meetings.

“The draft strategy shifts the focus towards sustainable growth – underpinned by a high-value sector that meets its potential, with the benefits shared across New Zealand’s regions.”

The new strategy replaces the 2011 Leadership Statement for International Education and is organised under three key goals – *Delivering an Excellent Education and Student Experience,* *Achieving Sustainable Growth* and *Developing Global Citizens*. It includes specific actions which will help deliver on these goals.

“New Zealand is geographically isolated and international education connects our regions, communities, businesses and schools with the world, as well as helping our young people become global citizens.

“The draft International Education Strategy signals our commitment to offering all international students who study in New Zealand a high-quality education and a positive experience. This means putting student wellbeing at the centre of our strategy.”

The International Student Wellbeing Strategy, released in 2017, is embedded within the draft strategy and further builds on a commitment to international students being safe, welcome and well and valued for their contribution to New Zealand.

The consultation period will run until 22 June 2018.

New Zealanders can also access the strategy and the survey through the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) websites. For those attending the [ENZ Connect Series](https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/enzs-connect-seminar-series-returns-in-2018/), there will be an opportunity at each event to provide feedback. A stakeholder reference group will also be consulted; this group includes both providers and students.

At the same time as the Government is consulting on the draft International Education Strategy, MBIE is consulting on the Government’s proposals for changes to post-study work rights for international students. Information on this proposal can be found on the MBIE [website](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/immigration/consultations/immigration-settings-for-international-students).
