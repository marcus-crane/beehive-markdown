Minister of Local Government, Hon Nanaia Mahuta, has announced that from 1 July 2018, eligible retirement village residents will be able to apply to their local council for a rates rebate.

“The Rates Rebate (Retirement Village Residents) Amendment Act 2018, ensures that retirement village residents who do not own their unit, but pay fees to live there, are recognised as rate payers, and are therefore entitled to apply for a rebate,” says Minister Mahuta.  

Eligible residents are required to fill out an application form, and provide a declaration certificate completed by their village operator. Both of these documents, along with eligibility criteria, will be available on the Department of Internal Affairs website from 1 July 2018. 

“I would like to thank Hon Ruth Dyson for proposing the Amendment Act. It will be great to see Kiwis benefit from her commitment to change.

“If you have any queries about your eligibility or that of a family member, I encourage you to get in touch with your local council or retirement village operator,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
