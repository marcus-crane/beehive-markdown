The Queen’s Birthday Honours list reflected the huge input Māori  are having into New Zealand life, says the Minister for Māori Development the Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

“It’s been great to see that everyone from John Rowles being made a Knight Commander of the New Zealand Order of Merit to Archdeacon Tikituterangi Raumati honoured with a ONZM.

“It was also pleasing to me to see that Hekenukumai Busby was knighted for his services to waka building. His ceremonial waka Te Hono ki Aotearoa recently was used in the Battle of Passchendaele celebrations.

Other Māori honoured this June with an ONZM include Christine Brears for services to health, Timua Brennan for services to music and Māori preforming arts, Matutaera  Clendon for services to Māori, Carol Ngawati for services to sport, education and Māori, Caren Rangi for services to the Pacific community and  Desma Ratima for services to Māori.

Dr Sharon Gemmell, Gabrielle Huria , Laura Mariu , Rebecca Mellish and Christine Panapa were honoured with the MZNM. Leith Comer was also made a companion of the Queens Service Order for his services to Maori and Local Government. Other Māori community leaders were honoured with the QSM.

“This was a great day for Māori achievement and I congratulate everyone who was honoured, “ says Nanaia Mahuta.
