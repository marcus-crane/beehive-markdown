Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri has announced the winner of the Postgraduate Science Scholarship at National Fieldays today.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) Postgraduate Science Scholarship offers Masters and PhD students funding to support their primary industry research in New Zealand.

“The aim of the scholarships is to help meet the science and technology needs within the primary industries,” Meka Whaitiri said.

“It’s an exciting time for the sector but we know there’s a number of areas where we need to strengthen our understanding – from genetics, to measuring and managing ecosystem impacts, to consumer and market insights.

“This scholarship scheme is an investment in the future of our primary industries. We are ensuring we have the new generation of scientists needed for the challenges we face, such as Myrtle Rust and Mycoplasma bovis.

“The depth and breadth of our new generation of scientists was shown by the diverse range of applications submitted, covering social science, kaupapa Māori, and genetics, to name a few.

“Along with the funding to help them complete their research, each winner will have the opportunity to work with an MPI mentor or supervisor to help them gain valuable insights and connections with the wider primary sector,” Meka Whaitiri said.
