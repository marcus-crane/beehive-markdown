Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau announced in Rotorua today, $811,625 from the Provincial Growth Fund for two of Rotorua Lakes Council’s Rotorua ‘Big Moves’ Projects.

“There are four Big Moves projects in total with money from the PGF going towards final business cases for developing and enhancing Rotorua’s Lakefront and Whakarewarewa Forest,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“These projects will develop and extend key infrastructure at the lakefront and forest which will support the growth of the tourism sector as well as provide investment opportunities and employment.

“It is anticipated the projects once complete will generate over $350 million in private and iwi investment, and potentially over 800 jobs for the region.

“It’s transformational projects like these that the PGF is interested in advancing and it’s been great to see the spirit of collaboration between the Rotorua Lakes Council and local iwi who have been key partners in developing both projects over many years.”

Mr Tabuteau also acknowledged the Bay of Connections Group who released its Visitor Economy Strategy today alongside the PGF announcement. “We now have an overarching visitor economic strategy for the wider region which provides a context for the lakeside and forest projects. 

“This is a fantastic accomplishment and I acknowledge the work and commitment from all the partners involved, including the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
