Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has welcomed the meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore.

The two signed a Joint Statement in which Chairman Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump also made a commitment to provide security guarantees to North Korea.

“New Zealand welcomes this stated commitment towards resolving the long-standing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  It is our hope that the diplomatic efforts foreshadowed in Singapore build trust and enable progress towards lasting peace,” said Mr Peters.

“The meeting has brought North Korea to an important crossroad. Following the right path now will bring a prosperous and secure future for North Korea. The New Zealand government strongly encourages it to realise the commitments it has made by undertaking complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, and by abandoning its other weapons programmes.”

 “Along with the rest of the international community we view the future talks as the critical next step to delivering upon the historic Singapore meeting,” said Mr Peters.

 “North Korea has an opportunity for a much brighter future, which New Zealand and the rest of the international community stands ready to support,” he said.
