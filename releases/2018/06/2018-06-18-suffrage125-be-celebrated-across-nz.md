People across Aotearoa New Zealand will soon be able to apply for funding to celebrate 125 years of voting for women, the Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter announced today.

 Minister Genter launched the $300,000 contestable fund as a Budget announcement at He Tohu – National Library in front of the 1893 Women’s Suffrage Petition.

 “Women’s history matters. It is important that we celebrate this unique milestone as the first country where women fought for and won the right to vote,” Ms Genter said.

 “This funding will allow community groups to celebrate women who have led the way for women’s rights. A particular focus will be recognising Māori, Pacific and women of diverse cultures.

 “I encourage all New Zealanders to think of projects, big and small, to put forward that tells the story of women’s continuing campaign for equality,” Ms Genter said.

Applications are invited from Thursday 21June.
