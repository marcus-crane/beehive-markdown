Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Kris Faafoi has urged the sector and public to get involved in proposed changes to the fees charged by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ).

The costs of IPONZ’s trade mark, patent and design services are recovered through fees paid by those who directly benefit from holding intellectual property (IP) rights.

“The consultation follows a routine review which found changes to the current fee structure are necessary for IPONZ to continue supporting an effective, efficient and future-ready IP regulatory regime,” Mr Faafoi says.

“IPONZ is ranked highly against its international counterparts for the world-class services it offers, and providing quality services will remain a priority throughout any changes.

“At the same time, IPONZ plays an integral role in ensuring that innovators’ and entrepreneurs’ ideas are protected in the marketplace so that they can develop these ideas. It is important fees are set at an appropriate amount to recover IPONZ costs, whilst not becoming onerous or unaffordable for those using the services.”

The review identified a number of areas where changes could be considered to rebalance patent and trade mark fees, and to improve the efficiency, equity and effectiveness of the two regimes. Changes to fees for designs, plant variety rights, geographical indications and hearings services are not being proposed at this time.

“I encourage those interested to read the consultation documents online now, and to have your say on the suggested approaches to how IPONZ charges for its services.”

Consultation is open until 5pm on 30 July 2018. More information and to the consultation documents can be found [here](http://www.iponz.govt.nz).
