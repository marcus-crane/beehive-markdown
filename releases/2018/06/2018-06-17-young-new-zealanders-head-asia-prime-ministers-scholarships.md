Education Minister Chris Hipkins has congratulated 180 New Zealanders who have been awarded prestigious Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia (PMSA) as part of the second 2017/18 round.

The students from across New Zealand include 60 individuals and 12 groups of 120 students, making 180 students in total. They will travel to destinations including Korea, China, India and Singapore to study, carry out research or undertake an internship.

“The PMSA enables talented Kiwi students to enjoy unique experiences living and studying in Asia at a formative time in their lives,” Chris Hipkins said.

 "These experiences challenge students at a personal level, broaden their horizons and allow them to build networks that will be useful throughout their careers.

“They will become more outwardly focused and engaged in international issues and interested in other cultures.

“Students having learning experiences in Asia also benefits us at a national level – it means New Zealand is growing the collective skills and cultural understanding required to make a mark on the global stage and show leadership in matters of significance to the Asian region.”

Individual awardees, who are at tertiary level or have recently graduated, will carry out programmes that span six weeks to two years. 

The individual PMSA awards include:

- An eight-week medical elective for ophthalmology and dermatology at the Seoul National University Hospital,
- A two-year Master's degree at Ewha Woman's University in South Korea with a focus on development co-operation, and
- A four-month internship with the Asia Internship Program (AIP) in Singapore, a leading social enterprise.

 Group PMSA awardees include 10 Massey University students who are travelling to India for six weeks. Five of the students will take up internship positions at Jaipur Rugs, an international award-winning knotted rug company, and five will take up positions at Bhu:sattva, a leading eco fashion company. The students will learn global approaches to design business within a sustainable practice framework.

A total of $1,443,448 was awarded this round for 2017/18 covering both individual and group awardees.

“The PMSA has been an important factor behind the increased number of domestic students looking to further their education in Asia though exchange programmes. This is a real shift for New Zealand – previously students tended to look at English-speaking destinations for these experiences,” Chris Hipkins said. 

The scholarship programme is funded by the New Zealand Government and administered by Education New Zealand (ENZ). The PMSA has been running for five years. PMSLA awards offering similar support for learning experiences in Latin America, launched in 2016. Second round 2018/19 PMSLA awardees will be announced shortly. 

To date, there have been 1,543 PMSA and PMSLA awardees. The scholarship covers study and internship costs and makes a significant contribution to travel and accommodation expenses.

The deadline for the first round for 2018/19 for PMSA and PMSLA will be announced shortly.
