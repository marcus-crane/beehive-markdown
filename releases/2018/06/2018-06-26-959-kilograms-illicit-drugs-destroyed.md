Customs has destroyed 959 kilograms of illicit drugs and packaging to mark the United Nation’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, says Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri.

The truckload of drugs, which filled 59 rubbish bags and 15 boxes, was destroyed in a secure environment under strict protocol. The drugs were mixed with other putrid material before being processed in high-pressure steamers to neutralise it and turn it into waste.

The 3,522 items included methamphetamine and its precursors as the bulk volume, as well as cocaine, MDMA, GBL and thousands of smaller seizures including blotter tabs and cannabis products – with some concealments such as methamphetamine mixed with chilli paste and car wheel rims thrown in.

“I am incredibly proud that Customs has destroyed this massive quantity of illicit drugs and prevented hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of harm to our whānau, communities and regions,” says Meka Whaitiri.

“The UN’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking aims to raise global awareness of the major problems that illicit drugs represent to our society, and make us more determined to work together towards becoming a drug free world.

“I’m pleased this year’s theme has a strong focus on tamariki – listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.

“I encourage all New Zealanders to join Customs and this Government in taking a stand against illicit drugs in Aotearoa. Whether it is looking out for children growing up in drug abusive families or offering support to troubled youth – you can help make a difference,” says Meka Whaitiri.
