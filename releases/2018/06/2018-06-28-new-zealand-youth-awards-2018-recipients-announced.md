“I am pleased to announce that Injy Johnstone was named as the Senior Supreme Award recipient, and Ranisha Chand as the Junior Supreme Award recipient.

"It is hugely important to acknowledge the mahi that Aotearoa's youth put into the present and future of our nation. The New Zealand Youth Awards recognises the hours, commitment, and perseverance that goes into affecting positive change. For me personally, this award recognises the strength of diversity and inclusivity in leadership particularly for youth with access needs and that come from disadvantaged backgrounds," Injy Johnstone said.

“Receiving an award assured me that I was making a positive change in the community through my passion for feminism and social justice for migrant women and young people. This recognition helps in amplifying my voice for others who are less fortunate. While I feel my contribution towards making change is small, it is nonetheless significant enough to change the mindsets of others and also break negative societal stereotypes. I believe that when I speak it’s not just me talking, but I am representative of other young people who are yet to gain the confidence to voice their opinions,” Ranisha Chand said.

“The Awards winners will inspire and encourage other young people to get involved and make a difference. I’d also like to recognise all of those who were nominated for an Award this year. It’s demonstrated to me that Aotearoa New Zealand is in good hands for the future. Our country is full of committed, creative, and talented young people who are leading change and developing innovative solutions,” Peeni Henare said.
