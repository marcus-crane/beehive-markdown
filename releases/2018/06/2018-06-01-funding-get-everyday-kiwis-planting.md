The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will provide a $6.6 million boost to a well-established Trust to get New Zealanders planting native trees nationwide, Forestry Minister Shane Jones has announced.

“The funding, over three years, will go to Project Crimson Trust’s Trees That Count campaign, which was launched in 2016 and connects tree planters with tree funders,” Shane Jones said.

“The Trust’s goal is to motivate New Zealanders to plant as many native trees as possible. This funding will allow Trees That Count to significantly scale up its efforts to mobilise more people to get out there and plant native trees to mitigate climate change, improve the environment and increase biodiversity.

“We want everyone – children, mums and dads, grandparents, teenagers, iwi and private businesses – to be part of the nationwide native tree planting movement as part of the One Billion Trees programme.

“The funding will deliver significant social and environmental benefits and I’m pleased the Government has been able to partner with Project Crimson and build on the fantastic work the Trust does.

“The funding will also be used to encourage businesses to fund trees which can be gifted and then planted by everyday Kiwis. Landowners will also be able to pledge land to ensure there are various ways of participating in this common goal.

“Trees That Count will support the development of educational resources, skills and employment for communities. Training is being developed with NorthTec, a local iwi and their plant nursery. Six regional advisors will be employed to train and connect land owners, tree funders and planting groups.

“This is about more than an investment in trees – it’s an investment in people, our regional communities and our environment,” Shane Jones said.
