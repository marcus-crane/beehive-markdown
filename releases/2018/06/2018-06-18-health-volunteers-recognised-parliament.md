Health Minister Dr David Clark has announced Turangi-based Kim Gosman is the overall winner of the 2018 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards. 

“The Minister of Health Volunteer Awards celebrate and recognise the thousands of dedicated health sector volunteers who give many hours of their time to help other New Zealanders,” says David Clark.

“The judges were impressed by the depth and range of Kim’s volunteering work over 44 years and the impact that has had on improving Māori health outcomes in particular.

“I would like to thank Kim for her contribution to the health and wellbeing of others. Her commitment at a strategic level and to training and mentoring new staff has enabled the expansion of frontline health services and improved health accessibility for Māori in the Lakes District Health Board region.

“This is an example of how volunteering benefits patients and anyone using health services and supports New Zealand’s health system as a whole. Well done to all those who were nominated and congratulations to those recognised as outstanding achievers,” says David Clark.

Dr Clark presented the Minister of Health Volunteer Awards in Parliament today, during National Volunteer Week, 18 – 24 June.

Outstanding achievers were recognised across six categories – healthcare service provider, community or NGO, youth health, Māori health, Pacific health, and long service.
