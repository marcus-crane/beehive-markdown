Applications open today for scholarships aimed at boosting the power of New Zealand’s business managers, with a change in focus from earlier years to include a wider range of Kiwi businesses. 

The Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships provide an opportunity for managers to gain valuable skills and experience by undertaking world-class executive education at international business schools. 

While they were previously aimed at exporters and internationalising New Zealand-based firms, the criteria have been expanded to include domestically-focused firms that can take advantage of New Zealand’s competitive advantage, such as in areas like agricultural technology. 

There is also a particular focus on expanding the diversity of recipients to include more women, Maori and Pasifika people. 

“These Scholarships open the door to opportunities not readily available in New Zealand, giving business leaders access to international experts, global networks and knowledge to bring home to their businesses and share with colleagues and the wider business community,” Economic Development Minister David Parker said.  

“Lifting management capability in New Zealand’s businesses will help strengthen and develop the productive potential of this economy, which is a priority for the government. 

“Having the people who lead our companies equipped with the best skills possible is crucial for driving greater efficiency, innovation and productivity.” 

The Scholarships fund 50 per cent of the cost of overseas study at an international business school, up to a maximum value of $110,000. 

Recent recipients include leaders from the IT, agriculture, electricity, technology and textile industries. Recipients attend business schools including Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the European Institute for Business Administration (INSEAD). 

“As a small nation at the bottom of the world it is not always easy to get exposure to the world’s business learning resources and that’s why the Government is pleased to offer this opportunity,” David Parker said. 

The Scholarships close at noon on 9 July 2018. To apply visit [www.mbie.govt.nz/pmbs](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/pmbs)
