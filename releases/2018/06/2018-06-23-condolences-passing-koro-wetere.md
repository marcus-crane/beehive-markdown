Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters has expressed his condolences with the passing of Hon Koro Wētere this morning.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Government I wish to acknowledge the contribution Koro Wētere has made to the country and his remarkable service as a parliamentarian for more than quarter of a century,” said Mr Peters. 

Koro Wētere served as Crown Minister for Lands and for Maori Affairs and played a key role in the affairs of his Tainui people. He was also instrumental in the complicated resolution of the Maori fisheries settlement during the 1980s. His contributions to New Zealand’s modern society include advances in Te Reo language recognition.

“Koro was highly respected across the divide of politics for his sincerity and integrity. Our deepest condolences are extended to his family and to Ngāti Maniapoto for their loss,” said Mr Peters.
