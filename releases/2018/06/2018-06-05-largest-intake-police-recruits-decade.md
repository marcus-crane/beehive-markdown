Police recruitment has stepped up a gear with the largest intake of recruits in more than a decade beginning training at the Royal New Zealand Police College near Porirua.

“I offer congratulations and welcome to the 100 new recruits who begin the intensive 16 weeks training course as part of Wing 318,” says Police Minister Stuart Nash. It is the largest single intake since 2006.

“The 100 recruits arrived at the weekend and begin formal training today. They have demonstrated commitment and dedication to get this far, and I acknowledge their families and friends for the support offered behind the scenes.

“Before they arrive at Police College every applicant goes through assessments and tests and a distance learning course. They are expected to demonstrate their fitness levels, reasoning abilities and character, and to undergo reference checks and a medical examination. They must prove their skills at communication, building relationships, solving problems and delivering a high standard of service. They even sit a typing assessment to test their computer and technology skills.

“Our new Police recruits are professional and talented before they even begin training. We ask a lot of them and their families and the training course is a demanding time for everyone involved.

“Budget 2018 set aside almost $300 million in new operating funding for this unprecedented recruitment drive as a result of the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First. We are striving to recruit 1800 new Police officers over three years, backed up by 485 support staff. Since the government was formed in October 2017, 455 new Police officers have graduated from the Royal New Zealand Police College.

“The youngest recruit in Wing 318 is 19 years old and the eldest is 50. There are 38 women and 62 men, and a number of new Kiwis from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. I offer my thanks to Wing Patron Laulu Mac Leauanae, the Chief Executive of the Ministry for Pacific Peoples, for accepting the important role as mentor for the new recruits.

“Our neighbourhoods want a greater uniformed presence for community policing and they also expect an increased focus on organised crime. We are building a stronger Police service and giving them tools to prevent offending, enforce the law and keep communities safe,” says Mr Nash.
