Maapuna ana mai te rere o roimata ki te mate. Ko Kaiwaka i te rangi te tohu o aituaa ki te papa, e too ai te tangata.  

It is with solemn condolences I convey my sympathy to the family of the late Hon Koro Wētere, says the Minister of Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta. 

‘Koro will be sorely missed by the people of Waikato-Maniapoto. He has made a contribution in so many ways. 

‘His unflappable leadership during some critical junctures of Maori economic and social development helped to create the establishment of the Kohanga Reo, extended the jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal, urging a different approach to funding outcomes for Maori and a greater emphasis on Maori land development. 

‘Koro also ensured the smooth passage of the Waikato Raupatu Settlement Act 1995 as a lasting contribution to his tribe and continued that leadership in the tribal domain when he left Parliament. 

“He was a stalwart confident to the late Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu and that continued to her successor Kiingi Tuheitia.

“In 1990 Wetere caused an uproar in Parliament by replying to questions in the House in Māori and refusing to supply an immediate translation. That stance in favour of equal status for both languages helped to establish the current system of simultaneous translation of Maori language speeches in Parliament.

“On a personal note he was a trusted advisor and supporter throughout my own political journey I grieve with his wife and family - his loyalty in service is a lasting example,” says Nanaia Mahuta.  

No reira, e te ruruhau o tini, o mano kua ngū i to ngarohanga, whakatā, e moe. Pai Mārire
