Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri says the Framework for Action on Animal Welfare released today, sets out a better approach to animal welfare that is clear, transparent and inclusive.

Minister Whaitiri, the first dedicated Minister for animal welfare, foreshadowed plans for a new way forward at the Animal Welfare Advocate Hui held at Manurewa Marae earlier this month. The hui was also attended by the Greens’ Gareth Hughes and New Zealand First’s Mark Patterson.

“New Zealanders take animal welfare very seriously and in response, this Government is committed to improving animal welfare outcomes in Aotearoa,” Meka Whaitiri says.

“This framework for action is the result of eight months of discussions with stakeholders. Conversations which signalled it is time for a more open and engaged relationship. One where Government, industry, farmers, campaign advocates and New Zealanders work together to improve our animal welfare system.

“Today’s framework for action signals the creation of an independent future-thinking voice on animal welfare, more inclusive decision-making, and a strengthened, more effectively monitored Codes of Welfare system.

“We are also prioritising uplifting expectations in terms of achieving animal welfare outcomes and developing the skills of those at the coal face of this issue, including for those working with our nation’s animals.

“With modern consumers more discerning, I want to ensure these strong outcomes contribute to New Zealand keeping its competitive advantage as a safe food producer.

“Once the future direction of this framework is complete, I will seek Cabinet approval as part of our commitment to improving animal welfare outcomes across the board.

“I look forward to continuing to work with all New Zealanders in order to deliver on this new framework,” said Meka Whaitiri.
