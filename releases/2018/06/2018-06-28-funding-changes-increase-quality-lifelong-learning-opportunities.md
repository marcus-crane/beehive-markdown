Foundation level te reo Māori is one of many tertiary programmes to benefit from a funding rate increase, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

The rate increase of $1000 per full time equivalent place comes into effect next year and applies to a number of Student Achievement Component (SAC) level 1 and 2 programmes provided by tertiary education organisations.

“Programmes including te reo Māori, supported learning for students with high learning needs and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) will benefit,” Mr Hipkins said.

“The changes result from my [earlier decision](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/bureaucratic-tertiary-funding-model-scrapped) to do away with the previous Government’s failed competitive funding model for level 1 and 2 foundation programmes.

“The move helps tertiary providers deliver better quality courses, supports lifelong learning, and helps students better prepare for employment or further education.

“In 2017, there were about 19,000 student enrolments in the programmes receiving a funding rate increase in 2019.

“Funding rates for level 1 and 2 programmes in trades and services remain unchanged. The vast majority of providers, however deliver a mix of foundation level programmes and will benefit, Chris Hipkins said.
