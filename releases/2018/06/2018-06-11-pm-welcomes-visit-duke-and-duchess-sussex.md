Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has welcomed confirmation that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will make their first official visit together to New Zealand in spring, around the time of the Invictus Games in Sydney.

“It’s wonderful news that the Duke and Duchess are coming to New Zealand as part of their first major tour outside the United Kingdom and I look forward to welcoming them here,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“I know Prince Harry really enjoyed his last visit here in 2015 and I’m sure New Zealanders will want the Duchess of Sussex to also experience our warm hospitality and manaakitanga on her first visit here as a member of the Royal family.

“This is the Duchess’s second visit to our country and I know New Zealanders will be very much looking forward to welcoming her back.”

The visit is still in the planning stage and further details regarding dates and the itinerary will be released closer to their arrival.
