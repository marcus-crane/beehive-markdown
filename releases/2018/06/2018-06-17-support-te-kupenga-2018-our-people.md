Te Kupenga 2018 is an absolute  priority for our people so that our Coalition Government can be informed of what is happening in the Māori world, says the Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta.

Te Kupenga is a Stats NZ survey that will interview 11,500 men and women across Aotearoa  who in the Census said that they had Māori ancestry. 

“This will inform the Government over how our people are thinking and this will help Government agencies, iwi and community groups to empower Māori. 

“It gives the hard facts for legislators like myself to plan coherent policy for our future. 

“This is the second survey of Māori wellbeing. The earlier survey in 2013 told us some important facts about Māori life such as over half the people surveyed could speak some te reo Māori. 

“I note this time that there will be a new questions about the importance of te reo and issues such as the environment. 

“Te Kupenga will support further work the Government is doing to define a living standards framework that seeks to improve wellbeing and impact on inter-generational outcomes for whanau. 

“Language, culture, identity and the environment are all important contributors to Māori wellbeing. 

“I can’t  reinforce strongly enough that we need the answers to these questions so we can plan for the coming century,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
