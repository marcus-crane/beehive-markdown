The government will extend the timeframe of the Cyber Security Strategy refresh and do a deeper dive into the issues, to inform the new action plan.

Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran says cyber security is an essential element of New Zealand being a connected, digital nation.

“There’s been strong interest in the cyber security strategy refresh and we want to ensure we have a broad range of perspectives to inform the strategy and action plan.  As a consequence, we’ve extended the time we initially had available for input through until September.” Ms Curran says.

“Cyber threats continue to increase and become more sophisticated and cyber-crime and espionage tools are more accessible. It’s timely for us to reassess and step up our cyber security efforts.

“The refresh will examine whether we have the right resources and the right arrangements to deal with cyber threats facing New Zealand.

“This government is committed to building a connected nation that includes promoting and protecting digital rights, along with harnessing digital technology for economic growth, community benefit and innovation.” Ms Curran says.

There will be a series of opportunities for stakeholders to provide their views from June through until September with a series of workshops starting in Wellington today.   

Minister Curran will report back to Cabinet at the end of October with a revised New Zealand Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan.
