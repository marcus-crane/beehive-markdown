Up to 400 affordable homes will be built in the Auckland suburb of Northcote under the KiwiBuild programme, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford announced today.

This announcement comes on the eve of the KiwiBuild home count officially starting on Sunday July 1 – where homes built under the programme will count towards the Government’s official target of 1000 homes by June 2019, 5000 homes by June 2020 and 10,000 homes by June 2021.

The mid-year start date was designed before Labour came to office to allow the new Government to set up the structure and processes needed for New Zealand’s largest state-backed house building programme in generations. It has also allowed the KiwiBuild Unit within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to do the groundwork required for such a major programme, including engaging with developers and setting price caps.

Phil Twyford said this redevelopment of Housing NZ land in Northcote is being led by its subsidiary, HLC. “This development will comprise 1,200 new homes, divided equally between state houses, KiwiBuild/affordable homes, and market homes.

“It will use the very latest in building innovation including off-site manufacturing.

“We expect the first of the KiwiBuild homes at Northcote will be finished in 2019,” Phil Twyford said.

Following the official launch for counting KiwiBuild homes, from next week aspiring first homeowners will be able to register their interest in a KiwiBuild home.

From early July, aspiring first homeowners will be able to check their eligibility and will soon be able to pre-qualify for the first KiwiBuild homes that are expected to be completed by the end of October, the Government’s first year in office, and the thousands of others that will be built by the KiwiBuild programme.
