Addressing the skills shortage in the construction sector is a key priority for this Government, says Minister for Building and Construction Jenny Salesa. 

“This is a critical issue so we must work with urgency,” says Jenny Salesa. “That is why I am leading the Ministerial Group on the Construction Workforce, which has developed a Construction Skills Action Plan to build a sustainable construction workforce for New Zealand.

“This isn’t just about numbers. We need a workforce that can embrace innovation and new and efficient methods of construction.

“We know this will take time which is why my colleague, the Minister of Immigration Iain Lees-Galloway, is today announcing the proposed immigration changes to support KiwiBuild. 

“If we are to increase the capacity and capability of the construction workforce, we cannot work in silos. Through a cross-Government programme of work, we will partner with the construction sector to drive a rapid and sustainable shift.

“We need the right people, at the right time, with the right skills to meet New Zealand’s current and future construction pipeline, including Kiwibuild.

“I am undertaking targeted sector engagement on the proposed Action Plan.  I want to hear from the construction sector, all possible solutions to the enormous challenge of tackling the shortage of skills in construction in New Zealand,” says Jenny Salesa.

Engagement on the Construction Skills Action Plan begins Thursday 28 June and runs until Tuesday 17 July. For more information please contact:  [Jess.Walker@mbie.govt.nz](mailto:Jess.Walker@mbie.govt.nz)
