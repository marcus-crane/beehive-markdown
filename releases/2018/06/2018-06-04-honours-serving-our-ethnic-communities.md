Ethnic Communities Minister Jenny Salesa congratulates all the Queen’s Birthday Honours recipients that have been recognised for services to Ethnic Communities.

“It is wonderful that those who have served and championed ethnic communities to engage and prosper in New Zealand have been recognised today,” Jenny Salesa said.

“A diverse group of Ethnic Communities Leaders have been honoured in this year’s Queens Birthday Awards, including several from our South Asian communities.

“Mr Yikun Zhang, has been made a *Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit*, for services to New Zealand-China relations and the Chinese community. Mr Zhang has facilitated economic and trade conferences and Expos between New Zealand and China and is an effective and tireless community organiser.

“Venerable Suthep Surapong was also made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the Cambodian community. Abbott Surapong has played a significant role in supporting the resettlement of Cambodian refugees over the last 32 years.

**“**Mrs Mavis Lata Singh received the QSM for work for services to Migrants and the community. Mrs Singh launched the women’s organisation *New Zealand Sanatan Naari Sabha* in 2001 to help migrant communities settling here. She has organised annual workshops to find solutions to domestic violence, child and elder abuse, youth problems, and nutritional related diseases in migrant communities in Aotearoa.

**“**Mrs Kumiko Imai Duxfield was appointed *Honorary Member to The New Zealand Order* of Merit for service to the Japanese community. She has been integral in the promotion of Japanese culture, food and music through bi annual events like *Taste of Japan* and the formation of New Zealand’s first Japanese drumming team.

“I congratulate and thank all those who have made contributions to the improvement of the lives of Ethnic Communities in Aotearoa today. Their service and dedication helps us build a foundation for a stronger and better New Zealand, “Jenny Salesa said.
