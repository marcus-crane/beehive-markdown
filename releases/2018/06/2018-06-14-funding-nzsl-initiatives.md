Minister for Disability Issues, Hon Carmel Sepuloni is pleased to announce that $441,338.75 is to be awarded to national and local initiatives to promote the use of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL).

Carmel Sepuloni says, “Every year the NZSL Board identifies its priorities for the NZSL Fund, which supports long-term planning to promote and maintain NZSL.

“This year, the NZSL Board was looking for projects that help Deaf people to develop or maintain ‘Deaf spaces’, where NZSL users can come together face-to-face or online; or that added to the research or educational resources available to all NZSL users.”

Minister Sepuloni said that the number of applications demonstrates how responsive the Deaf community is to opportunities to have their voices heard.

“Of the thirty-two applications, thirteen have been selected to receive funding. Successful projects include an NZSL choir for deaf children and children of Deaf parents to support the learning of NZSL, a national camp for parents and their deaf children, and a Māori Deaf youth hui.

“This is the fourth year that the Board has run a contestable process for funding, giving anyone in the Deaf or NZSL user community the opportunity to put forward their ideas.

“The NZSL Fund also supports a range of NZSL Board initiatives including standards for NZSL interpreters, further development of a national NZSL curriculum and resources to support adults to learn NZSL.

“As an official language of New Zealand, the Government is committed to supporting the promotion of NZSL through the activities carried out by the NZSL Board.”
