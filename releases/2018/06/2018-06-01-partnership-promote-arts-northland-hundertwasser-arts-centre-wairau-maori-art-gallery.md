Hundertwasser Arts Centre with Wairau Māori Art Gallery in Whangarei is set to benefit from a $10 million investment from the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones announced today.

“Designed by celebrated artist Freidensreich Hundertwasser, who lived in Northland for 30 years, the Centre will include a collection of his own original works as well as New Zealand’s first curated gallery dedicated to showcasing contemporary Māori art,” said Jacinda Ardern.

The $26 million project to build the Centre and art gallery is part of the region’s Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan.

“I’m pleased to be in Northland to announce this funding today. Annually, the centre will attract more than 200,000 visitors bringing about $26 million in net economic benefit,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“This investment will help create more than 60 fulltime equivalent jobs during the two-year construction period, 10 fulltime jobs in the art gallery and education centre once completed, and a further 21 fulltime jobs in the adjoining café and retail facilities,” said Shane Jones.

Construction is expected to start in the next month.
