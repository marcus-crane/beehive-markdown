Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford has announced the appointment of Mark Gosche as deputy chair of the Housing New Zealand board.

“As a former Cabinet minister with years of leadership experience, Mark Gosche has the right skills to contribute to the Housing NZ Board,” Phil Twyford said.

“Since retiring in 2008 after 12 years at Parliament – where he held several Cabinet posts including minister of housing – Mark Gosche has served on numerous not for profit, community and trust boards.

“He has also been the chief executive of Pacifica health and social services provider Vaka Tautua since 2014, and was recently appointed chair of Counties Manukau District Health Board. 

“Mark Gosche will bring an in-depth understanding of the needs of Housing NZ’s tenants and invaluable knowledge to help it achieve the Government’s aim of building 6400 new public houses in the next four years, of which at least 4,000 will be new state houses.

“Mark Gosche has been appointed as deputy chair for a first term of three years. Previous deputy chair John Duncan will continue to serve as a member of the Board,” Phil Twyford says.

Other board members to be reappointed to the Housing NZ Board include Adrienne Young-Cooper, who has been reappointed as Board chair until 31 May 2019. John Duncan was reappointed as a Board member until 30 June 2021 and Michael Schur was reappointed as board member until 30 June 2020.
