Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little acknowledges and welcomes the rangatira of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki for coming to Parliament for the third and final reading of their Treaty settlement legislation.

“This legislation delivers the full and final settlement of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki’s historical claims, as agreed in the Deed of Settlement signed by the Crown and iwi in 2015.

“Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki welcomed the arrival of the Crown in 1840, which they envisaged as a continuation of the mutually beneficial relationships they had enjoyed with early European settlers and missionaries. However, the Crown breached its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi when it acquired large tracts of land in the Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki rohe.

“Crown acquisitions included 78,000 acres of land it considered surplus to pre-Treaty transactions and the confiscation of a further 51,000 acres. The Crown made no assessment of the adequacy of lands remaining in the possession of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, who were left virtually landless by 1880.

“This Bill cannot change the injustices of the past, nor will it be enough to compensate fully for the losses incurred by Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki.

“However, with the passing of this Bill the Crown’s apology to Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki is enshrined in legislation and the full redress contained in the Deed of Settlement. The redress items provide a starting point for the restoration of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki’s economic base, and cultural redress in recognition of sites of paramount significance to the iwi.

“What has been achieved is a significant investment in the present and future generations of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, a provision for their mokopuna to have a connection to their customary lands, and what I hope can be the start of a new relationship with the Crown.

“I acknowledge and pay my respects to Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, many of whom were present in the public gallery on this historic day, for the commitment and hard work they have undertaken to reach settlement,” says Andrew Little.
