The Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta today announced four new community-based transitional homes, a home for a support worker, and central whare in the Whangārei suburb of Ōtangarei.

“These homes will not only provide whānau with warm, dry and safe housing but will provide a platform for them to rebuild their futures. We are committed to improving the lives and wellbeing of all New Zealanders and ensuring a thriving Aotearoa.” 

“I am pleased to see these Ōtangarei homes underway which is an investment towards the health and wellbeing of whānau, particularly our rangatahi". 

And in Kaitāia, more good news today with an innovative trial helping low-income whānau to move toward owning their own homes announced.

“For many whānau, home ownership is simply out of reach. Rates of Māori home ownership have been declining at a faster rate than for the general population,” says Nanaia Mahuta. 

”The last census says that only 28 per cent of Māori adults own their own home, compared to 50 per cent of the total population. 

He Korowai Trust, a Māori service provider in Kaitāia, is leading the trial in collaboration with Te Puni Kōkiri. The He Korowai Trust is testing an affordable rent-to-own home ownership model that enables whānau to not just put a roof over their heads, but eventually own it. 

Budget 2018 also commits further funding for papakāinga housing development and community housing repair and regeneration. 

$15 million for Māori housing has been set aside as part of Budget 2018 to provide practical assistance and resources to whānau and Māori housing providers to support papakāinga development and housing repairs through  Partnerships between Te Puni Kōkiri and Māori communities. 

“These are all significant moves to ensure there Māori housing is addressed within the Government’s overall approach to housing. “This government’s focus is widespread-from homelessness to home-ownership, increasing the state-housing stock, social housing, papakāinga housing, as well as partnered housing opportunities,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
