The programme that gives schools the option of running NCEA exams online will receive an additional $8 million for the 2018 and 2019 school years, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“Online exams are increasingly popular in schools, are more efficient to administer and make assessment data more readily available for analysis,” Chris Hipkins said.

“This additional funding will allow NZQA to continue building the IT system schools need to offer NCEA exams online by 2020. NZQA will deliver over 30 digital examinations in 2019 as part of its pilots.

“Since 2014, around three quarters of secondary schools have taken part in NCEA Online trials and pilots and between 2016 and 2017, this rose significantly,” Mr Hipkins said.

“Funding will come from within Crown baselines and does not require any new appropriation. The funding has been reprioritised from underspends resulting from tertiary enrolment data for 2017/18.”
