All Dunedin residents and businesses are able to connect to ultra-fast broadband (UFB) now the project to build the network’s infrastructure is complete, 19 months ahead of schedule.

Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Clare Curran says Dunedin has long shown an appetite for faster internet speeds.

“About 47 per cent of the city’s residents are already connected to ultra-fast broadband – 4.5 per cent higher than the national average. It won the national [Gigatown competition](http://gigatown.co.nz/the-winner) in 2014, giving residents access to one gigabit per second fibre connections,” Clare Curran said.

“It’s also home to successful businesses that are using their technological expertise and creativity to develop new digital products and services for the global market.

“It’s great that Dunedin is leading the way in UFB connections, but 47 per cent still means more than half the people who can connect aren’t taking advantage of UFB at their door.

“This government wants all New Zealanders to embrace digital opportunities and prosper from them. Every New Zealander needs to be on the journey with us; know how to access and use digital technology; and trust the systems we have to manage and protect our information,” Clare Curran said.

“It’s about all of us, not just some of us.

“More Dunedin businesses and individuals should capitalise on UFB and the city’s one gigabit per second fibre connection to better connect with the world and participate in New Zealand’s growing digital economy.”

UFB is scheduled to be delivered in Dunedin’s fringe areas and Allanton, Karitane, Outram, Waikouaiti and Waitati between 2020 and 2022.

“I want to thank Chorus staff for all their hard work in completing this build, for the Gigatown initiative and their part in the national UFB rollout.”

 

**Background:**

The government’s [Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/technology-communications/fast-broadband) is one of the country’s largest and most ambitious infrastructure projects.

By the end of the initiative in 2022, 87 per cent of New Zealanders, in over 390 towns and cities will be able to access fibre-to-the-premises, putting New Zealand in the top five OECD nations for access to fibre.

During the Dunedin build, Chorus has built more than 4,500 kilometres of fibre.

Existing and planned ultra-fast broadband, and other available internet access technologies, can be viewed on the interactive [National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.nz/).

Dunedin-based start-ups capitalising on this one gigabit per second fibre connection:

- Tussock Innovation - cutting-edge work designing sensors to measure and monitor stormwater drain levels.

<!--THE END-->

- Code Lingo - scans code for errors and automatically corrects them.
- The Bison Group - developed a world-first portable container-weighing scale in response to changes in container shipping logistics management.
- Photonic Innovations - uses lasers to detect toxic and hazardous gas leaks.

Figures show that more than 50,000 unique users a month are logging on and making the most of the free gig-enabled hotspots in 15 locations around the city.
