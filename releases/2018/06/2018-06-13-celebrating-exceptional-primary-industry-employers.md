Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri has today launched the new Good Employer Awards in recognition of outstanding primary industry employers and those that provide services to the primary industries.

The new awards are sponsored by Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and the Agricultural and Marketing Research Development Trust.

“New Zealand needs to attract, develop and keep people in our primary industries,” Meka Whaitiri said.

“An important part of this is providing great work environments where employees feel supported, safe and have the opportunity to develop and grow.

“In our forestry workforce, we need both employees and employers to develop new skills that focus on sustainability, resilience and accountability.

The awards recognise good employers in the following categories:

- innovative employment practices
- employee development
- safe and healthy work environments
- Māori agribusiness
- Minister’s Award

“The primary industries employs about one in seven New Zealanders and as many as one in three in some regions. That’s a lot of people and it’s time we start celebrating those employers who are doing an outstanding job.

“I’m also very pleased to include my own Award for a regional employer that has shown a commitment to improving employment practices in their region,” Meka Whaitiri said.
