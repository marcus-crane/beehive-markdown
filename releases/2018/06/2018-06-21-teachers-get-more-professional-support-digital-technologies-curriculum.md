Education Minister Chris Hipkins has today launched a $12 million professional support programme today to help schools implement the new digital curriculum.

Mr Hipkins visited Northland School in Wellington to make the announcement this morning.

Kia Takatū ā-Matihiko, the Digital Readiness programme is one part of a wider $38 million Government funding package to help teachers and kaiako with the roll out of the new digital curriculum [content](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-digital-technologies-schools-and-kura).

“The digital curriculum is about teaching children how to design their own digital solutions and become creators of, not just users of, digital technologies, to prepare them for the modern workforce.

“More than 44,000 teachers will be able to access the support programme which includes experts and resources from CORE Education, Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and the University of Canterbury, face to face coaching sessions with digital technologies specialists, online toolkits and videos to help teachers gain more confidence in delivering the new curriculum content.

“This is a good professional development opportunity to assist teachers to learn new skills.

“The programme recognises that teachers will have different levels of experience in this subject area and will be able to use a self-assessment tool that is designed to individually tailor the programme.

“I encourage all teachers to sign up to the programme,” Chris Hipkins says.
