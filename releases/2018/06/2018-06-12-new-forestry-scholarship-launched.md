A new forestry scholarship has been launched at National Fieldays today by Forestry Ministers Shane Jones and Meka Whaitiri.

The new scholarship aims to grow the capability of the forestry sector and increase the number of women and Māori in the industry.

“The new scholarship – Ngā Karahipi Uru Rākau – provides $8,000 a year to Māori and female students enrolling in either a Bachelor of Forestry Science or Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Forest Engineering at the University of Canterbury,” Shane Jones said.

“It also provides a paid internship with Te Uru Rākau (Forestry New Zealand) and other forestry employers.

“Four scholarships will be awarded for the 2019 academic year, and this will increase to a total of 18 over the next three years.

“The One Billion Trees programme is a key focus for this Government and we want to ensure that our young men and women see forestry as a sustainable and exciting career. We need to ensure we have the right skills today and in the future to increase sustainability, productivity and value in the primary industries, and address environmental challenges.

Associate Forestry Minister Meka Whaitiri said the forestry sector provided opportunities for rewarding and lifelong careers.

“The forestry industry is an exciting and evolving and it will need people who can work with robotics, and help develop products and processes to take advantage of engineered timber, new bio-material and bio-energy,” Meka Whaitiri said.

“The sector employs few women and Māori are also under-represented in the professional areas of the industry. I am delighted to be announcing this scholarship programme as it will help us build a highly skilled, safe and higher paid forestry workforce.

“Not only will the successful students be gaining the skills we need, but through the programme’s internships they will also gain valuable industry relationships, along with practical job experience,” Meka Whaitiri said.
