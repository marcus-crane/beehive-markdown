Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has congratulated the 192 New Zealanders recognised in the 2018 Queen’s Birthday honours list, noting that 56 per cent are women, making it the first time ever there are more women than men receiving awards.

 “This list acknowledges a wide range of New Zealanders from all over the country: people who selflessly serve their communities, and people who have achieved something special. Today’s recipients have all contributed to enriching our lives in one way or another.

 “Many are ‘quiet achievers’ who, while not seeking accolades, inspire and encourage us all with their service and dedication. I would include Catherine Healy, who becomes a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit and who has spent decades working behind the scenes to support some of our most vulnerable workers, in that category.

 “Others like the iconic and incorrigible Topp twins are household names. There would be very few New Zealanders who wouldn’t have, at one time or another, been touched in some way by the untouchable Dames, Jools and Lynda. They not only have a wonderful ability to entertain people from all walks of life, but have also been life-long advocates of fairness, equality and diversity.

  “Kristine Bartlett, named New Zealander of the Year in February, is also a shining example of the calibre of this year’s recipients. Kristine paved the way for equal pay, working tirelessly in her unassuming way to make life better for women in the aged-care and support sector.

“And congratulations also go to my former parliamentary colleague The Right Honourable Bill English, whose 28 years of service to New Zealand have been recognised with his appointment as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

 “I also want to acknowledge Waka expert and accomplished carver Hekenukumai (Hek) Busby who was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2014 for his services to Māori. An esteemed Kaumatua and founder of a school for traditional celestial navigation Hek’s continued service is recognised again today with the KNZM.

 “On behalf of all New Zealanders I thank all of today’s recipients. We have been the lucky recipients of their years of service and achievements,” Jacinda Ardern said.
