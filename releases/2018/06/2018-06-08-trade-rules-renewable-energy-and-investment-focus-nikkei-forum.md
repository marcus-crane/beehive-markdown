New Zealand will urge regional leaders to defend the open international trading system, based on enforceable rules, at a meeting in Tokyo next week.

Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker will travel to Japan on Sunday to represent the Government at the 2018 Nikkei International Future of Asia Forum.

The conference brings together leaders from the public and private sectors to discuss issues relevant to Asia-Pacific regional integration, security and the economy.

“I’ll use this opportunity to talk about the importance of defending and promoting a trading system based on rules, and the importance of regional agreements like CPTPP being open to those willing to join,” David Parker said.

“Colombia is the first to formally notify New Zealand, as Depositary, of its interest in joining once CPTPP enters into force.

“I’ll also stress the importance of a trade policy that can contribute to sustainable, progressive and inclusive economic development that benefits all New Zealanders,” he said.

“Japan is one of New Zealand’s most important partners and we have a strong economic relationship. The CPTPP is a tangible example of us working closely together.

“The approaching entry into force of CPTPP will be a good opportunity to discuss emerging areas of cooperation including in the field of renewable hydrogen energy,” David Parker said.

“I am also looking forward to meeting Japanese investors and companies, including in forestry and in the growing renewable energy industry.”

The theme of this year’s forum is “Keeping Asia Open; how to achieve prosperity and stability”.

“New Zealand has much to gain from working with our Asian partners, including Japan as a regional leader, to ensure prosperity and stability across the region as the world faces rising protectionism,” David Parker said.

During his three day visit David Parker will also meet Japanese Government representatives, including his Economy, Trade and Industry counterpart, Minister Hiroshige Seko, Minister in Charge of Economic Revitalization Toshimitsu Motegi, and Environment Minister Masaharu Nakagawa.
