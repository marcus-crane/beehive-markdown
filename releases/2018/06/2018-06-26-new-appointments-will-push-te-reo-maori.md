Today’s appointments to te Taura Whiri i Te Reo Māori Board will mean that the promotion of the Māori language as a living language will be in excellent hands, says the Minister for Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

“I am delighted that Charisma Rangipunga has been reappointed as a member and Deputy Chairperson of the board while Professor Rawinia Higgins has been appointed as chairperson for a three year term. 

“Both appointments will be crucial in the on-going revitalisation of te reo Māori across Aotearoa. These appointments were made from nominations received by Te Mātāwai.” 

Charisma Rangipunga is the Chief Values Office, Ngāi Tahu Holdings and was a member of the Māori Language Advisory Group which reviewed the Māori Language Bill.  

Professor Higgins is a highly respected academic who was made Deputy Vice Chancellor (Māori) at Victoria University in 2016. She also chaired the review of the Māori Language Bill. 

“Te reo Māori is becoming more and more important as a lot more New Zealanders - non-Māori are speaking te reo because they know it’s how they can engage with the Māori economy. These appointments are nationally crucial to that process,” says Nanaia  Mahuta .
