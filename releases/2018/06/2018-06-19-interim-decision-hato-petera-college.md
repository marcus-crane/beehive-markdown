Minister of Education Chris Hipkins has today shared with Hato Petera College’s Commissioner his interim decision to cancel the College’s integration agreement.

“[In April this year](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/future-hato-petera-college-consultation) the proprietor of Hato Petera College, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Auckland, and I decided to initiate a consultation process on the future of the College,” Chris Hipkins says.

"Despite the extensive work of the Commissioner, previous Boards of Trustees, teaching staff and the community, concerns about the College’s finances, human resourcing, curriculum and its low student numbers remain.

"I have considered the submissions received to date and the College’s Commissioner now has up to 28 days to provide any further information on the proposed cancelation of the school’s integration agreement, after which I will make my final decision.

“I’ve announced this publically in the interest of transparency, I will not however be making any further comments until the final decision is made,” Chris Hipkins says.
