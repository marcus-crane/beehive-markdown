Letters of support and a special video message from Minister for Disability Issues Hon Carmel Sepuloni are on their way to our Paralympians as they prepare to compete in South Korea.

“On behalf of all New Zealanders I want to wish the team the very best for competing in the upcoming 2018 Paralympic Winter Games,” Minister Sepuloni said.

The Minister today met with the support team and acknowledged the hard work they are doing in preparing the Paralympians for the event. The dedicated support team will share the video and hand deliver the letters when they join the athletes in PyeongChang.

“Paralympics has an important role in challenging common misconceptions about disabled people,” Minister Sepuloni said.

“It’s important to me we show our appreciation for the talent and hard work that has taken our Paralympians to the top of their sports.

Representing New Zealand are para alpine skiers Corey Peters and Adam Hall and para snowboarder Carl Murphy. Aaron Ewen, an alpine skier, has unfortunately withdrawn due to injury.

The city of PyeongChang is hosting the games which run from 9 to18 March and our New Zealand team is hoping to win at least two medals.

“New Zealand has a great tradition of achievement in the Paralympics, which all New Zealand can be proud of,” says Minister Sepuloni.
