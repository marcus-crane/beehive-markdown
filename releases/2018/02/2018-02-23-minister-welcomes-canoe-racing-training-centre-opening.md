Acting Sport and Recreation Minister Peeni Henare congratulates Canoe Racing New Zealand and the Waipa District Council on today opening the newly constructed High Performance Training Centre and Perry Community Water Sports Centre at Lake Karapiro, Cambridge. 

“It’s incredibly exciting to be here for the opening, with the added buzz around our elite women who won four medals at the World Championships last year competing in the NZCT Canoe Racing National Championship this weekend – and I’m sure the local community feels as inspired as I do,” Minister Henare says.

The shared facility aims to drive efficiencies and bring economic benefits to the region through events and programmes, while building on Cambridge’s ‘Home of Champions’ brand as the host of the Avantidrome and Rowing New Zealand High Performance Training Centre. 

“The model for this facility is a great example of how high performance athletes and community groups can share space and complement one another. The Government is proud to invest in this project, to provide a world class daily training environment for elite athletes and inspire our youth to be physically active and healthy. 

“Making the move from Auckland has been a collaborative effort to leverage the resources and capability that Rowing New Zealand, Cycling New Zealand and High Performance Sport New Zealand already have in place here in Cambridge, and I’d like to recognise Sport NZ as the funder for having the vision to bring these facilities together for tremendous mutual benefit.”
