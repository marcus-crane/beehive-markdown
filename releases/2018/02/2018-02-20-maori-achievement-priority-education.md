The Government’s three-year education work programme prioritises lifting achievement for Māori students, Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis says.

Today Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced a comprehensive work programme to ensure the education system delivers for New Zealand children and their families, with a focus on lifting Māori achievement.

“The gap between the educational achievement of Māori students and the total population is substantial and persistent,” Mr Davis says.

“Even though results in Māori-medium education are better, near that of the total population, significant numbers of Māori students do not go on to any tertiary education.

“Too many Māori students are disengaged from the school system or not progressing to tertiary education. Remedying this situation is a key focus of our education work programme over the next three years.”

Work being undertaken to lift Māori achievement includes a refresh of Ka Hikitia (Māori Education Strategy); strengthening the Māori-medium education pathway; providing long term solutions for the supply of te reo teachers; and improving the transition of students from school to further education and training or work.

“One of the biggest levers we have to raise Māori achievement is to strengthen teaching – in English and Māori-medium schools,” Mr Davis says.  

“That means ensuring we have a pipeline of te reo competent teachers and making the most of initial teacher education and professional learning and development to support the teaching workforce to be confident and culturally competent in our classrooms.  

“We expect that better integration of Māori language and culturally responsive teaching and learning practice across the whole education system will provide significant leverage for addressing the inequity that currently exists.

“How the education system can be more equitable for tamariki and rangatahi, and its role in protecting te reo and fostering Māori identity and culture will be key themes at Minister Hipkins’ Education Summits in May. I encourage hapū and iwi as well as Māori educationalists to get involved and contribute to the discussion.”
