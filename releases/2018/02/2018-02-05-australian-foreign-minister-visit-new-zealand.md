Foreign Affairs Minister, Rt Hon Winston Peters, has announced the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon Julie Bishop, is visiting New Zealand this week. 

The two Foreign Ministers will meet in Auckland on Friday and Saturday 9 & 10 February for the formal six monthly foreign policy discussion between the two countries. 

“Australia is New Zealand’s most important bilateral partner and our discussion will help ensure the trans-Tasman relationship is working effectively,” said Mr Peters. 

“This meeting is part of the regular foreign policy consultation with Australia. We will discuss in depth the global and regional issues where we have shared interests,” he said. 

The two Foreign Ministers last met in November at the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Viet Nam. The Foreign Minister meeting in Auckland will also prepare the way for the annual meeting of New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers due to take place in March in Australia.
