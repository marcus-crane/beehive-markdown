Waitangi Day will see people throughout Aotearoa joining together to mark the signing of our country’s foundation document Te Tiriti o Waitangi and commemorating it in a variety of ways, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Jacinda Ardern says.

“This year sees $288,000 in grants from the Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund distributed to community groups up and down the country for activities which will deepen our understanding of what Te Tiriti means for us.

“No matter where you are on February 6 the chances are there’ll be a brilliant local, free, family-event in close proximity.

“From Northland to Taranaki and from Hawkes Bay to Canterbury, Southland and the Chatham Islands, the Fund supports a diverse range of activities recognising the 178th signing of Te Tiriti.

“In Canterbury the Cheviot Community Culture Club is hosting *The Treaty Trail*, an *Amazing Race* type event, featuring nine challenges based on the nine Treaty documents and in the Hawkes Bay the Waitangi Festival @ Clive features a treaty pageant re-enactment. 

“In Auckland the Kelston Community Hub is hosting an event for migrant and refugee communities to find out more about the Treaty, while at Kawatiri, Westport, Māori health providers Poutini Waiora are hosting a commemoration which offers people the opportunity to sign a large-scale replica of Te Tiriti.

“There will also be events held at other times to recognise significant days for Te Tiriti; in Marlborough for example a hīkoi to Port Underwood, Cloudy Bay on June 17 will celebrate the Treaty signing there on that day in 1840.

“I’m heading to Waitangi today (Feb 1) and on Friday get the chance to open Nigel Brown’s *Concerning Nurture Exhibition* at Te Kōngahu Museum. On Monday evening I’ll be attending the Royal New Zealand Navy *Beat the Retreat* and Sunset Ceremony on the upper Treaty Grounds.

“On Waitangi Day itself, I’m privileged to be speaking at the Dawn Service at te Whare Rūnanga. Coupled with my schedule of valuable hui I’m looking forward to meeting people at the breakfast and joining them at Waitangi’s annual festival.

“Our national day gives us the opportunity to reflect on what it means to be a New Zealander and how Te Tiriti o Waitangi is crucial to this understanding,” Jacinda Ardern said.
