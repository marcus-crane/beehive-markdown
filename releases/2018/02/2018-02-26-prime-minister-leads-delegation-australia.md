Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will lead a delegation to Australia this week for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will host the meeting in Sydney on Friday. The delegation will leave early on Thursday evening.

“Australia is our largest economic partner and this is a relationship that matters to both our countries,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“About 18,000 Australian companies do business here each year. The annual Leaders’ Meeting fixture recognises the significance of the connection between our two countries.

“I look forward to discussing a range of topics with Prime Minister Turnbull, building on our meeting in Sydney late last year. 

“I expect we will use this opportunity to take stock of the trans-Tasman relationship, including our Single Economic Market, and the situation of New Zealanders living in Australia. We will also cover other international issues of mutual interest.”                 

The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister, Winston Peters, and seven New Zealand Ministers. 

A delegation of senior business leaders will also travel with the Prime Minister to Sydney and, during the visit, the two Prime Ministers will speak to business leaders from both countries at the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum.
