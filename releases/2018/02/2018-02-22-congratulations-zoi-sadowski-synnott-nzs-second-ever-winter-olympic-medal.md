Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson congratulates snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott on winning the bronze medal in the Women’s Big Air at the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea today.

“It was such a thrill to watch Zoi win New Zealand’s second ever Winter Olympic medal – this is history being written, and I couldn’t be prouder to be here representing our Government today,” Grant Robertson says.

“What made it even more special is that Zoi is only 16 years old – now our youngest ever Olympic medallist. It was an incredible performance and she handled the pressure amazingly well to win New Zealand’s first Winter Olympic medal in 26 years.

“Kiwis achieving excellence on the world stage is a source of our national identity, pride, and inspiration – especially for our young people. I’m sure everyone back home joins me in applauding this stellar effort,” Grant Robertson says.

**Note to editors:**

New Zealand sent its first Winter Olympic team to the VI Olympic Winter Games in Oslo, Norway in 1952. Annelise Coberger won New Zealand’s first ever Winter Olympic medal in ski slalom at the XVI Olympic Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992.

The XXIII Olympic Winter Games are being held until 25 February in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province. This is the first time the Olympic Winter Games have been held in Korea in 30 years, after the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988.

Hon Grant Robertson is visiting the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang in his capacity as Sport and Recreation Minister. He is also meeting with some of his international counterparts and officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
