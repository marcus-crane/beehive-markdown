The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will provide $17.5 million to help create jobs, address infrastructure deficits, diversify the regional economy and enhance the tourism opportunities that exist in Northland, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones has announced today.

“Northland has enormous untapped potential and – after years of neglect – I’m looking forward to seeing what the PGF can do in partnership with the region to transform this beautiful part of the country,” Mr Jones says.

“Tourism is a growing sector with far-reaching benefits but Northland is severely restricted in terms of capacity to both keep up with demand, and capitalise on the opportunities that tourism presents for Northland.

“Northland has higher than average unemployment so a huge focus for the region is to create sustainable jobs and get more young people into education, training and employment.

“This Government is committed to doing that, and the PGF can help provide the much-needed investment Northland needs to kick-start this momentum.

“Today, we’re announcing support for two cultural centres in Opononi and Whangarei, a Tōtara industry pilot to explore a new market in the forestry sector, the construction of a new tourism hub in Kawakawa and a long-awaited roading project to greatly improve safety, reduce congestion and support the overall economic growth of the region.

“This is just the beginning for Northland with further announcements expected in the coming weeks,” Mr Jones says.
