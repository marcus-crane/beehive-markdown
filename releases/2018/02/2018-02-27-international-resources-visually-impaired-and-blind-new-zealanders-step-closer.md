The Government today paved the way for the 168,000 New Zealanders with print disabilities to have greater access to copyright works in accessible formats, including Braille and large print.

 Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi spoke on the Marrakesh Treaty in Parliament today, a requirement in order for the Treaty to progress.

 “Currently, it is estimated that only 10 percent of written material worldwide are published in accessible formats. This lack of access to copyright works can make it difficult for people with print disabilities to participate in public life and restricts their employment, education, and recreational opportunities. Simply – it does not assist them to live their best lives.

 “As a Government we want this to change.

 “There are 168,000 people with print disabilities – and that number will grow as our population ages. All of these people deserve to fully access resources that are available in comparable countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Singapore who have already signed up. So I am delighted to enable progress today through this treaty.”

 The Marrakesh Treaty is a multilateral treaty which makes it easier to share copyright works in accessible formats across borders.

 "New Zealand already has an exception in the Copyright Act 1994 that allows organisations like the Blind Foundation to make accessible format copies of works for the benefit of individuals with a print disability, however producing a Braille copy of a book can cost around $5000.  The cost of producing accessible format copies, and the challenges involved in importing such copies from other countries, means that material available in accessible formats is limited.

 “Enacting the Marrakesh Treaty will make a real difference to the lives of those who use these resources, their family and community.”

 “I also commend the work that key organisations such as the Blind Foundation and Copyright Licensing New Zealand are doing to bring organisations that represent the visually impaired and organisations that represent the interests of copyright owners together. Through initiatives such as the Accessible Formats Forum they are working alongside Government to improve access and assist in the smooth implementation of the Treaty.

 Changes to be made to the Copyright Act will enable New Zealand to join the Marrakesh Treaty and allow for the importation of accessible format copies produced in other countries. It will also expand the group of organisations and individuals able to produce and provide accessible format copies works for individuals with a print disability.

 Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni said she welcomed the Treaty as progress towards this government’s intent to create a fully inclusive New Zealand.  

 “Accessibility is a key focus of the Government’s disability strategy and enacting the Marrakesh Treaty sends a strong signal.

 “It’s about making information accessible to those with print disabilities so that they can fully participate in society and be involved in decision making. Removing disabling barriers for people with disabilities is crucial to support them to fulfil their aspirations.”
