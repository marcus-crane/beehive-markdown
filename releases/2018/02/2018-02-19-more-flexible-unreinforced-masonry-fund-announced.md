Further changes have been made to the $4.5 million Unreinforced Masonry Buildings Securing Fund (URM Fund) for large and complex buildings that require securing work.

“These changes to the URM fund support building owners to complete important securing work in order to reduce risks to public safety in the event of another significant earthquake in the region,” says Minister for Building and Construction Jenny Salesa.

“The more flexible nature of the URM fund will provide certainty for building owners with large and complex buildings.”

Buildings that are defined as large and complex can now apply to receive up to $65,000 for securing work. This is an increase from the previous funding cap of $25,000.

The newly created definition of large and complex buildings is, buildings that are three storeys or more. These types of buildings require more remedial work to be secured than buildings two storeys and under. 

“Changes to the URM Fund are in direct response to feedback from councils and building owners in affected areas. We recognise the fact that owners of large and complex buildings have greater costs, and are responding to this need.  

“The new funding cap will help building owners to find the best and fastest solutions to securing their buildings,” says Ms Salesa.
