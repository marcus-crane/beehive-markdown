Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods today opened the next round of the Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund for applications.

 

“Round four has funding of up to $4 million available.

 

“The Fund was established to encourage innovation and investment to accelerate the uptake of low emission vehicles. It offers up to 50 per cent funding for projects, with applicants required to match or exceed the amounts granted.

 

“Since its launch in 2016, the Fund has invested in a total of 49 projects (from 183 proposals).

 

“To date $10.1 million has been committed to a wide variety of projects, with applicants committing to additional co-funding of $18.8 million to get their projects off the ground,” Dr Woods said.

 

“A number of round one and two projects are already operational, while others are expected to be fully completed in 2019, and a small number of more complex projects due for completion in 2020. 

 

“Meanwhile, work is commencing on round three projects as contracts are finalised.

 

“The Fund has invested in 21 separate infrastructure projects to help create a public network of charging stations throughout the country. Electric vehicles can now travel from Cape Reinga to Bluff using any of the 124 public fast charging stations that are currently operational, with new locations being added all the time.  

 

“Other projects demonstrate how electric vehicles can be effective for a wide range of uses – from public transport and vehicle sharing services to light and heavy vehicle use. The Fund has also assisted organisations from across a broad range of industries to go electric, from waste management to manufacturing, courier and delivery services, vehicle rentals and tourism operators.

 

“Another successful applicant from round three is MITO who will develop a qualifications framework for the inspection, maintenance and servicing of electric vehicles in New Zealand.

“The investment focus for round four will be same as the previous round which encourages projects to fill key gaps in the charging network, and the demonstration of light and heavy electric vehicles.

“While I expect to see proposals in round four that will continue our work in these areas, I’m also looking forward to seeing applications from innovative small businesses keen to embrace low emission vehicles.”

 

Applicants for the fourth funding round have until Wednesday, 11 April 2018 to submit their proposals to EECA.
