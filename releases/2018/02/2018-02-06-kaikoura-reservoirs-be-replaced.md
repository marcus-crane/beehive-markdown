The government is providing $676,000 to replace water reservoirs and incoming pipes in Kaikōura district damaged in the 14 November 2016 earthquake, Minister of Civil Defence Hon Kris Faafoi says.

The funding allows Kaikōura District Council to build a new reservoir to build the resilience and reliability of the freshwater supply.

 Kaikōura’s Ford 1 and Ford 2 reservoir tanks were severely damaged in the November 2016 quake. While temporary repairs have been made to one tank, allowing it to be returned to service, both tanks are now at the end of their useful lives and are expected to fail if there is another significant shake.

 “These tanks are critical to maintaining the supply of fresh water to most urban residents and businesses” Mr Faafoi says, “so this funding will allow the two damaged tanks and incoming pipework to be replaced within 15 months with a single reservoir of equivalent capacity.”

The funding for the reservoir and incoming pipework replacement is the first drawn down from a $2.4 million fund set aside to help Kaikōura District Council upgrade damaged infrastructure, rather than just repairing it. The fund is in addition to the Crown’s usual contribution of 60 percent of costs of repairing three waters (drinking water, waste water and storm water) infrastructure.

 “This funding recognises that Kaikōura District Council needs extra support,” Mr Faafoi says. “It is the second smallest council in New Zealand, with a tiny rating base. Every extra $58,000 the council has to spend on repairs would mean a one percent increase in rates. Clearly the kind of investment Kaikōura needs after the 2016 quakes, providing needed infrastructure that is resilient to the ongoing seismic risk, isn’t manageable from rates alone.

“So I am pleased the Government can confirm this funding to help ensure the community has the infrastructure it needs now and in future. The re-opening of the Harbour was a really positive step I was able to see for myself recently and this is another. As I said then, there has been progress but there is still work to be done. We are still here and we will keep working with the community as long as we need to.”

The government is also continuing to support Kaikōura, Hurunui and Marlborough District Councils to repair quake damage to three waters infrastructure through the usual 60 per cent Crown contribution.
