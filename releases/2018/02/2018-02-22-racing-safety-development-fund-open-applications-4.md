The second round of Racing Safety Development Fund applications is open, Minister for Racing Winston Peters announced today.

The Racing Safety Development Fund has been operating for ten years and has two funding rounds per year. The second funding round for 2017/18 has $340,045 available for allocation.

“New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses so it’s important we help ensure health and safety standards for the animals, riders, officials and spectators,” Mr Peters says.

“Past projects have included improvements for irrigation and drainage, lighting upgrades, safety running rails and grandstand repair.”

On-line applications must be submitted by 28 March 2018.
