“The Conference provides an opportunity to reinforce the importance our region places on enhancing human security and protecting our peoples from harm,” said Mr Tabuteau.

“It further reaffirms the role that the Pacific can play in protecting and strengthening global norms and in advancing the scope and span of humanitarian law,” he said.
