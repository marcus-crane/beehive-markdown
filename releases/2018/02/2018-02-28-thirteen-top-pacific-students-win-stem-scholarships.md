The Minister for Pacific Peoples, Hon Aupito William Sio has awarded thirteen top Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) scholarships to students of Pacific descent from all across New Zealand.

“I’m excited that this year we are able to support more Pacific students studying STEM subjects in disciplines and career-pathways Pacific people are under-represented in,” says Mr Sio.

The Government’s Fees-free policy introduced for first-year students has meant the Ministry for Pacific Peoples could increase the scope of scholarship support to Pacific students pursuing STEM majors in 2018.

“I want to see more Pacific people pursuing STEM majors so that we grow our workforce to become well equipped for the changing working environment with the intellectual and practical skills to power a sustainable economy that benefits all our families, our community and New Zealand.

“It’s vital that our students succeed, as Pacific success is important to this Government and critical to Pacific people’s contribution towards growing a sustainable economy that is fair to all New Zealanders.

“That’s why the Ministry has put in place agreements with participating universities to provide pastoral care with academic and cultural support essential for student success.

The Ministry for Pacific Peoples Toloa programme provides Pacific students with STEM scholarships for their tertiary studies and Minister Sio will present their awards at the Toloa Scholarships ceremony in Auckland this evening.

“I congratulate all the winners and their families. As recipients of the Toloa scholarships you each become role models for all our Pacific youth and we are extremely proud of your achievements,” says Mr Sio.
