Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Wendy Hinton as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Turkey.

“New Zealand and Turkey enjoy a warm relationship, based on our shared Gallipoli heritage,” says Mr Peters. “Turkey is a generous host of annual Anzac Day commemorations and welcomes many New Zealanders each year.

“The Ambassador will play an important role in strengthening our relationship with Turkey and exploring opportunities to expand our trade and economic relationship.

“Turkey is a significant Middle East regional player, and provides New Zealand with useful insights into current turmoil in the region. Turkey also hosts more than 3 million refugees from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.”

Ms Hinton has held a number of key positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and was most recently Ambassador to Poland and Ukraine.

In addition to Turkey, Ms Hinton will be accredited to Israel and Jordan.
