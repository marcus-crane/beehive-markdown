A report from the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee confirms the Government is on the right track to prepare New Zealand for the future of mobility, Transport Minister Phil Twyford says.

The Government’s response to the report was presented to Parliament today and highlights that 12 of 14 recommendations from the Select Committee are already being implemented, and the Government is achieving the intent of the remaining two.

The report investigated how changing transport technology, and social and economic trends, can improve our mobility by enhancing productivity, social connectedness and road safety, while reducing costs and the impact on the environment.

“In most cases, these recommendations align with initiatives we’re either already doing, planning, or considering as part of our current work streams,” says Phil Twyford.

“The Government is determined to ensure New Zealand’s transport system encourages all modes of transport. These recommendations back our commitment to promoting the use of electric vehicles, improving shared mobility, encouraging walking and cycling, and ensuring the transport system is accessible and safe for all users.

 

“I am very pleased to be able to say the future of New Zealand’s mobility is on the right track and this Government will ensure this positive and meaningful trajectory continues,” Phil Twyford says.
