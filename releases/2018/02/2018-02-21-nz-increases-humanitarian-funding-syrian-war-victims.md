Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced that New Zealand will make a further $1.5 million in humanitarian assistance available to help people affected by the on-going conflict in Syria.

“The situation for civilians in Syria remains dire, with more than 13 million people requiring humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs,” Mr Peters says.

“The public infrastructure in Syria has been devastated. More than half the medical clinics and one in three schools have been destroyed. Access to safe drinking water is limited for much of the population.” 

“The funding announced today will be delivered via the International Committee of the Red Cross which will and will help provide food assistance, access to water and sanitation, and medical support to hospitals and health centres in Syria.

“New Zealand also calls on all sides to respect international law, protect civilians, and ensure rapid and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel and delivery of aid.”

This latest contribution brings New Zealand’s total humanitarian funding for the Syrian crisis to $23.5 million to Syria since 2011.
