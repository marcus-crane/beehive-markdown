Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Regional Economic Fletcher Tabuteau has congratulated Minister Jones on launching the Provincial Growth Fund in Gisborne today.

A key component of the coalition agreement between Labour and New Zealand First was the establishment of a $1 billon per annum regional development fund.

“This Government is committed to our regions and the Provincial Growth Fund demonstrates how serious we are about providing economic opportunities to all parts of New Zealand,” says Under-Secretary Tabuteau.

“There is huge potential in New Zealand’s provinces and this Fund will allow central Government to form genuine partnerships with local councils, iwi, business owners, community organisations and other private sector entities to unlock this potential.

“One of my focuses is to support the work of economic development agencies, organisations and governance groups, and I look forward to supporting Māori economic development so we can all reach the goals articulated in regional economic action plans.

“With better resourcing, we are now in a position to create jobs, enable long-term sustainable growth, and enhance social inclusion for all New Zealanders.”
