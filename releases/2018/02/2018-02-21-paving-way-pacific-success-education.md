The Government’s three year work programme for Education reaffirms our commitment to lifting and sustaining achievement for Pacific children and young people, says Associate Education Minister Jenny Salesa.

“Our work programme announced today places a high priority on improving Pacific student achievement and reflects our commitment to ensuring the education system is responsive to Pacific children, families and communities.” says Ms Salesa.

Priority areas for Pacific education will focus on quality teaching and the role of Pacific identities, language and culture, and powerful connections with parents, families and communities.

“While there have been some improvements in Pacific participation in the education system, there are still serious inequities that impact Pacific children and young peoples’ ability to achieve their potential. 

“A whole of system response is needed so that every Pacific person gets a quality education and is successful.

“I am also keen to develop strong connections across my portfolios. For example I see an opportunity for young people to undertake training and education in the Building and Construction sector. There are long term sustainable career opportunities for young people that choose a trade.

“Our Pacific children and young people deserve choices so they can make informed decisions that will get them into secure jobs, and be trailblazers in any field or profession they want.

“Parents, families and communities also deserve the opportunity to participate effectively in the system, so that they too can support the decisions their children and young people make.

“I invite our children, young people, parents and Pacific communities to engage in the Education Summits to collectively drive change so that the education system delivers for all,” Ms Salesa said.

This is an exciting opportunity for the Pacific community to engage in the future of education in New Zealand.
