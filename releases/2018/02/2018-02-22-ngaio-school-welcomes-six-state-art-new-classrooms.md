Wellington’s Ngaio School is welcoming in the new school year with the completion of six new classrooms.

The project was needed to replace some deficient and ageing infrastructure, as well as adding an additional classroom for roll growth, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

“The two buildings which made up Block C had significant weathertightness issues, and have been replaced with six new classrooms, as well as modern toilet facilities.”

Strengthening work on another of the school’s blocks and some general minor repairs was also part of the $3.3 million project, which was completed on budget.

The new classrooms will have a flexible design to allow for an innovative learning environment with resources for collaborative teaching and learning.

Mr Hipkins said the project reflects Ngaio’s vibrant, growing community.

“Like many areas, Ngaio School is at the heart of its community, and I think everyone can be proud of its new modern facilities.”
