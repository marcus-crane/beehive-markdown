Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says New Zealand is making available an initial $750,000 to support relief efforts in Tonga following Cyclone Gita.

“Initial assessments of the damage are still coming in. However, it is clear that Cyclone Gita has caused significant damage,” Mr Peters says.

“This is an initial contribution that will enable us to respond quickly to requests from the Government of Tonga to meet immediate needs, such as emergency shelter, water and sanitation. We stand ready to provide additional support as the extent of the damage becomes clear,” he says.

“We will also be responding to requests for assistance from New Zealanders in Tonga.”

“Given the force of this Cyclone all signs point to a lengthy clean-up effort and our thoughts are with the Government and people of Tonga as they come to terms with the scale of this disaster,” Mr Peters says.
