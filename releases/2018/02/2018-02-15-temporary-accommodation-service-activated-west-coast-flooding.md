West Coast residents hit by flooding caused by ex-Tropical Cyclone Fehi can now access help finding temporary accommodation with the Government activating the Temporary Accommodation Service, Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development Jenny Salesa announced today.

“The Temporary Accommodation Service (TAS) has been activated by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to help people whose homes were damaged by the extreme weather and flooding on 1 February 2018, when ex-Tropical Cyclone Fehi hit New Zealand,” says Ms Salesa.

“TAS is working with local authorities to assess the damage and establish how many homes will need to be repaired or rebuilt, but it is clear assistance finding temporary accommodation will be required for a number of households.

“The TAS team will collect registrations from displaced people who require temporary accommodation, establish what accommodation options are suitable, and match them accordingly.

“The service has proved very successful in the Christchurch and Kaikoura earthquakes, and the Edgecumbe floods, and the level of damage and displacement justifies us establishing this service in the West Coast.

“I urge anyone who has a current or expected need following the flooding on the West Coast to register their details at [http://www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz/](http://www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz/) or alternatively, call 0508 754 163 to discuss your requirements.

“I would also urge tenants and landlords of rental properties to visit [http://www.tenancy.govt.nz/](http://www.tenancy.govt.nz/) to familiarise themselves with their tenancy rights and obligations following an event like this.”

The Temporary Accommodation Service continues to provide support to households following the November 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, and the April 2017 Edgecumbe floods, and has received 434 and 147 registrations from households in those areas respectively. The same team also helped more than 6,500 households affected by the Canterbury earthquakes find temporary accommodation, over 1,100 of which were in Government established villages.
