Justice Minister Andrew Little will today represent New Zealand at the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The annual World Government Summit brings together political, business and civil society thought leaders to focus on how humanity can harness innovation and technology to solve universal challenges.

The UAE is an important partner for New Zealand and our 16th largest export market. Dubai is a gateway to the Middle East and North African region for our exporters and is an important hub for tourists travelling to New Zealand. Mr Little will meet with senior Emirati leaders to further strengthen New Zealand’s relationship with the UAE.

Andrew Little has just visited Iraq and Afghanistan with Defence Minister Ron Mark.
