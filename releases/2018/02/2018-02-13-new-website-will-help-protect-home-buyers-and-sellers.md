Associate Justice Minister Hon Aupito William Sio today launched a new website *Settled.govt.nz* for people selling or buying houses.

Mr Sio says the website will help New Zealanders with what can be their biggest financial decision and the complex process of buying and selling a house.

“Buying a house is often the biggest financial commitment families make and it’s also hugely significant for New Zealanders to have that family home.

“We want to ensure that everyone buying or selling is able to get good independent advice throughout the process.”

*Settled.govt.nz* is hosted by the Real Estate Authority (formerly Real Estate Agents Authority). The Real Estate Authority is the Crown entity responsible for the regulation of real estate agents under the Real Estate Agents Act.

Mr Sio says *Settled.govt.nz* supports the Government’s focus on protecting the rights of New Zealanders when they are buying and selling property.

“*Settled.govt.nz* is a comprehensive and useful source of independent guidance that will be a huge help to New Zealanders when they are involved in real estate transactions. I believe settled.govt.nz will empower Kiwis and help them make good decisions when they are buying and selling their homes,” Mr Sio says.

The [website](http://www.settled.govt.nz/) was launched at a reception at Parliament today hosted by the Minister.
