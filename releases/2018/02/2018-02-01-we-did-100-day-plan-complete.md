The completion of the Government’s 100 Day Plan today demonstrates its commitment to setting the direction for a stronger and fairer future for New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.

“We promised we would be a different government, one that makes dealing with the big challenges like child poverty, housing and climate change a priority. Over the past 100 days we have delivered on that promise.

“Today we announced a Royal Commission of Inquiry into historical abuse of children in state care – the final commitment in the Government’s 100-Day Plan.

“Yesterday, I announced my Government’s targets to halve child poverty and material deprivation, and set New Zealand on a path to becoming the best performing country in the world for child well-being.

“We said we would give renters confidence that their homes would be warm and dry and we did, by legislating for healthy homes.

“We said we’d make post-secondary education fees free for the first year and we have.

“We said we’d resume contributions to the Superfund, and we began payments within a few weeks of taking office last year.

“We have also started work on a Climate Commission, introduced changes to employment law to bring fairness back to the workplace, established the Pike River Agency and taken a huge step toward cutting child poverty by lifting incomes through our Families Package.

“Through these achievements, and the programme of work that will follow, we will demonstrate that it is possible to have a strong, growing economy while looking after people and the environment at the same time.

“The 100 day plan was just the beginning. There’s a lot left to do to restore the public services that keep us connected and strong, and to build a sustainable, growing economy, that works for everyone."
