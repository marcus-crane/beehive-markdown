Applications open today for health scholarships designed to provide opportunities for Māori in the health and disability sector.

Announcing the opening of applications for Hauora Māori Scholarships 2018, Associate Minister of Health Jenny Salesa says the scholarships are a great opportunity for students and health care workers committed to training and excellence.

"These scholarships offer support to assist students to achieve, and to excel in their chosen health career,” Jenny Salesa says.

She says enhancing and encouraging Māori representation in the health workforce is hugely important so that the system responds effectively to the needs of Māori.

“From community health workers, to dentistry, dietitians, health management and more, these scholarships provide for a range of exciting opportunities.

“The New Zealand health system will benefit from the depth and diversity of recipients.”

There are 11 scholarship categories and three special award categories: the Excellence Awards, the John McLeod Award and Te Apa Māreikura Award. The scholarships and awards range in value from $1000 to $10,000 each.

To be eligible for a Hauora Māori Scholarship, applicants must be a student enrolled and attending a university, polytechnic, wānanga or private training establishment based in New Zealand and have whakapapa and/or cultural links with Te Ao Māori or Māori communities.

They must demonstrate a commitment to and/or competence in Māori health and wellbeing and be studying a health or disability-related, NZQA accredited course.

Online applications open at 5pm today (14 February) and close on 28 March.
