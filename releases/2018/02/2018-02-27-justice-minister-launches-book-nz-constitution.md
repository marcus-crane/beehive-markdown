Justice Minister Andrew Little will officially launch a new book, *This Realm of New Zealand: The Sovereign, the Governor-General, the Crown* at Parliament this evening.

The book has been written by Dame Alison Quentin-Baxter, a distinguished public and international lawyer and former Law Commission president, and Professor Janet McLean, a University of Auckland professor of law. 

“I would like to acknowledge Dame Alison’s and Professor McLean’s valuable contribution to constitutional scholarship and debate in New Zealand.

“*This Realm of New Zealand: The Sovereign, the Governor-General, the Crown* will enhance understanding of our unwritten constitution, particularly as it relates to the Queen, her representative the Governor-General, the institution of the Crown, and how we engage with our government and elected representatives,” Andrew Little said.

*This Realm of New Zealand: The Sovereign, the Governor-General, the Crown* is published by Auckland University Press.
