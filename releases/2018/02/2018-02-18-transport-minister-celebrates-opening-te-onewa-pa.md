Minister of Transport, Phil Twyford, has this morning opened the recently upgraded Te Onewa Pā, located under the northern end of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, with a dawn blessing.

“Te Onewa Pā holds a special place in Māori and Auckland history.  This work acknowledges the cultural and historical importance of the area,” says Phil Twyford.

The upgrade work includes a new walkway, replacement of a pedestrian bridge, fencing, planting and landscaping and is the final part of a wider upgrade programme which started in 2010.  

The pouwhenua, carved from heart Totara by Reuben Kirkwood of Ngā Tai ki Tāmaki, was revealed during the dawn blessing and recognises the whakapapa of mana whenua.

Sensitive and respectful construction and landscaping methods were developed in partnership and included using ponga logs and native eco-sourced plants to stabilise areas, re-using existing post holes wherever possible and specialist supervision and monitoring.

“Close collaboration with Iwi, Auckland Council, Heritage NZ and the NZ Transport Agency has created an opportunity to share, respect, protect and celebrate the cultural history and identity of this site, while clever design minimising ground disturbance, has helped to preserve it for future generations,” Phil Twyford says.
