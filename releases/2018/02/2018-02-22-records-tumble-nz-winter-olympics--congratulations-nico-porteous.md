Records continue to tumble for New Zealand at the Winter Olympic Games, with Nico Porteous’ bronze medal in the men’s ski halfpipe, Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson says. This makes Nico our youngest ever Olympic medallist the same afternoon as fellow 16-year old Zoi Sadowski-Synnott achieved the same feat.

“After waiting 26 years to add to New Zealand’s only Winter Olympics medal, these two amazing young New Zealanders will each be bringing home a bronze medal from PyeongChang, South Korea.

“In doing so, both became the youngest New Zealand Olympic medallists across summer and winter games – Nico being a few months younger than Zoi.

“The New Zealand contingent was buzzing as we made the mad dash from Zoi’s awesome performance to watch our skiers in the men’s halfpipe. The day just kept getting better, with Nico landing our first ever men’s Winter Olympic medal.

“I’d also like to congratulate Beau-James Wells for finishing fourth in the same event and mention his brother Byron’s efforts to get the final. All this after amazing efforts from our Men’s Speed Skating team and our other athletes – New Zealand’s representatives here are doing us all proud,” Grant Robertson says.

**Note to editors:**

New Zealand sent its first Winter Olympic team to the VI Olympic Winter Games in Oslo, Norway in 1952. Annelise Coberger won New Zealand’s first ever Winter Olympic medal in ski slalom at the XVI Olympic Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992.

The XXIII Olympic Winter Games are being held until 25 February in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province. This is the first time the Olympic Winter Games have been held in Korea in 30 years, after the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988.

Hon Grant Robertson is visiting the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang in his capacity as Sport and Recreation Minister. He is also meeting with some of his international counterparts and officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
