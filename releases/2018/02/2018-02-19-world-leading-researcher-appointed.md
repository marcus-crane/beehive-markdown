The University of Auckland has welcomed the appointment of a world leader in Augmented Reality (AR), Professor Mark Billinghurst, to its Entrepreneurial Universities programme, Minister of Education Chris Hipkins announced today.

The Entrepreneurial Universities programme aims to bring world-leading innovative academics with commercialisation experience and their teams here to improve links between universities and industry and to develop New Zealand’s pipeline of entrepreneurial students.

“Professor Billinghurst will lead a research team at the University’s Auckland Bioengineering Institute.” Mr Hipkins said.

“Together they will continue their work on Empathic Computing and how AR and Virtual Reality can be used to enhance face to face and remote collaboration, further strengthening and growing New Zealand’s innovation culture.

“New Zealand is a very attractive place for research but it’s an extremely competitive environment and this scheme helps our universities to attract global talent.

“World-leading academics will bring huge benefits in terms of their knowledge and networks. Our undergraduates can learn from the best, and innovative New Zealand firms can benefit from partnership opportunities with the best of the best in their fields,” Mr Hipkins said.

Over the next three years, the initiative is expected to bring 15-20 world-leading researchers and their teams to New Zealand.
