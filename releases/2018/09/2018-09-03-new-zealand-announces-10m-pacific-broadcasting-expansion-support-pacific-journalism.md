Foreign Minister Winston Peters has today announced plans for an enhanced free-to-air Pasifika TV service, affirming New Zealand’s commitment to Pacific media.

The expanded Pacific Cooperation Broadcasting Ltd service, valued at NZ$10 million over three years, will include a dedicated Pasifika TV channel with New Zealand content, improving both quality and access for free-to-air broadcasters across the region.

The expansion will also include a comprehensive training programme to support broadcasting and journalism across the Pacific, including equipment, internships and cross-regional training.

“The expansion of the Pasifika TV service will dramatically improve the way in which New Zealand content is delivered across the Pacific,” said Mr Peters.

“While the existing service has demonstrated its ability to lift broadcasting and journalism in the region, it is the natural next step to promote the production of more Pacific content, including news and current affairs.

“Informed open conversation, facilitated by the media, is the backbone of transparent governance.  This initiative provides an opportunity to support broadcasters throughout the region to contribute to that debate.”

Mr Peters announced the package at the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru.
