Submissions are rolling in from across New Zealand on the Government’s proposed phase-out of single-use plastic shopping bags, with more than 4,000 received so far.

Now with just over a week of the consultation to go, Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage is encouraging all Kiwis who want to have their say on this issue, to do so.

“New Zealanders have called on the Government to take action on single-use plastic bags, and we’ve listened. Earlier this year I received a petition signed by 65,000 people calling for an outright ban on these bags.

“This consultation is important to ensure we get things right. We want to hear from as many people as possible about factors like how fast we move and which types of plastic bags are included in the mandatory phase out.

“Ultimately phasing out single-use plastic shopping bags will mean a change for all New Zealanders when they purchase their groceries and other retail goods. This is an opportunity for people to have their say on how New Zealand makes this change.

“We use hundreds of millions of single-use plastic shopping bags every year in New Zealand. Far too many of these end up in the environment, particularly our marine environments where they are harming marine life and entering the food chain, which is a real concern for human health.

 “Many other countries have taken action on plastic bags and I am confident we can do this.  We need to ensure the way we make the change is right for the New Zealand context – that’s why submissions are so important and I encourage people to have their say.”

Submissions are open until Friday 14 September. To have your say visit [www.mfe.govt.nz](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/).
