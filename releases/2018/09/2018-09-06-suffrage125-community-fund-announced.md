Acting Minister for Women Eugenie Sage today announced 42 successful applicants for the Suffrage 125 Community Fund, at the Kate Sheppard Memorial in Christchurch.

The fund’s projects commemorate the 125th anniversary of universal suffrage in New Zealand from $300,000 funding in Budget 2018.

“I am pleased to be launching these projects celebrating 125 years of women winning the right to vote,” Ms Sage said.

“The funding decisions announced today allow community groups across the country to recognise women from today and from our history who have led the way for women’s rights. A particular focus is recognition of Māori, Pacific and women of diverse cultures.

“There will be a wide range of activities funded including discovery kits for classrooms around New Zealand and profiling New Zealand women for a Wikipedia Edit-athon.

“An independent panel selected a range of activities across the country following community applications. There was very high interest in this fund and unfortunately the Government could not fund all of the projects that were put forward, I welcome the enthusiasm and dedication to celebrating women.

“I am pleased to be here today with the Canterbury University’s Feminist Society who received $1500 from the fund. The future of women organising for change and making our world better is in good hands,” Ms Sage said.

The priorities for the fund were to celebrate the 125th anniversary of women’s suffrage, encourage participation, support diversity and empower young people.
