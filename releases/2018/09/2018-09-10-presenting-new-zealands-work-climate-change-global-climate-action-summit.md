The Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, is travelling to California tomorrow to present New Zealand’s plans for action on climate change and to gather the latest research and work elsewhere in the world to help us address the issue at home.

The Global Climate Action Summit, being held in San Francisco, will bring together government leaders, businesses, scientists and NGOs at one of the largest gatherings this year to address Climate Change.

“The theme of this Global Climate Action Summit, in San Francisco, is titled ‘Taking Ambition to the Next Level’, and it’s important we continue to build on the momentum established by the Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change,” says James Shaw.

“I will be presenting about the Government’s programme of work on New Zealand’s transition to a low emissions economy, and I will talk about the positive level of commitment that’s coming from New Zealand’s business and farming sectors to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.

“The summit is also an opportunity to learn about latest scientific research on climate change, and to hear about how other countries, cities and businesses are stepping up their work programmes to reduce emissions and operate more sustainably.

“The three day conference will cover all areas of climate change action; from renewable energy systems for the future, to accelerating investment in a low carbon world, to technology development and innovation, and food production in a world affected by climate change.

“The Prime Minister will deliver a video message to the closing plenary of the summit as well, reinforcing the need to maintain a global response, and reinforcing that New Zealand stands alongside our Pacific neighbours for whom climate change is a very real security threat,” says Mr Shaw.
