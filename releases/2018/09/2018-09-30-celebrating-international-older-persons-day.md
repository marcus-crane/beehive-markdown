Today is the International Day of Older Persons, a time to recognise the importance of older people in our society, and the valuable contribution they make every day.

Minister for Seniors, Tracey Martin, said the day was a chance for everyone to celebrate the amazing older people in their lives and to say thank you.

“Throughout New Zealand there are many older people who are doing amazing things. They are contributing as leaders, volunteers, mentors, caregivers, parents, grandparents, employers, workers, friends and colleagues – the list goes on,” says Minister Martin.

“Like the 2018 New Zealander of the Year, Kristine Bartlett who changed the lives of thousands of New Zealand women and low-paid workers by successfully securing equal pay legislation for caregivers in the aged-care sector.  And Kim Workman, social justice advocate and promoter of restorative justice, the 2018 Senior New Zealander of the Year.

“Older people make a hugely positive contribution to our economy. In the future we will need to increasingly rely on that contribution if New Zealand is to grow.”

Currently today there are around 725,000 people aged over 65. By 2028 there will be 1 million people, nearly a quarter of the population.

“Our ageing population is one of our greatest achievements. A growing number of older people are healthier, more educated, and more skilled and are living longer. These are all things to celebrate.”

The theme for this year’s International Day of Older Persons is “Celebrating Older Human Rights Champions.”
