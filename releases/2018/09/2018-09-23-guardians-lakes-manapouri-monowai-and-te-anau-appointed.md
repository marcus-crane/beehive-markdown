Conservation Minister, Eugenie Sage today announced appointments to Guardians of Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau.

“I am pleased to appoint both Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu nominees, Sandra Cook and Jane Kitson, as Guardians of Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau.

“I am also pleased to advise of the re-appointment of Bill Jarvie of Te Anau and the appointment of Laurel Teirney of Dunedin as a Guardian.”

The Guardians of Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau is a statutory body established under the Conservation Act 1987.  It is supported by the Department of Conservation, Te Anau Area Office.

“The role of the Guardians is to advise me on matters arising from environmental, ecological and social impacts of the power schemes on these lakes, as well as advising on the operating guidelines for the lakes,” Eugenie Sage said.

“The eight Guardians bring a broad range of expertise and experience and are passionate about the Fiordland lakes.”

A recent example of the Guardians work was consultation with Meridian Energy Limited to lower the minimum lake level for Te Anau during low inflow periods. The Guardians considered the science behind the proposal but elected against supporting the proposal.
