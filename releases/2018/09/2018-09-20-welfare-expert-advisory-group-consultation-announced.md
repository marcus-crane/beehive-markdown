The Welfare Expert Advisory Group will be undertaking a six week consultation on the future of the welfare system from September 27th.

“It is important that the Advisory Group hears New Zealanders’ views on our welfare system, what is working well and what isn’t, what level of support should be available and what values should underpin New Zealand’s welfare system,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

Advisory Group members will be visiting 16 locations throughout the country, holding community forums and focus group meetings with those who work within or experience the welfare system.  They will also be conducting a survey to ensure that those who can’t attend a Forum can share their views.

“The Advisory Group’s work to review the welfare system to ensure it is accessible and fair to all New Zealanders is part of this Government’s commitment to improving the wellbeing of New Zealanders and their families.

“For the Advisory Group to deliver recommendations that are robust and rigorous enough to last the next 20 years, they must be based on real experiences of those interacting with the welfare system every day and that’s why consultation is so important,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
