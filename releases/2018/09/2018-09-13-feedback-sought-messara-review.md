The public is being asked for feedback on John Messara’s Review of the New Zealand racing industry, Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“As requested, Mr Messara conducted an independent assessment of the state of New Zealand’s racing industry and made a number of recommendations for change,” Mr Peters said.

“The review delivers a blunt appraisal and concludes the New Zealand’s racing industry is in a state of serious malaise. It is important that those most vested in the industry have the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommendations.”

Public consultation will run for five weeks, closing 5pm 19 October 2018.

Feedback can be emailed to [racingreview@dia.govt.nz](mailto:racingreview@dia.govt.nz)
