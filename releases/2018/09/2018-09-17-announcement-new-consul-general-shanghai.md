Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of Andrew Robinson as the new Consul-General in Shanghai.

“Mr Robinson will be responsible for our relationships with Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, as well as Shanghai, which together make up a critical economic region with a population of over 180 million people,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand’s relationship with China is one of our most significant, with extensive political, economic and personal links and exchanges.

“Shanghai is particularly important as China’s commercial and financial centre, and most populous city. It is also home to the largest New Zealand business community in China, and is a vital market for our exports, tourism and education.”

Andrew Robinson is currently a Lead Advisor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, working on New Zealand’s preparation for hosting APEC in 2021, and was previously part of the leadership group for New Zealand’s UN Security Council term. He is a Mandarin speaker who has previously served at the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing.
