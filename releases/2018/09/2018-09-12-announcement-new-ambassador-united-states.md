Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Rosemary Banks as New Zealand’s Ambassador to the United States of America.

The new Ambassador has previously held a number of senior roles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has served as New Zealand’s Ambassador to France and Portugal, as well as Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York.

Ms Banks is currently a Crown Negotiator in the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process, a member of the Council of the University of Canterbury, and a Senior Adjunct Fellow in the Department of Political Science.

“The Government congratulates Rosemary Banks on her appointment. She is a highly experienced diplomat and public servant who will be a consummate professional in representing New Zealand’s interests in Washington,” Mr Peters said.

“The Government also wishes to acknowledge the departing Ambassador, Hon Tim Groser for his service. He has been a strong advocate for New Zealand and has been successful in cementing the relationship between our two countries.”
