Finance Minister Grant Robertson today announced three new appointments to the Independent Expert Advisory Panel ahead of Phase 2 of the Review of the Reserve Bank Act.

Barbara Chapman, Belinda Moffat and John Sproat join existing members Suzanne Snively (chair), Malcolm Edey and Girol Karacaoglu on the Panel.

“The Review of the Reserve Bank Act is a one-in-thirty-year opportunity to ensure New Zealand has a well-functioning and efficient financial system,” Grant Robertson said.

“Phase 1 of the Review considered and recommended changes to New Zealand’s monetary policy framework. These included that the Reserve Bank considers maximum sustainable employment alongside its price stability mandate, which it is now doing.

“Phase 2 will ensure the Reserve Bank Act is fit for purpose and aligned with what the Government considers is a strong, flexible and enduring regulatory framework for the financial system that enjoys broad public and industry support.”

The detailed work of Phase 2 is being led by a joint Reserve Bank and Treasury team. The Review team will shortly release details outlining the Phase 2 process. The previously announced terms of reference for Phase 2 can be found [here](https://treasury.govt.nz/news-and-events/reviews-consultation/reviewing-reserve-bank-act/phase-2-reviewing-reserve-bank-new-zealand-rbnz-act).

The Panel’s role is to provide independent advice to the Minister of Finance on the work being carried out by that team.

“As the terms of reference for Phase 2 are broader and more wide-ranging than Phase 1, the appointments announced today will enhance the existing Panel by adding a mix of regulator and regulated and capital markets advisory experience,” Grant Robertson said.
