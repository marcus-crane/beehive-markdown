Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced four appointments to the Education New Zealand Board.

Former Vice-Chancellor of Massey University and Education Minister Steve Maharey has been appointed as a member of the Board for the next six months. He will step into the Chair role in February 2019 when the current Chair Charles Finny retires from the Board.

Lyn Provost and Rachael Tuwhangai have each been appointed as Board members for three year terms, and Victoria Spackman has been reappointed as member for a three year term.

"I am delighted that Steve Maharey has been appointed to the Education New Zealand Board," Chris Hipkins said.

"Steve has a proven record of leadership and management in both government and tertiary education and brings a great deal of experience to the Board.

"Lyn's extensive knowledge of the government sector and strong governance and leadership skills will be an asset to Education New Zealand. Rachael will bring a fresh perspective to Education New Zealand's work. She has broad education sector experience, as well as digital and ICT skills and the ability to connect with Maori and Pacific communities.”

Chris Hipkins said he is pleased to have retained Victoria's substantial commercial experience on the Board for another three years.

"Departing members Philip Broughton, John Morris and Richard Leggat have contributed valuable advice and expertise to Education New Zealand, and I want to thank them for their service over the past six years."

Education New Zealand is New Zealand's government agency for building international education. It promotes New Zealand as a study destination for international students and supports the delivery of education services offshore. Education New Zealand also administers scholarships to help New Zealanders study overseas.

International education enables New Zealanders to live and learn alongside people from other cultures - make new friends, learn other languages and discover new perspectives.

International education contributes to tourism, regional growth and long-term trade, investment and diplomacy.
