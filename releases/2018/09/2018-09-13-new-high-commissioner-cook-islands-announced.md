Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced today that diplomat Tessa Temata will be New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the Cook Islands.

“New Zealand has a very special relationship with the Cook Islands,” said Mr Peters. 

“We share a strong political and development partnership, with shared regional and international priorities and a common whakapapa that stretches over centuries.

“New Zealand ‘s development programme in the Cook Islands focuses on core infrastructure and social services such as health and education. We are working collaboratively with the Cook Islands Government towards an increasingly mature partnership.” 

Ms Temata is a career diplomat with over 20 years’ experience in development, trade and legal matters. She has worked mainly in the Pacific and has had postings in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Ms Temata is currently the unit manager responsible for Pacific regional trade and values in the Pacific and Development group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade.
