“Today marks the 125th anniversary for women winning their right to vote in Aotearoa New Zealand,” Acting Minister for Women Eugenie Sage said.

“I am immensely proud that Aotearoa New Zealand was the first country in the world where women gained their voting right, and it established our country as world leading for women’s rights.

“We acknowledge the work of Kate Sheppard, Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia, and all of the suffragists who tirelessly campaigned for the vote. We also acknowledge the men who supported the cause and voted for the Bill to pass.

“Today we also need to ask each other: how we can continue to make our country a fairer and better place to continue the legacy of the suffragists.

“Aotearoa New Zealand has a female Prime Minister, we have women in cabinet. And I’m here as Acting Minister because the Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter is on maternity leave. New Zealand is a good place to be a woman!

“This government continues to take action to ensure our country is progressing well for women’s rights. We have extended paid parental leave up to 26 weeks for babies and to ensure workplaces are fairer for women. We are working hard to overhaul pay equity legislation and to end violence against women.

“I am pleased to see so many groups across New Zealand, in schools and businesses, celebrating our this historic anniversary and encouraging people to think about our future.

“Increasing public recognition of women’s achievements can inspire women and girls on their career choices, inspire our next leaders and break down gender stereotypes that exist in society. I look forward to the next generation of New Zealand suffragists,” Eugenie Sage said.
