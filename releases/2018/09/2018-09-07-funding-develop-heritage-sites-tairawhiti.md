The Mt Titirangi – Puhi Kai Iti Connection in Tairāwhiti is set to benefit from investment of up to $6.1 million from the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) Regional Economic Minister Shane Jones announced today.

The investment will fund the Titirangi Summit Upgrade, which includes a visitor facility and carpark redevelopment. This is a significant project that reflects the dual heritage that Māori and European have in the region.

“The PGF funding will help to increase productivity and tourism opportunities in Tairāwhiti by showcasing and celebrating the unique culture and navigational heritage of the region,” Shane Jones said. 

“The Titirangi – Puhi Kai Iti Connection project will recognise important tūpuna, such as Te Maro of Ngāti Oneone, who made a significant contribution to their people and are important to the Tairāwhiti region and to the greater story of Aotearoa New Zealand.

“It is the pinnacle of three Tairāwhiti Navigation Programmes supported by the PGF, which together have the potential to contribute around 44 jobs to the region.

“I’m pleased to be in Tairāwhiti today to announce this funding for what promises to be the jewel in the crown of the nationally significant Tairāwhiti Navigations Programme.

“The Programme aims to bring together the voyaging, arrival and settlement histories from two cultures and provide a world-class heritage experience at key sites based around the Gisborne Inner Harbour,” Shane Jones said. 

Other projects included in the Tairāwhiti Navigations Programme are the Gisborne Inner Harbour improvements and the Cook’s Landing site restoration which has also received $1.6 million from the PGF.

The Mt Titirangi – Puhi Kai Iti Connection is expected to be delivered in time for the 250 year commemoration events in October 2019.
