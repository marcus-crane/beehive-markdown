The public is encouraged to provide feedback on the interim report released today by the Tax Working Group (TWG), Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash said on Thursday.

Since it was set up in January, the group has regularly released policy advice and papers it has received in order to keep the public informed.

“The TWG was asked to consider the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system and we expect it to address those questions,” Grant Robertson says.

“The Government has always been clear that no changes will be implemented this term and that there are key bottom lines. In particular the family home, increases to income tax and GST, and an inheritance tax are off limits,” Grant Robertson says.

“The purpose of the TWG is to ensure our tax system is fit for purpose for today’s New Zealanders and for future generations,” Stuart Nash says.

“We look forward to continuing to hear from the TWG as it considers feedback and prepares its final report for Government which is due in February,” Stuart Nash says.

“We have sent a letter \[attached] to the Group, asking for more information and work in some areas,” Stuart Nash says.

Submissions are open until 1 November 2018 and more information can be found at [https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/](https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/)
