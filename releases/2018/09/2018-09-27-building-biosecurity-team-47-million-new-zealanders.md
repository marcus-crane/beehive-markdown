Minister for Biosecurity Damien O’Connor today calls on every New Zealander to help build a biosecurity team of 4.7 million as part of the *Ko Tātou This Is Us* campaign.

*Ko Tātou This Is Us* is an independent biosecurity brand that aims to connect all of us with the many ways we can help protect Aotearoa from pests and diseases.

“With biosecurity in the spotlight as we attempt to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis, turn away ships to keep the Brown marmorated stink bug out of New Zealand, and deal with the emergence and spread of Myrtle rust and Kauri dieback, now is the time for every New Zealander to stand up and take action on biosecurity,” Damien O’Connor said.

“Biosecurity keeps safe everything that shapes our unique way of life, from the great outdoors we farm, fish, hunt and play in to the biodiversity of our unique ecosystems.

“The campaign includes a beautiful and thought-provoking video, featuring a kuia looking back on her life and urging New Zealanders to understand that everything that shapes our way of life is finite and fragile and that we must all play our part in protecting it from pests and diseases.

“It also focuses on appropriate biosecurity behaviours and actions in three core areas: moving people and goods, vigilance and readiness, and pest and disease control.

“I thank those who have shared their own personal connection to biosecurity as part of this campaign, such as Pro XC Mountain Bike racer and Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Anton Cooper, owner of the largest cooking school in Australasia Sachie Nomura, and Big Angry Fish hosts Milan Radonich and Nathan O’Hearn.

“Together we can make a difference. Together we can keep Aotearoa safe from pests and diseases. Ko Tātou This Is Us,” Damien O’Connor said.
