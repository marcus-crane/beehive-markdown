Rise UP Trust’s application to establish a new designated character school in Auckland has been approved, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“This decision means that the applications from ten charter schools have so far been approved,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Rise UP Academy was facing property issues which prevented its application from going ahead sooner. 

“The immediate issues have now been resolved, and a site for 2019 is in the pipeline.  I have therefore approved Rise UP Academy to be established as a designated character school. 

“I have also appointed the new school’s Establishment Board of Trustees.  They include members of the charter school’s governance board, to provide continuity and support its character.

“I am pleased that we have been able to provide certainty and continuity for the school’s students and staff and wider community.  They will also have the benefit of the added protection and support that the state system provides,” Chris Hipkins said.

Final decisions on the two remaining applications to establish state integrated schools are expected shortly, once integration agreements have been finalised.
