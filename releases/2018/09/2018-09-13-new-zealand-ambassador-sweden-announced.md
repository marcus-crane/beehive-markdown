Foreign Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Andrew Jenks as Ambassador to Sweden.

“New Zealand is establishing the New Zealand Embassy in Stockholm in order to strengthen our relationship with Sweden and neighbouring Nordic countries, which are some of our closest friends in Europe,” said Mr Peters.

“As states that are strongly supportive of democratic values, free and fair trade, the rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes, we are natural partners on the world stage.

“A stronger relationship with Sweden and other Nordic countries will allow New Zealand to advance our interests in the European Union, and take advantage of opportunities arising from an EU-NZ FTA.”

Andrew Jenks is currently Ambassador to Spain, accredited to Morocco, Malta, Holy See and Andorra. He has previously worked in both the Europe Division and the Trade Negotiations Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as assignments to New Zealand’s Embassies in Paris and Jakarta. He has previously also lived in Sweden and worked in a private capacity in Stockholm in the field of trade policy.
