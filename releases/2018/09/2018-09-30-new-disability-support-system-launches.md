A new disability support system prototype starts today in the MidCentral DHB region, offering disabled people and whānau more flexibility and options, announced Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni and Acting Associate Minister of Health James Shaw.

“From today, disabled people and whānau in the MidCentral region will have more control over what supports they need and want, rather than having to choose from a fixed set of options,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“It’s taken 18 months of hard work to develop the new system, Mana Whaikaha, which makes it easier for disabled people to access supports. It has been co-designed with disabled people, whānau and others in the disability sector.

“Mana Whaikaha focuses on what disabled people can do, not what they can’t, and offers flexible options to increase wellbeing and health outcomes for them,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“We are taking a ‘try, learn and adjust’ approach to this new system so we can be innovative and respond to the feedback on what is working and what needs improving,” James Shaw said.

“We look forward to seeing the prototype in action and the results of what happens when disabled people and whānau make decisions about how to use funding for services and supports that are important to them.

“The feedback we receive on the prototype in the MidCentral region will help us develop and refine the new disability support system so it creates the sustainable and meaningful change that we’re all working towards,” James Shaw said.

The Government has committed $21.24 million over the next two years to fund the new system in MidCentral, which includes Palmerston North, Horowhenua, Manawatu, Ōtaki and Tararua districts.

Both Ministers Sepuloni and Shaw acknowledge the contribution of all disabled people and whānau, the disability sector and the MidCentral Leadership Group, who have been involved in the work to date.
