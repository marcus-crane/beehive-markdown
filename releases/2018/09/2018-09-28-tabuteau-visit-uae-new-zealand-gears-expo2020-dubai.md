Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau will travel to the United Arab Emirates next week to meet with UAE Ministers and representatives of New Zealand and Emirati businesses to reinforce the importance of our bilateral relationships as well as further our trade and economic links.

“The UAE is now New Zealand’s largest export market in the Middle East and our 11th largest trading partner globally,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“Many New Zealand businesses have a presence in the UAE, and New Zealand is an important partner for the UAE in renewable energy and food security.”

Under Secretary Tabuteau will also visit the site of New Zealand’s pavilion for Expo2020 in Dubai.

“This will be a great opportunity to reinforce New Zealand’s commitment to Expo2020 that will showcase to the world our culture as well as innovation and trade capabilities.

“The UAE is an increasingly important global hub with a number of daily flights which helps connect New Zealand to the rest of the world,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
