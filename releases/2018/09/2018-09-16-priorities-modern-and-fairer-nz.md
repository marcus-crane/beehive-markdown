Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced 12 priorities in a long-term plan that will drive the Government’s ongoing work programme in a major speech delivered in Auckland today.

The plan is the first of its kind since the introduction of MMP; setting out a comprehensive set of priorities across a wide range of economic, social and cultural areas and agreed to by all parties that are part of the Government.

“The Coalition Government’s long-term plan is a blueprint which sets out our priorities and the steps we are taking to build a more modern and fairer New Zealand that we can all be proud of,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“This plan represents our shared vision and priorities; Labour, New Zealand First and the Greens. It establishes the foundation for the Government’s work and includes issues of particular importance to each of the parties which are supported by all of them.

“Our Government has a firm eye on the future. That’s why our plan is looking 30 years ahead, not just three.

“We are a government of change and this plan shows our new thinking on how we’ll tackle the big challenges facing our country and the world such as poverty and inequality and climate change.

“This Government is taking a different approach to the issues we think are important. Our priorities go beyond just having a strong economy; to include ensuring our children don’t live in poverty, our houses are warm and dry, our regions are supported, our climate is protected and the Crown and Maori have strong relationships. We only succeed as a country when all of us are doing well.

“The plan and our priorities will be the guiding force of the Government. Cabinet committees will play a role by working to ensure budget bids meet the priorities, and that our programmes are being delivered and are making a difference. Cabinet will remain the ultimate guardian of the priorities and the documents.

“Every New Zealander can clearly see what the Government is doing and what our priorities are. While not everything we will do is listed, it provides certainty on our direction and the issues we are focused on.

“We have delivered significant change and progress in our first year. Our plan sets out our coalition’s path for unlocking the potential of our country and taking New Zealand forward.”
