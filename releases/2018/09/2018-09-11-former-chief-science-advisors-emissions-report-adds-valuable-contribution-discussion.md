The Prime Minister’s former Chief Science Advisor has provided a valuable contribution to the discussion on how to handle agricultural greenhouse gas emissions with the release of his [report](http://www.pmcsa.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/Mitigating-agricultural-GHG-emissions-Strategies-for-meeting-NZs-goals.pdf) on this issue, says the Minister for Climate Change.

“As Sir Peter Gluckman states in his report on mitigating agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, New Zealand is well-placed to lead the word in dealing with these global warming pollutants,” says James Shaw.

“Sir Peter’s report sits alongside the recent publications released by the Productivity Commission and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.

“Like those reports, Sir Peter points out that obligations on farmers around agricultural emissions should not impose a disproportionate burden on them relative to their international competitors or other sectors within New Zealand.

“From the outset, the Government has said that our path to a low emissions economy must be a just transition over the next 30 years and farmers I have been speaking to agree on that approach.

“Sir Peter’s report is being considered along with the advice and recommendations Government has been receiving from other agencies and sector groups, including the 15,000 submissions received during public consultations on the Zero Carbon Bill earlier this year,” says Mr Shaw.
