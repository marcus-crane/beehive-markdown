A new public housing development to be built in Onehunga has been designed with disabled people in mind and will cater for any sort of tenant, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford announced today.

The site of the 71-unit, two-block complex in Galway Street, Onehunga was officially unveiled by Minister Twyford today with Housing New Zealand Asset Development Group General Manager Patrick Dougherty.

Phil Twyford said the Government is committed to building more public housing and more affordable housing, and recognises that more needs to be done to show leadership in integrating accessibility into those plans.

“This development points to the future of state housing in New Zealand. Housing New Zealand has been progressively replacing older, worn out homes, which were built for a family of one size, with an incredible variety of buildings which can cater to virtually any tenant’s needs.

“In this building, seven units on the ground floor will cater to tenants with mobility issues, requiring accessible designs including ramps, wider doorways, and other specifications.

“The design also includes a community room and space for on-site staff, meaning the development will be able to cater to a more intensive level of tenant support,” said Phil Twyford.

Galway Street will be completed in mid-2020 and will be among the 6,400 state houses to be built over four years following funding in Budget 2018.

Phil Twyford said in the midst of a housing crisis, one of the best ways the Government can tackle homelessness is to build more public housing.

“Building more state housing places relieves pressure on emergency and transitional housing as well as private rental accommodation. As more homes like the 71 in Galway Street are ready to move into, they will play a big part in improving housing affordability. Every home that is built means one less family that has to wonder where they are going to sleep tonight,” Phil Twyford said.
