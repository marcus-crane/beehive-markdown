A partial rebuild of Wainuiomata High School has been upgraded to a major redevelopment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins made the announcement at the school, which will now undergo a comprehensive upgrade to fix weather tightness issues, improve tired classrooms and build flexible learning spaces. Funding for the more ambitious project has been doubled from an earlier plan, to $24 million.

“This government is committed to rebuilding public education – including fixing run down and leaky schools,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Kids deserve safe, modern spaces to learn in and the students at Wainuiomata High School have waited long enough for the problems at their school to be fixed.

“It is the only secondary school in Wainuiomata and it is important that the school continues to serve its students, whānau and wider community effectively.”

Chris Hipkins said the school has been trying to get this project off the ground for some time.

"The school has told me they have been worried about its deteriorating condition and the effect on student numbers.

“With this announcement, the school’s current 640 students and staff and those that will follow can have certainty that they will have a modern school with high quality learning spaces right in the heart of their own community.”

Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins also announced $3.5 million of funding for seven roll growth teaching spaces including:

- Three new teaching spaces at Johnsonville School,
- Two new teaching spaces at Manakau School south of Levin, and
- One teaching space at Vogeltown School in New Plymouth.

The classrooms will provide extra space for almost 150 students.
