No review of the Game Animal Council is planned, Conservation Minister, Eugenie Sage said today.

The Minister rejected claims made by National MP Sarah Dowie that the Game Animal Council was being reviewed.

“Since taking office I have met with a range of groups and organisations across the hunting sector to understand their concerns and interests, and the role they can play in helping support New Zealand’s conservation work,” Eugenie Sage said.

“A review of the Game Animal Council and its legislation is not something I have chosen to progress.  Right now many groups including the New Zealand Deer Stalkers’ Association, the Game Animal Council and commercial Wild Animal Recovery Operators (WARO) are working with the Department of Conservation (DOC) as it examines WARO permits and works to bring a significantly the expanded  tahr population under control.

“Given this level of engagement, I have asked DOC officials to work with the Council on the scope of its work plan and how it can better contribute to hunting sector engagement.”

Public nominations for five positions on the Game Animal Council have been advertised recently.

“I am providing $200,000 in funding for the Council in 2018 and its future is secure.

“While there are range of complex challenges between hunting and conservation, DOC will continue working with hunting organisations and the Game Animal Council on how their work can assist the environment and conservation and how they can help bring tahr numbers under control.”
