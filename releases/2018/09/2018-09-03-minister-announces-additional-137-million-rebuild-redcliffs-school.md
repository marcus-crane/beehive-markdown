A further $13.7 million will be invested to relocate and rebuild Redcliffs School, Education Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today.

In 2013, the school was approved for funding in the Christchurch School's Rebuild (CSR) Programme to have its facilities rebuilt on the existing site. However, a decision was made to re-locate the school at Redcliffs Park.

"The funding I'm announcing today will bridge the gap between what was originally budgeted for Redcliffs School in the rebuild programme and what is required now," Chris Hipkins said

"Building work is expected to start next month and the school open for 2020.

“It’s a been a long process to get to this point and I’m delighted to be able to confirm that all the elements are now in place and the Redcliffs School community can look forward to a certain future.

“Once complete, the school will have top quality learning spaces for students and staff.

“The funding is in addition to the $62 million I announced for the CSR programme in Budget 2018 and is a part of the $332 million announced in Budget 2018 to support school infrastructure.”

The additional funding brings the cost of rebuilding the school to $16 million.
