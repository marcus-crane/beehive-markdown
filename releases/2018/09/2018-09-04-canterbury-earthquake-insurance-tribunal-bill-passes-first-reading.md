The Government has passed the first reading of the Canterbury Earthquake Insurance Tribunal Bill on the 8th anniversary of the first Canterbury Earthquake, say Ministers Andrew Little and Megan Woods.

“Eight years on from the devastating September earthquake, too many people are still battling EQC or their Insurance Companies in order to get their claims resolved. That’s not good enough and this Government is going to see them right.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Tribunal will provide another avenue for Cantabrians to have their claims resolved. It will allow for binding resolutions to settle claims, and will not require a claimant to be able to afford expensive lawyers’ fees to get access to justice,” says Andrew Little.

Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Megan Woods says the Bill’s passage through First Reading is a fitting way to mark the eighth anniversary of the earthquakes.

“Eight years is too long to wait. We know the delays around insurance are one of the key roadblocks holding back progress in Christchurch. That’s why this Government is taking action.

“This Tribunal puts more tools on the table to help people resolve their claim, from independent, funded mediation services to access to alternative dispute resolution services.

“The Tribunal will be empowered to set timelines that must be followed and award penalties for undue delay.

“I now invite the public to have their say on the details of the Bill through the upcoming Select Committee process,” says Megan Woods.
