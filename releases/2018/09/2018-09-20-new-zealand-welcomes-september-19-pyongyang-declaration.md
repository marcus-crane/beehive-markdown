Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has welcomed the September 19 Pyongyang Declaration signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un.

“New Zealand congratulates the two Koreas for agreeing to end hostilities at the third inter-Korean summit. This is an important step towards an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand is encouraged by North Korea’s stated preparedness to dismantle its Dongchang-ri engine testing and missile launching site under international observation. We urge North Korea to take further steps towards final, fully verified denuclearisation.”

“We stand ready to support North Korea as it continues to take steps that could lead towards a prosperous and secure path for its future. To that end, New Zealand welcomes news of further dialogue towards resolving the long-standing challenges on the Korean Peninsula.”
