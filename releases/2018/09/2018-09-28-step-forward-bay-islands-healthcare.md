Health Minister Dr David Clark says the new Bay of Islands Hospital redevelopment means the Kawakawa facility is better placed to meet the needs of its community now and in years to come.

David Clark officially opened the hospital’s new Accident and Medical Centre this morning.

“Today marks a significant step forward in improving the treatment and health outcomes for the people of the mid-North.

”I recognise and understand the health issues that the local population of the Mid-North faces, and I have great hope that this facility will help address those issues.”

“This new facility is more than just bricks and mortar, it’s also testament to the work that Northland DHB and the wider community have done together across the district to deliver patient centred care that is sensitive to the needs of the individuals and their whānau, and is culturally appropriate.”

The new Accident and Medical department opened today consists of suite of rooms including;

- four acute bays
- a procedure room
- x-ray room
- two resuscitation bays

It also includes a new twenty-bed medical ward.
