Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today announced a $9 million package to make it easier for Pacific students to access education.

“Pacific governments face significant challenges in delivering joined-up education services over a vast geographic area,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“This initiative will leverage high-speed internet connectivity to ensure more Pacific students have access to high quality education and learning opportunities.”

At the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru, Jacinda Ardern announced the package, which includes a $5m project to support teachers to deliver an interactive e-learning science curriculum for year 10 students in Samoa, Vanuatu, Cook Islands and Solomon Islands.

“Pacific Island countries want to lift the quality of science education without needing physical access to laboratories. New Zealand’s experience in this area will be a useful contribution to these partnerships.”

As part of the package, Jacinda Ardern has also announced a partnership with the University of the South Pacific and the Commonwealth of Learning to expand open, distance and flexible learning opportunities at secondary and tertiary levels.

“We are pleased to be able to draw on the considerable expertise of the University of the South Pacific and the Commonwealth of Learning to increase access to high quality secondary and tertiary education in the Pacific.”
