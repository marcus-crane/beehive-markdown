The number of electric vehicles (EVs) registered on New Zealand roads officially has passed the 10,000 milestone.

“10,000 EVs is an important milestone, particularly when you think that five years ago we had just 210 EVs registered,” Acting Associate Transport Minister James Shaw said.

“EVs offer potentially massive benefits to both our environment and our back-pockets. EVs cost the equivalent of 30 cents a litre to power up and run on home-grown, renewable energy,” Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods said.

“However, when you look at the huge number of vehicles in New Zealand it’s really our first baby step into an electric future. We now need to gear up for a leap forward,” said Mr Shaw.

“Right now EVs make up just 0.25 per cent of the four million vehicles on our roads.

“New Zealand is one of just a handful of countries without strong incentives, like fuel efficiency standards, to help bring down the cost of EVs. The independent Productivity Commission has pointed out that we risk becoming a dumping ground for polluting vehicles as other countries push ahead and start phasing them out.

“The Government is now investigating a range of options to make electric vehicles easier for Kiwis to buy,” said Mr Shaw.

Energy and Resources Minister, Megan Woods, says EVs will play an important role in New Zealand’s future.

“EVs are just one of many technological advancements that will transform our energy sector and help us make the move towards our goal of being net zero carbon by 2050,” said Ms Woods.

“That’s why the Government is investing in infrastructure to support the uptake of EVs. We have just announced the results of the fourth round of the Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund. This will see $3.87 million committed to new and innovative projects that support EVs. Applications for round five are currently being sought.

“We are demonstrating the rapidly-evolving potential of EVs by supporting projects that include food delivery, to rubbish collection, putting electric buses on the roads, and filling gaps in our charging infrastructure.

“Electric vehicles are clearly the future and this Government will make sure New Zealand is fully on board,” said Ms Woods.
