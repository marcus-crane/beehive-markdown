Minister Megan Woods will visit China to attend the 12th Annual Meeting of the New Champions World Economic Forum (WEF) in Tianjin, and meet with her ministerial counterparts in science and energy.

The WEF is a global summit on innovation drawing in a range of leaders from multinationals, government, media, academia and civil society with an interest in innovation, science and technology.

Megan Woods says the conference will be a great opportunity to meet with influential world and business leaders on science and technology.

“At the conference I plan to showcase New Zealand’s approach on issues such as a just transition to a low carbon economy, science and innovation investment, and government digital services.”

Prior to the WEF Megan Woods will meet with the Chinese Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang and the Acting Director of the National Energy Administration Liu Baohua in Beijing.

“Scientific cooperation between our two countries is strong, productive and growing, and there has been a surge in institutional agreements and collaborations in the last five years which we will continue to build on.

“I also look forward to discussing key energy issues facing New Zealand and China and both countries’ plans to transition to a low carbon economy.

“These meetings with Chinese officials will be an opportunity to deepen our relationship between our two countries.”

Minister Woods will be in China from 17-20 September.
