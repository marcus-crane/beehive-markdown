Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters, and Minister of Defence Ron Mark, have announced the New Zealand Government’s decision to deploy a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 maritime patrol aircraft to support the implementation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions imposing sanctions against North Korea.

“New Zealand is firmly committed to an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula.  We welcome the recent dialogue North Korea has had with the United States and South Korea.  However, until such time as North Korea abides by its international obligations, full implementation of the United Nations Security Council Sanctions resolutions will be essential,” commented Mr Peters.

This mission will see the P-3K2 undertake maritime surveillance above international waters in North Asia. The aircraft will be based out of Kadena Air Base, Japan.

“New Zealand will coordinate efforts with partners to counter North Korea’s maritime activities that contravene UNSC resolutions, in particular its use of ship-to-ship transfers,” said Mr Mark.

Sanctions resolutions against North Korea were unanimously adopted and supported by permanent UNSC members.
