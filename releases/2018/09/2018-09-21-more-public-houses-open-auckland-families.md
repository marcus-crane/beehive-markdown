Three new community housing developments officially opened in West and South Auckland today, which will provide desperately needed homes for up to 30 households.

The new developments are in Otahuhu, Mangere and West Auckland, and provide a mix of newly built one, two and three bedroom homes.

“Demand for public housing continues to rise, particularly in Auckland, where about 42% of people on the social housing register reside,” Housing And Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford said.

“In the midst of a housing crisis, one of the best ways we can tackle homelessness is to build more public housing.”

“Our priority is making sure everyone in need of somewhere to live has a place to stay, and this Government is doing everything we can to ensure that happens,” Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development Jenny Salesa said.

“Every home that is built means one less family that has to wonder where they are going to sleep tonight.”

The development in Otahuhu, built by Community of Refuge Trust (CORT Community Housing), is a brownfields development where two old houses on adjoining sections have been demolished, and made way for three buildings with four one-bedroom units in each.

The Mangere development is a project of Lotofale’ia Tongan Methodist Church of Mangere, supported by Airedale Property Trust.  The eight relocatable two-bedroom homes have been designed and built especially for older Pasifika persons.

In West Auckland, the development on Moire Road will eventually have around 200 homes, a percentage of which will be used for public housing.  The first 10 of these public housing homes opened today. They have been delivered through a joint venture partnership between Fletcher Living and Ngati Whatua Orakei, and purchased by VisionWest Community Trust and Accessible Properties Ltd.

“This Government is committed to building 6,400 public housing places over the next four years,” said Phil Twyford.

“However, we can’t do it alone. To increase quality, innovative public housing for our most vulnerable people, we are committed to working with Community Housing Providers, such as the ones who opened these homes today.”
