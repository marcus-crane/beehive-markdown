“Feedback from more than 130 Pacific groups is helping to shape a refreshed Pacific Vision, which will be launched in November,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Aupito William Sio.

Over the past year, the Ministry for Pacific Peoples has engaged with more than 2500 Pacific people representing community organisations, youth, people with disabilities, businesses, NGOs, and churches, on its journey to refresh the Pacific Vision, set in 1999.

“This is the first time the Government has embarked on a Pacific Vision project in 19 years. The Pacific Aotearoa Project builds on the work of 1999, but shifts its focus from government-led solutions to empowering Pacific peoples to be masters of their own destinies.

“Pacific communities are the youngest and fastest growing in the country. With almost two-thirds of our pacific population now born in New Zealand, protecting and developing pacific culture and identity is more important than ever.

“The opportunity to *talanoa* with a diverse range of Pacific communities about their concerns and aspirations for the future has been an inspiring experience.

“Our conversations with communities have highlighted Pacific identity, language and culture, economic development, and wellbeing as broad priority areas for progress and change.

“The priority on identity, language and culture is about a sense of belonging for Pacific peoples to fully participate in and contribute to Aotearoa. The priority on economic development includes education, skills, qualifications, employment, business and housing affordability, and debt. The priority on wellbeing is about Pacific peoples enjoying better health and leading healthier lifestyles.

“Further detailed findings and the new Pacific Vision will be launched at the Pacific Aotearoa Summit in Auckland on November 13,” says Aupito William Sio.
