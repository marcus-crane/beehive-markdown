The Government has allocated $19.6 million in funding for tourism infrastructure projects around the country, so local communities can feel the benefits of a healthy tourism sector, rather than the pressure it can create, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

The funding has been granted through the second round of the Tourism Infrastructure Fund and will be spread across 31 councils and community organisations.

“The extraordinary growth in visitor numbers we’ve seen over the past few years will likely continue for the foreseeable future, and these investments are essential to improving the quality of our tourism infrastructure to help manage that growth,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Successful applications include boardwalks and walkways, car parks, ramps, toilet and wastewater facilities, and dump stations.

“This funding is in addition to the $8.5 million the Government committed on 15 August to help communities manage freedom camping in their areas during the upcoming summer season.

“Managed well, tourism growth can significantly boost our economy, bring wealth to the regions and improve New Zealanders’ quality of life by creating more vibrant communities.

“I am also looking at ways the Government can step up to its stewardship role in bringing the industry together to create a more productive and sustainable sector.

“For example, we’re considering responsible camping legislation and how that might need to change for everyone’s benefit. We’re also implementing an international visitor levy to provide sustainable funding for infrastructure and conservation and we’re funding attractions through the Provincial Growth Fund that will help provide year-round jobs in our regions.

“We’ve made our first steps towards a better tourism experience – for Kiwis and for visitors – and you can expect to see more,” Kelvin Davis said.
