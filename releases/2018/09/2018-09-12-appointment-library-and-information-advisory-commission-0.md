Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin today announced the reappointment of David Reeves as Chair, and members Dr Judith Johnston, Helen Tait, and Carolyn Robertson to the Library and Information Advisory Commission.

The Library and Information Advisory Commission has a statutory role to provide the Minister with independent advice on library and information issues, including mātauranga Māori.

David Reeves, Dr Judith Johnston, Helen Tait, and Carolyn Robertson will take up their positions on 13 September 2018. They will join Matthew Oliver, a current member.

These reappointments retain the range of experience, skills and perspectives to ensure the Library and Information Advisory Commission has the expertise to continue providing high quality advice to the Minister.

Minister Martin acknowledged the work of Rachael Ka’ai-Mahuta who was not reappointed this year. “Rachael Ka’ai-Mahuta has made important contributions during her time on the Commission,” she said.
