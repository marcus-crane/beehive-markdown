Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has announced that she has now received a final report from Michael Heron QC.

This follows the Minister’s decision to direct an investigation into the affairs of the Whakatōhea Māori Trust Board under section 33 of the Māori Trust Boards Act 1955.

“I have now fully considered the findings and recommendations of the final report.

“In my view the Investigator’s report provides practical recommendations.  I have written to the Board to ask them to take steps to implement these recommendations.

“My hope is with the conclusion of this report that Te Whakatōhea can now move forward with their aspirations for the future,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
