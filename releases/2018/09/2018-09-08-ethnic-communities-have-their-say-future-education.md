Minister for Ethnic Communities and Associate Minister of Education Jenny Salesa is joining ethnic communities at a series of public meetings in Auckland to hear their views on education.

As part of the Government’s ongoing Education Conversations | Kōrero Mātauranga initiative, there will be three sessions across Auckland in Mount Roskill (8 September), Flat Bush (14 September) and North Shore (25 September). Two more sessions have been added in Wellington (18 October) and Christchurch (27 October).

“The Government is committed to taking a collaborative approach to building the education system New Zealanders want to see for the future,” says Jenny Salesa.

“That is why we are making sure the voices of ethnic communities and other priority groups are heard.

“We want to be inclusive and engage with a wide range of New Zealanders as we come up with a plan to improve New Zealand’s education system – which hasn’t changed for 30 years.

“We know from education summits held throughout Aotearoa that we need to do a better job at recognising cultural diversity and the value this can bring to the system.

“I am excited to hear the many comments and ideas that will be shared at our sessions by people of all ages.

“The discussions will be facilitated by representatives from the community, the Office of Ethnic Communities and the Ministry of Education.

“We are holding these meetings in Auckland because it is New Zealand’s largest and most diverse city. I encourage ethnic communities in other parts of the country to participate through the [online survey](https://consultation.education.govt.nz/education/korero-matauranga/) on the Kōrero Mātauranga [website](http://www.conversation.education.govt.nz/).

“All data and information from these events, along with feedback from other meetings and the [online survey](https://consultation.education.govt.nz/education/korero-matauranga/), will be used to inform changes to the educations system,” says Jenny Salesa.
