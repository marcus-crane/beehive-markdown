Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis today announced the appointment of Colleen Neville and Kauahi Ngapora as members of the New Zealand Tourism Board (known as Tourism New Zealand).

“These appointments will add tremendous value to the board as it works to increase the benefits to New Zealand from domestic and international tourism,” Kelvin Davis said.

“For these appointments I was looking for people with commercial tourism experience, particularly in the regions, a connection to Māori tourism operators, and strong financial acumen.

“I have also reappointed John Thorburn, Jamie Tuuta, and Jan Hunt for various terms, while chair Kerry Prendergast’s term has been extended to March 2019 to retain her experience and leadership while future changes are considered.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to thank outgoing members Richard Leggat, Christopher Parkin and Raewyn Idoine for their commitment, service and contributions to the board,” Kelvin Davis said.
