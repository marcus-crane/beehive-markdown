E toru tau te roanga ake o te tūranga a Tākuta Severne, ka whakakapi i a Jamie Tuuta.

“E manawanui ana au ki te pānui ka whakatakoria he tirohanga ingoingo me ngā āheinga e whai ana hei tautoko ake i ngā Māori e pupuri ana i te whenua. Ko Tākuta Charlotte Severne te wahine tuatahi hei ārahi i Te Tumu Paeroa”, hei tā Nanaia Mahuta.

“He hononga tapu i waenga i te wahine me te whenua. He nui tonu ō tātau kōrero e kōrero ana mō te hononga a te wahine me te whenua, ā, ka tika tēnei hei whakaatu i te kaupapa matua a  TeTumu Paeroa, arā, ko te hono i te tangata ki ō rātau whenua.

“E hiahia ana au te mātua whakarite ko te pikinga o ngā mahi tautoko i ngā  kaipururu whenua Māori ki tō rātou whenua  me te tautoko whakahaere pakari ake nei e haere tonu e whakaahua tonu I te tūranga o te tume paeroa I tēnei wāhanga e tū mai. E whakapono au e tutuki tēnei a Dr Severne.”

E whakamana ana te Kaitiaki Māori i raro i te ture Māori Trustee Act 1953. I raro i te ture nei, me whakatū te Kaitiaki Māori e te Minita Whanake Māori.

“He roa ake i te tekau mā ono tau a Tākuta Severne hei kaiwhakahaere me ngā pukenga āpiti kei a ia pēnei ki te whakawhanake rautaki me ngā kaupapa whakahaere.

“I roto i ngā mahi tūmatanui, tūmataiti anō hoki kua ārahi e Tākuta Severne ngā rōpū whai kounga hei whakatipu rōpū, hapori me ngā āheinga whai pānga,” hei tā Nanaia Mahuta.

Kei te whiria tonu te rā ka tīmata a Tākuta Severne.

**New Māori Trustee announced**

Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta announced the appointment of Dr Charlotte Marewa Severne (Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ngāi Tūhoe) as the new Māori Trustee today.

Dr Severne’s appointment is for a three year term and replaces Mr Jamie Tuuta.

“I am proud to announce that our next Māori Trustee will inject a vision of aspiration and opportunity to support Māori land owners. Dr Charlotte Severne will be the first woman to lead Te Tumu Paeroa (the Māori Trustee),” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Wāhine (women) and whenua (land) are intrinsically linked. Many of our stories refer to the connection between wāhine and whenua. And it’s apt given the role of Te Tumu Paeroa is connecting people with their land.

“I am keen to ensure that an increased focus to support Māori land owners to their whenua with strengthened governance support continues to define the role of the trustee in this next phase. I am confident that Dr Severne can achieve that.”

The Māori Trustee is established under the [Māori Trustee Act 1953](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0095/latest/DLM282038.html).  The Act requires that the Māori Trustee is appointed by the Minister for Māori Development.

“Dr Severne brings more than 16 years of executive management with a depth of skill in strategy development and operations.

“In both the private and public sectors Dr Severne has led highly effective teams focussing on growing organisations, communities and opportunities,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Dr Severne’s start date is yet to be confirmed.
