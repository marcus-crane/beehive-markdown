“During Parliament’s General Debate this afternoon the National Party MP Chris Bishop claimed to have made a revelation related to the Haumaha inquiry.  He hasn’t made a revelation and I’m swatting-off this midge right now,” says Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“There is no basis to Mr Bishop’s claim that I rang Mr Haumaha after the inquiry into his appointment was announced, nor have provided any assurances on the matter. I have not called nor had any reason to call Mr Haumaha since the controversy,” he says.

“My office has checked all my phone records since the inquiry was announced. No such call was made.”

“It is a matter of public record that this inquiry was initiated in my capacity as acting Prime Minister.”

“The public can have faith in the inquiry. It was initiated by Cabinet, it is being conducted by a highly respected independent QC, and it will report back to Cabinet.  The terms of reference have been publicly released. The final report will be made public.”

“Regardless, any suggestion that New Zealand First Ministers are seeking to unduly influence this inquiry is baseless nonsense,” says Mr Peters.
