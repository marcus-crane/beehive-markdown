The nationwide participant selection process for Youth Parliament 2019 is underway, Youth Minister Peeni Henare announced today.

All Members of Parliament are on the search for a young person to represent them and their community as a Youth Member of Parliament (MP) in 2019.

Youth Parliament is a non-partisan process held every three years. The Youth Parliament 2019 programme will run from 01 March to 31 August, with a two-day event taking place on 16 and 17 July in Parliament. Youth MPs are mentored by their MP, enabling them to build their confidence and skills, and enhance their understanding of the role of an MP and of the communities they represent.

“Youth Parliament is a great opportunity for rangatahi to get a first-hand experience of how Parliament works and for us Parliamentarians to hear from young people on what is important to them,” Peeni Henare said.

Young people who aspire to become journalists or who are interested in the workings of Government from the perspective of the Press Gallery are able to apply to be a part of the Youth Press Gallery (YPG) for Youth Parliament 2019.The YPG provides a unique developmental opportunity for rangatahi and replicates an important part of New Zealand’s democratic process.

“Youth MPs will deliver projects, engage with the Members of Parliament who select them, and connect with their peers to understand their views on topics which will be discussed at the two-day Youth Parliament event. Youth Press Gallery members will be responsible for covering the activities undertaken by the Youth MPs during their tenure, as well as providing an objective viewpoint of parliamentary proceedings,” Peeni Henare said.

“For the first time, participating young people will be able to submit and decide on the Youth Parliament select committee and mock bill topics they wish to discuss at the two-day event. Youth MPs will have the opportunity to submit their thoughts on the ten chosen Youth Parliament select committee topics through a public submission process, planned for April 2019.

“I want to challenge young New Zealanders, across every community from Kaitaia to Bluff, to consider becoming a Youth MP or a member of the Youth Press Gallery. Youth Parliament 2019 is the platform to learn more about the Parliamentary and press gallery processes, demonstrate your leadership skills, and give back to your community in a meaningful way,” Peeni Henare said.

Young people aged 16 to 18 years of age on the selection closing date (19 October 2018) are eligible to become a Youth MP; while Youth Press Gallery members can be between 16 and 24 years old.
