New Zealand and Japan will cooperate to ensure the success of the Pacific Climate Change Centre in Samoa, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting climate change action across the Pacific and we see the Pacific Climate Change Centre as a key regional institution,” Mr Peters said.

During May’s Pacific Island Leaders Meeting in Japan, Foreign Minister Peters and Japanese Foreign Minister Tarō Kōno confirmed their countries’ strong commitment to strengthening coordination and cooperation in the Pacific Islands region.

“We are pleased to cooperate with the Government of Japan on the development of this key regional institution,” Mr Peters said. 

“The Climate Change Centre will contribute to efforts to address the needs of Pacific Island Countries to combat the impacts of climate change over the coming decades.”

The Pacific Climate Change Centre is being built at the headquarters of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Community Environment Programme (SPREP) in Apia, Samoa.

“New Zealand is pleased to be contributing up to NZ$3 million for the Climate Change Centre. This builds on Japan’s significant support,” Mr Peters said.

“We recognise that partnership is vital to development success and are look forward to cooperating with Japan on this project over the coming years.”

The PCCC is expected to open in mid-2019, and will be a pre-eminent regional hub and centre of excellence for climate change issues. It will provide training, facilitate research, and coordinate regional actions on climate change issues.

The formal statement between the Governments of Japan and New Zealand is attached.
