The Government is continuing to tackle the housing crisis with a transformational programme to build around 10,000 new homes for families in Mt Roskill that will be linked up to Auckland’s communities through the planned light rail line, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford has announced.

Phil Twyford today unveiled the Mt Roskill Development at the site of a newly built state house. Similar in scale to the Mangere Development, the 143 hectare Mt Roskill Development will be built over the next 10 to 15 years.

“Not only will this redevelopment provide families in Mt Roskill with high-quality new, homes, it’ll provide the infrastructure to cope with growth and connect with the planned light rail line.

“This redevelopment will include more than 2,400 modest, affordable KiwiBuild homes for first home buyers, around 3,000 market homes, and more than 3,000 new state homes.

“Building in Roskill South has already started. Under stage one, 80 new state homes will be built, with the first ready to move into next year.

“Stage two will begin mid-2019 and will see 90 worn out state homes replaced with around 300 new homes, including around 95 KiwiBuild homes, around 60 state houses and market homes.

“The Roskill South part of the redevelopment will be finished in the next six years, with 302 new state homes and 578 affordable market homes being built.

Phil Twyford acknowledged the leadership of Auckland Mayor Phil Goff, local MP Michael Wood and the Puketāpapa Local Board in ensuring that community aspirations help shape the Mt Roskill Development.

“The Mt Roskill Development is a great example of how local and central government are working together to improve neighbourhoods throughout Auckland,” Phil Twyford said.

“The 2,400 KiwiBuild homes and thousands of affordable market homes being built will give many in the community a real shot at owning their own home.

“With access to rapid transport and new warm, dry homes for families, the redevelopment is a fantastic outcome for the Roskill community,” Phil Twyford said.
