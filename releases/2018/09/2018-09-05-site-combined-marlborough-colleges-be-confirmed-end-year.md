A site for the co-location of Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges will be known by the end of the year, Education Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today.

Chris Hipkins acknowledged the support of parents, staff, students and wider community of both Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges to find a suitable site for co-locating the Colleges.

“Early hopes of new site options have not materialised but I have asked Ministry officials to continue to seek to acquire a green-field site – the preferred option of both colleges – over the coming months,” Chris Hipkins said.

“If by the end of the year however the acquisition of a site is not imminent, I have instructed the Ministry to begin preparing to co-locate the Colleges on the site currently used by Marlborough Girls’ College and Bohally Intermediate.”

This alternative option is supported by both Colleges and Bohally Intermediate and includes land the Crown can use. Bohally Intermediate will be relocated within central Blenheim, provided a new site can be secured.

“Should no new site for Bohally Intermediate be found it will relocate to new purpose-built facilities on the current Marlborough Boys’ College site. They too are supportive, and I really appreciate their willingness to play their part in finding a solution for the wider school community.

“The Marlborough community has worked with the government over many months and we appreciate their time and patience.

“People have waited long enough and need clarity about the future locations of both the Colleges and Bohally Intermediate.

“This issue will be resolved one way or the other by the end of the year.

“What is certain is that wherever the site is, secondary students in Marlborough will be moving to first-class, 21st-century facilities,” Chris Hipkins said.
