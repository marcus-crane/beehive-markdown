The Government is partnering with the Tairāwhiti region on opportunities to develop jobs, transport and businesses with a $152.7 million investment package, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

The Prime Minister is in Tairāwhiti today alongside Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones to announce funding from the [Provincial Growth Fund](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/provincial-development-unit/provincial-growth-fund).

“I’m delighted to be in Tairāwhiti today to announce a package of funding that will help boost Tairāwhiti’s economy, create jobs and enhance tourism opportunities,” Jacinda Arden says.

“Tairāwhiti offers a unique quality of life combined with genuine business and economic opportunities. However, it faces significant infrastructure challenges, high unemployment and lower productivity.

“That’s why the Government is investing $152.7 million through the Provincial Growth Fund to ensure that Tairāwhiti reaches its potential.”

Projects that will be announced today include investments of:

- $137 million to unlock Tairāwhiti’s economic potential through stronger, safer and more resilient transport connections
- $13.3 million for tourism projects to attract more visitors to the region
- $1.3 million for forestry projects, including skills training for young people
- over $1 million for projects in the food and beverage sector.

“The projects funded through today’s announcement reflect the priorities of the Tairāwhiti Economic Action Plan which emphasise the need to connect people and markets and support businesses to thrive.

“This is a significant boost for Tairāwhiti and is evidence of this government partnering with the region to invest in projects that will help contribute to a better future for rangitahi and everyone here,” said Jacinda Ardern.

The full list of projects included in today’s announcement is provided below.
