The Education (Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand) Amendment Bill has passed its final reading today, restoring the voice of teachers on their own professional body, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

“This is a huge step forward for teachers. It reverses the previous National Government’s decision to remove elected teachers from the Council, which undermined the profession, Chris Hipkins said.

“I originally introduced this Bill as a member’s bill because I, and members who now form the Government, believed the teaching profession could be trusted to elect representatives on their own professional organisation.

“It is only fair that teachers have their right of direct representation and election restored. It is disappointing that National voted against this.

“However this Government recognises the importance of giving teachers the right to elect representatives to their own professional body, just like countless other professions.

The number of council members will be increased from nine to 13 – with seven members to be directly elected by the teaching profession and six members appointed by the Minister of Education. The new Council membership will be in place within a year.

“The name of the Council will also change to the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand, which better reflects the work of teachers, and the core business of the Council.

A number of amendments are made to ensure a smooth transition from the Education Council to the Teaching Council and to provide for ongoing arrangements for the Teaching Council.

“The changes implemented by the Bill are a part of the Government’s work to lift the status of the teaching profession,” Chris Hipkins said.
