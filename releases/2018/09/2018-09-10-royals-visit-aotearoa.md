News that Kensington Palace has confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be visiting New Zealand from 28 October to 1 November has been welcomed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“It’s wonderful news that the Duke and Duchess are coming to New Zealand as part of their first major tour outside the United Kingdom. I know they will receive a very warm Kiwi welcome wherever they go.”

“I hope many New Zealanders will have the opportunity to see the Duke and Duchess as they visit some of our beautiful provinces and national parks, and experience our hospitality.”

Their Royal Highnesses will arrive in New Zealand after attending the Invictus Games in Sydney and visits to Fiji and Tonga. It will be their first major tour outside the United Kingdom.

The Duke and Duchess will arrive in Wellington on Sunday 28 October and will visit Abel Tasman National Park on Monday 29 October. They will visit Auckland on Tuesday 30 October, and Rotorua on Wednesday 31 October. They will depart New Zealand on Thursday 1 November.
