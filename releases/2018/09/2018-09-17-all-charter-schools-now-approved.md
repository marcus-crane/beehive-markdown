Two charter schools’ applications to establish new state integrated schools have been approved, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

The decisions on Tūranga Tangata Rite in Gisborne and Waatea School in Auckland mean that all 12 charter schools that applied to become designated character or state integrated schools have now been approved.

“The Ministry of Education and the schools’ proprietors made good progress in their negotiations, and I have now signed the integration agreements for both schools,” Chris Hipkins said.

“I have also appointed the new schools’ Establishment Boards of Trustees.  They include members of each charter school’s governance board, to provide continuity and support its character.

“Te Kura Māori o Waatea will open as a year 1-8 state integrated school in 2019.

“Tūranga Tangata Rite was one of the last charter schools to be approved by the previous Government, and is not yet up and running.  The school will open as a year 9-11 state integrated school in Term 1 2020, once the property and site are ready.

“We have worked with the charter schools to find a way forward for them within the state system and no existing charter schools are closing their doors.

“I am pleased that we have been able to provide certainty and continuity for the schools’ students and their wider communities.  The new designated character and state integrated schools will benefit from the added protections and supports that the state system provides.

“Looking ahead, the Government is committed to investing in a state education system that delivers quality education and meets the needs of all learners,” Chris Hipkins said.
