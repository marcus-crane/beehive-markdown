Justice Minister Andrew Little welcomes the release of a public consultation paper by the Independent Panel considering the 2014 family justice reforms.

“The Panel is calling for public submissions, inviting everyone with experience of the family justice system to share their stories and have a say about how family justice services can be improved.

“The Independent Panel, made up of former Chief Human Rights Commissioner Rosslyn Noonan, and family lawyers La-Verne King and Chris Dellabarca, have been appointed to examine changes made to the family justice system in 2014.

“We can’t fix a broken system without knowing the extent of the problem so I’m pleased the Panel is seeking public input.

“The consultation process is an invaluable opportunity for the Panel to understand how the family justice system can provide a better service.

“Wide public engagement will allow the Panel to get the full picture when it comes to the reforms’ effectiveness.

“Submissions are open for eight weeks.  The Panel has worked hard to ensure that the consultation is accessible for anyone interested in helping to improve the system,” said Andrew Little.

Submissions close on 9 November 2018.
