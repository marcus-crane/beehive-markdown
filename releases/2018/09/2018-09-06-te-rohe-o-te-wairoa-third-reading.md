Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Andrew Little, welcomed hundreds of people from the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa to Parliament today to witness the third reading of their Treaty settlement legislation.

“The enactment of this Bill is an important occasion for both the Crown and the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa as we see this legislation passed and the Treaty settlement concluded.  It marks the end of a long-running Treaty settlement process that started in the early 1980s,” Andrew Little said. 

“It is important the Crown apologises for breaching the Treaty and acknowledges the significant, cumulative and detrimental impact of the breaches upon the well-being of the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa.  Many of the policies of the Crown have significantly contributed to the migration of members of the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa away from their rohe.  Those remaining in the rohe have experienced socio-economic disadvantage.”

“At $100 million in financial and commercial redress this is the sixth largest Treaty settlement to date.  This redress opens up new opportunities for the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa and the Wairoa region.”

“The settlement also includes relationship agreements between the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa, government agencies and councils.  These agreements provide opportunities for the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa to contribute to and influence decision-making on issues that are significant to them.”

“This Government is committed to settling historical Treaty grievances and working towards building a new partnership between the Crown and Māori.  The passing of this legislation marks the full and final settlement of all historical claims of the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa.  It also marks new beginnings in the Crown-Māori relationship going forward,” said Andrew Little.
