Disarmament and Arms Control Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau this evening hosted a function at Parliament, with the Wellington United Nations Association, to promote awareness of disarmament amongst young New Zealanders.

“Now more than ever we need to step forward together and continue to advocate for nuclear disarmament and pass this baton on to our next generation,” Mr Tabuteau said.

“New Zealand has a proud history of advocating for nuclear disarmament at all levels and we look forward to the next generation continuing to work to achieve a nuclear free world.”

Mr Tabuteau also announced an increase in funding for groups working on disarmament education.

“Annual funding for the Disarmament Education United Nations Implementation Fund (DEUNIF) will increase from $150,000 to $200,000.”

“This will go towards education activities that promote greater understanding of disarmament and arms control, as well as contributing to advancing New Zealand’s disarmament interests,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

Mr Tabuteau thanked the award winning youth Virtuoso Strings Orchestra from the “heart of Porirua” for their “beautiful and fitting” contribution to the event.

**Notes to editors:**

Mr Tabuteau chairs the Public Advisory Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control (PACDAC), which was established under the New Zealand Nuclear-Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987.

DEUNIF was established in 2004 to help NGOs undertake disarmament education activities in New Zealand.
