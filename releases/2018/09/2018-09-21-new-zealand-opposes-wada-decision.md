New Zealand is extremely disappointed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) decision overnight to reinstate RUSADA, the Russian anti-doping agency, as compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson says.

New Zealand is currently representing Oceania as a member of the WADA Executive Committee. New Zealand, on behalf of Oceania, and Norway, were the only countries on the Committee to vote against the recommendation that RUSADA be reinstated.

“I have heard from many New Zealand athletes how strongly they feel about having a clean environment to compete in. I need to be able to look them in the eye and tell them that we have a system that ensures this is the case. WADA’s decision makes it extremely difficult for me to do that.

“We will continue to work within WADA to ensure the highest standards are met,” Grant Robertson says.
