Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Bill Dobbie as the new Consul-General in Sydney.

“Mr Dobbie will be responsible for our relationships with New South Wales and Queensland,” Mr Peters said.

“Within the Single Economic Market New Zealand shares with Australia, these are significant relationships in terms of trade, commerce, investment and tourism. New South Wales is one of our largest trading partners globally and Queensland is home to the largest population of New Zealanders in Australia, at over 200,000.”

Bill Dobbie is currently a Unit Manager at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade responsible for working with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and other government agencies to strengthen the Ministry’s support for our exporters in overseas markets.   He was previously High Commissioner to Vanuatu and has also worked in London, Apia and Madrid.
