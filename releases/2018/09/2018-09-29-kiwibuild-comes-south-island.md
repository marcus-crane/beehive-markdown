Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford today announced the first South Island KiwiBuild development in Wanaka, where there will be 211 KiwiBuild homes built over the next two years.

Ballots will open on October 8th for the first 10 of these homes in the Northlake development.

Phil Twyford said KiwiBuild is restoring the Kiwi dream of home ownership to thousands of families who have been priced out of the housing market in the Queenstown Lakes district and across the country.

“For first home buyers who have been locked out of the market, KiwiBuild is providing the chance to buy an affordable modest, starter home in one of the most beautiful parts of New Zealand.”

Queenstown Lakes is one of the fastest-growing districts in New Zealand, and, with the highest median house price in New Zealand, has faced major housing affordability challenges.

“In August, we raised the HomeStart and Welcome Home Loan price caps for Queenstown Lakes to $650,000 for new builds, bringing them in line with KiwiBuild. Our Government is taking a comprehensive approach to assisting first-home buyers in one of our least affordable areas,” said Phil Twyford.

The Northlake development is a master-planned community adjacent to Wanaka township, which will comprise over 800 homes. Northlake will also have its own village centre, with shops, playground, childcare and healthcare centres, dining options and small business office space.

The first 10 KiwiBuild homes to be balloted at Northlake include four two-bedroom and six three-bedroom modern standalone homes, all fully landscaped with off-street parking and a Fisher & Paykel home appliance package. Built in durable, low maintenance materials and colours which reflect the natural beauty of the Wanaka area, the homes are backed by a 10-year Master Build guarantee. Prices for these homes range from $565,000 to $650,000.

Only eligible, pre-qualified buyers can enter the ballots for these apartments, so anyone interested in the KiwiBuild homes at Northlake should visit the KiwiBuild website and begin the pre-qualification process.
