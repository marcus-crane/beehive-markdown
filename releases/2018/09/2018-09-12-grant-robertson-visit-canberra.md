Minister Grant Robertson will undertake a two day visit to Canberra, beginning tomorrow, covering both finance, and arts and culture topics.

“On behalf of the Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage I will attend the Meeting of Cultural Ministers, an inter-governmental group fostering cooperation in the arts.”

“I’ll be talking with the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Mitch Fifield, and State and Territories representatives to further our mutual interests in arts and culture,” Grant Robertson said on Wednesday.

“This visit also provides a platform to talk about our work on sustainable careers in the creative sector and the work we have begun to improve access to the arts particularly at community level.

“As Finance Minister, I’ll also be taking the opportunity to meet with my economic counterparts from the Government including Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and Minister for Finance Senator Mathias Cormann, to further the strong economic relationship between our two countries.
