Andrew Little, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, is pleased that Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority (TIMA) and Te Kotahitanga o Ngā Hapū Ngāpuhi (TKT) representatives have agreed to hold additional hui next month, so Ngāpuhi can consider a proposal to evolve their mandate and negotiations structure.

“I’m pleased that Ngāpuhi have been engaging positively and constructively. There has been meaningful kōrero about the proposal, and many innovative ideas and possible solutions to longstanding issues have come forward.

“As part of Te Rōpū Tūhono, which includes rangatira from TIMA and TKT, I have attended 14 hui with Ngāpuhi. The consistent message ngā uri o ngā hapū o Ngāpuhi have sent to me is that the people want to move forward.

“What is clear is the new momentum demands that the ideas are heard, considered, and discussed by the people. I want all Ngāpuhi to know they have a fair opportunity to consider and kōrero on the proposal.

“That’s why I have agreed to extend the deadline for submissions on the proposal, and why I support Te Rōpū Tūhono arranging more hui for Ngāpuhi to kōrero kanohi ki te kanohi next month.

“This is about Ngāpuhi deciding their own future for themselves.

“Timing, dates and venues for hui will be notified by the Office of Treaty Settlements on 5 October. Ngāpuhi can make submissions on the revised proposal and the due date for doing this has been extended to 23 October,” Andrew Little said.
