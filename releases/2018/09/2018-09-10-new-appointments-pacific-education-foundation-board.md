Associate Minister of Education Jenny Salesa and Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio have announced five appointments to the Board of the Pacific Education Foundation (PEF).

The PEF Board was formed in 1972 to promote and encourage better education for Pacific people. PEF provides financial assistance to Pacific people in New Zealand who are enrolled in tertiary study.

The new Board appointments include, George Gavet (Auckland), Palatasa Havea (Palmerston North), Dr Litea Meo-Sewabu (Palmerston North), Aiono Matthew Aileone (Wellington), and Bradley Watson (Dunedin).

Associate Minister of Education Jenny Salesa welcomes the new board members.

“The Pacific Education Foundation has gone from strength-to-strength, promoting scholarships and improving connections with tertiary institutions. I am sure the new Board members will continue this great work and ensure PEF continues to flourish,” says Jenny Salesa.

“I also want to acknowledge the work of the previous Board and the solid foundation on which a new strategy can be built. 

“I am heartened by the commitment shown by our community toward PEF and the important role it has to play for Pacific education,” says Aupito William Sio. 

“Pacific people are one of the fastest growing and youngest populations in New Zealand. The Government is committed to ensuring the Pacific community thrives by helping individuals to achieve their goals and aspirations.”
