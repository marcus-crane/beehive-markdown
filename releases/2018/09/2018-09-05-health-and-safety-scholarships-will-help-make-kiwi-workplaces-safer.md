The establishment of an annual Scholarship Programme by the Health and Safety Association of New Zealand (HASANZ) will build the capability and capacity of New Zealand’s professional health and safety workforce, says Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Iain Lees-Galloway.

“I’m delighted to launch the HASANZ Scholarship Programme today, as a crucial step forward for making New Zealand workplaces safer.

“Access to further education to develop skills is key to ensuring an increased supply of qualified health and safety advisers into the future. Scholars can enter full or part-time tertiary study and receive up to $5000 per year for up to two years, gaining practical experience and mentoring.

“The HASANZ Scholarship Programme will contribute to a pipeline of professionals coming through the education system, so that Kiwi businesses can have better access to good health and safety advice to reduce workplace harm.

“Better health and safety in our workplaces is a huge part of this Government’s commitment to improving the wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

“Every New Zealand worker has the right to return home, to their whanau and friends, in the same health as when they started the day.

“The HASANZ Scholarship Programme will play an important role in keeping Kiwis safer at work,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.
