Foreign Affairs Minister Rt Hon Winston Peters will be seeking an update from the Indonesian Government on the impact of the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami during his regional visit.

Mr Peters departs on Monday for a scheduled visit to Thailand and Indonesia this week.

“The Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami will obviously be a current concern for the Indonesian government.  My visit will be an opportunity to personally express the condolences of New Zealand for the loss of life, and to discuss any potential assistance,” said Mr Peters.

Mr Peters will co-chair the New Zealand-Indonesia Joint Ministerial Consultations (JMC) while in Jakarta, alongside Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi.

“These talks come at an important time, as we celebrate 60 years of bilateral diplomatic relations. Indonesia is a vital partner for New Zealand in the Asia Pacific region, and we share real interests across trade, security and people connections,’’ he said.

Mr Peters is also visiting Thailand this week.

“Thailand matters to New Zealand.  We have warm, long-standing diplomatic ties, and a healthy trade relationship, with Thailand currently standing as our eighth largest trading partner,” said Mr Peters. 

“This will be New Zealand’s highest level of engagement since Thailand’s military coup in 2014, and provides an opportunity for us to express  our strong support for  democratic elections next year, as well as to discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues,’’ he said.

Mr Peters will meet with Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai, Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Thai political party representatives.

The Minister will visit Bangkok from 1-3 October, and Jakarta from 4-5 October.
