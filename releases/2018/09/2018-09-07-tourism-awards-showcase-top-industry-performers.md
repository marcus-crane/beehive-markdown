Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis has congratulated all winners and finalists honoured at the Tourism Industry Aotearoa New Zealand Tourism Awards ceremony, held last night in Christchurch.

Kelvin Davis attended the event and presented the Air New Zealand Supreme Tourism Award alongside Air New Zealand Chief Executive Christopher Luxon, as well as certificates to all finalists.

“There is much to celebrate about our tourism sector and it is important that we do so,” Kelvin Davis said.

“It was fantastic to see so many excellent tourism operators acknowledged for their hard work and innovation.  I congratulate all the winners, and particularly Tourism Holdings Ltd. for taking out the supreme award for 2018.”

Regional Economic Development Under Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau presented the He Kai Kei Aku Ringa Māori Tourism Award to Whale Watch Kaikoura Ltd.

“Tourism is a priority for the Provincial Growth Fund and there are so many opportunities out there that can and will benefit our communities,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“It is great to see such a high bar being set in this critical sector.”

Kelvin Davis agreed that tourism has an important role to play, especially in regional New Zealand.

“Some of the work being done to grow sustainable tourism businesses, spread the benefits far and wide across our country and deliver authentic Māori experiences is phenomenal.

“The growth and success, and subsequent challenges, of the tourism industry have been well covered but given the calibre of firms represented last night we can be confident the industry is well placed to meet these challenges with innovation and creativity.

“I look forward to seeing how these great companies continue to deliver for New Zealand,” Kelvin Davis said.
