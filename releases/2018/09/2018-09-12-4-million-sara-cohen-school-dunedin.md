A Dunedin school for students who need extra learning support is getting a $4 million upgrade, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“Sara Cohen School’s buildings are in a poor state and are badly in need of a major revamp. Portions of the school buildings are experiencing weather-tightness issues and have insufficient heating and ventilation,” Chris Hipkins said.

“This Government's committed to ensuring that all children are able to access the facilities they require.

“The school has been doing great work supporting children with extra learning needs since it was established in 1926.

“The new buildings will have a better layout and improve access for the students.

“We are prioritising spending to remove barriers to young people's access to education and learning. We want to ensure every child with learning challenges has access to the tools and professionals they need.

“This funding ensures that children with learning support needs are able to receive the best education possible,” Chris Hipkins said.
