The Government has today given a small community-run hospital a boost to help with a long-awaited rebuild.

Confirming a $1 million grant for the redevelopment of Maniototo Hospital Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said investing in basic services like health was a priority for the Government.

“We only have to look at the issues currently playing out at Middlemore Hospital to see the impact of years of underinvestment in the sector.

“Maniototo Hospital is an example of the best community-led health providers. It plays a vital role in the region with its integrated services providing primary care, medical beds, aged care and community services,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“It is run by a not for profit registered charity and is the only significant health facility in the area. The resident GP is also the chief medical officer and the nearest hospital is over an hour’s drive away.”

The $7 million redevelopment will see the existing rest home facilities converted to a medical centre and community services facility while two new wings will house administration, emergency services and 29 new bed for use across acute medical, hospital level and rest home level care.

“Funding for the hospital was a promise we made before the election. We have now delivered on it.

“However it is testament to the hard work of Maniototo Health Services Ltd and the dedication and passion of locals that the project is finally coming to fruition,” Jacinda Ardern said.
