Foreign Minister Winston Peters has expressed New Zealand’s grave concern at reports that dozens of civilians have been killed in a chemical weapons attack in Eastern Ghouta, Syria.

“New Zealand condemns this barbaric attack in the strongest terms. If it is proven that the Syrian Government is responsible, it provides further evidence of its callous disregard for the lives of its own people,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand calls for an independent investigation into the attack by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and for the perpetrators to be held to account. We call on the parties to the conflict in Eastern Ghouta to urgently allow OPCW inspectors access to the area.”

“We also call on the international supporters of the Syrian Government to work to uphold the cessation of hostilities promised in UN Security Council Resolution 2401 and to prevent further attacks of this nature,” Mr Peters said.
