The Government’s education conversation Kōrero Mātauranga is a watershed moment in the history of education for all Māori, Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis says.

“Māori have a huge opportunity to help build a world class education system that works for all our tamariki. Over 5000 New Zealanders have joined the education conversation so far, by filling out our online survey. Of these, 13 percent have identified as Māori.

“That’s a great start but I want more Māori to share their thoughts through the Kōrero Mātauranga | Education Conversation. Together, we need to ensure we create an education system that lifts Māori achievement and better engages our tamariki and rangatahi.

“Now is our chance to shine a light on the innovation and responsive things we have within communities, whānau, businesses and the wider system and get improvements happening for all our children, right now.”

The online survey, at [conversation.education.govt.nz](conversation.education.govt.nz), asks four questions about the future of our education system:

- What does a successful student of the future look like to you?
- What will they need to know and be able to do?
- What things need to be in place to make sure every learner is successful?
- If you were the boss of education in New Zealand, what would you do first?

“I know that Kōrero Mātauranga will speak very strongly to Māori,” Mr Davis says.

“The Government wants our public education system to be inclusive and work for all. I encourage all tamariki, rangatahi, whānau, iwi and urban Māori organisations to take part in the online survey to ensure the voices of Māori are heard.”

The survey responses, along with outputs from the upcoming Education Summit, will help inform the Government’s Education Portfolio Work Programme.
