New Zealand today released a statement at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Greenhouse Gas reduction strategy negotiations in London, urging IMO member states to work towards a meaningful and effective outcome in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

“With the end of the negotiations imminent, New Zealand urges the IMO not to miss this opportunity to adopt a workable and effective strategy to bring rising greenhouse gas emissions from shipping under control,” Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter said today.

“The IMO strategy needs to be ambitious with appropriate measures implemented as soon as possible and it needs to apply to all IMO member states and all ships equally, regardless of which state a ship is registered in.

“Halting climate change and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement requires countries to work together for fair and ambitious outcomes.

“New Zealand was proud to sign the [Tony de Brum declaration](https://www.oneplanetsummit.fr/IMG/pdf/7-_transport_maritime_-_tony_de_brum_declaration.pdf) at the One Planet Summit held in Paris last December, confirming that international shipping must play a part in global climate action.

“Shipping is vital for Pacific countries, including New Zealand, and we all have a part to play ensuring that maritime trade happens in an environmentally friendly way,” said Ms Genter.

“The IMO strategy also needs to recognise and protect the interests of Pacific Island countries and territories,” said Minister for Climate Change James Shaw.

“In particular, this means helping to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.

“A recent report by the OECD’s [International Transport Forum](https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/decarbonising-maritime-transport.pdf) shows that there are practical steps that can be taken now to reduce shipping emissions and shipping could be almost carbon free by 2035.

“We commend the leadership of Pacific Island states in encouraging ambitious outcomes from the IMO negotiations.

“With very little time remaining before negotiations conclude, New Zealand joins with Pacific Island states in urging all countries to redouble their efforts to ensure the IMO achieves a credible and ambitious result,” said Mr Shaw.
