New Zealand Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi and Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison have welcomed the cross-appointment of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Commissioner Roger Featherston to the New Zealand Commerce Commission (NZCC).

“I am very pleased to appoint Roger Featherston as an associate member of the NZCC under the cross-appointment arrangement with the ACCC. I have no doubt Mr Featherston will add value to the NZCC’s work, with his background in trade practices, competition and consumer law practice and policy,” Mr Faafoi says.

“Mr Featherston is a leading expert in this area and his cross-appointment will strengthen Trans-Tasman cooperation on competition and consumer issues,” Mr Morrison said.

“Over the years, the cross-appointment arrangement between the ACCC and the NZCC has helped ensure consistency of approach to merger cases and competition issues affecting markets in both countries,” Mr Morrison added.

Roger Featherston will be the second of the ACCC’s two cross-appointees to the NZCC, with the other being Sarah Court. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the NZCC, Dr Mark Berry and Sue Begg, are currently cross-appointed as associate members of the ACCC.
