Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri today welcomed the signing of a partnership between New Zealand Customs and dairy exporter Synlait Milk Limited that will see the company joining the Customs’ Secure Exports Scheme (SES).

The Minister visited the Synlait head office in Dunsandel, near Christchurch where she presented the Certificate of Partnership signed by Customs and Synlait.

“New Zealand’s SES scheme gives members greater certainty at international borders and ensures minimal delay, and this partnership is an endorsement of the exporter’s standards of security on its chain of supply.

“Synlait is one of the country’s most successful dairy businesses with a range of value added products, including infant formula and milk powders. I’m pleased they have joined this partnership and I am confident they will find real benefits in the scheme.

Exporters approved for the SES have risk management plans that assure other countries that their goods are packed and transported securely.

Customs currently has SES agreements with the United States, China, Australia, Japan and Korea. The SES is voluntary.

“One of the government’s key priorities is to strengthen international trade and support New Zealand exporters like Synlait. We want to work with importers and exporters to find opportunities to make maximize the benefits for our trading partners,” says Hon Meka Whaitiri.
