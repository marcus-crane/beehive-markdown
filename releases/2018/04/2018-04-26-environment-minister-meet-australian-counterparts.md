Environment Minister David Parker will meet his Australian counterparts in Melbourne tomorrow to discuss policy issues in their portfolio areas.

“This is an excellent opportunity to engage with my Australian counterparts on our common challenges such as climate change, waste management and biodiversity,” David Parker says.

“It is important that we keep up with the latest policy developments in Australia and work with them on aligning our approach to environmental issues with international aspects.”

The annual meeting of Australian Environment Ministers involves State and Federal ministers, including Australian Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg.

David Parker will update the meeting on developments in New Zealand and will also hold one-on-one talks with Minister Frydenberg.

New Zealand has a standing invitation to attend as an observer and has attended at Ministerial level twice, the last time in November 2016.

David Parker, who holds the portfolios of Trade and Export Growth and Economic Development, will also meet the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Melbourne-based Consul General and Trade Commissioner and NZTE contacts for an update on NZTE activities in Australia.
