New Zealand’s Commonwealth Games team has done itself and New Zealand proud with their huge success on the Gold Coast, Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson says. 

“This was our biggest ever Commonwealth Games team and they have delivered an amazing collective performance bringing home 15 Gold, 16 Silver and 15 Bronze medals,” Grant Robertson said.

“Those 46 medals make 2018 New Zealand’s most successful ever away Commonwealth Games, beating Glasgow (45) four years ago. That’s a fantastic achievement.

“These were a Games of diversity and inclusivity, with an equal amount of medal opportunities for men and women and with all our athletes able to compete alongside each other with emotion and pride. We have truly seen how the power of sport brings people together during these 11 days.

“It’s not just the NZ team that should hold their heads up high. New Zealanders up and down the country, our supporters on the Gold Coast and Kiwis around the world have given amazing support to our athletes. We have all been captivated and inspired by our team’s performances.

“I’d also like to congratulate the Gold Coast organisers for an extremely well-run Games. Roll on Birmingham 2022,” Grant Robertson said.
