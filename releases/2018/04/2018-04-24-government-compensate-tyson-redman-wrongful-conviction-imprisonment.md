The Government has provided Tyson Gregory Redman more than $500,000 in compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment, Justice Minister Andrew Little announced today.

Mr Redman was convicted of wounding and injuring in August 2007 and spent two and a half years in prison.

In December 2013, the Court of Appeal quashed these convictions without ordering a retrial and Mr Redman applied for compensation in July 2014.

In July 2015 the then Justice Minister, Amy Adams, instructed Dr Donald Stevens QC to provide independent advice on the application.

Dr Stevens’ first report in early 2017 concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Redman was innocent of the wounding and injuring charges.

Dr Stevens completed his second report assessing an appropriate amount of compensation just after last year’s General Election and the report was considered by the incoming Government.  Dr Stevens recommended Mr Redman be paid compensation covering his pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses.

The Government accepted Dr Stevens’ advice and offered Mr Redman an ex gratia payment of $551,017.16, representing $475,722.75 for non-pecuniary losses adjusted for inflation, and $75,294.41 for pecuniary losses (including his finalised legal costs).

The Government also adopted Dr Stevens’ recommendation to provide financial support should Mr Redman wish to receive professional counselling and therapy to help him deal with the mental and emotional impact of his experience.  Reimbursement of these costs would be for a two-year period and up to $21,700[.]()

Mr Little said the Crown accepted Mr Redman’s innocence and apologised unreservedly for his wrongful convictions and imprisonment.

“I recognise the Crown’s offer of compensation will never completely correct the wrong that Mr Redman has suffered, but I hope it will help him and his family recover from the distressing experience they have been through.”

[]()Mr Redman has agreed to accept the Government’s offer of compensation.
