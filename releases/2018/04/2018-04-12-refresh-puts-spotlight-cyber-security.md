Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran today announced a comprehensive refresh of New Zealand’s approach to cyber security. 

“Cyber threats are growing in number and are increasingly sophisticated. The reality is that digital technology provides new avenues for criminals and other states to gain advantage and cause harm here,” Clare Curran said.

“New Zealander’s widespread use of connected devices and the security challenges of emerging technology are intensifying the problems. 

“So it’s timely for us to step up New Zealand’s cyber security efforts so that we are not left vulnerable to cyber intrusion and to refresh the 2015 strategy so we can deal with increasingly bold, brazen and disruptive threats.

“This Government has committed to building a connected nation, promoting and protecting digital rights. We intend to close the digital divides by 2020, and to make ICT the second largest contributor to GDP by 2025. A modern, responsive cyber security system is essential to this.

“We must protect the information and network systems that are vital to our economic growth, ensure the integrity and security of our increasingly digitalised government services and make sure Kiwis can interact online without suffering harm.”  

The refresh of the Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan will involve close collaboration with the private sector and citizens.

It will consider whether the government has the right resources and the right arrangements to address the increasing cyber threats facing New Zealand.

“We must work collectively to build New Zealand’s cyber security capability and resilience so I invite everyone to join the play a key role in this work to refresh New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy,” Clare Curran said.

“The problems are growing and it’s timely to look at what more can be done to improve New Zealand’s cyber defences.”

The National Cyber Security Centre, which focuses on countering sophisticated cyber threats and protecting New Zealand’s networks of national importance, recorded 396 incidents over the 2016-17 year.

The Centre estimates that advanced cyber threats have the potential to cause $640m harm annually to New Zealand’s organisations of national significance.

“The refresh of the current strategy will be led by the National Cyber Policy Office (NCPO) within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) and involve a wide range of government agencies,” Clare Curran said. 

“Workshops will be held at an early stage of the process.”
