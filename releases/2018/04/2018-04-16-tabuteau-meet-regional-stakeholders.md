Under-Secretary for Regional Economic Development Fletcher Tabuteau travelled to Taranaki today to further discuss Government support for the recently launched *Tapuae Roa: Make Way for Taranaki* action plan.

"The Government through the Provincial Growth Fund is investing up to $20 million towards a range of initiatives outlined in *Tapuae Roa* that exemplify an ambitious future for a modern and sustainable Taranaki economy,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“The combined investment between the Government and the region, which is contributing a further $16 million to the plan’s projects, will address some of the key issues facing the region, including unlocking Māori potential and diversifying the economy.”

 Mr Tabuteau will meet with a range of regional leaders in Taranaki and visit businesses linked to the four key areas outlined in the action plan – food, the Māori economy, the visitor sector and the energy industry.

“My visit to Taranaki is one of many planned visits to the regions over the coming months to talk to local councils, iwi, business owners, community organisations and other private sector entities, on ways the Government can best support them to unlock their potential and deliver economic growth,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

Mr Tabuteau will also travel to the Whanganui region tomorrow where he will visit the Whanganui Port.  As announced in February, the PGF will invest more than $6 million towards revitalisation of the Whanganui Port and upgrade of the town’s rail line.
