Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni is encouraging people from the Deaf community and NZSL users to put themselves forward for the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Board now that the appointments process has opened.

“The NZSL Board is focused on making it easier for deaf people and NZSL users to use sign language and on removing barriers to sign language use. We’re looking for people from the community who can help us achieve those goals,” Ms Sepuloni said.

“This is a routine appointment process, which takes place every three years, to offer the opportunity for people to join the NZSL Board.

“It is also important that the NZSL Board, fluent NZSL users with the majority being Deaf, reflects the Deaf community and NZSL users it serves by having a good balance of gender, age, ethnicity and a range of skills. I want to ensure a wide range of people know about the role and how to apply.

“This is the first time board elections have been held since the establishment of the NZSL Board in 2015. Five of the ten positions on the NZSL Board are available. The remaining five positions will be open for appointment in 2019.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the current NZSL Board members. Their efforts, as the first board, have contributed significantly to developing a strong foundation for providing strategic direction and expert advice to government and the community on NZSL,” Ms Sepuloni said.
