Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will travel to Europe next week for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London and meetings with counterparts in Paris and Berlin.

“The CHOGM meeting sets the agenda for the Commonwealth for the next two years, and I look forward to discussing a range of issues facing all Commonwealth members,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“The theme this year – ‘Towards a Common Future’ – is very apt as we will be talking about the important areas of sustainable development and climate change, as well as trade and security.”

While in London, Jacinda Ardern will meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss bilateral and international issues, including the shared goal of a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) once the UK has left the European Union (EU).

Prior to CHOGM, Jacinda Ardern will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Édouard Philippe in Paris.  Climate change and an EU FTA will be on the agenda in bilateral discussions. She will also deliver a keynote speech at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, outlining ways the two countries can cooperate on climate change and environmental issues.

The Prime Minister will then travel to Berlin at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel where she will hold talks with the Chancellor and deliver a speech setting out the Coalition Government’s vision for achieving progressive and inclusive growth.

“I am grateful for the strong support we have received from our EU friends in moving towards the launch of FTA negotiations with the EU, and I look forward to discussing this in further detail with President Macron and Chancellor Merkel.

“France, Germany and the United Kingdom are important partners of New Zealand. They share our values and our commitment to maintaining the multilateral rules-based system. 

“As we all face numerous global challenges, it’s important that we maintain strong relationships with those who share these values,” said Jacinda Ardern.

The Prime Minister will visit Paris, Berlin and London from 16- 23 April. She will also stopover in Brisbane on 14 April to visit New Zealand athletes at the Commonwealth Games.
