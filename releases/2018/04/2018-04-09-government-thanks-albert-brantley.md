Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration Dr Megan Woods has today thanked Ōtākaro Limited Chief Executive Albert Brantley for his service to Canterbury.

Dr Woods thanked Mr Brantley for his work in delivering Crown-led anchor projects and the precincts in Christchurch since his appointment to the role in early 2016.

“Losing someone of Mr Brantley’s calibre and experience is a loss and he leaves behind a great legacy in our city - one that he should be proud of,” Dr Woods says.

“I would like to thank him and acknowledge his significant contribution and commitment to the rebuild and regeneration of our city.

“Mr Brantley has lead Christchurch through probably what’s been some of the most challenging moments of the Regeneration of our city. He has shown integrity in working towards getting the job done for the benefit of the people of greater Christchurch,” Dr Woods says.
