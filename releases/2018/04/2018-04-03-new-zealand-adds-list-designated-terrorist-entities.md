New Zealand has added two groups to the list of designated terrorist entities under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today. These groups are Indonesia-based entity Jamaah Anshrout Daulah (JAD) and Philippines-based entity Maute Group.

JAD and Maute Group have been responsible for planning and conducting violent terrorist acts against both government and civilian targets in Indonesia and the Philippines respectively. These attacks have resulted in targeted and indiscriminate killing of civilians, including foreigners.

“As a result of these designations, any assets the groups may have in New Zealand will be frozen. It will be a criminal offence to carry out property or financial transactions with them,” says Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“Regardless of whether a group is designated a terrorist entity, fundraising for, recruiting, and harbouring terrorists are criminal offences in New Zealand.

“New Zealand’s action in designating these groups supports international efforts to combat global terrorism,” Jacinda Ardern said.

New Zealand now has 20 terrorist entities designated under New Zealand law.

Details of the designations process and the statements of case supporting designation of these entities can be found on the New Zealand Police website: [http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities](http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities).
