More than 5000 New Zealand teachers, young people, parents, school board members and grandparents have already had their say about the future of education, via the ‘Education Conversation’ initiative, says Education Minister Chris Hipkins.

“This fantastic response, in such a short time, means this is already the most popular education consultation in decades. But we want even more people to join the Education Conversation - Kōrero Mātauranga, to help us build the world’s best education system for all New Zealanders,” Mr Hipkins said.

“Public education belongs to us all. Its future is too important to be left to politicians alone.

“So it’s really important everyone gets online, fills out the five minute survey, and has their say. In particular, we want to hear from those whose needs are not well served by the current education system, such as Māori and Pasifika, and those in need of additional learning support.”

The [online survey](http://www.conversation.education.govt.nz/) asks four questions about the future of our education system:

- What does a successful student of the future look like to you?
- What will they need to know and be able to do?
- What things need to be in place to make sure every learner is successful?
- If you were the boss of education in New Zealand, what would you do first?

“The views shared through the education conversation will be discussed at the Education Summit in May and will then inform the strategies and reviews that are part of the education work programme I announced in February,” Mr Hipkins said.

“Young people and parents have been really keen to join the conversation, and to share their ideas.

“Recently, for example, I met with some intermediate students and board members. They were quite clear about the skills our learners need to succeed.

“The students talked about wanting to learn more about technology, having more one on one time with their teachers, spending more time in their community, and the value of experiences outside of the classroom. Board members talked about the importance of children having resilience and building emotional and social skills.

“I encourage more New Zealanders to go online and have their say so we can design the best education system in the world.”
