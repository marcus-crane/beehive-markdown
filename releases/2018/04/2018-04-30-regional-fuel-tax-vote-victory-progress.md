Auckland Council is to be congratulated for this afternoon voting 15-2 in favour of the regional fuel tax, Transport Minister Phil Twyford says.

“The Council’s National-aligned Councillors deserve a special mention for standing up for their local communities and defying their party heavyweights.

“They are putting the interests of Auckland ahead of petty politicking.

“Today’s decision is a kick in the guts for National Leader Simon Bridges who this morning declared he would keep Auckland in the dark ages by scrapping the regional fuel tax.

“National would deny Auckland the certainty of a fully-funded transport infrastructure programme over the next 10 years that will create a congestion-free network, and unlock the enormous growth and wealth creation potential of our largest city,” Phil Twyford says.
