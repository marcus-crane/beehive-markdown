Health Minister Dr David Clark has announced new chairs to lead Auckland’s three District Health Boards.

The Auckland, Waitemata and Counties-Manukau DHBs have had acting chairs since December following the resignation of Lester Levy, who had led all three boards.

“No one should underestimate the task of governance in our public health service. DHB chairs play a vital role overseeing the delivery of health services to New Zealanders.

“These are demanding and important roles. I am more than pleased with the calibre of people that have agreed to step up to lead the DHBs,” said Dr Clark.

The new chairs are:

•    Pat Snedden, Auckland DHB (from June 1)

•    Judy McGregor, Waitemata DHB (from June 10)

•    Vui Mark Gosche, Counties-Manukau DHB (from May 3)

“All three incoming chairs are experienced leaders with long records of public service. I know they will provide strong leadership and support the Government to deliver on our vision of a high quality public health service.

“I want to thank the acting chairs who have taken the reins at the three DHBs since December. Kylie Clegg at Waitemata and Gwen Tepania-Palmer at Auckland will continue as members of their respective boards. 

“Rabin Rabindran and fellow board member Mark Darrow will finish their time at Counties Manukau DHB on May 2. I thank both for their service and contribution.

“I have also decided to appoint a Crown Monitor at Counties Manukau DHB, which is dealing with a number of complex issues, including an urgent need for capital investment and forecast rising deficits.

“The Crown Monitor, Ken Whelan, will attend and observe all CMDHB meetings and support the Board as they continue to address these challenges.

“Today’s announcements represent a significant refresh of the leadership of Auckland’s health services,” said David Clark.
