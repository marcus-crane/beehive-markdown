**Prime Minister congratulates new Green Co-leader**

Prime Minister and Labour Leader Jacinda Ardern has today congratulated Marama Davidson on being elected Co-leader of the Green Party.

“I have called to pass on my congratulations to Marama this morning,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“The Green Party is a valued confidence and supply partner of this Government and I look forward to working with Marama to build a stronger, fairer and more inclusive country.

“This Government was formed around a consensus to make progress on the issues that matter most to New Zealand including an economy that delivers for everybody, a much stronger focus on the environment and a commitment to invest in our people.

“I am sure our work will be strengthened with the addition of Marama Davidson helping to leading this important work alongside me, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, and Green Co-leader James Shaw,” Jacinda Ardern said.
