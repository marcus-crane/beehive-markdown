Minister of Civil Defence Hon Kris Faafoi is travelling to Rotorua this morning to meet residents affected by yesterday’s heavy rain and to support Civil Defence staff managing the local State of Emergency.

 Mr Faafoi says that today may be tough for those seeing now in daylight the effects on their property.

 “My thoughts are with all of those impacted – yesterday was difficult for many and today could be more challenging as we better understand the impacts on people’s property.

 “We are expecting more rain today in Bay of Plenty and other parts of the country, and the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management is continuing to monitor the situation and we will coordinate any Government support that may be needed.

“In the meantime I’d ask that everyone continues to take care – check on your neighbours and any whanau that you have not heard from. Don’t travel unless local conditions are safe – and never drive through floodwaters.”

 Mr Faafoi hopes to meet some of the local emergency services and contractors who are working hard on the clean-up and restoring services as floodwaters recede and damage becomes clearer.

 A local State of Emergency remains in force to assist with evacuations and the Rotorua Emergency Operations Centre has been activated.  A Civil Defence Centre was set up yesterday at the Energy Events Centre, with the Red Cross activated to help manage it. Fire and Emergency New Zealand assisted with the evacuation.

 Mr Faafoi will meet with the Mayor of Rotorua Stevie Chadwick and visit the Rotorua Emergency Operations Centre to meet civil defence staff. Mr Faafoi then hopes to visit residents in Ngongotaha, conditions permitting.
