Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor heads to Brisbane today to meet with his Australian Government counterparts.

Mr O’Connor will attend the annual Agriculture Ministers’ Forum (AGMIN) from 26-27 April to discuss common approaches to biosecurity, climate change and international trading conditions.

He will meet with Australia’s Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and the equivalent ministers from Australian states and territories.

Discussions at the sixth AGMIN will centre on the similar issues and opportunities facing the agricultural sectors in Australia and New Zealand.

“As significant exporters of agricultural products Australia and New Zealand face similar aspirations and challenges in world markets. We both produce high-quality products in demand from consumers around the world, but global conditions are volatile and biosecurity is a top challenge,” Damien O’Connor says.

“During the talks we will look for new opportunities for our two countries to work together to support our agricultural sectors.”

New Zealand and Australia have a Trans-Tasman Action Plan on Foot-and-Mouth Disease Preparedness where the two countries share intelligence on risk, collaborate on training opportunities and share specialised skills.

Another example of Trans-Tasman collaboration between our primary sectors is in biosecurity where both countries are signatories of the International Animal Health Emergency Reserve Agreement and can exchange experts in the event of an animal disease incursion. As part of the current Mycoplasma bovis response Australia has provided New Zealand laboratory staff and epidemiologists.
