Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran will travel to the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast tomorrow for a first-hand look at what it takes to broadcast a multi-media mega sports event.

“The broadcast of the Commonwealth Games is a major event for TVNZ and is the first time since 2006 that it has broadcast this major sports event,” Clare Curran said.

“To bring the event to all New Zealanders, TVNZ will screen coverage on three broadcast channels as well as an online only channel.  TVNZ OnDemand will live stream all four of TVNZ’s Commonwealth Games Channels. Visiting the broadcast centre and talking to TVNZ and other broadcasters will give a hands on insight in to how such an event is broadcast across multiple platforms.”

The visit will also provide the Minister with the opportunity to meet with TVNZ’s major production company partners.

“These partners are key players in producing New Zealand broadcast content and I’ll be able to discuss with them the issues they face over local production,” Ms Curran says.

“I am committed to locally-produced public interest broadcasting and digital media which provides choice, has universal appeal and promotes our unique culture. The Games coverage helps tell our stories and build our national identity.

The Minister will also meet representatives from Optus, which is the official support network for the Games.

“Optus is one of the largest telecommunication operators in Australia and is hosting a 5G technology showcase at the Games. It has built the fibre network around the venues providing Wi-Fi access for athletes and team officials,” Clare Curran said.

The Minister leaves tomorrow morning and returns on Friday.  During the visit she will also take in the New Zealand v Scotland hockey game and attend a dinner with leading TV production houses.
