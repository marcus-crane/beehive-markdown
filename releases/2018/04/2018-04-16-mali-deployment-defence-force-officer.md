Minister of Defence Ron Mark has today announced the deployment of an officer to an intelligence leadership role in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The deployment is for one year.

“This contribution to the United Nations mission in Mali will further our reputation as a credible contributor to peace and security efforts globally,” Mr Mark said.

“Although this deployment is of one person, it is into a leadership position, allowing a high-quality contribution to the intelligence area of peacekeeping in support of the protection of civilians, mission safety, and security.”

MINUSMA was established in 2013 following a security crisis in Mali and deteriorating humanitarian situation. The mission focuses on ensuring security, stabilisation, the protection of civilians, and the promotion of human rights.

The new role will be filled by Colonel Angela Fitzsimons.

“Colonel Fitzsimons will provide the specialised skills that the United Nations mission in Mali needs,” Mr Mark said.

“Her deployment will also boost the participation of women in peace operations, which is an important focus for both New Zealand and the United Nations.”
