An independent panel to undertake the review of Whānau Ora has been appointed, Minister Peeni Henare announced today.

 The Government has committed to identifying ways to grow and improve the Whānau Ora model. The review will look at how a whānau-centred approach can be applied across government, particularly in the social sector.

 “This Government has a unique opportunity to work together to achieve ambitious goals that focus on real outcomes for whānau,” Peeni Henare said.

 “The review will assess the ability of the Whānau Ora Commissioning Model to make sustainable changes in the wellbeing and development potential of whānau.

 “We want to ensure the Whānau Ora service delivery model and commissioning approach is accountable and transparent in the achievement of outcomes for whānau.

 The review panel will be led by Caren Rangi as Chair, with members Tania Lee Hodges, Te Raumawhitu Kupenga, Donna Matahaere-Atariki, Mereana Kim Ngārimu, and Brenda Steele.

 “I am confident that this panel reflects the broad range of skill and expertise required to appropriately review Whānau Ora.

 “Each member contributes to an impressive array of expertise, from knowledge of government systems, policy development and implementation through to service provision, clinical, cultural and community experience, and of course understanding of the Whānau Ora system as it has evolved since 2010,” Peeni Henare said.

 The review panel will deliver a report on their findings in November 2018 and is expected to report back to Cabinet in December 2018.
