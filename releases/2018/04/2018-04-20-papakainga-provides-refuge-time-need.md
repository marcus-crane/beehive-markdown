One year on from the Edgecumbe floods local whānau in ongoing and urgent need of a place to live will now benefit from new papakāinga housing, says Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Minister has attended the opening and blessing of five two-bedroom, pre-fabricated homes at Kōkōhīnau Marae today. The $2.7 million development was carried out with funding support from the Te Puni Kōkiri Māori Housing Network and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment

“This initiative involving the marae, government agencies and the wider community is a good example of local collaboration to address a specific housing need,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The marae committee was there to provide immediate shelter for whānau left homeless during the floods. Bringing forward of plans for their papakāinga development to help whānau in ongoing need is an extension of their manaakitanga. Through the provision of warm, safe, affordable housing, whānau will receive the help they need to rebuild and move forward.”

Besides the five homes that have been developed, the papakāinga also has a provision for a further 14 homes to be built at the site.

“The Kōkōhīnau Marae papakāinga emergency housing response showcases the kind of work Te Puni Kokiri undertook to partner community initiatives to provide homes, jobs and training for whānau, and working alongside housing developer EasyBuild and the community in this instance.”

The minister noted this site has potential for further houses, including some to accommodate larger whānau. “I have asked my Te Puni Kōkiri officials to work with the Kōkōhīnau papakāinga committee, and with other government agencies to make the most of this opportunity, so we can see a secure housing option for whānau in their community.”

The Pahipoto Māori Committee which oversees Kōkōhīnau Marae has agreed that once the need for temporary housing is lifted the five homes opened today will be retained for affordable kaumātua housing.
