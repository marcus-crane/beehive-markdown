Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is travelling to Europe and Singapore this week to hold bilateral meetings and attend the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).

The Foreign Affairs Minister will visit Brussels for a range of calls on senior figures in the European Union, NATO, and the Belgian government to discuss trade and security issues. Mr Peters will also pay his respects at several World War One commemorative sites in Belgium during his visit.

“Our shared values and commitment to the global rules-based system make the EU an important partner for New Zealand in today’s increasingly uncertain world,” said Mr Peters.

Following his visit to Belgium he will travel to London to meet with the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, and attend the 25th CHOGM with the Leaders and Foreign Ministers of over 50 Commonwealth nations.

“Along with the New Zealand Prime Minister, I will hold a number of bilateral meetings with our Commonwealth counterparts discussing issues of shared interest,” said Mr Peters.

The Foreign Affairs Minister will then travel to visit Singapore, one of New Zealand’s closest partners in Asia, to hold discussions with the Singaporean government.
