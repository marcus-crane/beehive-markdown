Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little has welcomed the Waitangi Tribunal’s report on the Whakatōhea mandate.

“The Tribunal acknowledged that the package on the table is a good package but there are some concerns about the process.

“I’ve just received the report this afternoon and will have a close study of the full report and the recommendations.

 “We take seriously what the Tribunal says as this is about ensuring that there is integrity to the settlement negotiations. The recommendation that Whakatōhea has a say on next steps aligns well with a key Treaty settlement principle that the members of the iwi themselves must show support for a settlement before it can be concluded.

“I’d like to acknowledge the Pre-Settlement Claims Trust and all the hard work they have done to date over a six year mandating period and the earlier efforts of Whakatōhea to settle in the mid 1990s. I’d also like to acknowledge the whānau and hapū members who’ve given evidence to the Tribunal in this process.”

“The Treaty of Waitangi settlement process is about acknowledging the injustices of the past, to fulfil the aspirations of Māori and all New Zealanders for the future. My commitment is to reach a fair and durable settlement with Whakatōhea,” says Andrew Little.
