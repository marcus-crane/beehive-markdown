Construction of the new Pukekohe West primary school in Auckland is set to begin next year, with an Establishment Board of Trustees in the process of being appointed.

Education Minister Chris Hipkins says the school, which will initially be called Pukekohe West School, will be built on a four-hectare site in Belmont, and have an initial build roll of 350 students.

“Once selected and appointed, the Establishment Board of Trustees will contribute to the school’s design, vision, and staffing plan,” Chris Hipkins says.

“Data projections show that the population in Pukekohe is expected to double from 21,000 people now, to more than 40,000 people by 2040.  We’re building a new school to make sure that the local schooling network is set up to cope with the projected population growth in the area.

"Pukekohe West School will also include provision for special education facilities including a Sensory Resource Centre for Blind and Low Vision Education Network New Zealand (BLENNZ).

“This is an exciting new development for Pukehohe and I’m looking forward to watching the school take shape over the next few years,” Chris Hipkins says.

Pukekohe West School is expected to open in 2021. It will be a contributing Year 1-6 school, and will have room to expand in the future if needed.
