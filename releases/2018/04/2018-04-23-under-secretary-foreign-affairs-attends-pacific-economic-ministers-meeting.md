Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau is travelling to Palau today to represent New Zealand at the Pacific Islands Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) from 25-27 April.

The FEMM is an annual meeting of finance ministers and senior officials to discuss a broad range of economic management and development issues in the Pacific to identify sectoral opportunities and constraints for a region-wide approach to development.

“Following on from my attendance at the Pacific Business Days in Papaetee recently and a day in Auckland yesterday hearing the views of Pacific business representatives and others in the private sector, I am looking forward to leading the New Zealand delegation at this important event for the Pacific region,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

The key theme of the meeting is building economic resilience, with a particular focus on climate change and natural disasters.

A resulting “FEMM Action Plan” will be provided to Pacific Island Forum leaders in advance of their September meeting held in Nauru.
