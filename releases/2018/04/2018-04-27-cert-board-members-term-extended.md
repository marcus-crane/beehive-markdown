Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran has extended the term of members of the CERT NZ Establishment Advisory Board by an additional six months.

The Board will provide advice to the Minister and CERT NZ on cyber security.

“The combined expertise and experiences of the Board members will provide key insights as CERT NZ continues to serve New Zealand’s cyber security needs both as they are occurring today, and into the future,” said Clare Curran.

“Digital technologies provide new avenues for criminals and other states to gain advantage and cause harm here.  Cyber threats are increasing in number and are becoming more and more sophisticated.

“I’m pleased all existing Board members have agreed to stay on and advise CERT NZ as we work through the refresh of our cyber security action plan, which I announced recently.

“Their expertise and insight will add value to the refresh and help protect the information and network systems that are vital to our economic growth, ensure the integrity and security of our increasingly digitalised government services and make sure Kiwis can interact online without suffering harm.”  

“The nine Board members have extensive careers in cyber security and related fields, in both the public and private sectors, and have been appointed for an additional term of six months, bringing their term to 24 months.”

The Cabinet paper on this extension is being proactively released and is attached.
