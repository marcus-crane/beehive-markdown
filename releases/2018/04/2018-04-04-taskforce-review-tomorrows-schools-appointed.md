The experts charged with undertaking the biggest review of the way our schools are governed, managed and administered in 30 years have been appointed.

 Education Minister Chris Hipkins says our schooling system needs to be able to respond to the education needs of the future. This Government wants a high quality public education system that brings out the very best in all New Zealanders.

 “The Tomorrow’s Schools Review Independent Taskforce will focus on the changes we need to make to governance, management and administration in education to ensure the fitness of the school system to meet the challenges we face,” Chris Hipkins says.

The Taskforce members are:

Bali Haque, Chair

Barbara Ala’alatoa

Mere Berryman         

John O’Neill

Cathy Wylie

 “I announced the [terms of reference](http://www.education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Ministry/consultations/Tomorrows-Schools-Review-Terms-of-Reference2.pdf) for the review in March. The taskforce will look at how we can better support equity and inclusion for all children throughout their schooling, what changes are needed to support their educational success, and at the fitness of our school system to equip all our students for the modern world.

 “The Taskforce will also be supported and informed by a designated cross-sector advisory panel of about 30 members that will include representatives of teachers, principals, boards of trustees, the LGBTQIA+ community, parents of children with additional learning needs, employers and young people.

 The organisations already invited to be represented on the panel include:   

NZ Educational Institute Te Riu Roa

NZ School Trustees Association

NZ Principals’ Federation

NZ Pasifika Principals

Association of Proprietors of Integrated Schools

Te Akatea

Secondary Principals Association of New Zealand (SPANZ)

Ngā Kura ā Iwi

NZ Association of Intermediate and Middle Schools

Area Schools Association of NZ

Post Primary Teachers Association

Special Education Principals Association

Te Rūnanga Nui o Ngā Kura Kaupapa Māori

 “This is a significant review that could have implications for a wide range of New Zealand families. That is why genuine and meaningful consultation is paramount, and I expect the Taskforce will spend the next few months gaining an understanding of our current system and engaging with all stakeholders on the themes and scope outlined in the [Terms of Reference](http://www.education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Ministry/consultations/Tomorrows-Schools-Review-Terms-of-Reference2.pdf).

 “The feedback from the [Education Conversation](https://conversation.education.govt.nz/) launched by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last month will play a key role in shaping the Taskforce’s advice to me.  It is one of the earliest chances for all New Zealanders to give their thoughts and experiences of the schooling system, and their advice on any improvements and changes.

 The Taskforce is due to report back to the Minister in November 2018. Its recommendations will form the basis for further public consultation in 2019.

 The review of Tomorrow’s Schools is part of the Government’s [education work programme](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/ambitious-three-year-work-programme-education), announced in February.
