Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has expressed her condolences to the families of those who died following reports that a van crashed into pedestrians at a busy intersection in Toronto, Canada.

“Our thoughts are with the victims of yesterday’s senseless tragedy, along with their families and friends. New Zealand stands with Canada during this difficult time,” Jacinda Ardern says.

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has written to his Canadian counterpart, Chrystia Freeland, to express New Zealand’s condolences.

The New Zealand High Commission in Ottawa is in contact with local authorities regarding the incident. There is no information to suggest New Zealanders have been affected at this time.
