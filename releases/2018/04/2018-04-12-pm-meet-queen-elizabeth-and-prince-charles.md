Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today confirmed she will meet Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in a private audience at Buckingham Palace while visiting London for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting next week.

“I am grateful that Her Majesty is taking the time to meet with me in what is an incredibly busy week for her as Head of the Commonwealth,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“This will be my first meeting with Her Majesty so I’m very much looking forward to sharing this government’s vision for New Zealand and our priorities.”

The audience with Her Majesty is an “on appointment” audience, which is offered to new Prime Ministers from those countries where the Queen is head of state. The Prime Minister will meet Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace on Thursday 19 April.

“I’ll also be meeting The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall the previous day at Clarence House. Their Royal Highnesses have had two very successful visits to New Zealand over the last few years, so this is a good chance to update them on issues of interest.

“I’m also looking forward to a very special Youth Town Hall where I will be meeting students from three London schools and hearing about the key social issues which concern them like gender equality.”

The Youth Town Hall is being hosted at City Hall on Wednesday 18 April by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who has also invited Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.

The Prime Minister departs for Europe on Friday 13 April and spends a day with New Zealand athletes competing in the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. In Europe she will meet the President of France Emmanuel Macron in Paris, German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and British Prime Minister Theresa May.
