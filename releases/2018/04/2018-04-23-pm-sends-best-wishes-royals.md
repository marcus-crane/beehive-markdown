Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has congratulated Their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, on the birth of their son.

“On behalf of the people of New Zealand I would like to congratulate Catherine, Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte on the arrival of their new little son and brother,” Jacinda Ardern says.

“I am sure that New Zealanders join with me in celebrating the birth of a new baby to such a close and loving family.”

Jacinda Ardern also extended her congratulations to The Queen and Prince Phillip, and The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, on the arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family.

New Zealand's official gift to the Royal couple will be a hand-crafted 100 per cent wool baby blanket featuring a manuka flower and seed pod design, and a selection of New Zealand children’s books. 

“I also gave a personal gift of hand-made rompers with buzzy bee lining, sewn by a family member.”

A 21 gun salute will be fired from Point Jerningham, Wellington, to celebrate the birth.

“I wish Prince William, Catherine, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and the Royal Family all the very best,” Jacinda Ardern said.
