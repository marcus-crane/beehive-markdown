The final seven members of the Digital Economy and Digital Inclusion (DEDI) Advisory Group have been announced.

Broadcasting, Communications, Digital Media and Government Digital Services Minister Clare Curran established the Group earlier this year to advise the Government on how it can build the digital economy and reduce the digital divides.

“We now have 15 people with a wide range of skills and expertise, from across a variety of sectors, on the DEDI group. They will help us ensure all New Zealanders have affordable access to digital services and the skills and desire to be fully involved in our digital world,” Clare Curran said.

“I’m committed to making sure no-one is left behind by the pace of technological change which is affecting the way we work, learn, relax and interact with each other.

“There was an overwhelming response from people with the skills, vision and enthusiasm to join the group who want to help all New Zealanders take full advantage of the opportunities provided by digital technology.

“Creating a blueprint for digital inclusion will help ensure New Zealand businesses and all Kiwis have access to connectivity, as well as the foundational skills and motivation, to thrive in their online lives.

“The 15 members have been appointed for a period of 12 months and I expect to meet with them next month to discuss the Group’s work programme for the year. There’ll also be opportunities for people with different sector-specific expertise to be part of this work and shape the way we tackle digital divides,” says Ms Curran.
