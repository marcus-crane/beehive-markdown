I welcome the announcement of the [Primary Sector Council](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/primary-sector-council-announced) by Minister O’Connor today, says Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri.

The Council is a much-needed step forward for the primary sector. The Council will bring independent and fresh strategic thinking to a vision and provide leadership to the primary industries.

“We must be brave and tackle the challenges as well as step up to the opportunities that come from a time of great change,” Meka Whaitiri said.

“I look forward to a conversation with the Council in May and to hearing their thinking around my areas of responsibility as Associate Minister.

“I want to ensure we meet our immediate and future skills needs in the primary industries – particularly growing science, technology and innovation skill development.

“There is significant opportunity to lift the productivity within the Maori agribusiness sector of which much of the land is Maori freehold land with multiple owners presenting additional challenges.

“I’m also very pleased to see the wide range of people making up the Council and acknowledge Minister O’Connor’s commitment to making this a reality. This is important for ensuring a diversity of viewpoints and makes for a richer perspective coming from the Council,” Meka Whaitiri said.
