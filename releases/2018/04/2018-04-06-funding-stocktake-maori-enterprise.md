The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will invest $100,000 in work to better understand the current state of Māori enterprise and education in Taranaki and develop a future pathway.

The announcement was made today at the launch of the *Tapuae Roa: Make Way for Taranaki Action Plan* in New Plymouth today.

The Māori Enterprise and Education Stocktake will focus on science, technology, engineering, arts/design, mathematics, innovation, and digital to identify the next steps to progress long-term economic benefits for Māori.

“This project will help in the creation of a plan to help us realise the incredible potential of Māori in Taranaki and drive economic growth for the whole region. Its results will also provide a useful roadmap for the rest of the country,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

*Tapuae Roa* is focused on developing four future areas: Māori economy futures, energy futures, food futures and visitor sector futures.

“All of these goals can significantly benefit from uplifting Māori expertise.

“The stocktake is a critical first stage in the implementation of the Māori economy futures,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

Te Puni Kokiri will contribute a further $50,000 to the project.
