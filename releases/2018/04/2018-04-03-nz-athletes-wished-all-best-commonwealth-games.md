Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson today wished the New Zealand team the best of luck as the Commonwealth Games opens on the Gold Coast in Australia.

“The Commonwealth Games holds a special place in New Zealand’s national identity, contributing some of our greatest sporting achievements over the years. I’m certain that our athletes will be breaking records again on the Gold Coast,” Grant Robertson said.

“The team is already making history. We have sent our largest ever contingent of 251 athletes. This includes athletes and teams which are featuring for the first time at a Commonwealth Games such as in beach volleyball and women's sevens rugby.

“The Commonwealth Games is made even more special by the fact that all of our athletes will be competing alongside each other, with an impressive group competing in Para events. This will also be the first Commonwealth Games to have an equal number of men’s and women’s events across all sports.

“I know New Zealand’s team will be cheered on all around the world as Kiwis near and far tune in to watch our athletes like flag bearer Sophie Pascoe, who is defending two titles, and Dame Valerie Adams, who will be competing for her fourth straight title. I’m also excited for those making their debuts – some of New Zealand’s most successful athletes first became world-beaters at the Commonwealth Games. I wish them all the best of luck.”
