**New Zealand assistance for Ambae, Vanuatu**

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced a further $500,000 package of support to the Government of Vanuatu as it plans to relocate affected communities to safe sites off Ambae Island following ongoing volcanic activity.

This brings the total New Zealand support to the response to $2.5 million since September last year.

“Two New Zealand Defence Force aircraft will fly from Auckland to Luganville carrying over 22 tonnes of relief supplies including mother and infant kits, family hygiene kits, jerry cans, shelter tool kits and tarpaulins,” said Mr Peters.

As the Government of Vanuatu makes plans to relocate the residents of Ambae Island, New Zealand supplies will be used to assist communities impacted by the ongoing eruptions and support their longer-term recovery,” he said.

A second deployment of relief supplies including water tanks, rainwater harvesting kits, food and water will be transported to Vanuatu on the HMNZS Canterbury which departs Auckland today.

New Zealand has been working with FRANZ partners Australia and France to assist the Government of Vanuatu since increased volcanic activity began in September 2017.

New Zealand has provided ongoing technical assistance since renewed volcanic activity started in March this year, including through the deployment of four GNS Science specialists currently in-country providing increased technical support to the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department (VMGD).

“This is a major operation for the Government of Vanuatu and as a trusted partner and friend New Zealand stands by ready to assist further,” said Mr Peters.
