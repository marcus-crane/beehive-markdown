The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will invest $100,000 to support Taranaki’s entrepreneurs and innovators, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Regional Economic Development Fletcher Tabuteau says.

The funding will contribute to a feasibility study into the creation of innovation precincts in the region.

“Taranaki has a small but growing entrepreneurial community,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“What these start-ups often need is a focal point, a sense of connection with others and a way to share ideas and knowledge.

“The feasibility study will investigate how a series of connected precincts, with a central New Plymouth hub, could support innovation and community engagement. While this is a small investment, it has the potential to lead to much bigger and better things.

“The proposed innovation precincts are anticipated to be in New Plymouth, Hawera, Stratford, Opunake, Waitara and Waverly/Patea and would include shared co-working and meeting spaces, incubator programmes, education and training delivery, and private sector participation,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
