Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today that the Government has invested $610,649 in 25 projects to improve safety at racecourses.

The grants are made available from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety across two funding rounds.

This year’s first funding round has supported a range of infrastructure projects including track maintenance equipment, irrigation system installation, replacement running rails and track lighting upgrades.

The fund plays an important role in supporting the safety of the racing industry for animals, staff and the wider public. In many areas these facilities are widely used by the community, and not just on race days.

The next funding round opens for applications on 14 February 2018 and closes on 31 March 2018.

New Zealand’s racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, are encouraged to apply to the Fund where there are safety improvements that need assistance.
