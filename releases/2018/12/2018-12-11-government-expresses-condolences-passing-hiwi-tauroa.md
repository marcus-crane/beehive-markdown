Tiwhatiwha te Pō!

Kakarauru te Pō!

I au i te Pō kerekere, i au i te Pō tangotango ka rapua kei hea koe e ngaro nei e! 

Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti Minister Kelvin Davis and Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today paid tribute to former Race Relations Conciliator (Commissioner) and Māori All Black Hiwi Tauroa (DCMG, CNZM, JP), who passed away yesterday surrounded by his whānau.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Government we acknowledge the important contribution Hiwi Tauroa has made to the country,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Hiwi Tauroa was a highly accomplished New Zealander whose time as an educator, rugby coach, Auckland regional councillor, former Race Relations Conciliator and Māori All Black saw him earn many impressive achievements and accolades.

“Hiwi was a well-respected leader, not only for his people of Te Tai Tokerau, but as Race Relations Conciliator during the Springbok Tour of 1981 where he worked hard to bring biculturalism and tolerance to the national stage,” Kelvin Davis said.

Nanaia Mahuta said that Hiwi Tauroa has been a servant to his people across a wide range of issues in Aotearoa.

“He served as chairman of Te Māngai Paho and the NZ Sports Foundation, and was a former Board Member on the Massey University Council, the NZ Council for Educational Research, the NZ Principals Association, the United Nations Indigenous Peoples Trust Board and the Te Tai Tokerau Māori Trust Board,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Kelvin Davis said: “We mourn his loss and send our sincere condolences to Hiwi’s beloved wife Pat, their whānau, tamariki and mokopuna.

“E kara e Hiwi, whakarerea i ngā pēhitanga o te ao kikokiko. Mahue iho mai mātou e tangi, e auē nei,” Kelvin Davis said
