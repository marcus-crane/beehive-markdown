The Tomorrow’s Schools Independent Taskforce is proposing significant changes to the way our schools are run, governed, and managed to ensure every student receives the best quality education in future, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today.

“We set up the Taskforce, as part of our Education Conversation with all New Zealanders, to get an independent view of the state of compulsory schooling in New Zealand,” Chris Hipkins said.

“They have delivered the report and bold recommendations which I hope will prompt wide and deep discussion about what our schooling system should look like for the next 30 years.

“We know, from the 43,000 New Zealanders who responded to the wider Education Conversation | Korero Mātauranga, that people want change.

“Much has changed since the last major schooling system review took place 30 years ago. For example, there is greater diversity across our student population, and our schools are dealing with more complex issues including student and teacher wellbeing, than was the case back then.

“The next four and half months until April 7, 2019 provides opportunity for the wider public discussion we are seeking.

“Now is the chance for all New Zealanders to have their say on building a schooling system that meets the needs of all students, educators and parents, and that is fit for purpose for the 21st century.

“The Taskforce will lead the consultation, and report on the results. The Government will make decisions on implementing the review in mid-2019,” Chris Hipkins said.
