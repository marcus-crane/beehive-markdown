A proposal to clarify the rules for rebuilding homes in some eastern suburbs of Christchurch has been given the go ahead.

The Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration, Megan Woods announced today that she has approved the proposal that will amend the Christchurch District Plan.

Almost 95 percent (131) of the 138 written comments received were in favour of the proposal.

“This decision will help to provide greater certainty and fairness over building in these suburbs. I wanted the families involved to be able to go into Christmas without that uncertainty hanging over them.

“The proposal I have approved was developed by Christchurch City Council after it was highlighted there was an absence of a specific policy direction to support the Residential Unit Overlay.

“The Residential Unit Overlay is an area that includes parts of New Brighton, South New Brighton, Southshore and Redcliffs where the risk of flooding is mainly from sea level rise.

“People with vacant sites within the Residential Unit Overlay where homes have been demolished following the earthquakes, and people with houses needing earthquake repairs, will now be able to build without requiring a resource consent, where they meet the requirements.”

Woods says all the written comments received were taken into account in making her decision.

“I would like to thank everyone who took the time to provide their feedback.

“Approving the proposal addresses an unfair situation affecting people in a specific geographic area as a result of the earthquake - this will help that community to rebuild and move forward.

“I’m comfortable that while the changes favour an accommodation rather than avoidance approach to some developments in the High Flood Hazard Management Area, this is unlikely to compromise future climate adaptation work.

“It will be for Council to develop new coastal hazard provisions for the Christchurch District Plan,” says Megan Woods.

The proposal uses section 71 of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act 2016 to make the amendments to the Christchurch District Plan.
