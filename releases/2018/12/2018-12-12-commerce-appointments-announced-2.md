Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi today announced two appointments to the Commerce Commission and the appointment of a new member to the Accreditation Council.

 Dr John Small has been appointed as an associate member of the Commerce Commission. His appointment increases the number of associate members to four.

 “I am pleased to appoint Dr Small to the Commerce Commission,” Mr Faafoi says. “His extensive expertise in competition and regulatory economics across a number of different sectors will be valuable for a range of the Commission’s functions. 

Sarah Court has been reappointed as an associate member of the Commerce Commission under the cross-appointment arrangement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).

 “Ms Court’s considerable expertise and experience in competition and consumer law and practice will support the Commission in carrying out its work under the Commerce, Fair Trading and Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Acts. Her appointment also promotes Trans-Tasman cooperation on competition and consumer issues affecting markets in both countries.

 Marion Cowden has been appointed as a new member of the Accreditation Council. Ms Cowden fills the vacancy left by Council member Lindsey Lawton.

 “Ms Cowden’s strong financial and governance background in the public and private sectors, both nationally and internationally, will bring a valuable perspective to the Council. I would also like to thank Lindsey Lawton for her contribution to the Council over the last four years,” Kris Faafoi says.
