Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Andrew Little, today welcomed Te Ariki Tā Tumu Te Heuheu and members of Ngāti Tūwharetoa to Parliament to witness the Third Reading of their Treaty Settlement legislation, the Ngāti Tūwharetoa Claims Settlement Bill.

The Settlement provides Crown Apology redress, including an agreed historical account and Crown acknowledgments of its historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Ngāti Tūwharetoa will receive financial and commercial redress of $25 million, and cultural redress, including funds totalling $3.95 million, to support their aspirations for the cultural and environmental revitalisation of Ngāti Tūwharetoa. They will also have 32 sites of cultural significance returned to them.

Reaching this milestone has been a long journey for Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Mr Little said.

“Not only did this October mark five years since my officials first visited Waihi Marae at Tokaanu, but the passage of your Bill through Parliament this year faced delays not of Ngāti Tūwharetoa’s making.”

“Ngāti Tūwharetoa have shown considerable patience in reaching settlement, and I sincerely thank them for it. They have carefully negotiated this settlement and it is my hope that this Bill will provide the iwi with the means to support and develop their people in ways that best suits their needs,” Mr Little said.

With a population of about 36,000, Ngāti Tūwharetoa are the fifth largest iwi in New Zealand, and are centred around Lake Taupō (Taupōmoana) and the Central Plateau, covering most of the Central North Island region.
