The [Public Service Workforce Data 2018 report](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/2018-public-service-workforce-data-published) released today shows improvements for women in the public service, says Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter.

The annual report by the State Services Commission shows the 2018 public service gender pay gap fell to 12.2 percent from 12.5 percent in 2017.

“Today’s release shows momentum is building by this government to ensure progress for women,” said Julie Anne Genter.

“We are making progress on closing the gender pay gap in the public service with the smallest gap since measurement began 18 years ago.

“I am particularly pleased that there are now more women in senior management and chief executive roles.

“The Government’s Gender Pay Action Plan that Minister for State Services Chris Hipkins and I launched earlier this year has a clear plan for how we will get faster progress for women in the public sector.

“Addressing diversity in the workforce means better decision making and a fairer workplace.

“New Zealand has more work to do to ensure our workplaces are fully gender equal.

“There is further work required to tackle the ‘double penalty’ of ethnic gender pay gaps especially for Māori, Pacific and Asian women as well as pay gaps related to disability, age and other factors.

“It is important that our public service reflects the communities that it serves,” said Julie Anne Genter.
