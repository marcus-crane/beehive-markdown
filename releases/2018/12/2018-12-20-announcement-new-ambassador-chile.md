Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of career diplomat Linda Te Puni as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Chile.

“New Zealand and Chile enjoy a close and long-standing relationship and Ms Te Puni is very well qualified to continue our work together,” Mr Peters said.

“As Pacific countries with shared democratic values, we work closely with Chile on a number of important international issues and have deepening trade and economic ties. New Zealand is also currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the Pacific Alliance group of countries which includes Chile, Peru, Mexico and Colombia. 

“A Spanish speaker, Ms Te Puni is currently a Special Adviser in the Americas and Asia Group. She has previously served New Zealand as non-resident High Commissioner to Tuvalu, as the Administrator of Tokelau, as well as Consul-General to the French Pacific and High Commissioner to the Cook Islands.”

The Embassy in Santiago is accredited to Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
