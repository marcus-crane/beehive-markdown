A new service will be trialled in Napier next year to help younger students at risk of disconnection from school because of suspension, expulsion and non-attendance, Associate Education Minister Tracey Martin announced today.

“The prototype, the Napier Student Managed Moved Service, is the first in New Zealand to be designed for primary rather than secondary school students,” says Tracey Martin.

The service will be run by a consortium of Napier schools and Communities of Learning  (Kāhui Ako), with strong whānau support to improve outcomes for Year 3 to 8 (ages 7 to 12) children at risk of being disengaged from education.

Minister Martin said that Cabinet yesterday approved investing $1.086 million to implement and evaluate the service, which will begin operating in 2019.

“I met with a group of people from the consortium in Napier last month and they said that a growing group of primary aged students were at risk of being disengaged from the learning process and even the school environment more generally.

“Persistent themes for Napier include high transience, low attendance, high suspensions and exclusions, and a concerning number of students not enrolled in school.

“What they also said, however, was that they had a solution – and I was very pleased, along with Education Minister Chris Hipkins, to be able to take a proposal to cabinet.

“Learners need support before they become disengaged. That support needs to be relevant and tailored to individual students and I believe this service will achieve these aims.”

“We want to help kids stay in school and to take the pressure off classrooms.”

The service will act as a support structure that aims to keep students in their school, or alternatively enrol them in another school. It will be a prototype lasting three years and will be fully and independently evaluated.

**Background notes for editors:**

In 2017 a Napier-wide Steering Group was established by the three Kāhui Ako in the city – Mataruahou, Matariki and Ahuriri – as well as representatives from Te Kura, schools, local iwi and other government agencies. This consortium developed the Napier Student Managed Move Service prototype.

The Managed Move Service team gets involved on referral from the host school, once the usual interventions and resources available to that school have been exhausted, but prior to any consideration of suspension or exclusion. This new service will also be able to help locate and assist students who are currently not enrolled and manage them back into the education system.

The service will be driven by a Transition Team led by a Coordinator. The Coordinator and Team will be responsible for the rapid (10 days or less) development of an individualised plan for the student inclusive of in-school and community wide expertise, whānau members and a trusted adult in the child’s life.

There are two parts to the proposed service. Both aim to reunite and reintegrate the student back to his/her host school.

- The Process-Based Managed Move Service involves clear referral pathways for the host school, a dedicated coordinator, a multi-disciplinary transition team inclusive of whānau, and an individualised plan within 10 days. The Managed Move Coordinator and Student Transition team support the move to a new school with as little disruption as possible to the student and their whānau and both the host and recipient schools. At the end of a ten week trial period, a decision is made by the child, whānau, schools and services about whether they stay at the new school or return to their home school.
- The Venue-Based Managed Move service is a venue-based option for students who need to be removed from the traditional school environment for a period of time.This is an education-based initiative that draws on other social sector resources for the Year 3 to 8 target group. Wrap-around support made up of teaching resources, whānau liaison and social support will be available at the venue. Learning in line with the New Zealand curriculum will continue during the placement. The aim in all cases is to place the student permanently into their original or a new school.
