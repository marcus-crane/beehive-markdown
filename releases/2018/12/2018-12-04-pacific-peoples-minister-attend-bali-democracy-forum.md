Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio will support the principles of democracy and good governance at the Bali Democracy Forum XI this week. 

Mr Sio will travel today to represent New Zealand at the annual Forum which is being held in Bali on the 6-7 December.

The Forum was established in 2008 to promote progressive democratic governance in the Asia-Pacific region, and has become a regional platform for sharing experience in building democratic institutions. 

“New Zealand has supported this Forum since its inception, and it’s important we continue to support the stability and prosperity of our region,” says Aupito William Sio. 

“This year’s theme is ‘Democracy for Prosperity’ which goes to the heart of the vision and values of the New Zealand Government: good governance, equality, rule of law, and the importance of inclusion being central to economic and social policies for New Zealanders.

“The Forum comes at a significant time in New Zealand’s relationship with Indonesia as we celebrate 60 years of formal diplomatic relations and elevation in our relationship to a Comprehensive Partnership,” says Aupito William Sio.
