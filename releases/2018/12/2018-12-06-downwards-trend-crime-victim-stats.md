Police Minister Stuart Nash says Police deserve acknowledgement for efforts to prevent crime and improve community safety, as new data shows a significant drop in the number of people who have been victims of crime.

In the 12 months to 31 October 2018 the number of victimisations recorded by Police fell by 3.5 percent. “This means 9,353 fewer people were victims of a crime during the year, compared to the preceding 12 months,” Mr Nash says.

“One of the Government’s top three priorities is to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders. We are building safer and more connected communities.

“The fall in recorded crime equates to 1,304 fewer crimes against a person and 8,049 fewer crimes against property. Of note, there were 6,377 fewer burglaries and clearance rates for burglary have increased.

“Burglaries are a key focus for Police. It is an invasive crime which greatly affects how safe people feel in their homes and communities. That’s why it is such a high priority.

“We know one of the greatest crime prevention tools is the visibility of Police in the community. That’s why the coalition agreement with New Zealand First strives to increase Police numbers by 1800 extra officers. We are making good progress and 941 new constables have already been deployed around the country. The net gain, accounting for attrition in the current workforce, is expected to be between 450-500 frontline officers by the end of the year.

 “We have a particular focus on community policing and organised crime, which is a driver of crimes such as burglary and assault. We are committed to building a country where people feel healthy, safe and happy in their homes and communities.

“I commend Police for their efforts to prevent crime, in particular their focus on organised crime such as this week’s operation in Rotorua which has disrupted the methamphetamine trade by members of the Head Hunters gang. I am committed to supporting Police to keep communities safe, Mr Nash said.
