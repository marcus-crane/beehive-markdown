Work to co-locate Marlborough Girls’ and Boys’ Colleges on a new site will begin in the New Year, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

The rebuilt Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges will be co-located on the site currently occupied by Marlborough Girls’ College and Bohally Intermediate. Bohally Intermediate will be re-located and rebuilt on the current Marlborough Boys’ College site.

The decision has been made after an extensive search to find an alternative green-field site – the preferred option of both colleges and the community – proved unsuccessful.

“After years of uncertainty, people in Blenheim finally have clarity about the future locations of both the Colleges and Bohally Intermediate,” Chris Hipkins said.

“The search for a suitable site has taken much longer than we would have wanted. The Marlborough community has worked with the Government over many months and we appreciate their time and constructive engagement. 

“Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges’ facilities are in poor condition. Their buildings have deteriorated and have weather tightness issues.

“When I became the Education Minister, I made a commitment to the community to move forward work on the co-located colleges’ project, and I’m delighted that we’ve now made progress. I would also like to acknowledge the Board Chair and Principal of Bohally Intermediate who have worked with us to help us find a way forward.

“This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that our schools around the country are modern and fit-for-purpose to support students to succeed,” Chris Hipkins said.

Preliminary design work will begin early in the New Year.

**Notes for editors**

Ministry of Education officials were asked in September to continue looking for a green-field site until the end of the year. If no suitable site had been found by then, the Minister instructed the Ministry to go ahead with the combined Marlborough Girls’ College / Bohally Intermediate site and re-locate and rebuild Bohally Intermediate on the Boys’ College site.
