Foreign Minister Winston Peters today announced that diplomat Dr Trevor Matheson has been appointed the new High Commissioner to Samoa, with accreditation to American Samoa.

“As a long-serving diplomat, Dr Matheson is more than suitably qualified for his new role,” says Mr Peters.

“Dr Matheson has more than three decades experience and is currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to the Republic of Indonesia. He has previously served as Ambassador to Italy and Saudi Arabia, and Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations in Rome.

“As one of our closest neighbours, and one of our longest standing partners we have had close relations with Samoa since it achieved independence in 1962.

“More than 144,000 Samoans live in New Zealand, and their art, sport, language and politics make an important contribution to New Zealand and Dr Matheson will be responsible for continuing to uphold this long-standing relationship.”
