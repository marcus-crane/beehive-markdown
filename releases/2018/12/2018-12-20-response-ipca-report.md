The Minister of Police has written to the Commissioner of Police following the release of the IPCA report into complaints about the Deputy Commissioner Wallace Haumaha.

“I have asked the Commissioner of Police to advise me how he intends to respond to the findings of the IPCA report. The report did not make any recommendations but it is clear that a finding of improper and unprofessional behaviour requires follow up action,” Mr Nash says.

“No Police officer, at any level in the organisation, should act improperly or unprofessionally and I am disappointed to hear the IPCA found it happened in this case.

“The behaviour identified in the IPCA report does not meet the high standards I expect. It is not in line with Police values, which require professionalism and for officers to treat colleagues and the public with respect.

“It is important now that Police learn from this. The IPCA has identified behaviours that need more work, and I want the Commissioner to advise me how he will take oversight of this.

“I also want to know how the Commissioner will manage future inter-agency work aimed at improving justice-sector outcomes for Maori. I want to ensure there is a clear project management framework for all such projects,” Mr Nash says.
