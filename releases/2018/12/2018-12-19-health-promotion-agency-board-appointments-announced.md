New appointments to the Health Promotion Agency (HPA) board have been announced today by Associate Health Minister Jenny Salesa.

Jenny Black will become HPA’s new board chair, while Mafi Funaki-Tahifote, Dr Teuila Percival and Professor Boyd Swinburn will all join the board for a three-year term.

“HPA has an important role in promoting health and wellbeing in Aotearoa, and those joining the board will bring much valued skill and expertise,” says Jenny Salesa.

“The new board members have extensive health sector backgrounds – from leadership roles to working on the ground in the health profession. All have been long-time champions of healthy eating and healthy living.

“Ms Black, a clinical dietician by training, is currently the chair of Nelson Marlborough and West Coast DHBs. She also chairs the DHB executives committee and DHB Chairs group.

“Dr Percival has been a consultant paediatrician for 25 years and has a specific interest in Pacific people’s health. Ms Funaki-Tahifote is currently the chair on the Board for Agencies for Nutrition Action, and Professor Swinburn is a director of the World Health Organisation’s Collaborating Centre for Obesity.

“The new board members will be a great fit for HPA as the organisation contributes toward the Government’s commitment to achieving equitable health outcomes in New Zealand. 

“I would like to acknowledge the outgoing chair Dr Lee Mathias and board members Professor Grant Schofield, Tony O'Brien and Jamie Simpson, who have done great work for the board over many years,” says Jenny Salesa.
