Iraq is host to New Zealand’s largest military deployment supporting the Iraqi Government and the International Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s efforts to rid Iraq of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS.

The Embassy in Iraq plays a critical role in supporting New Zealand’s commitment to working with the Coalition to contribute to a more stable and secure Middle East free from the scourge of terrorism.

“New Zealand is also making an important contribution to development and humanitarian assistance in Iraq. We contribute towards initiatives to help recovery and rebuilding in areas liberated from ISIS, and support the removal of explosive hazards left by the conflict enabling Iraqis to return to their homes."
