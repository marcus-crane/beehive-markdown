A new Health and Safety at Work Strategy commits New Zealand to better practices in the workplace for the next decade, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Iain Lees-Galloway announced today.

“The Government is determined to ensure that all New Zealanders can return home to their friends and whanau in the same health as when they began their day at work,” says Mr Lees-Galloway.

“Our commitment to improving the wellbeing of all New Zealanders must have a focus on making our workplaces healthier and safer. Putting New Zealand workers at the centre of our strategy is key.

“We have made significant progress in reducing work-related harm since the Pike River tragedy but it is clear there is much more we can and must do. There are still 50-60 deaths from work injuries each year and 600-900 deaths from exposures to health risks associated with their work. This is unacceptably high and the pace of progress has stalled.

“New Zealand can be among the world-leaders for workplace health and safety if we can get our attitudes and practices right. The Strategy will help us achieve this, by focusing on what makes the biggest impact in key areas that we must improve.

“To make a real difference, we need to take a broader view of work-related health risks, including mental health. Equally important to me, is to lift the outcomes for workers at greatest risk, including Maori, who are over represented in injury statistics. These are reflected in the Strategy’s priority areas.

“Success depends on everyone playing their part and I thank all those who provided ideas and feedback to help us shape the Strategy.

“Public consultation on the draft Strategy showed strong support for its overall approach, goals and priority areas. Around 500 people attended the workshops and 127 written submissions were received.

“Our next step will be to turn the Strategy’s vision into action. I anticipate government agencies will align their health and safety-related work with the Strategy. I also encourage sectors, businesses and communities to do the same.

“I will establish a stakeholder reference group to provide me advice on progress and help maintain that long-term focus and momentum,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

The final Strategy can be found on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s website together with the summary of submissions and factsheets by area of interest: [www.mbie.govt.nz/health-and-safety-strategy](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/health-and-safety-strategy)

**Notes to editor:**

- The Strategy will set out a direction for New Zealand’s workplace health and safety over the next 10 years.
- It was jointly developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and WorkSafe New Zealand, together with a range of stakeholders. It is informed by research, previous Strategy evaluations and public consultation on the draft Strategy.
- Its development flows on from the recommendations of the Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety that reviewed New Zealand’s system in response to the Pike River tragedy in 2012.
