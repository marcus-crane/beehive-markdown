Today’s announcement that nearly a million dollars will be injected into Coromandel aquaculture and marine services is great news for the people of Hauraki, said the Minister of Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

“Today’s announcement by Minister Shane Jones comes as a Christmas present for our people across the region. They will know they have a Government that is working for them.

“The funding will be in feasibility studies to get the planning right for the industry that  will support my people’s ambitions in aquaculture and marine services.

“The Provincial Growth Fund means that this community will able to broaden training, employment and enterprise schemes right across Hauraki,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The money will be earmarked for three Coromandel projects including a feasibility study to expand the Sugarloaf wharf.

“The Government has made it clear that it’s prepared to fast track these studies as it will make such a difference to the people of Coromandel and Hauraki,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
