The Section 8I Report is the first opportunity to track the progress our Government is making against the Waitangi Tribunal’s recommendations, Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta said today. 

The Māori Development Minister is required annually to table this report in Parliament. This year it will take on a new format.

“The report provides a more meaningful and transparent account of the Crown’s progress before the Waitangi Tribunal,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We want to improve outcomes for more people and that requires doing things differently.

“Our Government’s emphasis is on a holistic approach to wellbeing. This needs to be reflected in all that we do; it sets the context for the new reporting approach outlined in this report.”

This year’s report covers progress from July 2017 to 30 June 2018, inclusive of the Wai 2200: Horowhenua: the Muaupoko Priority Report 2017, and Wai 2662: The Whakatōhea Mandate Inquiry report (2018).

It also details the Crown’s progress in relation to the findings and recommendations of the Waitangi Tribunal report *Ko Aotearoa Tēnei: A Report into Claims Concerning New Zealand Law and Policy Affecting Māori Culture and Identity* (2011) (the Wai 262 report).

“The Tribunal’s focus has been shifting towards more contemporary issues similar to Wai 262 through the kaupapa inquiry claims.

“I have begun the appointment process to broaden the skill and subject expertise of Tribunal members to meet this emerging shift in focus,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
