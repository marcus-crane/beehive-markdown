Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has announced the appointment of Damian Stone and Terena Wara as Judges of the Māori Land Court, and the reappointment of Judge Patrick Savage as an Acting Judge of the Māori Land Court.

“Damian Stone and Terena Wara are highly capable lawyers and have the necessary skills and expertise to fulfil the role. They have built strong reputations working with whānau through their private practice. Judge Patrick Savage has proven qualities as an experienced Māori Land Court Judge,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Damian Stone was a managing partner at Kāhui Legal and has significant commercial, Māori Land Court and Waitangi Tribunal experience.

Terena Wara was a director at Tū Pono Legal and also has significant experience in both the Māori Land Court and the Waitangi Tribunal.

Judge Patrick Savage has significant experience as a Māori Land Court Judge having served on the bench since 1994.

Minister Mahuta says the appointments will greatly strengthen the bench of the Māori Land Court.

“The Māori Land Court bench will benefit from their skills in the important role it plays for Māori land owners.

“Whenua is a fundamental component of Māori culture, providing a sense of identity and belonging for current and future generations and this is recognised and supported by the Māori Land Court,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
