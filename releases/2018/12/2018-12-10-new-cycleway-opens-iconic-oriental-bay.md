Minister of Transport Phil Twyford and Associate Minister for Transport Julie Anne Genter today opened a new cycleway along Oriental Parade that will improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians.

The new cycleway will form part of the Great Harbour Way. It links to existing shared paths on Wellington’s waterfront and to Evans Bay Parade and Cobham Drive where improved facilities are planned.

The $900,000 project separates cycling from walking with a 2.5 metre wide two-way bike path and a 4.6 metre wide pedestrian-only path between Herd Street and Freyberg Pool. It also includes some additional vehicle and motorbike parking.

“During rush hour, this part of the waterfront is full of people walking, running, cycling and scooting. In this narrower section it makes sense to separate faster moving cyclists from people walking,” said Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter.

“Wellingtonians want the freedom to cycle around their city. Quality, separated cycle paths like this will help more people feel safe and confident getting about by bike.

“More people travelling by foot and by bike means less traffic and congestion on the road, and that benefits everyone,” said Julie Anne Genter.

The NZ Transport Agency is investing $390 million in walking and cycling over the next three years through the National Land Transport Programme (NLTP). This is a $96 million increase on the previous three years.

$260 million of the funding is going to cycling and walking facilities in our three main cities – Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch – where it can have the greatest impact on congestion by making it safer and easier to get around on foot and by bike.
