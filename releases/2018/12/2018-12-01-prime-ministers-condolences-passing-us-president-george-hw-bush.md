Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has expressed her condolences on the passing of the 41st President of the United States of America George H.W. Bush.

“On the behalf of the New Zealand Government, I wish to acknowledge the contribution President Bush made to international affairs over decades of service to the United States of America”, Jacinda Ardern said.

“As an American envoy to Beijing, as CIA Director, as Vice President for eight years and then four years as President, George H.W. Bush’s statesmanship played a key role in helping to end the Cold War, which bought democracy to millions of people in Europe and diminished the threat of nuclear war.

“George H.W. Bush was a strong supporter of the international rules-based system, the rule of law and democratic values.

“Our deepest condolences are extended to the Bush family and the people of the United States of America at this time,” said Jacinda Ardern.
