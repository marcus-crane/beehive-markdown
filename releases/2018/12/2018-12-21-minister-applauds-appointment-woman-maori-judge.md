The Minister of Māori Development, Hon Nanaia Mahuta  has applauded the appointment of the new District Court Judge in Northland.

this will be welcome news to those advocates on the child youth justice space who recognise the experience and insight that Ms King will bring to the District Court bench.

The Attorney General this morning announced that La-Verne King whose iwi include Ngātikahu ki Whangaroa and Ngāti Paoa will have jurisdiction in the Family Court. 

“It’s great that La-Verne King’s  background is in the North where she established Doubtless Bay Law Ltd. 

“The new judge, who was a member of the Independent Panel that considered the 2014 Family Justice Reforms, will be a great asset to her community,” said Nanaia Mahuta .
