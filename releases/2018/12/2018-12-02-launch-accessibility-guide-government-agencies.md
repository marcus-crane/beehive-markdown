Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni has announced a new guide on accessible information on the United Nations’ international day for celebrating disabled people.

“As part of today’s celebrations, I have great pleasure in launching the Accessibility  [guide](https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/newsroom/2018/accessible-public-information.html), *Leading the way in accessible information*,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

The Accessibility Guide gives the state sector guidance on how to increase accessibility to information through the use of inclusive language and design, and alternate formats such as New Zealand Sign Language, Easy Read and Braille.

The guide will be used by Government agencies that have signed up to the Government’s Accessibility Charter, which ensures that communication, services and information provided by state sector agencies is available to everyone.

The Charter was launched in February by the Ministry of Social Development and to date 33 Government agencies have signed up to the charter.

“I want to thank the Government agencies that have signed up already. It is appropriate that Government agencies take the lead in making information and services accessible for all New Zealanders. Your commitment to the charter can be life changing for disabled people,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Accessibility to housing, transport, information, and communications allows disabled people to work, have a home, participate in their communities, get an education, use public transport and be informed.

“As Disability Issues Minister I know there is still more work to be done in this space and I am working with government Ministers and the disability sector to understand ways we can make progress.

“I encourage people to continue to give their feedback on the draft New Zealand Disability Strategy Action Plan 2019-2022. It will provide solutions for a better life for disabled people,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

Workshops on the draft New Zealand Disability Strategy Action Plan 2019-2022 are open to the public and are underway across the country.

Information on venues for workshops are [here](https://www.odi.govt.nz/whats-happening/disability-action-plan-2019-2022-feedback-workshops).

People are also able to submit their ideas by NZSL sign language video, online, text, email, phone, Facebook and Twitter.

- “The New Zealand Disability Strategy 2016–2026 is about how the New Zealand Government gives effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The strategy was developed through extensive consultation with disabled people. The priorities set out in the New Zealand Disability Strategy provide direction for government agencies through the voice and experiences of disabled people. It guides agencies to align policy development and service delivery with the Convention.”
