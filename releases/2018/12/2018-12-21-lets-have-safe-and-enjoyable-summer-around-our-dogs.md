The Minister of Local Government, Hon Nanaia Mahuta says we have to be vigilant around our dogs this summer.

“It’s important that dog owners keep a watchful eye over their dogs, especially around children.

“Every summer we see our friends and family visit, often with young children. Dog owners have to be aware that while they may know the people they are visiting, their dogs don’t,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Last May there were over half a million dogs registered on the National Dogs database and over the last three years the number of dog owners has increased by over 12 per cent.

“People have to be extra careful at the beach and in parks and backyards. For many of us, dogs are part of the whānau but as with people , dogs may not appreciate coming into contact with someone they don’t know. Sometimes it may be best to leave your dog at home alone.

“Dog owners must be aware of their responsibilities under the Dog Control Act and make sure their animal is registered , microchipped and that your local council has your up to date contact details.

“By remaining vigilant around our dogs , we can ensure a safer and more enjoyable summer,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
