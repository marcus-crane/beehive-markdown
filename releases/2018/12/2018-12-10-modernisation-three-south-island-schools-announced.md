Two schools in the Tasman area and a College in Marlborough are in line for major improvements, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Over $30 million will be spent on upgrading Tasman’s Collingwood Area School, Golden Bay High School and Queen Charlotte College in Picton.

“About $12 million will be spent on 10 new classrooms and a refurbishment of 13 other classrooms at Golden Bay High School,” Chris Hipkins said.

West Coast Tasman MP Damien O’Connor visited Golden Bay High School to share the news with staff and students.

“The $9 million project at Collingwood Area School will replace around 10 classrooms, the library, technology, science and administration buildings. The school’s gym will also be completely revamped, so the students can access first class facilities" Chris Hipkins said.

“The two schools are an integral part of the small Tasman community and this investment is hugely important for the people of Golden Bay.

“This Government is also investing $9 million into modernising Queen Charlotte College, with 14 classrooms, a technology block, a library and the administration block being refurbished. These buildings have deteriorated over the years and this is a much-needed investment.

“Regional development is a key plank of Government policy – and that includes investing in our regional infrastructure around the country.

“I’m proud to announce these projects, and to ensure that students all over New Zealand can learn in an environment that inspires and supports them to achieve to the best of their potential,” Chris Hipkins said.
