Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has expressed her condolences to the Government and people of Indonesia for the loss of life and damage following yesterday’s tsunami which hit the Sunda Strait.

“My thoughts are with the loved ones of the victims and everyone affected by this tragedy,” Jacinda Ardern said. 

“On the behalf of the New Zealand Government and people, I express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the people of Indonesia.

“This disaster falls in the wake of the significant earthquakes in Bali and Lombok, and an earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi experienced by Indonesia in the last five months.

“As with those earlier disasters, New Zealand stands ready to assist the Government of Indonesia with relief and recovery efforts if requested,” Jacinda Ardern said.
