Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced two appointments to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) Board.

Former CPIT Board Chair Jenn Bestwick and Vivien Bridgwater, formerly of AUT and Auckland’s regional economic growth agency, ATEED, have each been appointed for three-year terms.

“I am delighted with these appointments. Both new members bring a great deal of governance and leadership experience as well as an understanding of the tertiary education sector, and each will bring new ideas and perspectives to the Board,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Retiring member Susan Paterson has made a valuable contribution to the Board during her term in office, and I would like to thank her for her time and energy,” Chris Hipkins said.

The Tertiary Education Commission leads the Government’s relationship with the tertiary education sector (including universities, institutes of technology and polytechnics, wānanga, private training establishments, industry training organisation and other providers of post-secondary education and training) and provides career services from education through to employment.
