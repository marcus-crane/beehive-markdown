People and businesses in Eastern Bay of Plenty will benefit from the Provincial Growth Fund’s (PGF) investment to improve digital connectivity in the regions, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones announced today.

“I’m pleased to announce the PGF will invest $1.3 million in the Eastern Bay of Plenty to improve digital connectivity. This is additional to the $6 million Government investment already allocated to the area’s RBI2 and MBSF expansion,” Shane Jones said. 

“Last month [Minister Faafoi and I announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/pgf-improve-regional-digital-connectivity) a PGF investment of $40 million to improve digital connectivity in the regions by expanding the Rural Broadband Initiative Phase Two (RBI2) and the Mobile Black Spot Fund (MBSF).

“Today’s announcement is Eastern Bay of Plenty’s share of that funding. 

“This investment will help more people in the region to experience the benefits of faster broadband and improved mobile coverage. For businesses in particular, this will allow them to fully harness the opportunities new technology brings.

“Ōpōtiki will receive approximately $300,000 and Whakatāne will receive approximately $1 million. This raises the total investment in each area to $4.2 million and $3.1 million respectively and will make faster broadband available to approximately 861 new households and businesses.

“When the PGF was established, digital connectivity was identified as a key enabler for economic growth in New Zealand’s regions – which is exactly why we announced a significant investment in this area.

“The people of Eastern Bay of Plenty deserve access to fast broadband and high quality digital services. I’m proud the PGF can play a part in that,” Shane Jones said.
