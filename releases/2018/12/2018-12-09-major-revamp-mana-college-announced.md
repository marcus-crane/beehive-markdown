Over $15 million will be invested to redevelop Mana College in Porirua, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced during a visit to the school this morning. 

“The College will get a new library and administration block as well as several new classrooms.  Plans include replacing the hall roof, demolishing up to 21 classrooms and rebuilding 17 larger flexible spaces,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Mana College has had to make do with tired classrooms and leaky buildings for too long. 

“Substantially more investment is needed, on top of the announcement in mid- 2017 because of the school’s rising roll, and this growth is expected to continue as further housing developments are completed in the area.

“I’m really pleased to be making this announcement today so work can get underway.

“The redevelopment of Mana College is just one part of this Government’s ambitious regeneration project in Porirua.

“It’s also an example of the Government’s commitment to ensuring schools have enough classrooms that are modern and fit-for-purpose to support students to succeed.

“Preliminary work is expected to start in the new year,” Chris Hipkins said.
