Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says Japan’s position in the International Whaling Commission was discussed with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Taro Kono.

“While we seriously welcome the announcement that Japan will cease whaling in the Southern Ocean, we are disappointed it is leaving the Commission with an intention to resume commercial whaling within Japan’s own exclusive economic zone,” Mr Peters said.

“Japan is a valued supporter of the international rules-based system and we had hoped Japan would choose to stay in the Commission.

“Whaling is an outdated and unnecessary practice. We continue to hope Japan eventually reconsiders its position and will cease all whaling in order to advance the protection of the ocean’s ecosystems,” Mr Peters said.
