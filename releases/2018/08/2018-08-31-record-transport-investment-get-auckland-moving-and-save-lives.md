Transport Minister Phil Twyford today announced a record $5.7 billion transport investment over the next three years will get Auckland moving and deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned programme of investment in Auckland’s transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

The NLTP comprises $12.9b from the National Land Transport Fund, generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; $3.4b from local government, generated through rates and Auckland’s Regional Fuel Tax; and $547m in other Crown investments.

                                      

Phil Twyford said the $5.7 billion investment planned for Auckland over the next three years marks a 23 per cent increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 44 per cent increase from 2012/15.

“Auckland is a world-class city, and it needs a world-class transport system that is safe and efficient to keep it moving as it grows. This record investment will help unlock Auckland and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” Phil Twyford said.

“The level of transport investment in Auckland over the next three years will be the largest on record. We are putting a much stronger focus on public transport, and making record investments in road safety, local roads, walking and cycling.

“Safety is a top priority for the Government, and $875m will be spent on programmes and projects in Auckland that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

“We are committed to delivering a rapid transit network for the city so we can unlock critical housing and urban development opportunities, and give people better access to jobs, health, education and recreation. With the $459 million set aside for the development of rapid transit and $266 million for transitional rail, we’re investing in light rail to Mangere, extending the Northern Busway and supporting the introduction of more electric trains,” Phil Twyford said.

“To ease congestion and make Auckland a healthier place to live, $1.9 billion will be invested in public transport, a 56% increase from 2015/18, and $149 million for walking and cycling, a 30% increase from 2015/18. This will create great walking and cycling routes in the city, including the SeaPath walking and cycling connection between Northcote Point and Esmonde Road, the SkyPath project across the Auckland Harbour Bridge, and the Glen Innes to Tamaki Drive shared path.

The significant $1.5 billion investment in state highways in the city reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system. The Northern Corridor project will complete the motorway connection for the Western Ring Route to the north, the Southern Corridor Improvements will result in a safer route between the city centre and the south, and the Transport Agency will continue to build the 18 kilometre extension of the Northern Motorway (SH1) from Pūhoi to Warkworth.
