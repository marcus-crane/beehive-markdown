The Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Jacinda Ardern is encouraging communities to apply for funding to help with hosting local events commemorating the signing of Te Tiriti.

Applications for the Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund open today.

“Waitangi Day is the time we reflect on the bicultural foundations of our nation and the contribution all New Zealand cultures make in our society,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“It is a day for commemoration not only at Waitangi, where the Treaty was first signed, but throughout the country, in recognition that Te Tiriti itself journeyed to other regions following the signing on 6 February 1840.

*“*Waitangi Day events are well established in many centres and enjoyed by thousands of New Zealanders. However, there are some areas where people don’t have the option to participate and I encourage all communities to work together to design and run local events.

 “These commemorations are important to the growth of our national identity as they bring people of all cultures together in a spirit of partnership.

“Together we can reflect on what it means to be a New Zealander and how Te Tiriti o Waitangi underpins this.

“I look forward to hearing about all the stimulating events planned for next year’s Waitangi Day,” Jacinda Ardern said.

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is now accepting applications for the Fund for events taking place in 2019. The Fund is open until 1 October 2018. Past events supported by the fund include kai festivals, marae open days, workshops, and public performances.
