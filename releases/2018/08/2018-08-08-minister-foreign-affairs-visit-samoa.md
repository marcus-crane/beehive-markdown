Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel to Samoa tomorrow to attend the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, and meet with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.

“The Foreign Ministers’ Meeting is an opportunity for Pacific Ministers to consider key regional issues ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting in Nauru in September,” Mr Peters said.

“A priority focus for the meeting will be the development of a new regional security declaration, as agreed at last year’s Pacific Islands Forum. Other key issues include climate change, ocean management and sustainable development.

“The Government is committed to re-setting New Zealand’s approach to the region, including deepening our partnerships with our Pacific neighbours.”

While in Apia, Mr Peters will also hold a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Samoa.

“I also look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Tuilaepa. New Zealand and Samoa share a special relationship, which is underpinned by 56 years of our Treaty of Friendship,” he said.

Mr Peters will be in Samoa from 9 to 11 August.
