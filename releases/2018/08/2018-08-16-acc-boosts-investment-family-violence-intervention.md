ACC will invest a further $1.7m over the next three years to support the expansion of Gandhi Nivas, an early intervention service that provides emergency accommodation and counselling for perpetrators of family violence, says Minister for ACC Iain Lees-Galloway.

"Gandhi Nivas puts families first, providing a safe environment for men to cool down in combination with counselling services it supports them as they work through their issues. Gandhi Nivas also provides services and referrals that help keep women and children safe.

“ACC invested $1.32 million in in the Gandhi Nivas service in December 2016 to enable a full wrap-around service around the perpetrator, victim and family.

“Gandhi Nivas provides counselling to help people examine the consequences of their actions. It challenges people to accept responsibility, and helps them to change their behaviour.

“Gandhi Nivas’ early intervention approach to family violence aligns to ACC’s violence prevention strategy to reduce harm caused by violence at home.

“The service deserves further investment, so I’m pleased ACC is providing further investment to enable expansion of services. This reflects on and rewards the success of the programme so far.

“The funding will support the launch of a second service in Waitemata to provide wrap-around services to help people who commit family violence.

"This early intervention approach places the victim first. Most importantly, it allows the victim to remain in the family home,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.
