Health Minister Dr David Clark has confirmed the final details of the wide-ranging review of New Zealand’s health and disability system as it begins its work in earnest.

The review, to be led by Heather Simpson, was announced in May. Final Terms of Reference and the full membership of the review panel have now been signed-off by Cabinet.

“New Zealand has a public health service that we can all be proud of. We are have world-class clinicians and allied health workers and they deliver quality services – but we can always do better.

“Like many countries we face some big, long-term challenges such as a growing and aging population and an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer.

“As Health Minister I am also committed to addressing the fact that our health system does not deliver equally well for all. We cannot just accept worse health outcomes for Māori and Pacific peoples.

“This review is a once in a generation opportunity to improve equity and outcomes for New Zealanders. It will chart a course for a fairer, more sustainable health and disability system.

“The Terms of Reference have been refined following expert feedback but they remain deliberately wide and now allow for a more thorough assessment of the disability sector.

Joining Ms Simpson on the expert review panel are Shelly Campbell, Professor Peter Crampton, Dr Lloyd McCann, Dr Margaret Southwick, Dr Winfield Bennett and Sir Brian Roche.

“The health sector will know these names well. There’s no way every interest can be represented on a panel of seven, but health leaders will recognise the reputation, competence and capability of this group.

“I have no doubt they will deliver robust and far-reaching recommendations. I expect and look forward to nothing less,” says David Clark.

**NOTE:** Final Terms of Reference are attached. The date for the final report is now no later than 31 March 2020.
