Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced a record $665 million investment for the Bay of Plenty today will deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system over the next three years.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned investment in the Bay of Plenty’s transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

Phil Twyford said the $665 million investment planned for Bay of Plenty over the next three years marks a 6% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 14% per cent increase from 2012/15.

The $665 million investment in Bay of Plenty through the 2018/21 NLTP includes $510 million from the National Land Transport Fund generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; with $137 million from local government and $17 million in direct Crown funding.

“This record investment in our transport system will help grow our regions, make it easier to get around our cities, and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” said Phil Twyford.

“Safety is a top priority for this government.  The increasing number of people dying on Bay of Plenty roads is unacceptable.

Over the next three years, we will invest $235m in safety across all activity classes, including improvements to save lives. This includes safety upgrades on SH2 between Waihi and Tauranga to reduce the risk of head-on and run-off crashes, as well as safety improvements on SH33 from Paengaroa to Te Ngae Road. $65 million has been allocated to the SH2 Waihi to Ōmokoroa Safer Corridor project in the NLTP 2018-2021, as part of an $87 million, five-year project of safety improvements on this route.

“State highways continue to receive the largest share of funding. We will invest $155 million for state highway improvements and $154 million for state highway maintenance.

“Investment through the NLTP will contribute to a land transport system for the Bay of Plenty that will be safer and easier for people to use, recognising the popularity of the region as a place where people want to live and work, the growth of tourism, the pressure on land usage, and the need to provide more safe travel options,” said Phil Twyford.
