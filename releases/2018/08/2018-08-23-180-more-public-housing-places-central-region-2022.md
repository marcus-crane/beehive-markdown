Up to 180 more families in Central Region will have warm, dry, and secure new homes built over the next four years, as a result of the Government’s comprehensive Public Housing Plan released today by Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford.

“The Government’s fully funded Public Housing Plan will build 6,400 new homes for families in need.” Phil Twyford said.

“The national housing crisis has hurt too many New Zealanders; from those locked out of the Kiwi dream of home ownership, to those left homeless and those suffering the health effects of poor quality housing.

“The single most important thing the Government can do to solve the housing crisis is to build more affordable homes, and the best way to tackle homelessness is to build more public housing.

“We’re making a great start in Central Region with concrete plans for 75 more public housing places.”

On top of this, the Ministry of Social Development will be partnering with Community Housing Providers, developers, Housing New Zealand, councils and others to build around 105 additional homes.

In Central Region, there are currently 2,312 public housing places, giving families and individuals warm, dry, and safe homes, for as long as they need it. 

“Public housing is an essential part of helping families and vulnerable people with one of their most basic needs, housing.

“It will take bold action to fix the housing crisis created over the past decade and the Public Housing Plan is another step in the right direction. Demand for housing changes all the time, and we’ll constantly monitor what’s needed and will continue to invest in places where New Zealanders need public housing the most.”
