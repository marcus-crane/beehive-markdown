Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel to Australia tomorrow to meet with Australian counterparts in Canberra.

“Our relationship with Australia is hugely important. For two independent nations, Australia and New Zealand enjoy an unparalleled level of connection and integration,” says Mr Peters.

Mr Peters will meet with Deputy Prime Minister Hon Michael McCormack, and with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop for their six-monthly Foreign Ministers’ Consultation.

“Ms Bishop and I see each other frequently at regional meetings so we have a good working relationship. These six-monthly consultations provide a formal opportunity for us to discuss the Australia-New Zealand relationship in-depth, as well as the many global and regional interests we share as partners,

“However we mustn’t take this for granted. During our meeting we will be focused on how we can keep working to strengthen and build on the bilateral relationship,

“In turbulent times such as these, our close friends like Australia are more important than ever,” Mr Peters says.

While in Canberra, Mr Peters will also make a keynote speech to the National Press Club.

Mr Peters will be in Australia 21-23 August.
