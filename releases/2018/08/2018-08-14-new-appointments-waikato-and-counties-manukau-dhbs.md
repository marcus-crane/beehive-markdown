Health Minister Dr David Clark has announced new appointments to the Waikato and Counties Manukau District Health Boards.

Current chair of Bay of Plenty DHB Sally Webb has been appointed chair of Waikato DHB, while former Speaker of the House and law professor Margaret Wilson will bring valuable legal insight to her role as deputy chair.

“No one should underestimate the task of governance in our public health service. DHB members play a vital role overseeing the delivery of health services to New Zealanders.

“Both Ms Webb and Professor Wilson will contribute strong leadership and governance to Waikato. I thank them for agreeing to take on these important roles,” David Clark says.

The Health Minister has also appointed a Crown Monitor to work with the Waikato DHB. Ken Whelan is a former Chief Executive of both Northland and Capital & Coast DHBs. He is also Crown Monitor at Counties Manukau DHB. 

“Mr Whelan will provide the board with the extra support it needs in its work to improve governance and leadership at the DHB.”

Two new board members have also been appointed to fill vacancies at Counties Manukau DHB. Both appointees are already serving on DHBs in the wider Auckland region.

“Auckland DHB chair Pat Snedden and Waitemata DHB member Kylie Clegg are joining the board of Counties Manukau. They bring considerable experience and expertise with them – and their positions on other DHBs will further strengthen the relationship between the Auckland boards, and support ongoing co-ordination of services,” Dr Clark says.

All the appointments are effective immediately and will expire on 4 December 2019.
