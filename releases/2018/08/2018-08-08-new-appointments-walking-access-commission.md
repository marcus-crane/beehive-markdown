Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri has announced five new members to the Board of the New Zealand Walking Access Commission, tasked with enhancing walking access opportunities across New Zealand.

“I’m pleased to announce new Board members Pierre Henare, Helen Mexted, Hilary Allison, Raewyn Tipene and Lisa Chase,” says Meka Whaitiri.

“These New Zealanders bring a wealth of skills, experience and knowledge to the Board, including strategy, community initiatives, leadership and tikanga Māori.

“I am proud that these appointments further support the growth of females in leadership positions within Aotearoa.

“Their skills will help the Commission provide leadership on walking access issues and administer a national strategy on walking access, including walkways. Collectively, they will also undertake a range of activities, including mapping walking access throughout New Zealand, providing information to the public and negotiating new access areas.

“The fresh perspectives of the new appointments will add to those of Board Chair John Forbes, Robin McNeil and Peter Brown. Collectively they will ensure the Board can continue to provide effective governance and direction for the Commission.

“I’d like to acknowledge and thank outgoing Board members Penny Mudford and Barbara Stuart for their valuable contribution to the Board and the Commission.

“I’m excited to work with these dynamic new appointments and hear the insights they will provide, as we look to further encourage New Zealanders to get outdoors, get healthy and see more of Aotearoa’s beauty through walking,” Meka Whaitiri said.
