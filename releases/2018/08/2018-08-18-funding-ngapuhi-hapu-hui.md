Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little has announced funding support for Ngāpuhi hapū to consider their Treaty settlement progress.

“The funding is to enable hapū to hold hui to consider the evolved mandate negotiation structure and provide feedback to my office,” says Andrew Little.  

“Eight public hui have been successfully held in Te Tai Tokerau and Tamaki Makaurau where it was made clear to me that some hapū want more engagement with their Principal leaders.

“Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority and Te Kōtahitanga o Ngā Hapū Ngāpuhi will engage with a team of technical advisors and officials to work through the proposals for an evolved mandate and settlement negotiations structure,” says Andrew Little.
