The Crown has signed the Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed with iwi of Hauraki at a ceremony held today at Parliament, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little, has announced today.

“The Deed provides shared collective redress for the Iwi of Hauraki, reflecting their overlapping and collective interests, and will pave the way for the conclusion of Treaty settlements in the Coromandel and Hauraki region,” says Andrew Little.

“The Iwi of Hauraki have a combined recorded population of around 16,000. Their combined area of interest is from Mahurangi in the north to the Western Bay of Plenty in the south, and includes the islands of the Hauraki Gulf/Tīkapa Moana.

“The Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed signed today provides redress for the losses suffered by the Iwi of Hauraki arising from the Crown’s breaches of its Treaty obligations. The deed recognises the connections between the Iwi of Hauraki and their traditional lands, waters and other tāonga.

“The cultural redress recognises significant sites and features of importance to Hauraki iwi and is informed by the Pare Hauraki world view. It includes the vesting of two maunga, Moehau and Te Aroha, and the ability of the Iwi of Hauraki to be involved in the governance and management of waterways such as the Waihou and Piako rivers.

“Signing of the Collective Redress Deed with the Iwi of Hauraki will be a major milestone on the Crown’s journey towards reconciliation with our past,” says Andrew Little.
