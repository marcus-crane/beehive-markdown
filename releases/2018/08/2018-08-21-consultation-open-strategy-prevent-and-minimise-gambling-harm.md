Associate Health Minister Jenny Salesa encourages you to have your say on a refreshed strategy to prevent and minimise gambling harm.

Every three years the Ministry of Health undertakes a refresh of the strategy and public consultation on its proposals is now open.  

"Gambling harm is a significant issue with up to one in five New Zealand adults affected at some time in their lives, either by their own gambling or the gambling of others,” says Jenny Salesa.

“Estimates suggest 37,000 people aged 15 years or older are at high risk of harm from gambling or are ‘problem gamblers’.

“Gambling and its effects can impact on anyone at any time, and that’s why it’s crucial we get feedback from as many people as possible to this draft strategy.”

The Gambling Act (2003) specifies the strategy must include measures to promote public health; services to treat and assist problem gamblers and their whanau; and independent scientific research associated with gambling, for example research on the social and economic impacts of gambling, particularly the impacts of gambling on different cultural groups.

It also includes proposals for a problem gambling levy set at a different rate for each of the four main gambling sectors.

“We’ve made it easy to have your voice heard – with 10 public and industry meetings over the next fortnight,” says Jenny Salesa.

“The meetings are taking place in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. For a list, visit the consultation page on the Ministry of Health website [here](https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/strategy-prevent-and-minimise-gambling-harm-2019-20-2021-22-consultation-document).

“Everyone’s invited and the meetings will provide people with an opportunity to hear about the draft strategy, ask questions and have their say.

“It’s important feedback comes from the widest cross-section of society as possible, particularly communities most affected by gambling harm. That’s why we are also hosting meetings to get feedback from the Maori, Pacific and Asian populations.

“If you’re unable to attend one of these meeting, it’s just as easy to provide feedback, by either completing the Ministry of Health’s [online submissions form](https://consult.health.govt.nz/gambling/strategy-to-prevent-and-minimise-gambling-harm/) or emailing a submission to [gamblingharm@moh.govt.nz]()

“So please make your views known and contribute to shaping the future direction of the strategy to prevent and minimise gambling harm,” says Jenny Salesa.
