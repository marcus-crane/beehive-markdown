Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a $1.6 billion transport investment over the next three years to deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system to keep Waikato moving and save lives.

The planned investments are detailed in the 2018-21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), published today by the NZ Transport Agency.

The NLTP comprises $12.9b from the National Land Transport Fund, generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; $3.4b from local government, generated through rates and Auckland’s Regional Fuel Tax; and $547m in other Crown investments. The $1.6 billion investment in Waikato through the 2018/21 NLTP includes $1.27 billion from the NLTF, with $270 million from local government and $59 million in direct Crown funding.

“This record investment in our transport system will help grow our regions, make it easier to get around our cities, and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” said Phil Twyford.

“Safety is a top priority for the Government. $487m will be spent through programmes and projects in Waikato that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

Along with the completion of the Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway, further investments of $109 million will be made in the Mt Messenger bypass on SH3.

“Investment in local road improvements more than doubles to $164 million to keep up with the strong growth in the region and to improve safety. This will include projects like improving the Wairere/Cobham interchange on the Hamilton Ring Road, revamping intersections to stop collisions and installing median barriers in high-risk areas. Combined with the $386 million for local road maintenance, this record investment in our local roads will help make our local communities safer and better connected.

“State highways continue to receive the largest share of funding, with $883 million being invested in improvements and maintenance over the next three years.  This includes $235 million which will be invested in the completion of the Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway, significantly improving road safety in the region.

“To help prevent congestion and make Hamilton and our towns healthier places to live, $75 million will be invested in public transport, a 39% increase from 2015/18. This includes funding to explore an interregional rail commuter service between Hamilton and Auckland to provide a viable alternative for commuters. There is also $20m for walking and cycling, a 9% increase from 2015/18, which will include the first section of the SH1 Hamilton to Cambridge Cycle Connection,” Phil Twyford said.
