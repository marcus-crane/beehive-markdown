Provincial communities across all regions will benefit from the rollout of 1800 extra Police with decisions today on the allocation of officers throughout the country.

The Commissioner of Police has announced increased officer numbers of between 13 and 27 per cent across twelve policing districts, based on factors like population growth, offending patterns and local priorities for crime prevention.

“The Coalition Agreement’s commitment to strive for 1800 extra frontline officers over three years represents the single biggest investment in Policing in our history,” says Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters.

“It represents an increase in Police constabulary numbers of around 20 per cent, with a further 485 civilian staff providing back office support,” Mr Peters says.

“We all know that our largest population centres in the big cities have high needs for community safety and crime prevention. But I am particularly gratified that the smaller regions and provinces have been allocated significantly increased Police resources under the Commissioner’s plan.”

“Some of our most neglected provincial areas are finally getting the attention and support they deserve.

“In Northland, a massive 25 per cent increase in Police numbers will make a huge difference to combat the methamphetamine scourge and improve safety in our communities. Provincial towns throughout Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki Whanganui and Manawatu gain between 17 and 27 percent more officers. And 264 new officers will be stationed in rural and urban towns throughout the South Island.

“This investment in frontline policing is an investment in our provinces, our communities and our neighbourhoods,” says Mr Peters.

Police Minister Stuart Nash says the allocation plan announced today finally allows Police to make real inroads into crime prevention in order to reduce victimisation, lower reoffending and bring down imprisonment rates.

“To make a real difference we need to focus on crime prevention and community safety. Our first budget set aside $300 million in new operating funding and $18 million in new capital spending for Police. I will be seeking further funding in Budget2019.

“Our neighbourhoods want a greater uniformed presence to prevent and respond to burglaries and aggravated robberies, family harm and child protection, road policing and civil emergencies.

“Our communities want to know Police have the tools they need to fight the threat from organised crime. Police need resources to investigate and disrupt transnational drug smuggling, child sex exploitation, cyber-crime and money laundering. That is what we will deliver.

“It is particularly important to see a renewed focus on gangs and disruption of organised crime. This was identified as a priority area in the Coalition Agreement, and this will truly make a difference to our communities.

“Organised crime, and the supply of methamphetamine and other illicit products that fund it, are responsible for so much harm in society. Extra officers at both district and national level represents an unprecedented effort into this area for Police.

“We are building a stronger Police service and giving them the support they need to prevent offending, enforce the law and keep communities safe,” Mr Nash says.
