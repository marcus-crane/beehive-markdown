Greg Miller has been appointed to chair the KiwiRail board, Minister for State Owned Enterprises Winston Peters and Minister of Finance Grant Robertson announced today.

Mr Miller replaces Trevor Janes, who resigned effective 30 June 2018. Acting Chair Brian Corban will continue in the role until Mr Miller takes up his position on the board. Mr Corban will resume the Deputy Chair role when Mr Miller joins the board.

Mr Miller is currently the Managing Director/Chief Executive of Toll New Zealand, a position he has held since 2008. He began his career as a cadet in transport operations at Mainfreight Group, rising through the ranks to become a key Group Senior Executive. He has since held roles at Tranz Rail and Tranz Link International as Managing Director across New Zealand, Australia and Asia and was Toll Tranzlink Director and Group General Manager from 2003-2008, where he chaired the Toll Tranzlink NZ Fonterra Strategy Committee.

“The Coalition Government has made rail a priority in our plan to boost the productivity of our regions after years of central government neglect for this crucial part of our economic apparatus,” Winston Peters said.

“Greg Miller’s leadership in the transport industry in New Zealand, in rail, road and sea transport, gives him a strong base for chairing KiwiRail and to help it meet the high expectations that the Coalition Government has for rail in New Zealand,” Winston Peters said.

“The 2018 Government Policy Statement on Land Transport highlighted how critical rail is for improving transport connections to the rest of the world for our exporters. KiwiRail is an important partner in this, and we look forward as shareholding Ministers to engaging with Mr Miller as we roll out our plans,” Grant Robertson said.

The appointment means Mr Miller will also join and chair the New Zealand Railways Corporation NZRC board.

“I look forward to working with the KiwiRail team, from the railway workers at the coal face to the new chief executive of KiwiRail, to keep building this company and delivering a rail operation that performs for our customers in all cities and regions, with a competitive commercial strategy,” Greg Miller said.

“I’m particularly keen to prioritise KiwiRail’s high-performance, high-engagement model where workers and executives collaborate to harness opportunities and improve productivity for the benefit of the whole company,” Greg Miller said.

Mr Miller has been appointed for a term of three years.
