Transport Minister announced today a record $302 million transport investment for Taranaki that will deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned investment in Taranaki’s transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

The NLTP comprises $12.9b from the National Land Transport Fund, generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; $3.4b from local government, generated through rates and Auckland’s Regional Fuel Tax; and $547m in other Crown investments.

Phil Twyford said the $302 million investment planned for Taranaki over the next three years marks a 26% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 50% per cent increase from 2012/15.

“Safety is a top priority for the Government. $64 million will be invested in programmes and projects in Taranaki that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

“The significant $171 million investment in state highways reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system. We’re supporting significant improvements to SH3, including progressing the Mt Messenger Bypass to improve the safety, resilience and reliability of this key transport route.

“To help keep the region moving, $11 million is being invested in public transport and walking and cycling projects, including funding for cycleways in New Plymouth, as well as $117 million for local roads,” said Phil Twyford.   

Investment through the NLTP will contribute to a land transport system for Taranaki that will be safer and easier for people to use, supporting the safe movement of freight and keeping communities connected.
