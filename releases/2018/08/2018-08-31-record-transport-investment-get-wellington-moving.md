Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a record $1.9 billion investment in Wellington will deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system over the next three years.

The planned investments are detailed in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), published today by the NZ Transport Agency. The planned $1.9 billion investment planned for Wellington is part of the Government’s record $16.9 billion investment in transport across New Zealand. The investment in Wellington is a 25% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 41% per cent increase from 2012/15.

“This record investment in our transport system will help grow our regions, make it easier to get around our cities, and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” said Phil Twyford.

“Safety is a top priority for the Government. $425 million will be invested in programmes and projects in Wellington that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

“Wellington is a fantastic capital city, and it needs a fantastic transport system that is safe and efficient if the city is to continue to thrive as it grows.

“To ease congestion and make our cities healthier places to live, $614 million will be invested in public transport, a 44% increase from 2015/18, and $83m for walking and cycling, a 248% increase from 2015/18. This includes funding for the Eastern Bays cycleway and the development of the Wellington to Hutt Valley Walking and Cycling Link.”

Phil Twyford said Wellington city’s compact position in an active earthquake zone makes improving resilience a critical part of the NLTP investment programme.

“Geographic constraints mean any disruption to the transport system will have significant social and economic impacts for the nation’s capital and for the wider region and beyond. We’re improving the safety and reliability of all travel options over the next three years to help keep communities connected, and keep corridors open for people and freight. We’re investing $109 million in transitional rail to help improve efficiency and reliability for commuters and freight.

“State highways continue to receive the largest share of funding, with a total of $759 million invested in state highway improvements and maintenance, which reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system.” Phil Twyford said.
