Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced Te Wharekura o Ngati Rongomai is to receive $10 million to build them new property.

 

Chris Hipkins made the announcement during a visit to Rotorua, where he was accompanied by local MP Tamati Coffey.

 

The wharekura has been a satellite of Te Wharekura o Te Kaokaoroa o Pātetere for a number of years. The $10 million investment will mean it will now have its own permanent property for the first time and become an established wharekura in its own right.

 

“This has been a long time coming and I’m delighted the Government can give the community the certainty to establish as a standalone wharekura” Chris Hipkins said.

 

“Having a purpose-built facility means the wharekura can continue to build its identity as it grows its roll.

 

“Once complete, this wharekura will have some of the best quality learning spaces for their students”

 

“Achievement for Māori is a key priority for the government,” Chris Hipkins said.

 

“Wharekura is well-positioned to stand alone as an immersion Kura that provides education which is strongly endorsed by iwi and hāpu.

 

“I know the Whānau and staff are committed to providing good quality care and education for their students. Planning is expected to start shortly.

 

“This is the latest announcement from a government that is investing hundreds of millions of dollars on upgrading and building new school infrastructure so that students have the space to learn in a warm and comfortable environment.”
