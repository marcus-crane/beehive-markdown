The Government will make $8.5 million available for immediate actions recommended by the Responsible Camping Working Group, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

Kelvin Davis established the working group earlier this year to improve the freedom camping system in New Zealand. The group recently provided the Minister with their report, which assessed the place of camping in New Zealand’s tourism offering and recommended options for better management.

“I want to thank the working group for looking at these challenging issues. They’ve come back with great ideas for both short and long-term actions that will improve how we manage freedom camping in New Zealand,” Kelvin Davis said.

“The Government has set aside $8.5 million for a package of initiatives that will support responsible camping, so that campers and locals alike can enjoy their summer.

“Kiwis and visitors have a long tradition of enjoying camping in New Zealand.

“The next peak season is fast approaching and I want people to be able to camp responsibly while ensuring the facilities are in place to support our communities.

“Not all the solutions recommended by the working group can be in place by this summer.

“I will be considering their longer-term recommendations, which look largely at legislative and regulatory changes.

“As these touch on different portfolios, I will work with my Cabinet colleagues to bring together a cross-government plan of action,” Kelvin Davis said.
