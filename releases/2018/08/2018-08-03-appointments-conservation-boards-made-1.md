More than half the new appointments to Conservation Boards announced by Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage today are women.

Eugenie Sage announced 57 appointments to the 15 Conservation Boards across New Zealand.

“Conservation Boards are the link between DOC and the community. They help ensure their region’s voice is heard on conservation issues,” Eugenie Sage said.

“These appointments bring the number of women on the boards to 52 per cent and 41 per cent identify as Maori.

“I am thrilled to see such diversity coming across in the boards and congratulate each of the 57 people who are stepping up to represent their communities, 34 of whom are serving for the first time.

“I would also like to thank the outgoing representatives for their contribution to conservation in their region.”

The Department of Conservation re-opened the nomination process in March seeking a broader cross-section of members from the different communities each board represents on the Minister’s recommendation. A third of Conservation Board positions were open for renewal this year.

“The diverse range of appointees will bring a wide array of knowledge and skills to conservation management in the communities they represent.

“We want to encourage all New Zealanders to get out and enjoy our magnificent country. This year, boards will have a greater focus on promoting recreation opportunities and tourism on conservation land, and enhancing relationships with iwi and hapū.”

There were 280 applications for Conservation Board positions.

“This level of community interest in conservation management is outstanding and I want to thank applicants for their ongoing commitment to conservation in their communities,” Eugenie Sage says.

Conservation Board appointments took effect from 1 July. More information about Conservation Boards can be found at: [www.conservationboards.org.nz](http://www.conservationboards.org.nz/)
