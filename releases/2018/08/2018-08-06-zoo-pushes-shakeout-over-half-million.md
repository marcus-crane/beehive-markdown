With just over two months to go until the ShakeOut national earthquake drill and tsunami hikoi, already half a million participants have signed up.

Minister of Civil Defence Kris Faafoi today visited Wellington Zoo to congratulate them on being the 500,000th signup. He was joined by staff from the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and Wellington Regional Emergency Management Office.

“Wellington Zoo has over 250,000 people through its door each year so it’s great to see the amazing preparedness plans they have in place to accommodate their guests, staff and animals. It’s my hope that all community organisations, workplaces and households use ShakeOut as a reminder to check their preparedness plans and emergency supplies.”

This year the Ministry for Civil Defence & Emergency management has added a tsunami hikoi because for people living near the coast the most important thing to do may actually be to start the walk to a safe location.

“All of New Zealand is at risk of earthquakes and our coastlines of tsunami. This is why it so important that we practice the right actions to take, and ShakeOut teaches us that. We can’t predict when one will happen or where we will be, but we can take steps to protect ourselves and our families.”

 Mr Faafoi says he hopes that many more will get involved in ShakeOut, because knowing the correct action to take in an earthquake and what do in a tsunami could save your life.

The New Zealand ShakeOut 2018 drill and tsunami hikoi, is taking place on Thursday 18 October 2018 at 9.30am.

**Remember**:

**Drop, Cover and Hold is the right action to take in an earthquake.**

It stops you being knocked over, makes you a smaller target for falling and flying objects and protects your head, neck and vital organs.

**Long or Strong, Get Gone.** If you are at the coast and experience any of the following:

- Feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up, or a weak rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more,
- See a sudden rise or fall in sea level,
- Hear loud and unusual noises from the sea,

Move immediately to the nearest high ground, or as far inland as you can.

Local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups provide tsunami zone maps and regional advice. Make sure you know where to go, whether you are at home, at work or out and about.
