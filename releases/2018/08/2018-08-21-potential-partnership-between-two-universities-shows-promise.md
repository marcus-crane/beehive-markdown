The prospect of a partnership or merger between Lincoln University and Canterbury University was welcomed by Education Minister Chris Hipkins today.

He said he was looking for it to demonstrate how it would significantly enhance Lincoln’s unique contribution to the land-based sectors of the New Zealand economy.

“We need to encourage more people to study and work in the land-based sectors to meet industry demand, increase productivity and tackle technological and environmental challenges,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Canterbury and Lincoln’s proposal to explore a merger or partnership might help to achieve that by enhancing Lincoln’s capacity to deliver world-leading teaching and research.

“It is critical that New Zealand has strong and stable, multi-disciplinary, university-based teaching and research that best supports the land based sector, and this process will help determine whether a partnership or a merger with Canterbury would achieve this at Lincoln.”

Both parties are expected to submit their formal proposal by the end of 2018.

Government commitment of up to $85 million of Crown capital funding to help Lincoln fund its share of a joint education and research facility with AgResearch is not affected by this process, Chris Hipkins said.

The Government is committed to Lincoln remaining at its present site and retaining its brand and identity.
