Hornby High School students are benefiting from the recent completion of stage one of their $26 million redevelopment, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Mr Hipkins visited the school for the official opening of their new north and south blocks.

"Today's event was a wonderful opportunity to celebrate with the school and to recognise the work of all those that have been involved throughout the redevelopment to date.

"When the project is completed next year 90 per cent of the school’s existing school buildings will have been demolished and replaced with 45 new classrooms and modern facilities.

The gymnasium, administration and technology block are the first of the new blocks to be operational.

"Students and staff have been enjoying their fantastic new facilities since the start of this term and it was great to see how everyone has settled in.

Stage two will include the new west block and is due for completion in mid-2019.

Mr Hipkins will also be joining staff and students at Oaklands School later today to turn the first sod as part of their redevelopment project.

“The redevelopment will include the construction of three new buildings, which include teaching and admin areas. Eleven existing buildings are being demolished, and six buildings, as well as the school hall, are being refurbished,” Chris Hipkins said.

Work on the redevelopment is expected to begin in the next few weeks, and the construction will be staged to ensure minimal disruption to the students.
