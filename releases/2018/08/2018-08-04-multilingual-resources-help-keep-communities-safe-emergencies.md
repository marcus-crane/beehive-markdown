Minister of Civil Defence Hon Kris Faafoi says a Wellington initiative to translate emergency information into 15 languages will help keep diverse communities safe.

“This Government believes that everybody has the right to be safe and informed in emergencies so ensuring emergency information is available to everyone is crucial.

“This is the kind of initiative I would like to see more of, and I’m looking with the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management to build on this momentum and further support the resilience of diverse communities.”

Mr Faafoi today joined the Wellington Regional Emergency Management Office (WREMO), Red Cross, the INTERACT research team, and translation, migrant and refugee services, for the launch of translated earthquake planning guides.

The award-winning guides provide advice and tips to ensure Wellington residents are prepared for an earthquake. The translated guides were developed by WREMO with the support of Red Cross, the INTERACT research team, volunteer translators and migrant and refugee services

Mr Faafoi says making the guides available is the culmination of a superb collaborative effort.

“Our diversity is our strength, and these translated guides will make us even stronger by helping to keep Wellington’s diverse communities safe and resilient.

“Partnering with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to include them in readiness preparations, harnessing their strengths, and developing relationships and arrangements, are all critical for an effective response to an emergency.”

Mr Faafoi says that the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management is developing a national public education strategy aimed at culturally and linguistically diverse communities, due to be launched early next year.

The Ministry is also providing funding support for a project led by Christchurch City Council and Plains FM 96.9 to develop foreign language messaging for radio in emergencies.
