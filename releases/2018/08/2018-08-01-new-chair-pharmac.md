Health Minister Dr David Clark has announced that former Vice-Chancellor of Massey University and senior Cabinet minister Steve Maharey has been appointed as chair of Pharmac.

Mr Maharey takes over as chair from today from Stuart McLauchlan whose term as chair expired yesterday. His appointment is for a three year term and was confirmed by Cabinet on Monday.

“Steve Maharey is a hugely experienced leader with strong governance skills. He is fiercely intelligent and compassionate – and I am delighted he has agreed to take on this important role,” says David Clark.

Mr Maharey is a former university academic and Senior Cabinet Minister holding many portfolios including Social Development and Education. 

After leaving Parliament he was Vice-Chancellor of Massey University between 2008 and 2016. He is currently an independent director and consultant. 

“Pharmac plays a vital role in our public health service and is the reason New Zealanders pay some of the lowest prices in the world for pharmaceuticals. I know Steve Maharey will ensure it continues to go from strength to strength.

“I also want today to thank Stuart McLauchlan for his long record of service. Stuart was first appointed as Pharmac chair in 2010 and has provided strong leadership throughout that time.

“However, after eight years with the same chair it is timely to refresh the leadership of the Board for the years to come,” says David Clark.
