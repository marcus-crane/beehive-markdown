Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the formation of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council, with Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon as its chair, in a major speech delivered to the business community in Auckland today.

The role of the Council will be to build closer relationships between Government and business, provide high-level free and frank advice to the Prime Minister on key economic issues and to create a vehicle to harness expertise from the private sector to inform the development of the Government’s economic policies.

Mr Luxon and the Prime Minister will determine the full makeup of the Council and its initial work programme in the coming weeks. 

“The Council will provide a forum for business leaders to advise me and the Government and to join us in taking the lead on some of the important areas of reform the Government is undertaking,” said Jacinda Ardern. 

“The Council will report to me on opportunities it sees and identify emerging challenges. It will bring new ideas to the table on how we can scale up New Zealand businesses and grow our export led wealth.

“I want to work closely with, and be advised by, senior business leaders who take a helicopter view of our economy, who are long term strategic thinkers who have the time and energy to lead key aspects of our economic agenda.

“The Council will complement the work the Government is already doing with the Small Business Council and business and union representative groups through the Tripartite Forum. Their work will focus on macro level economic strategy and active leadership on our economic agenda to build a more productive, inclusive and sustainable economy.”

Business Advisory Council Chair Christopher Luxon said he is looking forward to the challenge.

“I’m excited to chair this important initiative because I think building a better, more sustainable New Zealand is a cause well worth putting all our collective efforts and energy behind – business leaders working together with government.

“I believe all New Zealanders, regardless of our backgrounds, are united in wanting to see a more prosperous economy, a more cohesive society, and an enhanced environment. At the end of the day we will all get the country we deserve.” Christopher Luxon said.
