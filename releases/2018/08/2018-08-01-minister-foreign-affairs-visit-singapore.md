Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel to Singapore overnight to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit Ministerial Meetings.

“The Asia-Pacific region is of great importance to New Zealand,” says Mr Peters.

“ASEAN is one of New Zealand’s most important trading relationships, and as close neighbours the member states are key partners in the region’s security and stability,” said Mr Peters.

“The region faces some serious challenges to its security and prosperity, including in the areas of nuclear proliferation, terrorism and cyber security. These meetings are a chance to discuss how we address these challenges collectively.

“I will be stressing the importance of the rules-based international order in enhancing peace and prosperity.”

While in Singapore Mr Peters will have a number of formal bilateral meetings and informal interactions with foreign minister counterparts from the ASEAN and EAS countries, as well as countries attending as guests of the Singaporean government.

Mr Peters will be travelling from 1-5 August.
