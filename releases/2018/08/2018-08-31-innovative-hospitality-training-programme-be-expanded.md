An innovative Rotorua-based training programme finding work in the hospitality sector for local people from disadvantaged backgrounds is to be expanded to Christchurch.

Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni today welcomed the latest graduation of the AccorHotels Fast Track Partnership Programme in Rotorua.

The Fast Track Partnership Programme is a joint initiative between AccorHotels, Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA) and Ministry of Social Development (MSD).

The five-week programme offers unemployed people hospitality industry training and employment opportunities.

Accor Hotels and MSD started working together to help unemployed people in 2009. They joined with TIA to establish the Fast Track Partnership Programme in 2017.

“This programme is a winner and a good example of MSD working with business to create more job opportunities for New Zealanders. The results speak for themselves,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Thirty unemployed people took part in the first training programme, 90% got employment contracts as a result.

“Today we have a further 27 graduates, 24 of whom start work next week.

“I want to congratulate today’s graduates and acknowledge their courage and determination.

“I also want to acknowledge AccorHotels, MSD and TIA for their vision, their contribution to this community and their generosity in working with their competitors to help people in Rotorua.

“Following the success in Rotorua the Programme will be expanded to Christchurch, with the first programme starting in September. 

“This is the perfect time to expand the programme to Christchurch. It’s a city getting back on its feet and expanding its hospitality industry to meet growing demand from people wanting to visit from all over the world,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
