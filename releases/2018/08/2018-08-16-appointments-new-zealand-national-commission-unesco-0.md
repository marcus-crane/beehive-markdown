Associate Education Minister Jenny Salesa is pleased to announce appointments to the New Zealand National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (the National Commission).

Professor Tagaloatele Peggy Fairbairn-Dunlop has been appointed as the Commissioner - Social Sciences for a three year term, replacing Materoa Dodd. She has considerable expertise and mana within the social sciences field, including experience on UNESCO’s Social Sciences Sub-Commission and other agencies of the United Nations. She is Auckland University of Technology’s inaugural Professor of Pacific Studies.

Dr Carol Mutch has been appointed as the Commissioner – Education for a three year term, replacing Dr Cheryl Stephens. The appointment of Dr Mutch brings a strong education research perspective that is closely aligned to UNESCO’s work in nations experiencing rapid change, conflict and trauma. Dr Mutch is an Associate Professor in Critical Studies in Education at the University of Auckland.

“The two new appointees have great standing in their fields and will draw on their own research and broad knowledge to contribute to the work of the Commission’” said Jenny Salesa.

Dr Arapata Hakiwai has been reappointed as the Commissioner – Culture. Dr Hakiwai’s appointment provides a wealth of knowledge and experience relating to the cultural areas of the National Commission’s mandate.

“Dr Hakiwai has been an outstanding Commissioner who brings substantial knowledge of the cultural sector, both within New Zealand and internationally.”

Jenny Salesa thanked Materoa Dodd and Dr Cheryl Stephens for their services to the National Commission.

“The Commission has benefited significantly from Ms Dodd’s and Dr Stephens’ experience and expertise,” Jenny Salesa said.

The National Commission is the main channel of cooperation between New Zealand and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) which is responsible for promoting cooperative action between member states in the areas of education, science, culture, social science (including peace and human rights) and communication and information.

The National Commission fulfils New Zealand’s obligations as a member state, manages New Zealand’s relationship with UNESCO, maintains activities in support of the UNESCO mandate and provides advice to Government on UNESCO matters.
