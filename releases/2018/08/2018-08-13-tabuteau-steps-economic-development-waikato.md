Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau spoke at a meeting in Hamilton today hosted by the newly formed Waikato Regional Economic Development Agency (WREDA) about the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) and the opportunities it provides for the region.

Minister for Regional Economic Development Shane Jones also met with three district councils in the eastern Waikato last Friday - Thames-Coromandel, Hauraki, and Matamata-Piako, to discuss amongst other things, the recently launched Guide to the PGF - *[Powering up Aotearoa – New Zealand’s Regions](http://www.growregions.govt.nz/).*

“Waikato is full of potential and the Government is committed to working with the region to lift productivity and build on its many attributes,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“The establishment of the new WREDA and initiatives like the Waikato Māori Agenda and Action Plan provide a strong platform for sustainable, productive and inclusive growth in the region.

“I am looking forward to sitting down with WREDA and discussing the ways in which the PGF can help develop the region’s rich natural resources by investing in key sectors like dairy, manufacturing and forestry.

“The new WREDA, combined with the Waikato Economic Summit held at the end of this month, are significant milestones for economic development in the Waikato and will help set a clear path for the region going forward,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
