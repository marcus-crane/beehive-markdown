Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri is encouraging the next generation of vets to apply for career funding through a scheme designed to support and increase the number of graduate vets working with production animals in our regions.

Having opened applications for 2018, Meka Whaitiri says the Voluntary Bonding Scheme for Veterinarians offers 30 recipients who are developing careers in our heartland, $55,000 each over five years.

“Animal health and well-being is critical to the success of our primary industries and wider economy. Having skilled workers such as vets in our regions, where they are desperately needed, plays a key part in that success,” says Meka Whaitiri.

“To date, 256 graduates have benefited from this initiative and made a valuable contribution to rural veterinary centres focused on working animals – such as cows, sheep and horses.

“One hundred and sixty-eight female graduates have seized this career-enhancing opportunity, and I encourage even more women who want a rewarding role in rural vet services to apply.

“MPI officials are about to conduct a survey of all scheme participants, which will be used to investigate how the scheme can be further refined in line with the Government’s priorities in terms of inclusivity and diversity. I expect this work to be completed by the end of the year.

“I am committed to improving regional workplaces within the primary industries and this scheme helps meet that objective, with 62 recipients in the Waikato, and Canterbury, Southland and the Manawatu each home to 31, as strong examples.

“If you have graduated in the last 12 months from a related qualification and are looking for support to further your veterinary career, visit the Ministry for Primary Industries website and apply before 3pm on Monday 27 August 2018,” Meka Whaitiri said.
