Growing New Zealand’s food and fibre sectors sustainably and supporting a thriving economy are the hallmarks of a new investment programme announced today by Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor. 

“We’ve taken the best of two MPI investment programmes – the Sustainable Farming Fund and the Primary Growth Partnership – to create Sustainable Food & Fibre Futures, or SFF Futures,” Damien O’Connor said. 

“We are moving from volume to value. New Zealand’s commodity growth drive has come at the expense of the vital natural resources we need for our primary sector – our soil, water and social license to operate. 

“With a budget of $40 million a year, SFF Futures provides a single gateway for farmers and growers to apply for investment in a greater range of projects that deliver economic, environmental and social benefits that flow through to all Kiwis. 

“The food and fibre industries are the backbone of New Zealand’s economy, delivering more than $42 billion in export revenue last year, and the Coalition Government wants to help extract more value from what they already do, in a sustainable way that means our natural resources will be there for future generations.

“Targeted funding rounds may include projects focusing on specific outcomes, such as climate change or the environment.”

Mr O’Connor made the announcement on a farm in Morrinsville alongside the launch of a project to tap into the high-value, New Zealand goat milk infant formula industry.

“The CAPRINZ programme is the type of SFF Futures programme we are looking for. It has a value chain focus, will deliver environmental and sustainability benefits, grow an important industry, foster collaboration, build capability and importantly retain the benefits in New Zealand,” Damien O’Connor said.

**Note to editors:**

SFF Futures will be open for applications from October. Find out more [here](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/funding-and-programmes/sustainable-food-and-fibre-futures).

Findings of the independent review of the PGP are [here](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/30402-pgp-review-phase-2-report-final-pdf).

Existing PGP and SFF programmes will continue to their completion. Proposals in the pipeline will continue to be progressed under the original criteria.

SFF Futures applications are expected to have a greater focus on:

- demonstrating or delivering economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits
- prioritising product value over volume
- incorporating and encouraging collaboration and greater information sharing.
