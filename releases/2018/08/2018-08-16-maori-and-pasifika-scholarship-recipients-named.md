30 highly-accomplished Māori and Pasifika student teachers have been awarded prestigious Kupe Scholarships in a presentation ceremony hosted by Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis in Parliament today.

 The Scholarship is worth over $25,000 and aims to attract Māori and Pasifika high achievers to the teaching profession and support them to become inspiring teachers and role models in early childhood, primary and secondary education.

“It’s fantastic to see the Kupe Scholarship being utilised to encourage Māori and Pacific peoples into a teaching career,” Kelvin Davis said. 

“These scholarships reflect the Government’s commitment to raising the quality of education and education outcomes for Māori and Pacific students.

“One of the biggest levers we have to raise Māori and Pacific achievement is to strengthen teaching.

“That means ensuring we have a pipeline of competent Māori and Pacific teachers making the most of professional learning and development to support a confident and culturally competent teaching workforce.”

“The scholars that we’re celebrating today have already demonstrated high academic achievement, leadership, and close links with their communities, and this scholarship provides them the opportunity to make a real difference for kids in the classroom,” Kelvin Davis said.
