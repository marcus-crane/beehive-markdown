Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has offered his condolences to the people of the United States and the family of Senator John McCain at his passing.

“My deepest and sincerest sympathies go to the family of Senator John McCain at this very sad time,” said Mr Peters. 

“Senator McCain was a man of principle who dedicated his life to the service of his country. He was an inspirational leader and war hero; a man of integrity and bravery.”

“It was an honour to meet with Senator McCain on several occasions over recent years. He was a strong supporter of New Zealand’s close partnership with the United States. The tributes to his record of service have rarely been more deserved,” said Mr Peters.

“His leadership qualities will be missed by the people of the United States.”
