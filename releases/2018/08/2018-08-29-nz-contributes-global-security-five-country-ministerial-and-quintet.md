Minister Responsible for the NZSIS and GCSB, Hon Andrew Little, and Minister of Immigration Iain Lees-Galloway attended the annual Five Country Ministerial, held in the Gold Coast, Australia on 28-29 August.

The Five Country Ministerial brings to one place the interior Ministers and immigration Ministers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States to discuss common national security issues.

This year’s focus included counter-terrorism, countering violent extremism, cyber security, countering foreign interference, protecting critical infrastructure, migration, border management and law enforcement.

“We have a long, shared partnership with our Five Country colleagues and this is a valuable opportunity to discuss our shared challenges,” Mr Little says.

“Finding collaborative ways to address national security issues will help to better ensure the safety and security of New Zealanders.”

The Quintet of Attorneys-General, including Attorney-General Hon David Parker, joined the second day of the meeting to discuss national security issues from a legal dimension.

“National security issues are complex and global by nature and we are committed to working together to address our current and emerging national security challenges,” Mr Parker says.

Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway discussed ways that New Zealand’s immigration policy supports foreign relations and our international and humanitarian commitments.

“New Zealand supports a rules-based international system and is committed to protecting the wellbeing of New Zealanders,” says Mr Lees-Galloway.
