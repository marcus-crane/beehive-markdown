Justice Minister Andrew Little has introduced a Bill to help Cantabrians resolve outstanding residential insurance claims from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

“The Bill delivers on pre-election promises and establishes a Tribunal which will enable homeowners to resolve long-standing residential insurance claims including with Southern Response or the Earthquake Commission.

“The Tribunal will have the ability to award costs or general damages, and to appoint independent expert advisers to help the Tribunal to understand the technical aspects of a claim,” says Andrew Little.

Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Megan Woods says the Bill will make a real difference for the people of Canterbury.

“People have waited too long to have their claims resolved. This Tribunal will be another way to provide closure and help people move on with their lives.

The delay to resolve residential insurance claims has had significant impact and we need more options to make progress and help them reach an outcome.

“The Tribunal will have flexibility to tailor its approach to the needs of each case, and has various options available for resolving claims without a formal hearing, including referral to an independent, funded mediation service.

“The Tribunal will be proactive, managing cases through the process and setting timeframes that must be followed so claims progress.

“The Public will have the opportunity to comment on details of the Bill when it’s considered at Select Committee,” says Megan Woods.
