Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced a multi-million dollar programme to replace rundown classrooms, and provide modern learning spaces for students in Auckland and Northland.

Around $82.5 million is to be invested in two major redevelopments and 66 new roll growth classrooms at 14 schools across Auckland and Northland.

Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins announced the package during a visit to Onehunga High School in Auckland, where nearly $28 million will be spent replacing 18 teaching spaces, a gym and a library.

“This Government is focussed on rebuilding education and in this case we’re taking that literally, creating more and better learning spaces for thousands of students in Auckland and Tai Tokerau,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Every child deserves decent facilities to learn and achieve their goals.

“Student numbers at many schools in Auckland and Northland are growing fast.

“This funding will create more teaching space, giving thousands of students the opportunity to learn in more spacious, comfortable learning environments.”

Chris Hipkins said the investment is part of an on-going building programme of roll-growth teaching spaces and school upgrades across the country.

“Onehunga High and Northcote College are long overdue for some serious attention.

“Onehunga High has had to put up with substandard teaching facilities for too long. I am delighted it and all the other schools in this latest round of investment will now be able to plan properly for the future and provide better facilities for students.

“Northcote College will undergo a $11.5 million redevelopment, to replace old, end-of-life buildings with weather-tightness issues.”

In addition to the two major projects, $43 million will be invested in new roll growth classrooms at 12 schools across the two regions, Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins said.

Tai Tokerau schools will get 10 extra classrooms totalling $6 million:

Morningside School – 4

TKKM o Pukemiro – 3

Hikurangi School – 3

Auckland schools will get 56 classrooms totalling $37 million:

Kowhai intermediate – 5

Campbell’s Bay School – 13

Pukekohe High School – 6

Northcote Intermediate – 6

Birkenhead School – 6

Windy Ridget School – 3

Maraetai Beach School – 4

Homai School – 6

Manurewa South School - 7

Further announcements will be made about investments in school property in the coming weeks.
