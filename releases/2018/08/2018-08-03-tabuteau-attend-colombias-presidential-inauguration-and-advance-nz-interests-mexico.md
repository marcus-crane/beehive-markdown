Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau will represent New Zealand at Colombia’s Presidential inauguration in Bogotá next week, followed by a bilateral visit to Mexico.

“Colombia’s economic growth and international profile have increased impressively in a short period.  It was a privilege to open our new Embassy there in March, another significant step in strengthening New Zealand’s relations with the countries of Latin America,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

"I am looking forward to returning to Colombia for the inauguration of President-elect Iván Duque.”

While in Colombia, Mr Tabuteau will also visit a New Zealand-supported Dairy Value Chain development project and meet local leaders in regional Colombia.

Mr Tabuteau will then travel to Mexico City for meetings with political counterparts and representatives of New Zealand businesses.

“Mexico and New Zealand cooperate closely on global issues, at the United Nations and within the Asia-Pacific region. Mexico is our largest trading partner in Latin America and our economic relationship continues to grow.

“This visit will be a great opportunity to engage with Mexico at a time of political transition following the recent elections there.

Mr Tabuteau’s visit to Colombia and Mexico comes at a time when New Zealand is working to deepen its trading links with the Pacific Alliance through concluding a high quality free trade agreement. A trade agreement will allow New Zealand to become an *Associate Member* of the Pacific Alliance.

“The Pacific Alliance, made up of Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile, is one of the most important strategic initiatives in Latin America and a key platform for New Zealand to deliver on its commitment to deepen our relationships in the region.

“We see significant potential to grow trade and investment with our like-minded partners in the Alliance through a high quality and comprehensive trade agreement, which we hope to conclude this year,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
