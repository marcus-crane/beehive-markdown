Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a record $324 million investment for Hawke’s Bay that will deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned investment in the Hawke’s Bay transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

The NLTP comprises $12.9b from the National Land Transport Fund, generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; $3.4b from local government, generated through rates and Auckland’s Regional Fuel Tax; and $547m in other Crown investments.

                 

Phil Twyford said the $324 million investment planned for Hawke’s Bay over the next three years marks an 18% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 34% per cent increase from 2012/15.

“Safety is a top priority for the Government. $88 million will be invested in programmes and projects in Hawke’s Bay that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing. Safety improvements to the Hawke’s Bay Expressway will include flexible wire-rope safety barriers, wider shoulders, and a new passing lane between Bayview and the Airport

“The significant $77 million investment in state highways reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system.

“To help keep the region moving, $14 million is being invested in public transport and walking and cycling projects, as well as $178 million for local roads. This includes funding for iWay Napier,” said Phil Twyford.   

Investment through the NLTP will contribute to a land transport system for the Hawke’s Bay that will be safer and easier for people to use, supporting tourism and economic expansion, and keeping communities connected.
