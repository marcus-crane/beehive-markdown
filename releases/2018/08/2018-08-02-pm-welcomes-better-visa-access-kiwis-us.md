Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has welcomed the signing of the ‘KIWI Act’ by the President of the United States Donald Trump.

The Knowledgeable Innovators and Worthy Investors Act (KIWI Act) has been a long-term goal for New Zealand for many years.

The law gives New Zealanders access to E1 and E2 visas.  These allow those business people who qualify to enter the US multiple times over two years without having to apply for a new visa each time, with an option to renew their visa on a rolling basis.

“The KIWI Act will increase trade and investment between the United States and New Zealand and will benefit both our countries,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Lack of E1 and E2 visas has been a major issue for New Zealand business people wanting to access the US market. This Act will be a big boost to New Zealand businesses.

“Assisting New Zealand business opportunities in the US and elsewhere through trade and other regulatory measures is a key pillar of this Government’s economic strategy.

“The smooth passage of the KIWI Act was a sign of the strength of the New Zealand-United States relationship and I want to thank all those who made the passage of the Act possible.

“The US is critically important to New Zealand’s interests and this Act will help develop closer economic ties with the US. I thank the US Congress and President Trump for their support of the Act”.

New Zealand officials will now work with the State Department to ensure that the KIWI Act can be implemented as soon as possible, so that New Zealanders can start to apply for the visas.
