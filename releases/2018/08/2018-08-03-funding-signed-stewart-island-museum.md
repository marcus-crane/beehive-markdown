Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Carmel Sepuloni has met with Stewart Island locals to confirm $1 million of Government funding towards the Rakiura Heritage Centre building.

Minister Sepuloni signed off on the funding this week and has met with the Rakiura Heritage Centre Trust today to congratulate them on their work to secure the funding.

“The Community is excited about the prospects that come with the investment. The new building will be an important community and cultural hub and a tourist attraction,’ Carmel Sepuloni said.

The grant is provided to the Rakiura Heritage Centre Trust from the Government’s Regional Culture and Heritage Fund. Last year the previous Government had offered to grant funds, subject to some conditions.

“I’m delighted to confirm that these conditions have now been met and the grant of $1.08 million has now been awarded for the new building. 

“The Rakiura Heritage Centre Trust, the museum, and the entire community have worked very hard to pull this project together. Visiting the area gave me the opportunity to see the current museum building first hand and meet some of the Trust members.”

Construction of the new building will start soon. It will incorporate environmentally friendly design features including solar power generation and water collection. 

It will display around half the museum’s current collection, while the remaining collection will be safely stored in a much improved collection storage space. 

“The New Zealand Fire Service has generously made the new site available to the Trust and community members have worked tirelessly to raise funds for the project.  A strong array of community sponsors and Trusts are contributing,” Carmel Sepuloni said. 

Other key contributors to the project include Lotteries Special Projects Fund, Lotteries Environment and Heritage, Community Trust of Southland, Southland Regional Heritage Committee, Rakiura Māori Land Trust, and a DOC Rakiura National Park grant.
