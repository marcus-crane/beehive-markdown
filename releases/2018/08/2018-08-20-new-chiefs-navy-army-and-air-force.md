Defence Minister Ron Mark has today announced the appointment of new Service Chiefs for the Navy, Army and Air Force after the completion of a recruitment process led by the State Services Commission.

“I’m delighted to announce that following approval by Cabinet, Commodore David Proctor, Brigadier John Boswell and Air Commodore Andrew Clark have been appointed by the Governor-General to lead their respective Services,” says Ron Mark.

Commodore David Proctor has been appointed to the position of Chief of Navy, for a term of three years from 1 December 2018 to 30 November 2021, and will be promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral.

Brigadier John Boswell DSD has been appointed to the position of Chief of Army, for a term of three years from 10 September 2018 to 9 September 2021, and will be promoted to the rank of Major General.

Air Commodore Andrew Clark has been appointed to the position of Chief of Air Force, for a term of three years from 10 September 2018 to 9 September 2021, and will be promoted to the rank of Air Vice-Marshal.

“It takes decades of hard work to become a Service Chief. All three are excellent officers and I’m certain they will do an outstanding job.

“In particular this is a watershed day for the Navy, with Commodore Proctor becoming the first logistics officer to be appointed as the Chief of Navy.

“I’d like to thank the outgoing Chiefs of Navy and Army; Rear Admiral John Martin and Major General Peter Kelly, for their outstanding service to New Zealand.  You’ve been a credit to our Defence Force and I wish you well in the next step in your careers.

“I’d also like to congratulate the outgoing Chief of Air Force, Air Vice-Marshal Tony Davies, whose appointment to the role of Vice Chief of Defence Force was announced earlier in the year.

“In a wider sense, the appointment of three new Service Chiefs at the same time will lead to a refresh of Defence Force leadership at all levels. This is an exciting prospect, with a lot of impressive leaders coming up through the ranks.

“In particular, I will be watching for a lift in leadership opportunities for women throughout the organisation, increasing the chance that in the not too distant future the Government has the opportunity to appoint the first ever female Service Chief,” says Ron Mark.

The State Services Commission will be proactively releasing the Cabinet paper relating to the appointment here:
