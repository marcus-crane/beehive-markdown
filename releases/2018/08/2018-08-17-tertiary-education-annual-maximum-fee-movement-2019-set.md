The Annual Maximum Fee Movement (AMFM) for tertiary education organisations in 2019 has been set to 2%, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today.

Each year the Government sets a limit for any tuition fee increases charged by the tertiary sector for domestic students.

“I have considered the six submissions received and believe that the increase strikes a balance between protecting the affordability of tertiary education for students, while allowing tertiary education providers to invest in resources,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Providers can now start considering any fee changes and marketing for next year.

“The 2% limit matches the 2% limit that was set for 2017 and 2018 academic years.

“Continuing the annual maximum fee movement process provides certainty on potential fee rises for all parties – students, providers and the Government,” Chris Hipkins said.
