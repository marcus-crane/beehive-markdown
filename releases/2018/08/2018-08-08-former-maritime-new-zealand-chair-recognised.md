Transport Minister Phil Twyford has recognised the contribution of outgoing Maritime New Zealand Board Chair Blair O’Keeffe.

Blair O’Keeffe has been appointed a director of the Z Energy Board. This was identified as creating a potential perceived future conflict of interest because of Maritime New Zealand’s role in overseeing oil pollution issues.

For this reason, he decided to proactively manage this and resigned as Chair of the Maritime New Zealand Board last Friday.

Phil Twyford said Blair O’Keeffe was a loss to Maritime New Zealand, but he was grateful for his transparent approach.

“I would like to acknowledge Blair O’Keeffe’s commitment during his two years as a member of the Maritime New Zealand Board. His stewardship and direction have been invaluable for the Board and for Maritime New Zealand more broadly. I wish him all the best for the future in his new, exciting governance role,” Phil Twyford said.

Blair O’Keeffe was appointed in March 2016, becoming Chair in October of that year.

The Minister will now work alongside the Ministry of Transport to find his replacement. Candidates across the public and private sectors will be considered and consultation with industry undertaken before a final decision is made.
