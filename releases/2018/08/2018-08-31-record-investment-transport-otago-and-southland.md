Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a record $986 million investment for Otago and Southland will strengthen the region’s transport system over the next three years.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned investment in the region’s transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

Phil Twyford said the $986 million investment planned for Otago and Southland over the next three years marks a 52% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP.

“Safety is a top priority for the government. We will invest $211 million in Otago and Southland on programmes and projects that will help save lives and reduce the number of serious injuries.

“This level of investment in road safety in Otago and Southland, 22% of the total planned investment for the region, reflects the importance which the Government places on keeping all New Zealanders safe on the roads,” said Phil Twyford.

“We are putting a much stronger focus on regional investment, and also providing significant increases in funding for public transport, local road improvements, road safety and walking and cycling facilities.”

“Investment through the NLTP will contribute to a land transport system for Otago and Southland that will be safer and easier for people to use, supporting tourism and economic expansion, and keeping communities connected.

The significant investment being made in Otago and Southland through the NLTP recognises that safe, reliable and resilient access to remote communities and farming, forestry and tourism, is vital to maintain economic growth and prosperity in the region,” Phil Twyford said.
