Following on from the Education Summit, a series of wānanga are being held from Kaitaia to Dunedin to help shape the future of Māori education, Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

“This government is focused on raising achievement for all Māori learners. These wānanga, facilitated by the Ministry of Education, are the biggest opportunity in decades to make sure all Māori voices are heard on education,” Kelvin Davis said.

“We are off to a great start. About 100 people representing whānau, hapū, iwi, and kura attended the first wānanga in Rotorua today.

“Normalising te reo, improving and increasing the number of te reo teachers, as well as utilising traditional customs and practice were top of mind for participants, along with more careers focused subjects.

“At these wānanga, participants will discuss what’s important to Māori in education; what we value about education; and what we want to change to ensure even greater success for all Māori in education, life and employment.

“Māori will be telling us the best ways to promote the hauora of Māori learners, and about building stronger connections between education, iwi, whānau and local communities.”

“Between now and mid-October over 25 other wānanga will be held. I will be attending a number to hear the views of our people directly, as will other ministers.

“We want all Māori children, parents, families, educators and employers to come along to their local wānanga, and have their say,” Kelvin Davis said.
