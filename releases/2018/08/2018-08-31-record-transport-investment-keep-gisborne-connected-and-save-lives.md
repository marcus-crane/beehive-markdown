Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a record $232 million investment for Gisborne that will deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system.

The NZ Transport Agency has published details of the planned investment in Gisborne’s transport system over the next three years as part a record $16.9 billion investment in New Zealand’s transport system set out in the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

The NLTP comprises $12.9b from the National Land Transport Fund, generated through fuel excise, road user charges, and other revenue sources; $3.4b from local government, generated through rates and Auckland’s Regional Fuel Tax; and $547m in other Crown investments.

Phil Twyford said the $232 million investment planned for Gisborne over the next three years marks a 69% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 90% per cent increase from 2012/15.

“Safety is a top priority for the government. $51 million will be invested in programmes and projects in Gisborne that will save lives. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

“State highways receive a significant investment, with a total of $62 million invested in state highway improvements and maintenance, which reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system.”

Phil Twyford said protecting key road corridors and improving the resilience of the transport network is a key focus for the investment in Gisborne for 2018/21.

“Due to the region’s relative isolation and the absence of viable transport options, road closures can be both costly and time consuming for local people and businesses.

“Rural communities are left isolated when road links are cut, and reliable journeys are also needed from the farm gate and forests to production facilities and ports, and to support the growing popularity of Gisborne as a holiday destination. That’s why we’re investing $112 million for local road maintenance and improvements, and $49 million in regional improvement funding to support social and economic development,” said Phil Twyford.
