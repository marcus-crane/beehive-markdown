Middle School West Auckland and South Auckland Middle School have both been approved to open as designated character schools next year, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“I deferred making a decision on these two charter schools in July, because more information was needed to demonstrate that they meet the legal requirements for designated character schools,” Chris Hipkins said.

“An independent evaluator has since reviewed the schools’ planned curriculum alongside their proposed character, and reported back to the Ministry.

“As a result, I am now satisfied that the curriculum will reflect the schools’ designated character, and that their students will receive an education that is significantly different from an ordinary state school.

“Accordingly, I have decided to approve the sponsor’s application.  I have also appointed the Establishment Board of Trustees who will be responsible for both schools.  They include members of the existing Villa Education Trust Board, to provide continuity for the schools and support their special character.”

Nine charter schools’ applications to establish designated character schools have so far been approved.

Decisions are expected shortly on the three remaining applications (one for a designated character school, and two to establish state integrated schools).
