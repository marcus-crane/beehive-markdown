*Pacific Aotearoa,* an online survey launched today by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples gives tech savvy Pacific a voice in the Ministry’s Pacific Vision project.

“Pacific communities are the youngest and fastest growing in the country and it’s imperative that they have a voice,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio

The Pacific Aotearoa survey incorporates a range of questions that allows it to quickly profile respondents and then record their views on immediate concerns such as health, family commitments and employment opportunities and broader issues such as the importance of Pacific languages and the place of Pacific culture in mainstream New Zealand.

“The survey is easy to use and hits all the key challenges Pacific people face and invites them to share their aspirations about the future of Pacific Aotearoa. Quite simply, it asks: What is the future you see? This is exciting because it will give us real insight into our communities and a picture of the future they are working towards.

“We’re now into the second month of our engagements and at the last report we’d met with 46 groups representing community organisations, youth, people with disabilities, businesses, NGOs, and church groups and leaders. I’ll also be on the road myself during the Parliamentary recess consulting with Pacific communities in the South Island. 

“We’re getting real grass roots feedback and I’m excited by the enthusiasm we’re meeting with. Our people want to share both their immediate concerns and their aspirations for the future. They definitely have a vision for the future and are committed to the protection and development of our unique Pacific identity and culture.

The findings of the survey will be used to strengthen a Pacific Vision for the new generation of Pacific people who call Aotearoa their home.  This will be presented at a Pacific Summit scheduled for November.

“I’m confident that this will be a landmark event for Pacific Aotearoa. It will deliver a shared vision for Pacific peoples that will enable us to fully realise our potential and maximise our contribution to the Pacific New Zealand that is fast emerging around us,” says Aupito William Sio.
