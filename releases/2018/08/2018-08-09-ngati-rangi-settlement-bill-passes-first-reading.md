Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon Andrew Little, welcomed Ngāti Rangi to Parliament today to witness their Treaty settlement Bill pass its first reading.

“Although no settlement could ever compensate Ngāti Rangi for the prejudice they have suffered by the Crown’s acts and omissions today’s Bill heralds the beginning of a renewed relationship and a significant contribution to the fulfilment of the aspirations Ngāti Rangi hold for their future.

“I acknowledge the kuia and kaumatua who have not lived to see settlement. I would also like to acknowledge the significant work by the Ngāti Rangi Trust and their negotiation team to reach this settlement for their people.

“The principle of cooperation has consistently characterised Ngāti Rangi’s approach to their relationship with the Crown. They encouraged European settlement in Whanganui, provided land and other precious resources in their rohe, and made sacrifices for the benefit of the Crown and their fellow New Zealanders. The Bill acknowledges many members of Ngāti Rangi fought for the Crown in wars here and overseas.

“Ngāti Rangi settlement includes the Crown’s acknowledgements and its apology, financial and commercial redress totalling $17 million, and cultural redress including a statutory recognition of the Whangaehu River and shared governance arrangements for this treasured awa.

“A unique feature of this Bill is the volume and depth of its relationship with fourteen Crown agencies and six local authorities.

“Throughout the negotiations Ngāti Rangi impressed on the Crown the cultural and spiritual significance of Whangaehu awa not only for their iwi but for their whanaunga along the river. Te Waiū-o-Te-Ika framework will provide new governance arrangements for the Whangaehu River which recognises the kaitiakitanga of all iwi connected to the river,” says Andrew Little.

**Notes:**

The settlement includes the following redress:

- an agreed historical account, Crown acknowledgements, and an apology;
- cultural redress, including:
  
  - special recognition of the connection between Ngāti Rangi, other local iwi, and Te Waiū o Te Ika (the Whangaehu River) and a new framework for the joint governance of the river and its catchment;
  - conservation redress including a joint committee, Te Pae Ao, to administer specified reserve sites;
  - the vesting of certain Defence Force land at Waiouru which will then be gifted back to the Crown for the people of New Zealand;
  - Crown minerals redress;
  - a cultural fund of $167,000; and
  - relationship redress; and
- Financial and commercial redress totalling $17 million; and including:
  
  - sale and lease back arrangements;
  - a list of deferred selection properties; and
  - a list of right of first refusal properties.

The benefits of the settlement will be available to all members of Ngāti Rangi.
