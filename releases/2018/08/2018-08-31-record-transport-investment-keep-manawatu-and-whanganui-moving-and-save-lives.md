Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today a record $647 million investment for Manawatu and Whanganui to deliver a safer, better connected and more resilient transport system.

The planned investments are detailed in the 2018-21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), published today by the NZ Transport Agency.The planned $647 million investment for Manawatu and Whanganui over the next three years is part of the Government’s record $16.9 billion investment in transport across New Zealand and marks a 30% increase compared to the previous three yearly 2015/18 NLTP, and a 98% per cent increase from 2012/15.

“This record investment in our transport system will help grow our regions, make it easier to get around our cities, and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” said Phil Twyford.

The Government has made road safety a top priority. We are committed to reducing the number of Kiwis dying on our roads. In Manawatu-Whanganui, $136 million will be invested in safety programmes and improvements to help reduce the number and severity of crashes.

“We’re investing $234 million in state highways improvements and maintenance in Manawatu-Whanganui, reflecting the region’s importance as a transport ‘crossroads’, where road and rail corridors critical for the economy intersect. That’s why we’re investing $146 million in the development of a new SH3 route to connect Manawatū, Tararua District, Hawke’s Bay and northern Wairarapa, replacing the Manawatū Gorge route, which has been closed by unstable land and slips.

“To ease congestion and make our cities healthier places to live, $27 million will be invested in public transport and $13m for walking and cycling. This will include funding for the Palmerston North to Fielding shared path and the new He Ara Kotahi shared Manawatu River Bridge,” Phil Twyford said.
