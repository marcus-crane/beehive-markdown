Transport Minister Phil Twyford says more than $1.7 billion will be invested in Canterbury over the next three years to strengthen the region’s transport network, improving safety, building resilience and ensuring tourism continues to flourish.

The $1.7 billion investment in Canterbury is part of the Government’s record $16.9 billion investment in transport across New Zealand through the 2018/21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), published today by the NZ Transport Agency.

“Strengthening the region’s roads to make them safer and more resilient to meet the growth in freight volumes and increasing numbers of tourists is a key focus for investments detailed in the NLPT,” Phil Twyford said.                          

“Safety is a top priority for the Government. $294m will be invested in programmes and projects in Canterbury that will help save lives and reduce the number of serious injuries on our roads.

“Both safety and access to the Lyttleton Port of Christchurch will be improved with the completion of a tunnel deluge system to prevent a fire spreading, and completion of the alternative hazardous goods route over Evans Pass between Sumner and Lyttleton, representing a total investment of $31 million.

“Public transport will be improved trough a $176 million investment, an increase of 24% compared to 2015-18 NLTP. Projects including the CSA Bus interchange will give commuters more options and tackle congestion.

Phil Twyford said beyond the city, investment in both the Kaikoura and Hurunui districts will remain focussed on earthquake recovery and competing the rebuild of the local road network.

“The NZ Transport Agency has worked closely with local government for several months to ensure the NLTP investments are carefully targeted to areas and activities where it’s needed most and delivers the best outcomes for the greatest number of people in the region,” Phil Twyford said.
