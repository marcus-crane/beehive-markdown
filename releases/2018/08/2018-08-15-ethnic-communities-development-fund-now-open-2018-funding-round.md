Minister for Ethnic Communities Jenny Salesa has today announced the opening of the 2018 funding round for the Ethnic Communities Development Fund (ECDF).

ECDF provides $520,000 annually to support the development of strong, inclusive and resilient ethnic communities throughout New Zealand.

“This fund contributes to improving social cohesion by supporting the development of established and emerging ethnic communities, now numbering more than 200 throughout the country,” Jenny Salesa said.

Jenny Salesa encourages not-for-profit ethnic groups to apply for a share of the fund, which allocates grants under three separate funding priorities:

- leadership development projects

- cultural events

- social cohesion projects.

“The Ethnic Communities Development Fund supports communities to be inclusive and to value diversity.  It is essential that people from all ethnic and cultural backgrounds have a genuine sense of belonging in New Zealand, and are able to participate fully in our society.

“This year, I’d especially like to encourage applications that aim to increase the leadership and governance skills of ethnic community members. This aligns with one of my priorities – to progress towards a more balanced ethnic representation on state sector boards and committees,” Jenny Salesa said.

The closing date for funding applications is 26 September 2018.
