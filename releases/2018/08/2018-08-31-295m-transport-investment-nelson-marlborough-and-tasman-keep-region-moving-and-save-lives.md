Transport Minister Phil Twyford says a $295 million investment announced today for Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman will strengthen the region’s transport system over the next three years.

The planned investments are detailed in the 2018-21 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), published today by the NZ Transport Agency. The planned $295 million investment planned for Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman is part of the Government’s record $16.9 billion investment in transport across New Zealand.

“This investment in our transport system will help grow our regions, make it easier to get around our towns and cities, and save lives on our roads. It will deliver the best results for our transport dollar,” said Phil Twyford.

“Our Government is making safety a priority. $62 million of investment will go into programmes and projects in the top of the South that will save Kiwis’ lives by preventing accidents or reducing their severity. This will include revamping intersections to stop collisions, installing median barriers in high-risk areas, and increasing road policing.

“To help keep the region moving and promote healthier communities, $7.5 million is being invested in public transport, $4.3 million for walking and cycling projects, as well as $128 million for local roads. This includes funding the development of a cycleway connection to Tahunanui, the Grovetown to Spring Creek Walking and Cycling path and the Nelson East to Matai path,” said Phil Twyford.

“State highways continue to receive the largest share of funding, with a total of $135 million invested in state highway improvements and maintenance, which reflects the Government’s continued commitment to this vital part of our transport system.” Phil Twyford said.

Investment through the NLTP will contribute to a land transport system for Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman that will be safer and easier for people to use, supporting tourism and economic expansion, and keeping communities connected.
