The Government is expanding the number of Trades Academy places to help more senior secondary school students into employment, and simplifying the way Māori and Pasifika Trades Training students access the resources they need, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Mr Hipkins made the announcements at the ‘Got a Trade? Got it Made!’ awards ceremony at Parliament this afternoon.

“The Government is prioritising an extra 1,060 Trades Academy places from 2019. The funding is being transferred from the DualPathways Pilot which finishes at the end of this year,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Trades Academy is a successful programme and it makes sense to expand it.

“Shifting the funding to Trades Academies will make it easier for schools and tertiary education organisations to work together to support secondary school students who want to explore a career in the trades.

“We are also changing the way targeted funding is managed for Māori and Pasifika Trades Training to make it easier for learners in the programme to get the tools and other support they need.

Māori and Pasifika Trades Training provides fees-free pre-trades programmes and wraparound support for Māori and Pacific learners aged 16 to 40.  Consortia of tertiary education organisations, employers, and Māori and Pacific communities coordinate the programmes in each region.

“Previously trainees had to apply for tools grants if they wanted money to get essentials like work boots, goggles and any other tools they need for training. The funding will now go to the consortia so tools, resources and other essential costs like transport is purchased on behalf of the trainees.

“This is a small but significant change that will allow learners to get the support they need to enter and succeed in trades. The new approach will benefit many more people than the previous tools grant.

“These changes support the Government’s broader plan of supporting young people into training and apprenticeships, and dealing with skills shortages,” Chris Hipkins said.

**Notes for editors**

**Trades Academy** Lead Providers will soon be able to apply to the Ministry of Education for the additional places. Schools and tertiary providers participating in the DualPathways Pilot, and other schools and tertiary education organisations not already part of a Trades Academy, should contact a Trades Academy Lead Provider in their region to explore potential opportunities for 2019. Details of Lead Providers can be found [here](http://www.youthguarantee.net.nz/assets/Uploads/STP-Map-August-2018.pdf)

**Māori and Pasifika Trades Training** is coordinated by 16 regionally-based consortia, which helps align training and support more closely to the needs of employers, communities and learners. Last year, 2559 people were enrolled in Māori and Pasifika Trades Training.
