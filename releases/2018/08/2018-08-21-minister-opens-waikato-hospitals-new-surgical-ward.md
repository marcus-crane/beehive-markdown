Health Minister Dr David Clark says Waikato Hospital’s new surgical ward is an important investment in meeting growing demand for acute care in the Waikato.

Dr Clark officially opened Ward M18 at the hospital this afternoon.

“The completion of the new ward and the DHB’s associated patient flow improvement projects are significant steps forward in improving the treatment and health outcomes for the local population,” David Clark said.

“I acknowledge that the whole health system is under pressure from years of underinvestment that has led to increased pressure on services in primary and secondary care settings. Feedback from the sector is that those presenting to general practice and hospitals do require acute level care, and there are few inappropriate emergency department presentations.

“It is good to see that individually DHBs are taking action to manage and meet this increased acute demand including addressing capacity needs within the Hospital and working with their primary care partners to keep patients out of hospital.

“I want to acknowledge the efforts of the DHB Board, management and staff, in particular Sally Webb and Derek Wright, on this achievement,” David Clark said.

The new ward will have 26 beds including ten where general surgical patients can be assessed. This will mean some will be able to bypass the emergency department or spend significantly less time there.

A further 16 beds are for surgical specialty patients with an expected length of stay less than 48 hours.
