People throughout Aotearoa New Zealand have an opportunity to honour our past and build a future through a commemorative fund which opens today, said Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta.    

Te Pūtake o Te Riri - Wars and Conflicts in Aotearoa New Zealand Fund supports whānau, hapū and iwi to bring to life the stories of our past and present that speak to Aotearoa’s cultural evolution. Examples of commemorative activities may include local tours or events, the development of resources or community wānanga.  

“Our history is bursting with notable rangatira whose prowess in war, strategic and tactical feats are compelling and continue to impact on how communities have settled and relate to their own story. Yet only a small portion of the community know this story and it needs to be shared and understood. 

“This fund provides a specific opportunity to share local stories, born out of conflict but steeped in an important aspect of our New Zealand identity and how we can move forward together in future,” said Nanaia Mahuta. 

The Government has set aside $4 million over four years (from 2017 to 2020) for these local stories to be told. The fund  focuses on increasing awareness about local history, significant landmarks and people.  

The first He Rā Maumahara - national commemoration day took place on 11 March 2018 in Kororāreka (Russell), hosted by Te Tai Tokerau. The next one will take place in Taranaki on 28 October 2019. 

“We have a unique opportunity to build nationhood and pride through a better understanding of our history and I encourage groups to apply. 

“You can be part of celebrating mātauranga, and building strong relationships in communities, for the benefit of our country and our people. 

“This Government is committed to a shared sense of nationhood. All aspects of our encounters, wars and establishing our nation contribute to that effort. This has also been signalled by the opening of Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
