Associate Minister for Agriculture, Meka Whaitiri has extended the nomination period for the Primary Industries Good Employer Awards, in order to recognise more outstanding employers from the sector which employees around one in seven New Zealanders.

“From Māori Agribusiness to Employee Development, the Primary Industries Good Employer Awards celebrate employer innovation and encourages more Kiwis to experience a career in an industry that values their contribution,” says Meka Whaitiri.

“By extending nominations until August 24, we ensure all primary industries employers demonstrating exceptional employment practices, have a fair chance to be justly recognised as an award winner.

“Alongside award categories such as innovative employment practices, and safe and healthy work environments, I am welcoming nominations for employers who are committed to improving employment practices in their region for the Minister’s Award.

“As the primary industries employ as many as one in three people in some regions, I am committed to highlighting the kaupapa of improving regional workplaces within this sector.

“Don’t miss this chance to nominate a good employer in the primary industries, one whose work environment sees employees feel supported, safe, develop and grow,” Meka Whaitiri said.

- Individuals or businesses must be nominated by an industry body or a peer.
