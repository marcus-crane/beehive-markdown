Justice Minister Andrew Little joined more than 600 people who walked through the doors of Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua to start a public conversation about reducing offending, reducing re-offending, and having fewer victims of crime who are better supported.

“I’m encouraged by the diverse range of people who have come together to create a more effective criminal justice system,” says Mr Little.

“To create a fair and just system we need input from a wide range of New Zealanders. That’s why it’s important that we’ve been hearing from victims, NGOs, academics, Māori, Pasifika and a broad spectrum of the public.

“This is possibly the first-time that people who have offended have sat down with people who have been harmed and public sector officials and leaders to create new solutions together.

“Many of the people here today will know what it’s like to be one of the negative statistics that we need to turn around. I hope the stories and people’s voices are heard beyond the numbers to create tangible solutions for some of our toughest challenges.

“The ideas that are generated from workshops and discussions today and tomorrow will inform the wider reform programme Hāpaitia te Oranga Tangata, Safe and Effective Justice.

“This summit is the start of a national conversation, with online engagement and a series of regional meetings to be held to help gauge the widest possible range of people and opinions,” says Mr Little.
