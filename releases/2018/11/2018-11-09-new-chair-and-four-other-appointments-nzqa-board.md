Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced five appointments to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority Board (NZQA).

The new Chair, Murray Strong has been a Board member for eight years and has held a variety of Crown-appointed senior roles over the past 15 years. New members appointed for three years are Lyn Provost and Jenn Bestwick, while Dr Neil Quigley is to continue as a Board member for another year and Kate Shevland has been reappointed for a three year term.

“I am delighted with these appointments. They provide an excellent mix of continuity of experience, and new ideas and perspectives,” Chris Hipkins said.

“The Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato, Dr Quigley has been on the Board since 2010. The Board will continue to benefit from Dr Quigley’s oversight of NZQA’s strategic work programme, and from Ms Shevland’s extensive experience in the secondary sector, which includes her role as the Principal of Orewa College for 20 years.

“Retiring members Sue Suckling and Andrew McKenzie have each made a valuable contribution, and I would like to thank them both for their time and energy,” Chris Hipkins said.

NZQA administers the National Certificates of Educational Achievement (NCEAs) for secondary school students. Additional NZQA responsibilities include the quality assurance of non-university tertiary training providers; and helping to ensure New Zealand qualifications are recognised overseas, and overseas qualifications are appropriately recognised in New Zealand.
