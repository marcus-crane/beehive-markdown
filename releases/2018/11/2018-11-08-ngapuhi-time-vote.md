Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little has encouraged all [Ngāpuhi]() to participate in the month-long vote on the evolved Treaty mandate proposal that opened this week.

“This is about [Ngāpuhi hapū having a say on their future](),” Mr Little said. 

“I look forward to the day when the Crown and the hāpū of Ngāpuhi can sit down together and negotiate settlement packages that help to address the hurt and harm caused by the Crown’s breaches of the Treaty and provide for a better future for Ngāpuhi mokopuna.

“The process which Ngāpuhi are being asked to vote on follows months of discussions and hui, to ensure it complies with the Waitangi Tribunal’s recommendations and meets the needs of hapū. 

“I hope all Ngāpuhi vote and hold hui and make submissions, then we will know which hapū support the evolved model and how to proceed.

“I’d like to acknowledge the work of all those involved in developing the evolved mandate proposal, particularly Te Rōpū Tūhono, which includes rangatira from the Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority and Te Kotahitanga o Ngā Hapū Ngāpuhi,” Mr Little said.

The evolved mandate voting and hapū endorsement process runs until 7 and 10 December respectively, and come after 46 consultation hui in New Zealand and Australia, and more than 700 submissions.

“There is no such thing as a perfect process for this, but it is possible to have a process which respects hapū rangatiratanga, and which allows those who have carried the burden of the Crown’s wrongdoing for so long to achieve justice. Now is time for Ngāpuhi to make decisions about their future.”
