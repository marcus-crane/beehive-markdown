Te Korowai o Wainuiārua and the Crown have signed an agreement in principle that marks an important step in the settlement of the historical Treaty claims of Uenuku, Tamakana, and Tamahaki, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little announced today.

The agreement in principle outlines a broad settlement package, including provisional Crown acknowledgments of its Treaty breaches, financial and commercial redress of $21.7 million, and the return of sites of cultural significance to Te Korowai o Wainuiārua.

In signing the agreement, Mr Little acknowledged the difficult history between Te Korowai o Wainuiārua hapū and the Crown.

“It is a history of large-scale loss of ancestral land, much of it within a very short space of time to enable the construction of the main trunk line and the subsequent logging of the great Waimarino forests which helped to build the colony’s towns and cities.

“With this agreement in principle we acknowledge that history and are working to repair the relationship with tangata whenua,” Mr Little said.

“Te Korowai o Wainuiārua are a resilient and future-focused group who are seeking a comprehensive redress package to fulfil the aspirations of their people. I am pleased to sign this agreement with them and looking forward to seeing it develop into a robust deed of settlement.”
