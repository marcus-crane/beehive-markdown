A $400,000 investment from the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will be used to fund the first stage of an Advanced Aviation Hub at Whanganui Airport, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones has announced.

With the capacity to train up to 288 students a year, the funding will support development of a business case to expand existing facilities, and create an advanced simulation centre. 

“Across the globe there is significant demand for airline pilots, underscoring the opportunity that exists to facilitate and support required training. It’s heartening to see Whanganui looking forward to this opportunity and responding to it in this innovative way,” Shane Jones said.

“A training centre of this kind can support pilots, flight attendants, aeronautical engineers and others to gain the licencing and qualifications needed for modern aircraft. It will also have major benefits for the economy of the city,” Shane Jones said.
