There will be urgent safety improvements done on SH3 from Waitara to Bell Block to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries, Minister of Transport Phil Twyford announced today.

The $29 million dollar project will start in February and will include safety upgrades between Raleigh Street and Waiongana Stream. Over the next three years, a new right turn pocket on SH3 into Wills Road will be built, with an extension of the right turn pocket into Corbett Road following. There will also be SH3 widening between Wills/Corbett and Mahoetahi Road for wide shoulders with wire rope safety barriers.

Phil Twyford said that too many people are dying or being injured on our roads and these safety upgrades will make this busy section much safer while also catering for future growth.

“State Highway 3 is one of the busiest stretches of road in the region carrying a mix of freight and commuter traffic, and provides access to New Plymouth Airport and the Port.

“The NZ Transport Agency is prioritising urgent safety improvements to make them more forgiving of human error. Drivers will always make mistakes and the government’s job is to stop those mistakes turning into tragedies.

“The community has been asking for safety improvements for some time and I’d like to acknowledge them and New Plymouth Mayor Neil Holdom for their advocacy,” Phil Twyford said.

The Government is investing $4.3 billion in safety improvements nationwide over the next three years under the National Land Transport Programme to help save lives.
