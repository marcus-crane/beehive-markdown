A stand-alone Lottery Fund has been created to help communities throughout New Zealand benefit from the 2021 America’s Cup.

Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin says the Fund allows community groups to apply for grants that will create community benefit related to Auckland hosting the America’s Cup, maximising the benefits from the event.

“The America’s Cup is a global event, and having it here is a significant opportunity – one that can benefit towns and cities across New Zealand in the lead up to, during and post-2021,” Minister Martin said.

“While Auckland will be hosting the event, the Fund aims to spread community gains across the country.”

The Lottery Grants Board made the decision to create the Fund – the Lottery Fund for Community Benefit Related to the America’s Cup Committee – and it has been allocated $20 million.

The Fund will be open until the end of December 2020 or until funding has been fully distributed. Funding is available for capital projects and items that relate to or connect New Zealanders to the 2021 America’s Cup.

A new Lottery Distribution Committee, responsible for making decisions on applications to the Fund, has also been appointed.

The newly appointed members have knowledge and experience from a range of different areas as well as being experienced Lottery Committee members. Katie Noble and Richard Pamatatau have knowledge of Auckland communities’ networks and needs, while Arihia Tuoro and Garth Clarricoat have experience of national funding.  Ms Noble has been appointed as the Chair of the Committee.

“Lottery distribution committees make a major contribution to communities across the country. The appointees bring a wealth of knowledge, experience and community connections,” Minister Martin says.

The first decision meeting of the Committee will be held in mid-December 2018.
