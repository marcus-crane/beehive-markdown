Police Minister Stuart Nash says the seizure of 190 kilograms of cocaine in Auckland demonstrates the strength of partnership between Australian and New Zealand law enforcement agencies in preventing the harm drugs cause in our communities.

“Targeting transnational organised crime is a priority for the Government,” Mr Nash says.

“The Government’s unprecedented investment in Police in Budget 2018 supports the deployment of 500 extra Police officers to disrupt, deter and dismantle organised criminal networks and reduce harm in our communities. The Budget also funded 127 extra Customs staff.

“Drugs like cocaine cause harm and fuel organised crime networks. I would like to congratulate Australian Federal Police, New Zealand Police and New Zealand Customs staff for their great work in preventing these drugs reaching their destination.

“This operation highlights the key role New Zealand plays internationally in disrupting transnational criminal networks.

“It also showcases the fantastic work Customs and Police staff are doing every day to protect and keep our communities safe.”

Minister of Customs Hon Kris Faafoi said he was pleased to see the focus on consignments transhipping through New Zealand had been effective.

“Additional funding this Government provided in 2018 is aimed at disrupting drugs earlier in the supply chain to prevent harm to the community - this seizure has stopped what would have been a very significant amount of harm.

“This is a good example of what we can achieve when police, border and overseas agencies work together.”
