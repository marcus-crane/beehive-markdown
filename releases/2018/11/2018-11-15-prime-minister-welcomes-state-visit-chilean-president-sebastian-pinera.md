The President of the Republic of Chile, His Excellency Sebastián Piñera, will visit New Zealand on 19 November 2018, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“I am very much looking forward to welcoming President Piñera on his first state visit to New Zealand,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Chile is one of our closest and oldest partners in Latin America and we share many of the same values and interests. President Piñera’s visit provides us with an excellent opportunity to discuss the areas where we can strengthen our relationship.                   

“Chile is a long-standing partner for New Zealand on regional trade initiatives, dating back to the ‘P3’ trade negotiations with Singapore which became the foundation for the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

“Chile has also been a strong supporter of New Zealand’s goal to have closer engagement with Latin America including through negotiating a free trade agreement with the Pacific Alliance” 

“New Zealand and Chile work closely together in the Asia-Pacific region as APEC members. We both support the international rules-based system, as well as promoting trade that benefits all our citizens, including women and indigenous people,” Jacinda Ardern said.

President Piñera’s programme includes a business roundtable engagement, a wreath laying ceremony and tour of Auckland War Memorial Museum, a ceremony of welcome and a state lunch hosted by Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy at Government House and a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition.

Jacinda Ardern will be joined by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters, and Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker for the high-level discussions with President Piñera, Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero and Vice-Minister of Trade Rodrigo Yáñez.

Prime Minister Ardern first met President Piñera in New York in September 2018.
