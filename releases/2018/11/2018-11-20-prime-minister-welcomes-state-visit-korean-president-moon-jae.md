The President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in will visit New Zealand from 2 to 4 December, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“I am very much looking forward to welcoming President Moon to New Zealand,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“I met with President Moon on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit and APEC last week and he expressed how much he was looking forward to coming back to New Zealand following visits here in 2006 and 2015.

“Our governments have much in common, not just in terms of the international outlook, but also on the domestic policy front where we will be looking to exchange views and experiences. 

“Our long-standing ties were forged in the Korean War. President Moon’s visit is an opportunity to reaffirm the strength and mutual benefit of the New Zealand-Korea relationship.

“Korea is New Zealand’s fifth largest goods trading partner and an important source of high-quality investment. We work together in Antarctica, co-produce films and collaborate on innovative science and technology. New Zealand is also home to a vibrant Korean community, with more Koreans visiting New Zealand every year.

“We share a commitment to maintaining peace, prosperity and stability in our region. In particular, New Zealand welcomes the Republic of Korea’s efforts towards resolving the long-standing challenges on the Korean Peninsula.”                                   

Jacinda Ardern will be joined by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters for the high-level discussions with President Moon.

President Moon’s programme also includes a ceremony of welcome and a state lunch hosted by Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy at Government House, a wreath laying ceremony and tour of Auckland War Memorial Museum and an engagement with the Korean community in Auckland.
