Long standing problems with buildings and infrastructure at Middlemore Hospital and the Manukau SuperClinic will be fixed following an $80 million investment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“Improving access to high quality health services provided in world-class facilities is a priority for the Coalition Government,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“The people and staff of Counties Manukau District Health Board deserve quality facilities that are in a good state of repair.

“Problems with leaky buildings, including rot and mould in the walls, and earthquake prone facilities are all symptoms of years of neglect and underinvestment.

“We are tackling that with an $80 million investment which will make a real difference to patients and their families and to staff working at the frontline.

“Improving the state of our hospitals is a priority. In our first Budget $750 million of new funding was set aside for capital works – with today’s $80 million dollar investment we have allocated well over $600 million of that to key projects.”

Health Minister David Clark said today’s announcement was a welcome step in what would be an ongoing process of renewing Middlemore and other DHB facilities.

“This funding means Counties Manukau DHB can plan with certainty and develop business cases for four important projects:”

- Re-cladding the Kidz First Building, as part of an ongoing phased approach to re-cladding clinical buildings at CMDHB
- Relocating the radiology department from the aging Galbraith building to the Harley Gray building
- Establishing a radiology hub at the Manukau SuperClinic site (currently patients have to be transferred to Middlemore for CT and MRI services)
- Critical infrastructure work at the Manukau SuperClinic including new plant room/substations, IT, medical gases and parking – all needed to support expansion of clinical services in the short to medium term

“These projects will significantly improve the standard of key facilities. They will also help Counties Manukau DHB better handle a growing population with some of the most challenging health needs in New Zealand.

“Upgrading and repairing hospital facilities is no small task. It requires careful planning to minimise disruption to patients and staff while maintaining services throughout.

“In the end, though, this is about delivering the quality facilities and services that people need and deserve. This is a Government committed to that task,” said David Clark.
