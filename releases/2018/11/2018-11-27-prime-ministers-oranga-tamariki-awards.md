The first Prime Minister’s Oranga Tamariki Awards for exceptional young people in state care will be presented at a ceremony in Parliament next week, Children’s Minister Tracey Martin announced today.

“For the last 12 years, Oranga Tamariki and its predecessors have been holding what have been called the William Wallace Awards to mark the bequest he made to care-experienced young people,” Minister Martin said.

“It was a very generous gift that has seen the awards grow in profile and reach and it is timely that they are now endorsed by the Prime Minister.

“We want the young people to know that their effort and success is recognised at the highest level and to gain as much support as possible for the awards.

 “The new name recognises the mana of care-experienced young people, who have overcome a challenging start in life to demonstrate huge potential for the future and reflects the Government’s commitment to young people in care.”

The Minister said that the awards have been expanded this year to include a trial of tailored work or life experience opportunities for some of the winners along with the monetary scholarships. Two William Wallace Awards will remain part of the ceremony.

“More New Zealanders need to see the success of care experienced young people and that’s what these awards will show. The awards highlight the potential all of our young people have.”

The 20 winners of the inaugural Prime Minister’s Oranga Tamariki Awards will be announced at a ceremony in Parliament’s Grand Hall at 3pm on Tuesday December 4.
