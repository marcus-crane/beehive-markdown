Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has commenced the process to appoint New Zealand’s next Chief Justice to replace Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias, who retires in March 2019.  

Under s 100(2) of the Senior Courts Act 2016 the Governor-General appoints the Chief Justice, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.  

While there is no statutory process for this appointment, the Prime Minister has put in place a process outlined below to assist her in this role. 

The process is led by the Solicitor-General Una Jagose QC in order to determine suitable candidates for consideration against agreed criteria, listed below, and then produce a shortlist for submission to the Prime Minister.  

Jacinda Ardern will then consult the outgoing Chief Justice before making her recommendation to Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy. 

“Given the significance of the role of Chief Justice in New Zealand’s constitutional order, it is important that the appointment process is conducted against transparent criteria,” Jacinda Ardern said.  

“This is also important because this is the first ever appointment of the head of New Zealand’s final appellate court.” 

Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias was appointed in 1999. At that time the Privy Council was at the apex of New Zealand’s court structure. That changed in 2004, when the Supreme Court was formed. The legislation establishing the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court Act 2003, brought to an end appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from decisions of New Zealand courts. 

The appointment process is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. If it is not completed by the time the present Chief Justice retires the Senior Courts Act provides that the most senior available Judge of the Supreme Court is authorised to act as Chief Justice. 

***Editors’ note:***  

*Dame Sian Elias was appointed the Chief Justice in 1999 on the retirement of Sir Thomas Eichelbaum. She is due to retire on 12 March 2019.*

*The appointment of the new Chief Justice will be the first appointment made as head of the Supreme Court.* 

## Summary of process for appointment of Chief Justice
