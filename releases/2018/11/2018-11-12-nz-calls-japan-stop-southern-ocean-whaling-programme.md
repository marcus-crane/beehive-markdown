Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says Japan’s decision to continue its Southern Ocean whaling programme goes against scientific advice and the growing support for greater protection of the ocean’s ecosystems.

 Japan’s Fisheries Agency announced on 12 November that the Japanese whaling fleet had departed Japan for the Southern Ocean.

 “New Zealand is deeply disappointed that whaling continues in the Southern Ocean despite the significant scientific advice against this outdated and unnecessary practice,” Mr Peters says.

“It’s difficult to understand when Japan has so much to offer the world it would compromise its potential for goodwill with such an outdated practice.

 “Now is the time to increase protection of pristine Antarctic ecosystems. We must stop the killing of whales in the name of science,” Mr Peters says.
