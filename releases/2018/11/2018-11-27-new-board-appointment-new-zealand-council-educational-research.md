Dr Jodie Hunter has been appointed to the Board of the New Zealand Council for Educational Research (NZCER), Associate Minister of Education Jenny Salesa announced today.

Dr Jodie Hunter is a Senior Lecturer at Massey University’s Institute of Education. Her research covers the areas of mathematics, education and Pacific education. She is also a member of the Ministerial Advisory Group developing a 10-year Strategic Plan for Early Learning.

“Dr Hunter’s research with her mother, Professor Roberta Hunter, is at the forefront of current work on culturally responsive teaching approaches that reflect identity, language and culture whilst building strong partnerships with parents and communities. This research has received international recognition.

“I am delighted to welcome Dr Hunter to the Board. She brings valued experience and a unique perspective to the role,” said Jenny Salesa.

“I also want to acknowledge and thank the previous appointee, Pania Gray, whose governance expertise has added significant value to the Board over the last four years.”
