Education Minister Chris Hipkins has wished students well on the eve of NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship exams.

“I want to congratulate students for all their hard work in preparing for their external exams and wish them the best for the coming weeks,” Chris Hipkins said.

More than 140,000 students will participate in 120 exams this year, which begin tomorrow and continue until 30 November.

“This is an important time of year for students and encouragement from whānau will assist students with focusing on exams.

“This year, more than 46,000 students will simultaneously sit the Level 1 English exam on 12 November, making it the single largest sitting day of the three and a half week exam period.

“A huge amount of preparation goes into planning for these exams, to ensure that all 140,000 students have the very best opportunity to succeed.”

Chris Hipkins said that around 8,000 students are entered for digital pilot NCEA exams online.

“For the first time this year online exams will include Level 3 English, Media Studies and Classical Studies. Previously these subjects have only been available digitally at NCEA Level 1 and Level 2.

“Every year the number of students participating in online exams grows. Taking exams online improves the relevance of assessment and better reflects how students will use their skills and knowledge,”  Chris Hipkins said.
