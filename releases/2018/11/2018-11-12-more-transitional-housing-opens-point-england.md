A new transitional housing development, which opened in Point England today, will provide much needed transitional housing for around 28 families each year, says Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development Jenny Salesa.

“Transitional housing is a critical part of the support the Government offers to those with an urgent housing need,” Jenny Salesa said.

“The number of people asking for housing support continues to rise and transitional housing provides an immediate warm, dry and safe place to stay for around 12 weeks, or more if needed.

The Point England property was purchased by Island Child Charitable Trust (ICCT), with Government support. ICCT is a non-profit organisation that provides a range of social services, such as transitional housing, social counselling and advocacy, as well as health and youth programmes in Auckland.

“Transitional housing providers, like ICCT, don’t just give tenants a place to stay, they also offer support to families which can be life-changing.

“Families are supported to find a long-term home and also address issues that may be standing in their way.

“While transitional housing is important, we know more public housing is needed.  This Government has committed to 6,400 more public houses over the next four years.

“While we work to bring on the long-term supply, our priority is that all New Zealanders have access to somewhere warm, dry and safe to live, and are not sleeping rough,” Jenny Salesa said.

The Point England transitional housing development consists of five homes, which can support up to seven families at any given time.
