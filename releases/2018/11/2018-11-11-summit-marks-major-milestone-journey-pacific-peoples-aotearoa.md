More than 350 Pacific leaders will gather at Eden Park tomorrow for a major Summit to refresh the shared vision for Pacific peoples in Aotearoa. 

The Pacific Aotearoa Summit will refresh the Pacific Vision set in 1999 as a result of a four month Talanoa process with 2,500 Pacific peoples about their concerns and hopes and aspirations for the future. The Summit will launch a Reflections Report compiled by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples which captures community feedback from the Talanoa sessions, and a report from The Treasury, *The New Zealand Pacific Economy* which puts a monetary value on Pacific people’s contribution to New Zealand’s economy.

“Our Pacific communities in Aotearoa have changed markedly since the dawn of the new millennium, with the majority now born in New Zealand,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

“The future for Aotearoa is a Pacific one, with Pacific people the fastest growing and youngest population in New Zealand. They will play a key role in shaping the future of our communities and our economy, so it’s vital we take steps now to ensure Pacific communities can overcome barriers to reach their full potential.

“We’ll get a chance to profile and acknowledge community innovation, the pioneering efforts, creativity and successes of Pacific people who are leading in their various fields and on an international stage.

Guest speakers for the Summit include UK-based Masterchef Monica Galetti, Microsoft PowerPoint Champion of the World Tristan Mona, and winner of the Air New Zealand Leadership Inspiration Award at the 2018 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards Asena Tolungamaka.

“This Summit is about empowering Pacific communities to drive innovative change in our priority areas of Pacific languages, cultures and identities, economic development and income, health and wellbeing and youth.

“Over the next two years the Government will work closely with Pacific communities to co-design solutions to the challenges Pacific communities face.

“I look forward to seeing the progress of Pacific Aotearoa and the Summit will make in helping us achieve vibrant, prosperous and resilient Pacific communities,” says Aupito William Sio.
