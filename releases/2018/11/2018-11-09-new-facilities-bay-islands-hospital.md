Health Minister Dr David Clark says a new outpatients and primary care facility at the Bay of Islands Hospital at Kawakawa will give people better access to the range of services they need.

The Government is investing $7.1 million in Phase 2 of the hospital’s redevelopment which will see a new outpatients and primary care facility built next to the Acute Medical Building that was opened in September this year.

“This is an exciting development for the people of the Bay of Islands. Having GPs and other primary care clinicians on site will mean locals can more easily get the most appropriate care and treatment.

“As Health Minister I have often spoken about the challenges we face in the health system and the need to change how we deliver services to those in most need. Making the most of primary care is a key part of this. 

“I understand that Ngāti Hine Health Trust intend to provide primary health care with GPs operating from the new facility. I welcome their involvement and their commitment to improving health outcomes for their people - this is exactly the sort of local collaboration that we need to see.”

The Phase 2 redevelopment is designed to deliver a patient-centred and integrated model of care that is sensitive to the needs of the individuals and their whānau, and enables access to health services in a culturally appropriate community setting.

Northland DHB will move the outpatients services currently located in the older parts of the hospital into the new state of the art facility and will continue its partnership with Ngāti Hine Health Trust to develop new models of care for the Bay of Islands community. The location of renal services, which are currently in the old hospital, is also being reviewed.

“Health statistics tell us that we have a lot of work to do to improve outcomes for the people of the North. This development is a clear signal that the Government is committed to doing just that,” David Clark says.

The Phase 2 project will complete the redevelopment of Bay of Islands Hospital.
