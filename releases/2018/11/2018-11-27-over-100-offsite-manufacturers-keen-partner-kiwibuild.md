The KiwiBuild Unit has received 102 responses for its Invitation to Pitch for offsite manufacturers, Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford announced today.

KiwiBuild’s Invitation to Pitch for Offsite Manufacturing has closed. It asked companies involved in offsite manufacturing to propose ways they could help KiwiBuild boost New Zealand’s housing supply, increase productivity and build affordable homes for first home buyers.

Phil Twyford said innovative offsite manufacturing is a key part of the KiwiBuild plan to enable innovation and scale to drive a real-step change in the availability, quality and price of housing.

“KiwiBuild is not only about tackling the housing crisis and restoring the kiwi dream of homeownership to young families. It’s also about transforming how we build homes to reduce construction costs, deliver consistent high quality design, increase capacity of the construction sector, and get homes completed faster.

“Offsite manufacturing firms from across New Zealand and around the world have put forward their ideas to help us do that. The KiwiBuild Unit will now work through the proposals from the companies.

“There is a real opportunity to leverage the procurement power of Government, and the certainty of KiwiBuild’s targets, to incentivise offsite manufacturers to come up with new ideas and to commit to the New Zealand market.

“The offsite manufacturing procurement process will take time. In the meantime, KiwiBuild is building affordable, starter homes for first home buyers. It’s doing this through underwriting eligible new developments, making land available for development and integrating affordable housing into major urban development projects,” Phil Twyford said.
