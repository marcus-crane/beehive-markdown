Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Kris Faafoi says a new diploma will help address the shortage of cyber security professionals.

“This level six qualification will give students the technical skills needed for entry-level roles in cyber security,” Mr Faafoi said. “Cyber security is a diverse and interesting career and this is a great pathway for young Kiwis to enter this in-demand profession or to start further study.”

The idea of a Level 6 Diploma came from the Cyber Security Skills Taskforce, in response to industry demand for junior cyber security workers that could be trained more quickly than with a traditional degree course.

The diploma was developed by cyber security experts convened by NZQA and the New Zealand Institute of IT Professionals.

“Effective cyber security is essential across government, the private sector and for individuals,” Mr Faafoi said. “We need to ensure we have the workforce to support our digital economy and enable all New Zealanders to thrive online.

“This type of qualification is a win-win – we get Kiwis into a rich and rewarding career and develop a strong and capable cyber security workforce in New Zealand.

“If New Zealand is to keep itself secure, we need more New Zealanders to become skilled to work in the cyber security sector. This could also be a growth export service, if New Zealand puts effort into this area.”

Students will be able to register for the new qualification in 2019. Further information is available at [NZQA](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nzqf/search/viewQualification.do?selectedItemKey=3837).

A 2018 report by (ISC)² estimated the global cyber security workforce gap at 3 million people, and growing the New Zealand cyber security industry means that security keeps pace with the digitisation of the economy.
