“The Pacific Aotearoa Summit signals a fresh start filled with hope and confidence that we can lift the wellbeing of Pacific peoples by working across government agencies and community organisations,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

“It is the start of new conversations about how Pacific peoples who call Aotearoa-New Zealand their home, can live prosperous, healthy and vibrant lives.

Staged at Auckland’s Eden Park on November 13, the Summit was attended by approximately 450 central and local government representatives, and community leaders after 12 months of organising and community engagements throughout New Zealand.

The Summit has refreshed the Pacific Vision set in 1999 by capturing the hopes and aspirations of over 2,500 Pacific peoples from across New Zealand.

The *[Lalanga Fou](https://www.pacificaotearoa.org.nz/about-us)* report was launched at the Summit revealing raw feedback and data from the community which was grouped into four key areas of priority which require action.

- Thriving Pacific languages, cultures and identities
- Prosperous Pacific communities
- Resilient and healthy Pacific peoples
- Confident, thriving and resilient Pacific young people

*“Lalanga Fou* doesn’t provide all the answers to solving the challenges of inequities and barriers faced by many in the Pacific communities, but it will spark debate and encourage action from a range of government agencies, local government and community organisations.

Through engagements with Pacific communities a refreshed Pacific Vision has been set:

***Pacific values are our anchor, with each generation weaving the foundations for the next to stand on. Pacific communities are innovative leaders within Aotearoa, the Pacific region and the world. We are confident in our endeavours, we are a thriving, resilient and prosperous Pacific Aotearoa.***

“This Vision Statement will be a credible guide to informing anyone who wants to work with Pacific communities about Pacific values and strengths as the starting point for engagements and building strong working relationships, in order to be effective in a Pacific community setting.

“Over the next year the Ministry for Pacific Peoples will work alongside other government agencies, partners and stakeholders, to ensure we can invest and pilot new ideas and initiatives aimed at lifting community wellbeing.

“The new Pacific vision will inspire our young people to realise their fullest potential of becoming modern-day navigators and explorers, creators and innovators.

“They are already leading the way into new areas, new horizons, and are so accepting of diversity they give me a renewed confidence in our future as Pacific Aotearoa.

“The Summit has helped to renew calls for Pacific leaders to leave a legacy for the next generation to ensure no one gets left behind as we move forward with our plans to lift the wellbeing of our communities and really thrive.

At the Summit, the Minister of Finance Grant Robertson also launched *[The New Zealand Pacific Economy Report,](https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/tp/new-zealand-pacific-economy)* produced by Treasury which highlighted Pacific people contributed $8 billion to New Zealand’s economy.

“It is a good foundation to build upon to better understand Pacific people’s significant economic contribution to New Zealand society, and Pacific people’s perspective on wealth, prosperity and wellbeing.

“Just imagine how much more Pacific peoples can contribute to New Zealand society if we could eliminate the barriers and disparities Pacific peoples face in housing, health, education and employment and the negative stereotypes.

“I really believe that when we can lift the general wellbeing of Pacific peoples, we will also be lifting the general wellbeing of all New Zealanders because of our connectedness with one another.

I am encouraged by the new Pacific Vision set by the community and this is only a starting point as we strive for better outcomes and opportunities for Pacific people in New Zealand,” says Aupito William Sio.
