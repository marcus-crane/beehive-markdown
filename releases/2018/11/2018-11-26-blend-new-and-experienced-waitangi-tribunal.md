Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has announced the appointment of eight men and women to the Waitangi Tribunal, three members who are new and five who have been re-appointed.

“This blend of new energy and experience will help us make progress while keeping the waka steady,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Ruakere Hond, Kim Ngarimu and Prue Kapua have been announced as the three new Tribunal members. All have been appointed for three years.

Nanaia Mahuta said they bring collective expertise across the fields of language revitalisation, governance, women’s and children’s issues, the environment, public sector, community leadership and Treaty of Waitangi expertise.

“They have already contributed so much to Aotearoa New Zealand. The Tribunal will benefit greatly from their skills as it embarks upon significant kaupapa in the coming months.”

Dr Angela Ballara, Dr Monty Soutar, Ronald Crosby, Tania Simpson and Professor Pou Temara have been reappointed to the Waitangi Tribunal.

This group collectively holds extensive expertise in history, tikanga, reo, law, business and public policy.

The nature of the claims coming to the Tribunal are now changing from historical issues (pre-1992) to more contemporary claims (post-1992).

“As I consider the people who will hear these claims on behalf of New Zealand, I take very seriously the mix of expertise, mātauranga and perspective they each bring.

“It is critical that we keep focused as we enter a period of change. I sincerely believe these eight men and women will play a vital role in achieving that,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
