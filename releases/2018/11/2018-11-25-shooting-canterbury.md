The Minister of Police has offered his sympathies to the family of the man shot during an Armed Offenders Squad callout in Darfield. He is also extending his best wishes and hopes for a speedy recovery to the Police officer who sustained serious injuries.

“This is still an active Police investigation and I will refrain from further comment on the specifics of the incident,” Mr Nash said. “However my condolences go to the family of the man who has died.”

“I also want to acknowledge the impact this will have on the officer who was seriously hurt. He has suffered a traumatic injury while responding to a fast-moving and dangerous incident where the public reported shots had been fired. He will take some time to recover and Police will offer whatever support they can to ensure his full recuperation.

“It’s important to recognise the effect this event will have on other Police and emergency service personnel who responded, and for the small community around Darfield.

“Community safety is of paramount concern and our emergency services go to work every day to help prevent crime and make communities safe. All of those affected by this event should take advantage of the assistance available to them to help deal with what they have experienced,” Mr Nash said.
