Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today signed an air services agreement with his Peruvian counterpart, Néstor Popolizio, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Week in Port Moresby.

The agreement sets out conditions under which air services may be operated between New Zealand and Peru, including routes that can be flown and capacity (frequency and aircraft types) that may be offered.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Peru is going from strength to strength, including with Peru’s plans to reopen its Embassy in Wellington next year,” Mr Peters says.

“New Zealanders are increasingly looking to Latin America as a travel destination, and this agreement means Peru will become even more accessible.”

New Zealand and Peru will strengthen trade and economic ties when Peru ratifies the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Peru has also supported New Zealand’s goal to have a free trade agreement with the Pacific Alliance.

New Zealand and Peru have a strong record of working together on global issues, such as the environment, climate change, disarmament, agricultural reform, and trade liberalisation.

“This air services agreement marks an important milestone, as New Zealand now has air services agreements in place with all 20 of its APEC partners. These agreements pave the way for flights and code-share services that open up New Zealand’s access across the Asia-Pacific region.

“Having air services agreements in place with all our APEC partners helps to remove barriers to travel, and paves the way for stronger links between New Zealand and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr Peters says.
