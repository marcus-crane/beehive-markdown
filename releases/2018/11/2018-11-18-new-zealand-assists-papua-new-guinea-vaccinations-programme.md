Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced that New Zealand is committing up to NZ$10 million towards improving vaccination outcomes in Papua New Guinea.

Mr Peters made the announcement during the official opening of the St John Ambulance Operations Centre in Boroko, which was built with the support of New Zealand Government funding.

“The current polio outbreak in PNG is a tragedy for those children and families who have been affected. Back in New Zealand it highlighted for us the very real risks that exist for children who are not able to receive the appropriate vaccinations that protect them from serious and life-threatening illnesses,” Mr Peters said.

“We are pleased to be working with the Papua New Guinea Department of Health and Australia on this programme to ensure that children across PNG have access to life-saving vaccinations. 

“Investing in vaccination is one of the most effective investments in economic growth and human development that a country can make. New Zealand is committing to work together with PNG, and other donors particularly Australia, to strengthen local health systems in PNG to lift immunisation rates,” Mr Peters said.
