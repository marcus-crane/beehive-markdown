Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis today welcomes the launch of *Tiaki – Care for New Zealand*, an industry-led initiative that encourages kiwis and international visitors to act as guardians of New Zealand.

The initiative is a result of cross-sector collaboration, including public and private sector tourism organisations who have proactively come together to encourage positive visitor behaviour.

“Tiaki – Care for New Zealand and the Tiaki Promise is about the importance of our home, our place and people, and how we all have a responsibility to look after it,” Kelvin Davis said.

“New Zealanders have a unique connection to our home, and we have a collective duty to care for our country. Tiaki – Care for New Zealand is about helping everyone, including our visitors, feel that same sense of guardianship. Together, we can protect the things that make New Zealand special and help ensure they last for future generations.

“Tiaki will also mean people can safely enjoy what New Zealand has to offer, by driving carefully and properly preparing for our amazing great walks.”

“As Tourism Minister I have been encouraging collaboration across central and local government, industry and the private sector. It is the only way that we as a country can ensure that New Zealand continues to benefit from tourism. Tiaki – Care for New Zealand is the result of this kind of collaboration.

“Tiaki – Care for New Zealand is a great example of what can happen when we work together as an industry, and I congratulate everyone who has been involved in this initiative.

“I look forward to seeing New Zealanders and visitors standing behind the principles of Tiaki, acting as guardians of our place and people, and being safe and responsible while they travel around Aotearoa,” Kelvin Davis said.
