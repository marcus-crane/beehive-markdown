Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Domestic and Sexual Violence issues) Jan Logie has spoken in support of White Ribbon’s campaign launch in Auckland today and calls on all men to do their part to end family violence and sexual violence in New Zealand.

“White Ribbon is a call to action for men, urging respectful relationships with women and inviting men to take the pledge to always stand up, speak out and act to prevent all forms of violence against women,” says Jan Logie.

“This campaign comes as the Government is making significant moves to improve our response to family violence and sexual violence. It’s an important time for New Zealanders to get involved.

“Men engaging in cultural change is essential to preventing and reducing violence. Community-driven approaches play a critical role in showing how all New Zealanders can be part of the solution to family violence and sexual violence.”

People can get involved in White Ribbon by visiting the website ([https://whiteribbon.org.nz/](https://whiteribbon.org.nz/)) to find local community events to attend, access a range of tools and take the pledge. People who take the pledge will then receive information about eight key actions that will make a difference:  

- Listening and believing women
- Reflecting on and changing their behaviour
- Disrupting other men’s violence towards women
- Treating women as equals
- Choose how to be a man and how I will act
- Talk to a young man about breaking out of the “Man Box”
- Think about what they watch and the media they use
- Talk with young men about respectful relationships and pornography

“I look forward to seeing the White Ribbon campaign roll out over the next few weeks, and joining events in my local community in Porirua on 25 November. Together we will end this violence,” says Jan Logie.
