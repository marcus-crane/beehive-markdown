“Key Pacific organisations who are leading community change and Pacific innovation have all come on-board for the Pacific Aotearoa Vision Summit to be held on November 13,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

The Ministry for Pacific Peoples have been working in partnership with the Pacific Business Trust, Pasifika Futures, Pasifika Education Centre and Pacific Media Network to capture a collective vision to fully realize the potential of Pacific peoples in Aotearoa.

“These organisations are community pillars to our Pacific communities and have a vital role to play in ensuring we achieve general well-being for Pacific peoples throughout New Zealand.

“The four organisations are charged to become agents of change and thought leaders in their respective fields. They share our vision to fully realise the potential of Pacific people in Aotearoa.

“Our Summit is about empowering Pacific communities to drive innovative change in our priority areas of Pacific languages, cultures and identities, economic development and income, health and wellbeing, and youth.

“Our key partners will lead Summit workshops focussed on key priority areas identified through a four month community engagement Talanoa process the Ministry for Pacific Peoples undertook, and will facilitate discussions on how community and government can better work together for the benefit of the wider community.

“We’ve had strong interest in the Summit, with more than 350 Pacific community leaders expected to attend.

“The Summit is a significant milestone in our journey as Pacific Aotearoa and I look forward to launching the refreshed Pacific Vision to reflect where we have come from and our hopes and aspirations for the future,” says Aupito William Sio.
