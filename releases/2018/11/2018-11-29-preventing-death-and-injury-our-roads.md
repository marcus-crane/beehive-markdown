Police Minister Stuart Nash and Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter are encouraging road users to be alert to a new safety campaign launched today by Police and the NZ Transport Agency in the lead up to the Christmas.

“Too many people are dying on our roads and we want to support our agencies in getting the message out to drivers and riders to be safe,” says Mr Nash.

“However, everyone using the road needs to take responsibility. It’s up to all of us drive to the conditions and to not treat the speed limit as a suggestion. Everybody needs to pay attention to what they’re doing and when you’re socialising over summer, don’t drink and drive.”

Today Police and the NZTA kicked off the summer season with their [annual impairment prevention operatio](http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/choose-safety-our-roads)[n](http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/choose-safety-our-roads), which will be followed by a Police social media campaign focusing on the four main contributors of trauma on our roads. These are people not wearing seatbelts, driving too fast for the conditions, driving drunk, drugged, or tired, and being distracted by things like cell phones.

Ms Genter says reducing the number of deaths and serious accidents on our roads is her top priority as the Associate Minister of Transport.

“These crashes impact families and communities across New Zealand,’’ she says. “I don’t want to see more people facing the festive season without their loved ones.’’

“Police will be out on the roads working hard to keep everyone safe. But they can’t do it alone. We all need to be responsible every time we get behind the wheel.”

Mr Nash and Ms Genter say the summer campaign by Police and NZTA has a simple and clear message: drive safely.
