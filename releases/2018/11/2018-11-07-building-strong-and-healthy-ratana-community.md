The Rātana Pā community is one step closer to making its aspirations a reality with an investment of up to $1.9 million towards housing infrastructure, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the Minister for Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta announced today.

“The $1.9 million investment will support the development of 26 sections on Māori freehold land for whānau to build on, and live in new homes,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Today’s announcement is consistent with the Government’s priority to build strong and healthy communities, not just houses.

“This is just the start - phase two of the investment will see $1.7 million invested in the future to develop a further 34 sections.”

The Rātana community is one of the largest Māori religious movements in Aotearoa and tomorrow marks 100 years since prophet Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana received the vision that began the movement.

Followers all over New Zealand are gathering at Rātana for the centenary celebrations.

“At the heart of this investment is partnership. It builds on the knowledge that communities and whānau are best placed to determine how to achieve their aspirations,” said Jacinda Ardern.

Te Puni Kōkiri will lead the Government’s partnership and investment of $1.9 million towards the development of housing infrastructure for Rātana. Construction work will begin in late 2019.

“We’re excited to be helping realise the goals of the Rātana Housing Strategy that was developed in 2009. This investment will mean the whole community will benefit from the training and employment opportunity it offers,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“This stage focuses on the development of the new subdivision and stage two should see a further 34 sections. This will mean a lot to those whānau that the Rātana Ahuwhenua Trust has been working alongside and is a very good example of using Māori freehold land to benefit whanau.”
