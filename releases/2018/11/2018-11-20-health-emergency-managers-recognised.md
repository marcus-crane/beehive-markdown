Long serving emergency managers in the health sector have been recognised by Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi at the Health Emergency Managers Forum today.

Mr Faafoi presented Civil Defence Emergency Management Long Service Awards to a number of emergency managers who have 10 years’ of active service in New Zealand.

“Health is an integral part of the Emergency Management System as both a lead and support agency,” Mr Faafoi said.

“Almost every hazard and risk we face in New Zealand will have a human health consequence.

“At the local level, these emergency managers work within their agency across services and departments to ensure a consistent, timely and effective response to emergencies as well as working closely with partner agencies in their Civil Defence Emergency Management Group.

“Emergency Management attracts dedicated and talented people, and today’s Long Service Award recipients are representative of the commitment we see right across the sector.”

- Charles Blanch, Director Emergency Management, Ministry of Health.
- Martin Buet, Regional Emergency Management Advisor, Ministry of Health.
- Tim Chiswell, Emergency Management Advisor South Island, St John Ambulance.
