The draft *Aotearoa-New Zealand Government Tourism* *Strategy* is an important step in ensuring that all New Zealanders benefit from productive, sustainable and inclusive tourism growth, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis and Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage announced today.

The Government also announced the next steps on how the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy will be invested to support implementation of the strategy.

“Tourism is a huge contributor to New Zealand’s economic success and we need to continue to ensure we get the best from tourism growth for our country and people, while managing the challenges that come with it,” Kelvin Davis said. 

“This strategy proposes a more co-ordinated and active role for government in tourism, to make sure growth is productive, sustainable and inclusive -  improving New Zealanders’ lives and supporting thriving and sustainable regions.

Eugenie Sage said that sustainability is central to this strategy.

“We know our natural and cultural wonders are a major drawcard, and we want to see tourism help maintain and restore our unique natural, cultural and historic heritage,*”* Eugenie Sage said.

“I urge everyone to have their say on this strategy.”

The Government has also announced that the revenue collected from the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy will be split 50:50 between conservation and tourism to help drive the outcomes of the strategy. 

“The International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy is one tool that will help achieve our tourism goals, while protecting and enhancing our natural environment,” Kelvin Davis said.

The Government will develop an investment plan, with input from key conservation and tourism stakeholders.

“We will use the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy to protect the things that make New Zealand special, and to make sure it remains a great place to visit,” Eugenie Sage said.

Engagement on the draft Tourism Strategy closes at 5pm, 04 February 2019.
