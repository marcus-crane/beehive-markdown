Health Minister Dr David Clark says the Government has committed $45.6m to Wellington’s new state of the art children’s hospital – a project fast tracked by a $50m donation by businessman Mark Dunajtschik.

David Clark announced the funding at a mauri stone laying ceremony today to mark the start of construction.

“The Government wants to make New Zealand the best place in the world to be a child and health services and facilities like this new hospital play a vital role in delivering this vision,” David Clark said.

“The current hospital is almost 30 years old with services located in different parts of the regional hospital. This is not ideal for children or families who are already going through a stressful time, nor for hospital staff who want to provide the best service for their patients.

“This new, purpose-built hospital will provide these services under one roof. It has been designed with children and their whānau at the centre while allowing for the provision of high quality services, as well as encouraging clinical collaboration and communication.”

Capital and Coast DHB’s plans for a new children’s hospital to replace the current facilities were brought forward last year following the announcement of Mr Dunajtschik’s donation.

“International evidence shows that health systems with a strong publically funded core deliver the best health outcomes for all. I acknowledge that those outcomes are improved further with the incredibly generous support of New Zealanders like Mark Dunajtschik,” David Clark said.

The Government’s contribution to the new hospital is the latest investment from the $750m for health sector capital investment allocated in Budget 2018.

**Background:** The new hospital will be spread across three floors, will 50 beds and 21 clinic rooms, situated at the northern end of the Wellington campus, connected by a link bridge to the main hospital. There will be features to support patient care and manage risks, such as infection control.  These include, beds that fold out alongside the patient's bed to allow parents to stay with their children.  There will be more ensuite bathrooms, and a greater number of single bedrooms.

The new hospital will have the most modern fit-out and state-of-the-art equipment – thanks in large part to the fundraising efforts of the Wellington Hospitals Foundation. It is scheduled to open by early 2021.
