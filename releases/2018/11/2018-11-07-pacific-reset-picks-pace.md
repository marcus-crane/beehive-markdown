Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced the establishment of a $10 million Pacific Enabling Fund.

“The Coalition Government is committed to rebuilding New Zealand’s standing in the Pacific, supporting our Pacific partners, and continuing to deliver on our Pacific Reset priorities,” Mr Peters said.

The fund will allow engagement with Pacific partners on a diverse range of activities which sit outside our formal aid funding arrangements, such as cultural and sporting diplomacy, people to people links, and some military cooperation activities. 

 “This initiative will be funded from within the increased resource for MFAT announced in Budget 2018, and build on the momentum generated by the Pacific Reset and our development programme,” said Mr Peters.

“As well, Ministry of Foreign Affairs is increasing the number of offshore staff in the post in Pacific over the next two years.

 “This will result in a significant increase to our diplomatic and development footprint in the Pacific and which will reaffirm our commitment to a region of serious strategic significance to New Zealand.

“Further announcements on the detail of this increase in staffing at our posts will be made this year, following discussions with partner countries,” he said.
