Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, will travel to Singapore and China this week for climate change discussions with regional Ministerial counterparts.

Mr Shaw will deliver a presentation to the Clean Environment Leaders’ Summit at the invitation of Singapore’s Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Masagos Zulkifli.

He will then visit China at the invitation of the Minister of Ecology and Environment, Li Ganjie, for the second New Zealand China Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Change Cooperation.

“This trip presents an opportunity for New Zealand to deepen cooperation with China, Singapore and the wider Asia-Pacific region in an important area of mutual interest,” James Shaw says.

“Both China and Singapore are active on climate change and focused on the transition to a sustainable future.  

“In Singapore, I’m going to speak about the work we have underway, such as the Zero Carbon Bill and how we’re planning for a just transition to a net zero emissions, sustainable economy by 2050.

“I also want to learn what Singapore and others are doing to build sustainable cities and economies. 

“My discussions with China will include how we can work together on ways to reduce emissions and implement the Paris Agreement.” 

Mr Shaw will also discuss what can be done to get a strong outcome at the United Nations Climate Change meeting in December. 

“It’s about enabling the Paris Agreement to do its job and set the world on the path to a stable climate,” Mr Shaw says.

 He will be travelling from 8-14 July.
