The Government is establishing a contestable fund for providers to train digital skills in homes, says Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Associate Education Minister Tracey Martin.

“The Coalition has agreed to set aside up to $1.0 million this financial year for providers to undertake programmes to promote digital skills,” Chris Hipkins said.

“This proposal, strongly promoted by the New Zealand First Party, is consistent with the *Labour and New Zealand First Coalition Agreement* which commits to restore funding for [computers](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/nzfirst/pages/1911/attachments/original/1508875804/LabourandNewZealandFirstCoalitionAgreement2017.pdf?1508875804) in homes programmes this Parliamentary term,” Tracey Martin said.

“More details on this will be announced shortly, in what is a first step in the Coalition Government’s plans in this critical area,” Tracey Martin said.

Funding will come from within Crown baselines and does not require any new appropriation. The funding has been reprioritised from underspends in the Tertiary Education Vote in the 2017/18 year.

“This money for digital skills accompanies the Government’s announcement of a $31.7 million a year for institutions that provide courses at Level 3 and above to help them maintain quality standards, and other education initiatives,” Chris Hipkins said.
