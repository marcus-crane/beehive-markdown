Racing Minister Winston Peters has announced that applications for funding to improve racecourse safety is now open.

The $1 million Racing Safety Development Fund has two funding rounds per year. The first funding round for 2018/19 is open for applications as of 1 August 2018.

“Racecourses are an important part of communities across New Zealand and it’s important that they meet health and safety standards,” Mr Peters says.

The Fund benefits clubs and racing bodies across the country.

“Past projects have included improvements for safety running rails, irrigation and drainage, lighting upgrades, and grandstand repair. This helps to address the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, officials, and others involved in racing,” Mr Peters says.

New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses. All racing clubs and racing code bodies should consider the condition and standard of their facilities and equipment, and assess whether they are safe for animals, staff and spectators.

The Racing Safety Development Fund covers up to half the costs of a project with between $7,500 – $50,000 funding being available for each project.

Online applications should be submitted by 26 September 2018.
