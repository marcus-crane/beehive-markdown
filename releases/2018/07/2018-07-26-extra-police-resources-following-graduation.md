Extra resources for crime prevention and community safety are being deployed around the country with the graduation today of 79 new Police officers at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.

Police Minister Stuart Nash has congratulated the recruits of Wing 316.

“The recruits are the latest constables to enter service as part of the coalition government’s plan to boost Police numbers by 1800 new officers over three years. On top of this we are funding 485 additional support staff,” Mr Nash says.

“The government’s first budget set aside $300 million in new operating funding and $18 million in new capital spending for Police. We are rolling out the single biggest investment in policing in New Zealand history. There will be further resources in future budgets.

“This is the ninth recruit wing to graduate since the government took office. Since October 2017 more than 600 new frontline officers have successfully completed training at the College.

“The new officers from Wing 316 bring diverse and talented qualities. Thirty percent are female officers, more than 16 percent are Maori, the youngest is 19 years old and the oldest is 50. They speak a range of languages including Serbian, Spanish, and Hindi. Some have served in the armed forces, others have done valuable volunteer work such as in ambulance services, surf lifesaving, victim support and Youthline.

“Our neighbourhoods want a greater uniformed presence for road policing, family harm and child protection, burglaries and aggravated robberies, and the ability to respond to civil emergencies.

“Our communities want to know Police have the tools they need to fight the threat from organised crime. Police need resources to investigate and disrupt transnational drug smuggling, child sex exploitation, cyber-crime and money laundering. That is what we will deliver.

 “We are building a stronger Police service and giving them the support they need to prevent offending, enforce the law and keep communities safe.

 “I also want to thank the wing patron, Governor General Dame Patsy Reddy, for her guidance and mentoring of the recruits during their 16 weeks training,” says Mr Nash.
