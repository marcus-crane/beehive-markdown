The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will invest $60,000 into the development of Otago’s Economic Development Strategy and $820,000 in the Dunedin Waterfront Project, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones has announced.

Minister Jones made the announcement while attending the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the Dunedin Waterfront partners in Dunedin today.

Dunedin City Council will receive $820,000 to complete a full feasibility assessment and development of a business case for the Dunedin Waterfront Project, which will include engineering, environmental and commercial feasibility.

“A revitalised waterfront will add to Dunedin’s appeal as a visitor destination,” Shane Jones said.

“The vision for the waterfront project also includes a hotel, residential accommodation, and aims to be focal point for locals and visitors. The project is the right kind of ambition we want to see regions striving for and includes a plan to connect the town centre, the university and the stadium with walkways, cycleways and a bridge.

“This kind of thinking is very likely to attract new businesses with its appealing environment and its sustainable future focused design.

“We’ll also invest $60,000 in the development of an Economic Development Strategy for Otago, with the remainder of the funding coming from local and regional councils.

“This will allow the Otago Regional Economic Development Steering Group to build its capability to allow it to better assess long-term regional opportunities.

“This essential work will help the wider Otago region identify areas of common interest for investment and also reduces the risk of duplication or increased transaction costs across the region.

“I’m happy to be in Otago today – along with my Dunedin-based colleague Minister David Parker – to be making this announcement,” Shane Jones said.
