Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is pleased to be in Taranaki today to announce $600,000 from the Provincial Growth Fund to support the Taranaki region to diversify its economy.

“We are fully cognisant of the impact of a changing energy sector on the Taranaki region and remain relentlessly committed to generating opportunity and growth in the region,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“Additional PGF funding over three years will enable Venture Taranaki to employ a transitional economy manager to work alongside businesses, iwi, central government, communities, and the workforce, to identify, create and support new opportunities, jobs, skills, and investments across the energy, food, Māori economy, and tourism industries.

*“*This aligns with the *Tapuae Roa: Make Way for Taranaki Action Plan* launched in April that inspires a collaborative approach to building a modern, productive and sustainable Taranaki regional economy, and recognises key opportunities including diversifying the economy and unlocking Māori potential.

“There are enormous economic opportunities that come with renewables and low emission energy solutions and I am excited to support Taranaki in its future energy aspirations.

“PGF investment in Taranaki is now $21.4 million and we expect there will be further initiatives identified through this partnership approach we are pursuing to support the region’s just transition,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
