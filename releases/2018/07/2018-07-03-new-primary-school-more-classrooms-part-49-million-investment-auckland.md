A new primary school and more classrooms at existing schools will be built for 1200 students in Auckland, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

The announcement was made during a visit to Waterview Primary School in Auckland this morning. The funding is a part of a $332 million announced in Budget 2018 to meet roll growth pressures.

“Auckland is one of our fastest growing regions in the country and it is critical schools can keep pace with population growth,” Chris Hipkins said.

“We made a strong start in Budget 18 towards the investment needed in education infrastructure,” Mr Hipkins said.

The $49 million will deliver:

- 240 student places by expanding Waterview Primary School ($6.3m)
- 350 student spaces by relocating, rebuilding and expanding Paerata Primary School ($20m)

“As well as this, we are building a brand new primary school at Scott Point for 650 students ($22.8m), with the design and build of the school being managed by Ministry of Education.

“This is on top of the $19.5 million already announced to completely rebuild and expand Onepoto Primary School on the North Shore in Auckland.

“This Coalition Government is commitment to ensuring schools have enough classrooms that are modern and fit-for-purpose to support students to succeed.

“We are just getting started, there will be more classroom announcements under Budget 18 in the coming weeks.

“It comes as the [Government progresses work](http://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/information-releases/cabinet-paper-towards-a-comprehensive-reform-of-school-property) to set a long-term, strategic approach to managing school property,” Chris Hipkins said.
