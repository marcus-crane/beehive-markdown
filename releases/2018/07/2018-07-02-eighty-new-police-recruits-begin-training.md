Police recruitment is taking another significant step forward with the arrival of eighty new recruits who begin training today at the Royal New Zealand Police College.

Police Minister Stuart Nash has extended a welcome to the recruits of Wing 319 who arrived over the weekend and begin their formal training today.

“I am delighted to see the diverse demographics of Wing 319,” Mr Nash says.

“There are 37 women, representing 46 per cent of the new recruits in this wing. Police have a goal of women making up 50 percent of new recruits as part of the longer-term plan to have more women entering senior ranks.

“Fifteen percent of the new recruits identify as Maori, just under eight percent as Pasifika, and nine percent as Asian. The youngest recruit is 18 years old and the eldest is 46.

“There is a tough 16-week training course ahead of these 80 recruits and I wish them all the best. They have shown a great deal of dedication and hard work to even make it into formal training and I acknowledge their commitment and the support of their families.

“Before they arrive at Police College every applicant sits a series of tests. They have to demonstrate their fitness levels, reasoning abilities and character, undergo reference checks and a medical examination. They must prove their skills at communication, building relationships, solving problems and delivering a high standard of service.

“We are building a stronger policing presence in our neighbourhoods to increase community safety and prevent crime. We set aside $300 million in new operating funding in this year’s Budget as a first step towards our goal of 1800 new Police officers and 485 new support staff over three years.

“I offer my thanks also to the Chief Executive of MBIE, Carolyn Tremain, who has agreed to be the Patron of Wing 319. Ms Tremain will offer valuable guidance and act as a mentor to the recruits, sharing her extensive knowledge of leadership and service in the public and private sectors,” Mr Nash says.
