Minister of Social Development Carmel Sepuloni is pleased to announce a partnership between the Ministry of Social Development and Nelson manufacturing and construction company XLam.

“The Ministry of Social Development and Xlam NZ Limited will work together to create entry-level manufacturing and construction opportunities for unemployed clients, especially in the Pre-Fabrication sector,” Carmel Sepuloni said

XLam NZ Limited is a highly innovative building manufacturing and construction company specialising in Laminated Timber panels. It employs approximately 100 staff across Australasia in their Nelson manufacturing plant, Auckland off-site Solutions facility, and in their Aubrey, Australia manufacturing plant.

“Xlam NZ will provide training and support to our clients in the manufacture of pre-fabricated buildings with opportunities for on-site assembler roles. 

“This agreement is just one of the ways the Government is showing its commitment to getting people into meaningful and sustainable employment. This is particularly important in high demand areas like building and construction.

““This is a win-win situation for everyone involved. It’s a great example where employers partner with government to provide sustainable jobs for our unemployed people,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
