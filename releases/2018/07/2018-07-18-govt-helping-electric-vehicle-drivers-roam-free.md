Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter today launched EVRoam, a new initiative providing electric car drivers with real-time information about where they can find reliable charging stations right around the country.  

EVRoam is a live database, collated by the NZ Transport Agency from real-time data fed directly from charging station operators such as Chargenet and Vector. EVRoam then shares this information out as widely as possible, to dozens of other websites and apps, so that drivers can receive reliable data on charging stations through all channels.

“This is about giving people the practical tools to confidently drive an electric car right around the country and know they have the power to go the distance,” said Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter.

“EVRoam lets drivers know if a charging station is active and able to be used, which means they can confidently plan their journeys.

“EVRoam aims to give drivers confidence by identifying only reliable charging stations that meet government guidelines, such as having a consistent plug type and being monitored.

“The real-time data will be made available on the Agency’s [journey planner website](http://www.journeys.nzta.govt.nz/ev-chargers), and to other third party platforms like Google Maps, TomTom and the Automobile Association’s website.

“There are currently 117 active rapid charging stations nationwide, a further 19 under construction, and 42 planned sites.

“We now have electric vehicle rapid charging stations every 75km on almost 80 percent of the state highway network, which is a huge achievement.

“Initiatives like this are part of the Government’s commitment to making sustainable transport an easy option for all New Zealanders,” said Ms Genter.
