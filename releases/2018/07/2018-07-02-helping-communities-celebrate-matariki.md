The Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta is pleased that Te Puni Kōkiri is supporting New Zealand communities who want to mark the start of Matariki, the Māori New Year.

The Māori New Year is marked by the dawn rising of the star cluster Matariki (the Pleiades) or in some regions the rising of Puanga (Rigel in Orion) in the night sky. This year Matariki  rises around the 6th to the 9th of  July. This is the time when you can see Matariki just above the horizon before the sun rises.

“It is wonderful to see the range of activities that have been planned to mark the rising of Matariki-Puanga. Te Puni Kōkiri has invested in 70 events around the country to celebrate the Māori New Year.

Te Puni Kōkiri has provided more than $250,000 to support these community initiatives. The funded projects cater for everyone from tamariki  to kaumātua and will be held from the Far North to the South Island,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

These events include festivals, art exhibitions and workshops that have been initiated by kōhanga reo, rangatahi groups and other non-profit organisations.

“The growing number of communities celebrating Matariki is a great sign.

“More New Zealanders are interested in learning more about Māori culture and language. Matariki-Puanga is a good time to learn more about Māori culture, strengthen our connections and plan for the year ahead,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
