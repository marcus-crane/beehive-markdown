## The Minister for Climate Change strongly welcomes the commitment by the new Climate Leaders Coalition of 60 businesses to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions and leading the way to the low-carbon economy.

“These 60 companies - from Z Energy, to Spark, Vodafone, Air New Zealand, Contact Energy, Meridian, Ngai Tahu Holdings and Ravensdown - make up nearly half of our country’s total greenhouse gas emissions when you include their supply chains.

“So to have them formally join the challenge to tackle climate change and reduce their emissions is a huge boost towards our goal of net zero emissions by 2050,” says James Shaw.

“Other countries have business groups committed to cutting emissions too, but in no other country do those groups represent almost half their country’s emissions. These business leaders can see what’s possible and they’re up for the challenge.

“I am also delighted to see their support for two key parts of the upcoming Zero Carbon Bill, which are to establish an independent Climate Change Commission and set regular carbon ‘budgets” as stepping stones to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

“The fact that their commitment also extends to working with their suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as well shows these companies are serious about joining the collective responsibility we all have for reducing our climate pollution.

“When you put today’s declaration from the Climate Leaders Coalition together with the recent commitment made by New Zealand’s Farming Leaders to support our goal of New Zealand achieving net zero emissions by 2050, you can see significant momentum is building,” says Mr Shaw.

“These demonstrations of leadership from the private sector just go to show that New Zealand is ready to take on the challenge of tackling climate change and hungry to seize on the opportunity to upgrade our economy, not just so that it’s ‘clean and green’ but also more productive, higher value and better paid.

“And I encourage all New Zealanders to have their say on the Zero Carbon Bill before the deadline for submissions close on Thursday 19 July.”
