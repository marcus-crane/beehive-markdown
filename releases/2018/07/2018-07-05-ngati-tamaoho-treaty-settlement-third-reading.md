Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little acknowledges and welcomes the rangatira of Ngāti Tamaoho who came to Parliament for the significant third reading of their Treaty settlement legislation.

“I acknowledge the Ngāti Tamaoho and Crown negotiation teams who have worked tirelessly during the negotiations process. The Crown acknowledges breaches that led to complete land loss and suffering. Today marks a major milestone for Ngāti Tamaoho and the Crown as we see this legislation passed,” says Andrew Little.

“In the early 1800s Ngāti Tamaoho entered positive relationships with settlers and sold land to the Crown in good faith. The Crown failed to fulfil a commitment to retain acquired land for Ngāti Tamaoho. Crown actions also exacerbated tensions between Ngāti Tamaoho and neighbouring iwi. Ngāti Tamaoho area of interest extends from the Awhitu peninsula across Franklin District and the Hunua Ranges and also includes both Waikato wetlands and central Auckland. 

“The Crown branded Ngāti Tamaoho “rebels” and organised the destruction of their homes through the burning and looting of their settlements at Pokeno. Ngāti Tamaoho were left landless, their tribal structure undermined, and they were denied their role as kaitiaki of their rohe and its waterways, rivers and lakes.

“The Bill gives effect to the Deed of Settlement signed on 30 April 2017 for the full and final settlement of the historical Treaty breaches. The settlement package includes commercial and financial redress with a total value of $10.3million, including the opportunity to purchase Crown properties.

 “The Crown can never fully compensate Ngāti Tamaoho for the loss and prejudice they have suffered, however this settlement provides a solid foundation for a new beginning for a new relationship between the Crown and Ngāti Tamaoho hāpu,” says Andrew Little.
