Six more applications from charter school sponsors to establish designated character schools next year have been approved, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

In addition, two applications for state integrated schools have been approved to go through to the final stage.

“I have sought further information from the sponsor of two further schools, and work is needed on property options for the remaining application. The applicants for these three schools have met all other criteria for becoming a designated character school,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Vanguard School was approved in May.  I have now approved the following six schools to be established as designated character schools from Term 1 2019:

- Pacific Advance Secondary School, Auckland
- Te Aratika Academy, Whakatu
- Te Kāpehu Whetū (Teina), Whangarei
- Te Kāpehu Whetū (Tuakana), Whangarei
- Te Kōpuku High, Hamilton
- Te Rangihakahaka Centre for Science and Technology, Rotorua

“To help these schools be ready for the start of the school year, I have also appointed their Establishment Boards of Trustees. They include members of each charter school’s governance board, to provide continuity and support its character. 

“I have approved the first stage of the state integrated school applications relating to Tūranga Tangata Rite in Gisborne and Waatea School in Auckland. This means the Ministry will begin negotiations on integration agreements with these schools’ applicants, from which I will then make a final decision,” Chris Hipkins said.

Decisions will be made as soon as possible about the two remaining sponsors’ applications to establish three designated character schools, when more information is available. The schools are Rise UP Academy in Auckland, Middle School West Auckland and South Auckland Middle School.

“I expect to make final decisions on the two state integrated and three designated character schools in September, but have asked the Ministry to try and ensure this happens earlier if possible. This is still enough time for the new schools to open in 2019.

“Today’s decisions mean that six more charter school sponsors, their students and school communities have certainty for next year, within the wider state system. The Government’s focus is on rebuilding the state education system, so that it meets the needs of every student and supports them to succeed.”
