The new Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Board chairperson and deputy were announced by Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage today.

The new chairperson is Julie Hardaker and her deputy is Steven Tipene Wilson.

The EPA board is responsible for the EPA’s governance. The EPA makes decisions for and regulates hazardous substances and new organisms as well as specified marine activities in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone. It also provides administrative support for the decision-making on major infrastructure and called in projects under the Resource Management Act and operates the New Zealand Emissions Trading Register under the Emissions Trading Scheme.

“Former Hamilton Mayor Julie Hardaker brings a depth and breadth of experience to the role including knowledge of central and local government processes, financial accountability, risk monitoring and public and employment law.

“Ms Hardaker also received the Order of Te Arikinui Queen Te Atarangikaahu in 2016 for services to Māori, and has a strong interest in environmental issues and protection,” Eugenie Sage said.

“Steven (Tipene) Wilson will be a strong Deputy Chair for the EPA as he brings his experience as Current Deputy and former Chair of Ngā Kaihautū Tikanga Taiao, the EPA’s Māori Statutory Advisory Committee to the role.

“Mr Wilson has worked with various iwi on environmental management, helped an iwi Environmental Management Plan team win a NZ Planning Institute Best Practice award in strategic planning and guidance, and has knowledge of central government and regional council processes.”

Outgoing Chair Kerry Prendergast has served the EPA Board since its inception in 2011. She was joined by Deputy Chair Kevin Thompson in 2012.

“I thank them both for their work. Together their steady leadership has provided the EPA a solid foundation and a good direction for the future.”

Other appointments are Dr Gerda Kuschel and Professor Jeroen Douwes who replace Kura Denness and  Geoff Thompson.

Dayle Hunia, Tim Lusk, Gillian Wratt and Nicki Crauford will continue as EPA board members.
