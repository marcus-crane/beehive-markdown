Minister for Biosecurity Damien O’Connor says Kiwis can celebrate those helping to keep our flora, fauna and vital primary sectors safe by nominating them for New Zealand Biosecurity Awards. 

Mr O’Connor [opened the award entries today](https://www.facebook.com/damienoconnormp/videos/1807103756046820/).  

“The awards are a way to thank and shine a light on people and organisations who are protecting Aotearoa – in our communities, businesses, science organisations, iwi and hapū, and central and local government. 

“Biosecurity is our number one challenge because it is critical to our economic base and way of life. Recent reports show that only 2 per cent of Kiwis feel a biosecurity breach would affect their lives – I think this level of awareness is changing and there’s a growing understanding that every New Zealander has personal responsibility for ensuring we maintain a resilient and strong biosecurity system.  

“The awards kicked off last year and this year we’ve added three new categories: the Emerging Leader, Innovation and Science awards,” Damien O’Connor said. 

Finalists will be announced on Friday 12 October and winners on Monday 12 November at an awards dinner in Auckland.   

Entries are open until 31 August. Find out more at [www.mpi.govt.nz/biosecurityawards](http://www.mpi.govt.nz/biosecurityawards)
