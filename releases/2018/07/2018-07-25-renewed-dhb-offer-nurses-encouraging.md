Health Minister Dr David Clark says it is encouraging that the Nurses Organisation is recommending the latest District Health Boards’ offer to its members.

“These negotiations have been long and testing. I am pleased both parties have reached an agreement on an offer to put to NZNO members,” David Clark says.

“I congratulate both negotiating teams for their continued hard work to find common ground.

“This Government is committed to ensuring that DHBs deliver on all elements of any settlement – particularly with regards to safe staffing levels. 

“We know that trust has historically been an issue for nurses who do not feel that DHBs have always held up their end of the bargain. As Health Minister I have been listening to these concerns and can assure the public I will require DHBs to honour their commitments.

“I understand that the NZNO will ballot its members about the latest offer from next week. I encourage nurses to consider this offer closely,” David Clark says.
