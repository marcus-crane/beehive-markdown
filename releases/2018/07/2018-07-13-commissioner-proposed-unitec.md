The Government is reaffirming its commitment to Auckland-based institute of technology Unitec, with the proposal to appoint a Commissioner, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Unitec is facing a shortfall of approximately $19 million this year and $27 million next year, if no changes are made. The Government is currently considering options to ensure Unitec is supported.

“Following consultation and considering 23 submissions, I have notified the existing Unitec council of my plans to dissolve it and appoint a Commissioner to address Unitec’s financial difficulties,” Mr Hipkins said.

“The council has up to 21 days to respond before the decision is finalised.

“Our message for students is that the Government is committed to ensure top quality vocational education and training is available at Unitec and they should have every confidence that its financial issues will be addressed,” Chris Hipkins said.
