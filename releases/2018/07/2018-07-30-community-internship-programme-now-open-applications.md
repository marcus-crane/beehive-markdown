Applications for the Community Internship Programme are now open, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Peeni Henare announced today.

“The internship programme is a way for kiwis to take a break from their normal mahi and help organisations in their community,” Peeni Henare said.

“People can use their skills and work with community groups, to offer services like strategic planning, relationship building, and leadership development.

Over $200,000 in grant funding is available, allowing not-for-profit community organisations to pay the salaries of skilled staff from the public, private or community sector. Interns will work with their organisation for three to six months, with part-time internships of up to 12 months will also be considered.

In 2017, eight organisations from across the sector took part in the internship scheme, including Housing New Zealand, Deloitte, and Tuia Charitable Trust.

A staff member from Deloitte worked alongside K’Aute Pasifika Trust, to lend a hand with financial management processes. The relationship strengthened the Trust and put them in a better position to do their work, such as managing the accounts for 6 other providers in their region.

“The programme grows understanding, cooperation and interaction between the private, central government, local government, and community and voluntary sectors,” Peeni Henare said.

Grants approved from this funding round will fund community internships beginning in January or February 2019. 

Applications are now open and will close 5 September 2018. For more information on the Community Internship Programme, visit [https://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/community-internship-programme/](https://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/community-internship-programme/)
