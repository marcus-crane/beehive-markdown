Having climbed the 1349 steps on the Hākarimata walkway outside Ngaruawahia, the Minister for Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta says she is delighted to welcome a new digital app that promotes the history and the healthy value of the track.

“This is an important educational resource that promotes Hauora (health and wellbeing ) and Kaitiakitanga  on the walk’s significance to the Waikato -Tainui people.” 

The new digital app has a video, maps, environmental information and a step counter.

“The app will welcome people to the Hākarimata, raise awareness of the cultural heritage of the area and encourage the protection of  our natural resources.

“I have walked Hākarimata several  times and call the walkway a ‘very patient trainer’. No matter your age, shape or size the health benefits of making the steep climb is rewarded with the beautiful view at the top and a real feeling of achievement at the end,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The app was launched by the Minister of Conservation Hon Eugenie Sage in Ngaruawahia today who congratulated Waikato –Tainui on the initiative.

“Replacing the old track the Department of Conservation built some years ago with the challenging stairway to the summit has increased visitor usage from a few thousand annually to now over 200,000 , says Eugenie Sage.”
