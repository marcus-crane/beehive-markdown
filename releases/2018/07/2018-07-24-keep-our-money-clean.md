Justice Minister Andrew Little has launched a public information campaign to raise awareness about the problem of money laundering by domestic and foreign criminals here in in New Zealand.

“The [Keep Our Money Clean](https://www.keepourmoneyclean.govt.nz/) campaign is about keeping our international corruption-free reputation and making sure Kiwi businesses are informed and prepared,” says Andrew Little.

“The campaign starts today and uses print and digital advertising. It will run in four phases as new business sectors come under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act.

“New Zealanders are rightly proud that our country is free from corruption. To keep it that way we need all Kiwi businesses to be vigilant so criminals with dirty money won’t do us any harm.

“Money launderers undermine our country’s financial and justice systems, and leave us vulnerable to trans-national crime. If the world loses confidence in us, our ability to protect our financial channels, our hard-won international financial and trade reputation will be at risk.

“The Government has prepared ‘*Keep our Money Clean*’ information packs for law practices, accounting business agents and real estate agents so that customers can understand the anti-money laundering requirements those businesses are required to uphold.

“Some customers will be asked for extra information, such as identification, when they’re conducting business. That’s how we’ll keep our country safe together,” says Andrew Little.
