Significant progress has been made with the collective redress deeds for the Marutūāhu and Pare Hauraki iwi, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Andrew Little, has announced today.

“I have initialled the Marutūāhu Iwi Collective Redress Deed.  Following further consideration, I’m also ready to sign the Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed. 

“There will still be outstanding issues between iwi over these settlements and I expect all parties to use the period ahead to engage in tikanga-based processes to deal with these issues.

“Initialling the Marutūāhu Iwi Collective Redress Deed is one step closer to settlement and it’s now up to the Marutūāhu iwi claimant community to consider ratification.

“Some groups with overlapping interests are seeking changes to the Deed, and this is the subject of court action. Initialling the Redress Deed shows a commitment from both parties, however, it is not binding until ratified and signed by the Crown and Marutūāhu iwi.

“The Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed was initialled in December 2016 and is now ready to be signed.

“Several months ago, I signalled my intention to sign the Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed and sought final information from relevant parties. As strong concerns were raised I wanted to look again at the proposed redress.

“I made sure a fair amount of time was available to do this and I received full and direct views from the iwi. This process resulted in amendments provided to Pare Hauraki Iwi.

“I acknowledge the Waitangi Tribunal’s finding of Hauraki interests in Tauranga Moana,Te Puna - Katikati blocks. Agreements were reached in good faith between the Pare Hauraki Collective and Tauranga Moana iwi between 2012 – 2014. 

“Advancing these settlements is a vital step in coming to terms with our history and making reparation for past injustices. It’s time to move ahead and allow Pare Hauraki and Marutūāhu to settle their historical claims,” says Andrew Little.
