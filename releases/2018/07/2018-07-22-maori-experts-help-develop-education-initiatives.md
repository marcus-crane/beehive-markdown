Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis is hosting an impressive group of 12 Māori experts in Wellington today to help realise the potential for two education initiatives flagged in this year’s Budget.

The group will help the Government develop the parameters for two Māori education initiatives: Te Ahu o te reo Māori and Te Kawa Matakura.

“There’s huge potential for this if we get it right,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Te Ahu o te reo Māori will support teachers to deliver te reo in the classroom and is the start of our plan to better integrate te reo across the education system.

“The demand is there. The teaching workforce has a number of teachers who have good capability in te reo and are looking for ways to improve their confidence to use it every day in their classrooms.”

“Te Kawa Matakura is a response to calls to pilot a traditional wānanga Māori. The vision is to produce rangatahi conversant in mātauranga Māori in mind, body and wairua.

“This has long been the dream of our elders and Te Kawa Matakura is a first step to its realisation,” Kelvin Davis said.

The think tank is a one-off. Kelvin Davis said the level of expertise available for the workshop was impressive.

“We mustn’t be afraid to ask for help particularly when there’s an unparalleled wealth of knowledge available at our doorstep,” Kelvin Davis said.

**Additional information:**

- **Te Ahu o Te Reo Māori** is a package of initiatives to support teachers to use te reo Māori in the classroom. It will target teachers who are already teaching te reo, and those who have the potential but not the confidence.
  
  Teachers will have access to tailored courses, peer networks and resources to increase their capability, proficiency and confidence to deliver te reo Māori in the classroom.
- **Te Kawa Matakura** will target two groups of rangatahi; those in their final years at wharekura and secondary school (16-18yrs), as well as 16-25 year olds that no longer attend formal education but display a high level of Māori language proficiency and strong leadership skills.
  
  Te Kawa Matakura will provide a platform for children to learn and grow in an environment steeped in tribal bodies of knowledge alongside Māori expertise, wisdom and guidance.
  
  The key learning areas will include mōteatea, hītori Māori, karanga, whaikōrero and karakia.
