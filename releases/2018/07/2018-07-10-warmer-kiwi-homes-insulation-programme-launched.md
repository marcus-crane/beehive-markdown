The country has been hit with a series of cold snaps this winter but low-income homeowners can now warm up with grants covering two thirds of the cost of ceiling and underfloor insulation, Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods says.

Woods launched the *Warmer Kiwi Homes* insulation programme in Christchurch today, following an announcement in the May Budget of a $142 million investment to make Kiwi homes warmer and drier.

The grants are targeted towards those who need them most. People and families who live in low decile areas or with a health condition or a community services card are eligible under the new scheme.

The first year of the programme will focus on insulation grants, with grants for heating available from July 2019, Woods says.

“The Government has invested in this programme because too many homes are cold and damp, leading to preventable diseases such as rheumatic fever and asthma. Low-income families, young children and older Kiwis are especially vulnerable to the impacts of living in cold, damp homes.

“That’s a huge personal cost to families but it also adds cost and pressure to the health system. That’s why the government has lifted the level of funding per grant from 25% per fit out to two thirds of the cost. This will make getting your home insulated more accessible to those who need it most.”

Woods also acknowledged the community organisations which invest additional funding in insulation programmes, lifting the level of funding available in grants and making a significant difference to the wellbeing of their communities.

“The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), which runs *Warmer Kiwi Homes,* is encouraging community organisations to contribute funding to make the cost to homeowners as low-cost as possible,” says Megan Woods.

This programme delivers on the Coalition and Confidence and Supply Agreements with New Zealand First and the Green Party.
