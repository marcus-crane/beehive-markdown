Brian Corban has been appointed to the KiwiRail board as Deputy Chair, Minister for State Owned Enterprises Winston Peters and Finance Minister Grant Robertson announced today.

Mr Corban will replace Trevor Janes on the board. Mr Janes retired as Chair and from the board on 30 June. Mr Corban will act as Chair of KiwiRail until such time as a new Chair is appointed. The process to appoint a new Chair is underway.

Mr Corban is an Auckland-based company director and lawyer. His experience includes as Chair of Genesis for ten years, Chair of Radio New Zealand Ltd, the Foundation Chair of Television New Zealand Ltd and he has previously served as Deputy Chair of NZ Railways Corporation/Kiwirail in 2008.

He is also Chair of the Melanesian Trust Board, a board member of Auckland War Memorial Museum, a director of Ngatarawa Wines and a number of private companies and a trustee of various community trusts. He is a former Chair of Auckland City Mission and member of the Waitangi Tribunal.

“Mr Corban’s appointment will bring expertise in Crown company governance and leadership that will greatly assist a new Chair in adjusting to the role,” Winston Peters said.

The Ministers acknowledged Mr Janes’ work as KiwiRail Chair and wished him well for the future.

They also thanked KiwiRail CEO Peter Reidy, who announced today he will be stepping down from the company later this year to take up the CEO role at Fletcher Construction.

Mr Reidy’s achievements include KiwiRail’s response following the Kaikōura earthquake to the rebuild of the Main North Line between Picton and Christchurch, expected to be completed in mid-2019.
