Dr Beverly Gatenby will join the independent Charities Registration Board to replace Ms Caren Rangi who has stepped down after six years on the Board.

Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Peeni Henare announced the appointment along with the reappointments of chair Mr Roger Holmes Miller and Mr Simon Karipa.

“Caren has made a valuable contribution to the Board and was recently appointed as an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the Pacific community and governance. I want to acknowledge and thank Caren for her service as a Board member,” Peeni Henare said.

“I am pleased to welcome Dr Gatenby, she brings a wealth of community skills and business acumen to the Board which will provide them with an important perspective for the charitable sector.

Dr Gatenby is a consultant, facilitator and coach based in Hamilton. She recently conducted a review of the Hamilton City Council’s community development strategy and has coached a number of chief executives in the community and local government sector. She was the Chief Executive of Trust Waikato between 2006 and 2016.

Mr Roger Holmes Miller is founding partner of Wellington law firm Maude and Miller, and with extensive experience in the governance of community organisations, has been the chair of the Charities Registration Board for the last six years.

Mr Simon Karipa is the General Manager of Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō Trust, has also held a range of governance roles in iwi and community organisations, and has been appointed for a second three year period.

The Charities Registration Board is responsible for making decisions on registering and removing charities from the Charities Register under the Charities Act.
