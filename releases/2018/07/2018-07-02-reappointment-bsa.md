Cantabrian Paula Rose QSO has been reappointed to the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) for a second term.

Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran says “Paula Rose is a highly regarded member of the board and her reappointment gives the BSA continuity as two other members of the four-member board, including Chair Peter Radich, come to the end of their terms.

“She has considerable governance and complaints resolution experience as a member of WorkSafe New Zealand, the Parole Board, the Online Media Standards Authority and the South Island Regional Trust Board for St John. 

 “She was the former National Manager Road Policing and an executive advisor with the Ministry of Social Development, where she was involved with implementing an action plan for vulnerable children.

“Her experience sits well with the skills needed for the BSA to maintain broadcasting standards, consider complaints and set the required codes of practice.”

Paula Rose is reappointed until 30 April 2021.
