The Minister for Social Development, Carmel Sepuloni, has announced the successful Children and Families Research Fund proposals and the launch of new funding round.

Each year the Government awards $750,000 in research funding to support further analysis of the information gathered by the *Growing Up in New Zealand* longitudinal study.

“*Growing Up in New Zea*land collects information from around 6,800 families to help inform our understanding of what’s happening for children growing up in 21st Century New Zealand,” said Social Development Minister, Carmel Sepuloni.

“Already this year, the Government has restored more than $1.9 million of funding to the *Growing Up in New Zealand* study so that all study families have the opportunity to participate in the current round of data collection.

“As well as boosting the funding for data collection, we want to encourage deeper investigation of that data and draw on the information being gathered so that government policies can be shaped to better meet the needs of children and families in New Zealand today, and in the future.

“Today we open the third round of funding, and I encourage academics, public and private researchers and non-government organisations to shape up proposals that will help build knowledge to support our diverse society.

Applications for funding must be received by the Ministry of Social Development by Friday 31 August.

“I am also pleased to announce the successful proposals from the second round of funding. These five research projects from academic institutes will provide further evidence to support high-quality policy design and decision-making,”  said Carmel Sepuloni.
