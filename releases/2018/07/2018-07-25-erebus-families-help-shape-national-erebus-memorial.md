A survey on the planned Erebus memorial has gone to family members of those who passed away in the Erebus accident and to workers involved in the recovery in Antarctica, Acting Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Carmel Sepuloni announced today.

“The views of family members and the Operation Overdue workers are vital in helping to shape the Memorial.  We will be asking questions such as what a National Erebus Memorial should feel like; the activities and events that should happen at the Memorial; and, whether it is best placed in a busy or quiet location,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“We’re looking forward to receiving this valuable input. It will provide important guidance for the National Erebus Memorial design.

“If you are a family member and haven’t received the survey please get in touch with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage at [erebus@mch.govt.nz]() as soon as possible, so you can have your say.

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Jacinda Ardern is planning to meet with the Erebus families later in the year.

The National Erebus Memorial will be in place in the first half of 2020, with the 40th anniversary on November 28, 2019 being marked in some special way connected with the creation of the Memorial.

“The Government is committed to getting a National Erebus Memorial in place and involving family members and Operation Overdue workers in the process.

“It is so important that we get an appropriate Memorial that formally recognises those who died and those involved in the recovery. The Memorial will be a place where all New Zealanders can come to pay their respects and remember this tragedy,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
