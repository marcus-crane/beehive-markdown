Projects using innovative and engaging ways of teaching such as combining performing arts and co-teaching strategies received Government funding to get started, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Mr Hipkins congratulated the 25 schools and early learning services getting a total of $1.78 million in the latest round of the $18 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund (TLIF).

The fund supports teams of teachers to develop innovative practices that improve learning outcomes especially for students who are Māori, Pacific, students with additional learning needs or students who are disadvantaged.

“This Government encourages creativity and innovation in classrooms,” Chris Hipkins said.

“There are some really exciting projects this year. One of them explores opportunities for students to write in their own language and work through the translating process with their family to increase cultural awareness and promote a more inclusive classroom.

“The fund helps teachers bring in additional expertise. This could include, cultural advisors, academics with specialist knowledge and external support to help evaluate the impact of their project. 

“Several of the projects involve collaboration across a number of schools and services – that means more than 40 schools benefit from this funding round,” Mr Hipkins said.

Aotea College in Wellington is one of the schools receiving funding. The College’s principal, Kate Gainsford said she’s enormously pleased.

“This fund will see an already strong and innovative teaching team do research into a group teaching model in performing arts. Our teachers are very excited about this,” Ms Gainsford said.

More than 140 projects received a total of $10 million from the teacher-led innovation fund in the past four years.

**Notes to editors –**

Co-teaching - one teacher leads the whole group, while the other teacher observes and collects data.
