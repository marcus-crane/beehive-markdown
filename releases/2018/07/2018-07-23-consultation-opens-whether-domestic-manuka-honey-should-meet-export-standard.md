The Government wants to hear from mānuka honey producers and consumers on whether the honey produced and sold in New Zealand should meet similar requirements to exported mānuka honey.                                                                                         

Agriculture and Food Safety Minister Damien O’Connor opened the consultation at the Apiculture New Zealand conference and trade exhibition in Blenheim this morning. 

“In December 2017, the Ministry for Primary Industries introduced a robust scientific definition for exported New Zealand mānuka honey to safeguard the industry from cowboy operators and protect New Zealand’s trade reputation.  

“The next step is to consider options for mānuka honey sold in New Zealand. The consultation launched today gives everyone the opportunity to have a say on the impacts, benefits and costs of the proposals on all parts of the sector.                                                             

“The New Zealand apiculture industry is an important contributor to the primary sector – both directly and as an enabler via pollination.  

“The mānuka honey industry is worth nearly $180 million to New Zealand, although it’s not known what portion stays in the country and this consultation will also help us to better understand that,” Damien O’Connor said.
