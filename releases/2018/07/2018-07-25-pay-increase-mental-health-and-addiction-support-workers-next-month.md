Five thousand mental health and addiction support workers will receive a pay increase next month with Health Minister Dr David Clark signing an agreement this morning which gives them the same pay rates as care and support workers.

“This Government is committed to pay equity and lifting wages, particularly for our lowest paid workers,” said David Clark at the signing ceremony.

“I’d like to acknowledge the courage and perseverance of Kristine Bartlett and the Food and Service Workers Union – now E Tū - in filing and pursuing the original pay equity case in the Employment Court six years ago.

“Last year when Labour was in Opposition, Jacinda Ardern was very clear that extending pay equity to mental health and addiction support workers would be one of our first priorities in Government.

“I’m pleased that we can now sign this agreement with unions and employers, to extend the Care and Support Workers (Pay Equity) Settlement Act to include these important workers.”

From next month nearly half will get an increase of more than $3 per hour which means full-time workers will be paid approximately an extra $120 a week before tax.  One-in-five workers will get an increase of more than $5 per hour or around an extra $200 for a 40-hour week.

 

The new pay scale reflects workers’ qualifications and experience. It will be back-dated to 1 July 2017.

“This agreement puts right a problem created by the previous Government, which deliberately excluded mental health and addiction workers from the Care and Support Workers settlement. These workers often support New Zealanders when they are most vulnerable and they deserve a fair go. This Government has delivered that,” says Dr Clark.

“Ensuring our mental health and addiction workers are paid what they deserve will help deliver a robust workforce,” says Dr Clark.

The $173.5 million settlement extension will be implemented over a five-year term and funded through an increase to Vote Health.
