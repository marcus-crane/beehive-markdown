Over $1,000,000 in grants has been provided to community organisations to promote and support volunteering, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Peeni Henare announced today.

“The Support for Volunteering Fund will help organisations find new and innovative ways to support and evolve volunteering.

This Fund recognises that volunteering can have a special meaning for Māori, Pacific and Ethnic communities. It caters for the different approaches to volunteering and needs of the sector.

This year the Support for Volunteering Fund will provide:  

- $747,000 to 17 regional volunteer centres, to recruit and train volunteers, promote good practice in volunteer management, and provide training and networking for community organisations.
- $175,000 to Volunteering New Zealand, which plays a leading role in the volunteer sector and builds volunteer capacity and capability through its member organisations.
- $80,000 to 16 organisations focusing on Māori, Pacific, and Ethnic communities, who will promote and support volunteering by building volunteering capacity and capabilities within their communities.

“Volunteering is a big part of our kiwi culture and volunteers make a huge contribution - it’s important we get behind the fantastic work they do,” Peeni Henare said.
