Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods is pleased to announce a number of new Board appointments to the Crown Research Institutes (CRIs).

“CRIs carry out important scientific research for the benefit of New Zealand, and play an important role in addressing some of our most pressing issues, such as biodiversity and climate change,” says Woods.

“Today it is my pleasure to announce the appointment of eight new members to five of the CRI boards. The new appointees come from a wide range of professional backgrounds, and will each bring their own unique set of skills and strengths to the Institutes.

“It’s also really pleasing to see an increase in the number of women on these boards from 35.4% to 44.7% of CRI board members. 

“These appointments are a testimony to each new member’s leadership and achievements in their respective fields, and I am confident they will positively contribute to the future performance of the CRIs,” says Woods.

The new board members are:

- Rukumoana Schaafhausen as a Director of AgResearch (with Dr Paul Reynolds temporarily acting as the Chair)
- Kate Thomson as a Director of the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR)
