The Ministers of Local Government, Youth, Employment, and Building and Construction today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs establishing a new partnership to get more young people into work. 

The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs helps promote the economic well-being of young people through advocacy projects, partnerships with best-practice organisations, and facilitating access to local communities.                                                                                        

“Though unemployment is decreasing, one in eight under 25-year-olds remain out of work or education. By working together at all levels of government, we can provide real opportunities and pathways for our rangatahi,” Employment Minister Willie Jackson said. 

“This partnership will open doors for rangatahi to develop leadership skills, and create opportunities to share their experiences, practise new strategies, and demonstrate leadership at a local level. I am excited for youths recognition and participation through central and local government,”Youth Minister Peeni Henare said. 

Initially work will focus on supporting local employment initiatives including He Poutama Rangatahi and the Provincial Growth Fund. 

“This agreement is another example of central and local government partnering to improve outcomes in local communities. Local needs are often best met by locally-led solutions and mayors have a critical role to play in driving local initiatives tailored to their communities,” Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta said. 

“I am working with my ministerial colleagues, with local government and with the construction sector to increase training opportunities and encourage young New Zealanders to take up the exciting career opportunities that construction provides. I’m looking forward to working with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs to meet our shared goals,” Building and Construction Minister Jenny Salesa said.                             

The memorandum was signed by the ministers, Otorohanga Mayor and Mayors Taskforce for Jobs Chair Max Baxter, and Local Government New Zealand Chief Executive Malcolm Alexander.
