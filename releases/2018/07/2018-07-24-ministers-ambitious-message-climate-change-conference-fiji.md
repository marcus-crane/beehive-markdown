The Minister for Climate Change says he will be reinforcing that urgency and ambition are needed regarding action on climate change as a Pacific conference gets underway tomorrow in Fiji.

James Shaw is attending the second Climate Action Pacific Partnership conference (CAPPII), over the next three days in Suva. The CAPP was established in July 2017, as part of Fiji’s Presidency of the twenty third UN climate change conference of the parties (COP23). The CAPP is focused on accelerating climate action in the Pacific and supporting implementation of the Paris Agreement. 

“At the conference I will be explaining the work that is happening here in New Zealand on climate change and sending the clear message that we, as Pacific nations, can show strength and leadership together on this issue.  

“Speaking with young Pasifika representatives before leaving for Fiji, they told me Pacific island nations need the global community to take climate change seriously. 

“They also explained to me that there are Pasifika entrepreneurs and innovators looking for new opportunities to get action on climate change happening, alongside government.

“In turn, I made clear to these representatives of the future that I will be pushing for ambitious global action to address climate change, including at this conference. 

“Together we need to meet the Paris Agreement’s objective of keeping global warming well below 2 o Celsius, and pursue efforts to keep warming under 1.5 o if we are to have any chance of limiting things like sea level rise and ocean acidification.

“As one of the representatives said to me, Pacific island people are saying ‘We have a right to survive’, and that message will be guiding my work at the conference,” Mr Shaw said.
