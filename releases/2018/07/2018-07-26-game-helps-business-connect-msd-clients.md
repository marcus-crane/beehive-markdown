A new online interactive game allowing small and medium business owners to learn about the services offered by the Ministry of Social Development, BNZ and Xero, has been launched today by Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni.

“The game - *Restaurant Tycoon* is an exciting opportunity to increase the number of partnerships between the Ministry of Social Development and industry and to increase job opportunities for unemployed people,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Too many small businesses face constraints through a combination of external pressures and lack of experience or commercial acumen.  Recruitment, training and retention of good employees are cited as among the greatest challenges for this group – and that’s where MSD can help.

“The game makes it easy for people to see how they can work with MSD for free, to recruit staff, access funding, mentoring and support when hiring a MSD client.

*Restaurant Tycoon* is one of a series developed by Joy Business Academy that allows players to immerse themselves in building and operating their own business in a virtual world. MSD, BNZ and Xero have all placed their products and services into the game.

“Following today’s launch, a link to download the game will be sent to 145,000 BNZ and 350,000 Xero Small and Medium business customers.  

“There are plans to develop other versions of the game for the Construction and Trades, Tourism and the Retail sector.

“This initiative is another way that Government and Industry are collaborating to grow job and business opportunities for New Zealanders,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
