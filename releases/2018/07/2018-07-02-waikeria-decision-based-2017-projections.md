The decision on the rebuild of Waikeria Prison was made by Cabinet based on the 2017 Justice Sector Projections, Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis said today.

“Simon Bridges is wrong. Ministers have been working off the 2017 projections through all decisions made in relation to Waikeria Prison. These formed the basis of the paper I took to Cabinet in June,” Kelvin Davis said.

 The 2017 Justice Sector Projections were publicly released last week.

“My comments this morning were intended to convey that I simply had not read the public version of the report on the projections, which was published last week. Of course I’ve seen dozens of official reports based on the information in the projections,” Kelvin Davis said.

Cabinet papers related to the Waikeria decision are due to be released within the next ten days.
