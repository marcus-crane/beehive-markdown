The Government is seeking submissions on a proposed 2% Annual Maximum Fee Movement for tertiary education organisations in 2019, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today.

Each year the Government sets a limit for any tuition fee increases charged by the tertiary sector for domestic students. The proposal is for a 2% limit to apply to students enrolling for the 2019 academic year.

“The proposed increase strikes a balance between protecting the affordability of tertiary education for students, while allowing tertiary education providers to invest in resources,” Mr Hipkins said.

“The 2% limit matches the 2% increases set for the 2017 and 2018 academic years.

“Continuing the annual maximum fee movement process provides certainty on potential fee rises for all parties – students, providers and the Government,” Mr Hipkins said.

Details of the proposed AMFM are available through the Ministry of Education’s [website](http://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/consultations-and-reviews/consulting-on-the-annual-maximum-fee-movement-rate-for-2019).

Submissions close on 27 July 2018.

The final AMFM notice is expected to be issued before the end of August to give providers time to consider fee changes and marketing for 2019.
