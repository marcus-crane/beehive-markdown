The Government has reached a major milestone in its commitment to eliminate the gender pay gap in the public service, as new Gender Pay Principles are launched tonight, State Services Minister Chris Hipkins and Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter said today.

“These five principles represent significant progress for women who’ve waited too long to be recognised fairly at work,” Women’s Minister Julie Anne Genter said.

“I’m proud to be part of a Government committed to eliminating the pay gap in the core public sector, and valuing women’s contributions, skills and experience across the board, including through unpaid work.

“These principles will guide all Government work on gender pay and are a significant step forward for the whole of the State sector.

“They strengthen the Government’s goal to eliminate the gender pay gap within the Public Service, agreed through Labour’s confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party,” Julie Anne Genter said.

“The principles were developed by a bi-partite working group of state sector unions and agencies, including the State Services Commission,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Their purpose is to ensure working environments in the State Sector are free from gender based inequalities.

“This Government recognises that workplace gender equality must be addressed by policies around recruitment, remuneration, career progression, and many more.”

The working group was established in June 2017 following a claim filed against the State Services Commission.

The five principles cover areas that the working group identified as overarching issues or practices relevant to all aspects of the employment cycle, while recognising Te Tiriti o Waitangi and its principles.

The Five Gender Pay Principles

1. Freedom from bias and discrimination
2. Transparency and accessibility
3. Acknowledging the relationship between paid and unpaid work
4. Sustainability
5. Participation and engagement.

Each of the Principles has an issue statement with information that shows how the Principle links to the workplace. Further guidance is being developed and made available so employers and employees can use it.
