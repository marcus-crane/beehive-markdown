Acting Prime Minister, Rt Hon Winston Peters, has announced a Provincial Growth Fund investment to help develop hydrogen fuel infrastructure in Taranaki. 

During his visit to New Plymouth today, Mr Peters said a grant of $950,000 will be made to Hiringa Energy and its partners which is seeking to develop zero emission hydrogen transport fuel.

The funding will be used to scope the engineering and design of two hydrogen generation facilities, up to four mobile compressed hydrogen storage and distribution containers, and up to three hydrogen refuelling stations. 

“Hiringa Energy and its partners should be congratulated for this foundation project. It has the potential to provide further employment and investment opportunities through clean energy technology,” said Mr Peters.

“This funding supports the next step towards developing a specialist skill base in the region to support hydrogen projects. This project’s deliverables will help grow the industry that has the potential to reduce emissions and provide clean, sustainable, secure energy.”

“Since the first investment from the Provincial Growth Fund into Taranaki, the government has invested $21.4 million into initiatives that will provide economic development opportunities in the region,” he said.

Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau also announced $600,000 from the Provincial Growth Fund for Venture Taranaki to employ a transitional economy manager.
