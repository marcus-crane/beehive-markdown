Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker will hold talks with his Pacific Alliance counterparts in Mexico next week to seek further progress on a free trade agreement with the four-nation grouping.

David Parker leaves for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Saturday to attend the Pacific Alliance Summit before travelling to Mexico City to promote the Government’s new Trade for All agenda.

The Pacific Alliance is made up of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. As a group, it is the world’s sixth largest economy and home to over 220 million people.

With a new government in Chile, and recent elections in Colombia and Mexico, the Summit is an opportunity to engage with new political leaders in the region.

“We see significant potential to promote integration within our region, demonstrate our shared commitment to free trade and reject the rising tide of trade protectionism in the world,” David Parker said.

“A progressive, high quality and comprehensive trade agreement with the Pacific Alliance will create new opportunities by reducing barriers and levelling the playing field while deepening connections with all four countries.”

In Mexico City he will meet Mexican and New Zealand business representatives.

“Mexico and New Zealand have a strong and well-established friendship with links that include trade, agriculture, sport, and the arts,” David Parker said.

Ambassador Traslosheros last month in Wellington formally handed over notice of Mexico’s ratification of the CPTPP, making it the first country to take that step.

Mexico is New Zealand’s largest goods trading partner in Latin America and this country’s 21st-largest export market overall.

“This visit will be an important opportunity to grow our relationship with Mexico and look for new opportunities opened up by the CPTPP and the Pacific Alliance,” David Parker said.
