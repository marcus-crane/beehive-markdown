Justice Minister Andrew Little has revealed the first steps in fixing our broken criminal justice system, so we can make communities safer.

“This Government believes New Zealand should be the best place in the world to live and raise a family. Our justice system must play its part in that. We are determined to confront the challenges with a hope and belief that we can and should do better for whānau and communities today, and for future generations.

“I’m hosting a Criminal Justice Summit, Hāpaitia Te Oranga Tangata, the Safe and Effective Justice Programme from August 20 to the 22nd.

“The Summit will be launched by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern from Parliament’s Banquet Hall on August the 20th. The remainder of the Summit will be at Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua.

“Today I’m also announcing the establishment of a specialist advisory group, the Safe and Effective Justice Programme Advisory Group – Te Uepū Hāpai i te Ora, to work alongside Justice Sector agencies on a prudent and realistic scope for effective criminal justice reform.

“The Advisory Group brings together people with practical working experience of the realities of our broken criminal justice system. Former minister Hon Chester Borrows will chair, working alongside independent victims’ advocate Ruth Money, and Julia Whaipooti, Dr Warren Young, Professor Tony Ward, Professor Tracey McIntosh, Dr Carwyn Jones and Dr Jarrod Gilbert.

“New Zealand needs less offending, less re-offending, and fewer victims of crime. We can’t continue to have one of the highest re-offending rates in the OECD.

“Real change means we have to do things differently. The Summit provides a start to honest conversations as a country, supported by real evidence. The Summit will bring together victims, victims’ advocates, front-line workers with different backgrounds and experience in the criminal justice system, and experts in criminal justice.

“Hāpaitia Te Oranga Tangata is about having the guts to look honestly at our slide towards an American-style justice system, and fixing things so we can have safer Kiwi communities,” says Andrew Little.
