Transport Minister Phil Twyford accepts the findings of a Civil Aviation Authority investigation into his use of a mobile phone on a domestic flight and will pay the infringement fine.

“I reiterate my unreserved apology for using my phone after the aircraft doors had shut in preparation for take-off,” Phil Twyford said.

“This is inappropriate for anyone, but particularly inappropriate for me as Transport Minister.

“It is an important reminder to follow safety requirements around using phones on planes.

“I accept the findings of the investigation that I breached Civil Aviation Authority rules and will pay the $500 infringement fine,” Phil Twyford said.
