Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced diplomat Tiffany Babington as New Zealand’s new High Commissioner to Tonga.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with Tonga, based on a population of more than 60,000 Tongans resident in New Zealand, development cooperation and our shared interest in regional issues,” says Mr Peters.

“Cooperation between our countries has been clearly demonstrated in recent days with our support to the Tongan Government following Tropical Cyclone Gita.

“Ms Babington will lead the delivery of New Zealand’s Official Development Assistance programme in Tonga, helping to oversee $66 million of investment over three years focused on energy, policing, justice and education.”

Ms Babington has previously been posted to Vanuatu and Italy, and worked on global development, Pacific regional, Niue and Tokelau issues.
