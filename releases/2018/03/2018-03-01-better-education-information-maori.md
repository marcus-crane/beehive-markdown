The Government will be making improvements to information for iwi and hapū on the achievement of their tamariki, Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis says.

Today the Ministry of Education released their annual *Iwi Profiles,* which provide information on participation rates of early childhood, attainment of NCEA Level 2 and 3 and tertiary study in rohe around the country. 

“The data in the Iwi Profiles provides a high-level overview of achievement and I know some iwi find it useful for their education planning,” Mr Davis says.

“But the profiles are largely based on showing how the previous Government’s Better Public Service Targets are being met. Useful information for Māori shouldn’t just be about that and we can deliver something more meaningful.”

“I want to produce something which shows what achievement looks like from a Māori perspective, not what the Crown sees as Māori success. I’m keen to work with iwi and hapū to understand what they want us to report on, which could include a greater focus on the child’s experience.

“Iwi might also want to know about whether tamariki are engaged and enjoy their learning, the strength of te reo among Māori students in the rohe, and how education is contributing to their children’s success as Māori.”

“Support from iwi, hapū and whānau is crucial if we are to raise the achievement of our tamariki and rangatahi. Having more appropriate information for them is part of that kaupapa.”

The Government plans to talk to iwi and hapū and make improvements to the *Iwi Profiles* from next year.

The latest *Iwi Profiles* are available at:
