Storm damaged households in the Nelson Tasman district can now access temporary accommodation.

The Government is extending the Temporary Accommodation Service (TAS) to assist more households affected by ex-Tropical Cyclones Fehi and Gita, says Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development Jenny Salesa.

“TAS is already assisting those in storm damaged households on the West Coast and this same service will now be extended to those impacted in the Nelson Tasman district.” says Ms Salesa.

“The extreme weather damaged a number of houses and dwellings in the Nelson Tasman district, particularly around Ruby Bay, Riwaka and Marahau and it is clear that a number of households will need temporary accommodation,

“If you’re on the West Coast or in the Nelson Tasman district, and your home was damaged by Cylone Fehi or Cyclone Gita, then contact the Temporary Accommodation Service. They will help you find somewhere to stay while your home is repaired.

“I would also urge tenants and landlords of rental properties to visit [www.tenancy.govt.nz](http://www.tenancy.govt.nz/) to familiarise themselves with their tenancy rights and obligations following an event like this.” says Ms Salesa.

Those wanting assistance to find temporary accommodation should register their details at [www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz](http://www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz/) or call 0508 754 163.
