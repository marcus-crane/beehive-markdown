Dr Chris Eichbaum has been appointed to the Board of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Finance Minister Grant Robertson says.

Dr Eichbaum is currently a Reader in Government at the Victoria University School of Government and Associate Dean in the Victoria University Business School. He holds a Doctor of Philosophy in Public Policy and has published on topics including public policy and central banking.

He previously served on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Board between 2008 and 2013. His current appointment is for a five-year term, in accordance with the Reserve Bank Act. Dr Eichbaum’s previous roles include a number of positions at Victoria University and in Government.

“Dr Eichbaum brings his experience as a previous Board member at a critical time of change. His understanding of public policy and the place of monetary policy in that context will also be very helpful as the review of the Reserve Bank Act progresses,” Grant Robertson says.

Reserve Bank chairman Professor Neil Quigley welcomed Dr Eichbaum back to the Board. “It will be invaluable having someone with Chris’ previous experience as we go through the review, including looking at the role of the Board itself,” Neil Quigley says.

Dr Eichbaum’s appointment fills the vacancy left by Rod Carr’s retirement from the board in 2017.
