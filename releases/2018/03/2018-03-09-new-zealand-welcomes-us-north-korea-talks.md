Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says the New Zealand government welcomes the United States' willingness for talks with North Korea, and North Korea’s reported openness to discuss denuclearisation.

“New Zealand remains firmly committed to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and we have always encouraged all parties to continue to work toward this goal,” says Mr Peters.

“It has always been our position to advocate for a diplomatic solution. That’s why we welcome an indication that these high-level talks may proceed,” he says.
