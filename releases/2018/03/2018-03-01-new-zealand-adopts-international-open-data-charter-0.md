  MEDIA STATEMENT

## New Zealand adopts International Open Data Charter

Statistics Minister James Shaw says ensuring government-held data is used to help achieve better outcomes for New Zealanders is a key reason why the Government is officially adopting the international Open Data Charter.

 New Zealand will confirm its commitment to the practice of openness in government when the Minister co-signs a letter with the Government Chief Data Steward, Liz MacPherson, officially adopting the Charter.

The signing will take place after Minister Shaw and Liz MacPherson have spoken at the *Open Data, Open Potential* event in Wellington this afternoon (*1:15pm*).

By opening up public agencies’ data, Mr Shaw says the government is encouraging openness as the default setting for government agencies to make non-personal, unclassified and non-confidential data freely available to anyone to use and share.

 Confidential and private information will remain protected and safeguarded.

 “As well as meeting increased user demand for open data to drive innovation, this will ensure we are accountable, transparent, and resilient in our use of data,” Mr Shaw says.

 An Open Data Action Plan, implemented by Stats NZ, will set the direction for the Charter’s implementation in New Zealand. The action plan will:

- Provide transparency about the data the government holds
- Equip agencies with better tools and resources
- Connect citizens and government.

Online tools and resources and training will lift people’s capability to innovate, to inform decision-making, and to provide evidence-based policy through data.
