Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni says Kiwi Paralympic skier Corey Peters has done New Zealand proud winning a bronze medal on the first day of the Paralympic Winter Games in PyeongChang.

“A huge congratulations to Corey Peters for his outstanding achievement,” says Ms Sepuloni. “His hard work, determination and talent has paid off and he continues to be an inspirational role model to all New Zealanders.

“Corey Peters put New Zealand on the medal table on the very first day of the competition and we are all extremely proud and excited.

“I also want to acknowledge the hard work, training and dedication of the Kiwi support team,  coaches and officials in helping prepare all three of our Para athletes for this highly competitive event.

“Like many other Kiwis across the country I will be following their progress with great interest as they continue to take on the world in the coming days.

“I wish each of our Para athletes the best of luck and look forward to congratulating them all in person when we officially welcome them home later this month.
