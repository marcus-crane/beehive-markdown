Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran has congratulated the New Zealand firm Tait Communications which has won the contract to install new technology on London’s transport network.

“Christchurch based Tait Communications has beaten out major manufacturers from around the world to do the work, worth around $30 million. It’s wonderful to see a New Zealand technology company being innovative and forward thinking to develop a resilient system for the UK capital,” Ms Curran says.

“Tait will manufacture and replace both the communications infrastructure providing coverage across Greater London and the terminal equipment on London’s fleet of almost 10,000 buses as they switch from analogue to digital communications.

“More than 31 million journeys are made across London’s public transport network each day and this is a critical communications upgrade as part of wider investment to extend and improve London’s transport network.

This government supports those who produce goods and services, export and provide decent jobs for New Zealanders. We support companies that know how to work smarter and develop new technologies such as this,” Ms Curran says.

“We are also committed to increasing skills and training so our education system provides what is needed for the young people of New Zealand to do well in this rapidly changing world and go on to produce the sort of innovations we see in the new technology being installed in London.”

The Transport for London network has more than 650 contracted bus routes served by over 9500 vehicles with a network of over 19,000 bus stops.
