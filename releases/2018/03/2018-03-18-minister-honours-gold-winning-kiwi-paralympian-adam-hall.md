Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni says gold-medal winning Paralympian Adam Hall is an inspiration to all New Zealanders.

“Adam continues to dominate the world of Para alpine skiing. Not only did he win both bronze and gold at the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games, he was also awarded the top honour of the event,” said Carmel Sepuloni.

The Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award is presented at every Paralympic Games to one male and one female athlete who each "best exemplify the spirit of the Games”.

“This award reflects Adam’s commitment, hard work and talent as an athlete as well as his contribution to his community. It is a rare and prestigious honour and the first time a New Zealander has won the award.

“Our Kiwi team has finished the games in PyeongChang with an outstanding total of three medals, one gold and two bronze, and on behalf of all New Zealanders I extend my warmest congratulations.  

“It’s important to me we show our appreciation for the talent and hard work that has taken our Paralympians to the top of their sports.

“I look forward to celebrating our Kiwi Paralympian’s success when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I officially welcome them home this week,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
