The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will help support a desperately-needed upgrade at the Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones has announced.

The airport is among the fastest-growing regional airports in the country and needs a new terminal to keep up with demand. Approximately 96,000 people used the airport during 2017, which required Air New Zealand to put on additional flights to meet the demand.

“The proposal was identified as a key priority in the Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan, which was launched in February 2016, and has received strong support from our national carrier Air New Zealand – the main user of the airport,” Shane Jones said.

“The current terminal is not fit for purpose and does not meet Air New Zealand’s requirements, while growth in passenger numbers is also putting pressure on the existing facilities.

“A new terminal will relieve congestion and cater to visitor growth by boosting capacity and improving facilities for passengers arriving in the Far North.

“The project has third-party funding and a clear rationale for central Government funding. It’s also among the few regional airports that central Government does not partially own.

“The Government will work with Far North Holdings Ltd to progress a detailed business case for the upgrade and – subject to that work and due diligence – will commit $1.7 million to the project.

“This is a project that will improve connectivity for tourism, the local community and businesses in the Far North and help support the growing tourism sector and create new jobs,” Shane Jones said.  

Building consents have been lodged and are due at the end of next month.
