Women and young people are set to benefit from $6.5 million in funding for the Samoa Private Sector Development Programme aimed at boosting employment, and helping them get into business. The programme is being announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Samoa today.

“Women and young people are strongly represented in the small and medium enterprise sector so this funding will have a direct impact on their ability to establish sustainable businesses and help Samoa achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth,” Ms Ardern says.

The funding will be focussing on improving the performance of Samoa's private sector through direct support for micro, small, and medium enterprises.

“Supporting the development of a vibrant and inclusive private sector in the Pacific is one way we can help our neighbours address youth unemployment, and ensuring women have the opportunity to set up businesses,” Ms Ardern says.

“We will partner with the Samoa Small Business Enterprise Centre to provide business development services, mentoring, training, and technical support.

“New Zealand will also work closely with the Samoan Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour to boost export opportunities for smaller and emerging exporters, support the Development Bank of Samoa's programme of small loans to start-ups, and support the development of insurance products for small businesses,” says Ms Ardern.
