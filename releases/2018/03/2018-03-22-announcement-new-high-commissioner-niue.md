Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of Kirk Yates as High Commissioner to Niue.

“Niue has a special relationship with New Zealand founded on close historical ties, unique constitutional arrangements and a common citizenship and currency,” says Mr Peters.

“Niue is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand, and Niueans have automatic right of entry into New Zealand as New Zealand citizens.

“With tourism identified as Niue’s best opportunity for sustainable economic growth, New Zealand will work closely with Niue on developing key tourism infrastructure including the upgrade of the Hanan airport runway.”

Kirk Yates is currently Agriculture Development Manager at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has held diplomatic and development positions in Indonesia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.
