Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has welcomed today’s announcement that the leaders of North and South Korea have agreed to hold talks next month.

  "A meeting between President Moon Jae-in and Chairman Kim Jong Un is a significant step towards building trust between the two Koreas,” said Mr Peters.

  “The New Zealand Government welcomes the Republic of Korea’s leadership in laying the foundations for dialogue between the two Koreas and also between North Korea and the US.”

 “The expectation now is that the talks are conducted in good faith.”

  The summit between the two Korean leaders will take place on 27 April at the Peace House on the south side of Panmunjom in the DMZ ahead of a planned summit between US President Trump and Chairman Kim.

  “New Zealand remains firmly committed to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and encourages all parties to continue to work toward this goal.”

  “The recent meeting between China’s President Xi Jinping and Chairman Kim Jong Un was positive in this respect”, Mr Peters said.
