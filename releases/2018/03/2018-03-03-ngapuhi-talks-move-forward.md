Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little met with representatives of Ngāpuhi this weekend to discuss ways to progress redress negotiations for the iwi.

The discussions comprised representatives from Tūhoronuku and Te Kotahitanga and were held at Parliament.

“I’m pleased with the tone of the discussions. I considered the talks helpful and constructive.”

“The Ngāpuhi representatives will report back to the hāpu and iwi on the issues discussed. Further discussions will take place shortly, after Easter,” said Mr Little.
