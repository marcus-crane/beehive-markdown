Foreign Affairs Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is travelling to Tahiti today to represent New Zealand at a three-day Pacific business event that will be opened by French Polynesian President Édouard Fritch.

“Being able to hear first-hand from key Pacific government and private sector leaders on trade and economic matters will be valuable for creating regional trade and economic business links,” Mr Tabuteau says.

Private sector organisation South Pacific Employers’ Representation in French Polynesia is hosting the Pacific Business Days event and has invited trade and economic ministers from the Pacific Islands Forum, as well as private sector representatives.

“I look forward to the opportunity to strengthen our ties with French Polynesia, which is one of the newest members of the Pacific Islands Forum.”
