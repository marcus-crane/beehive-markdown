Work on a major housing redevelopment to build 82 new state homes in the Auckland suburb of New Lynn began today, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford has announced.

“This project is a great example of how Housing NZ is redeveloping its aging stock to provide modern, warm and dry homes that fully utilise Crown land.

“When finished, this redevelopment will house up to 292 Aucklanders. These homes will be designed and built to modern standards, and include double-glazing, insulation, thermal curtains, carpet, and low-maintenance plantings.

“Importantly, they are located close to the New Lynn town centre and near public transport.”

“In the not too distant past, it was the site of 16 state houses built in the 1940s. They no longer matched the needs of today’s Housing NZ tenants,” Phil Twyford says.

The start of construction at Thom Street was celebrated today by local iwi, dignitaries and members of the community.

Phil Twyford says building more state houses is a crucial part of addressing the national housing crisis.

“Not only will it help reduce homelessness, it will take some of the pressure off our limited private rental market,” he says.

**Background:**

- The first homes will be completed within the first half of 2019 and the entire development completed mid-2020.
- The Housing NZ site at 1-12 Thom St, 14-16 Islington Ave and 47-51 Margan Ave, New Lynn once accommodated 8 two-bedroom, 6 three-bedroom and 2 four-bedroom houses on an 11,046 sqm site.
- The redevelopment will see the construction of 82 new homes using ten different dwelling typologies: seven two storey standalone units, 27 two storey townhouses, and 48 apartment units situated in three, three-level walk up apartment buildings.
