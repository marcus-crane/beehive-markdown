Establishing cellphone services for Minginui will support the scaling up of the Minginui nursery owned by Ngāti Whare Holdings, from commercial to industrial size for the production of native forestry grade seedlings, Associate Minister of Agriculture, Hon Meka Whaitiri announced today. 

“Included in Hon Shane Jones announcement of $5.8 million from the [Provincial Growth Fund](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/provincial-growth-fund-open-business) (PGF) is a contribution towards covering the costs to bring the cellphone service to Minginui village in the Whirinaki Forest which will be up and running shortly. 

“This coverage will enable the nursery to function effectively and efficiently in a modern competitive business environment and support this community,” says Meka Whaitiri, who has ministerial responsibility for primary sector skills development and Maori agribusiness. 

“This service will build on Ngāti Whare’s previous investment ($40,000) in the wireless broadband infrastructure that is already in place and Ngāti Whare’s  practice of investing in its social infrastructure. 

“The lift in staff at the nursery from nine employees to 90 creates opportunity for locals, many of whom will require training and skills development in order to be ready for employment.  Having technology solutions to support training will be vital. 

“The opportunity to develop science and technology skills while working and living in Minginui is also exciting and will equip locals with transferable skills across the primary industries. 

“I know, like Ngāti Whare does, the impact this can have on reinvigorating the community, improving social cohesion, supporting better outcomes, and lifting the goals their rangatahi set for themselves, Meka Whaitiri said.
