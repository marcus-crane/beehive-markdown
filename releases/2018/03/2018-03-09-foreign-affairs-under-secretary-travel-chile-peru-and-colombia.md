Foreign Affairs Parliamentary Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is travelling to Latin America this week. He will represent New Zealand at the inauguration of the President-elect of Chile, Sebastian Piñera, and formally open New Zealand’s Embassy in Colombia.

“I look forward to representing New Zealand at the President’s inauguration this weekend and meeting a wide range of senior political figures from across Latin America,” says Mr Tabuteau.

“The opportunities for New Zealand in Latin America are exciting and we are looking to strengthen our relations in the region,” he says.

Mr Tabuteau will also travel to Peru to meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Congressional Peru-New Zealand League, and to speak at the Pacific Alliance Observatory at the University of the Pacific. 

He will then travel to Bogotá, Colombia to formally open New Zealand’s newest Embassy, and undertake political consultations with the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs.

“Our new Embassy in Colombia shows we are committed to deepening our engagement with the region,” Mr Tabuteau says.
