A new public housing development opens in Mangere today, providing warm, dry and safe homes for five families just in time for winter, Associate Housing and Urban Development Minister Jenny Salesa says.

“While this project was initiated under the previous government, the current government welcomes its opening. More public housing means less families in desperate living conditions.

“The five homes in this development will cater to mainly Maori and Pacific families. The social housing register shows that by the end of 2017, there were over 3,200 Auckland households on the register, most of them Maori and Pacific.

“While five new houses for five families may seem like a drop in the bucket, these houses have two or five bedrooms, which means big families can be housed,” Jenny Salesa said. 

The development was funded by Te Taha Maori Property Trust, and will receive on-going support from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). The building of the development has been project managed by Airedale Property Trust.   

Airedale Property Trust’s Chief Executive  Bruce Stone acknowledged the role of Te Taha Maori Property Trust, in getting the houses built. 

“This project would not have been possible without that Trust financing the development. It shows their commitment to providing public housing to families in need,” he said.

The development on Massey Road is one of two Mangere properties Airedale Property Trust is involved with in partnership with MSD.  The other development, a joint project with Lotofale'ia Tongan Methodist Parish’s Matanikolo Housing Project is expected to open later this year.

“This Government is committed to increasing the supply of long-term public housing to support the needs of low income people and families,” Jenny Salesa said.
