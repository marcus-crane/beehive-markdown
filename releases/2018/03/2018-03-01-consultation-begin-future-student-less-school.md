Consultation will begin on the future of Tuturumuri School in rural Wairarapa, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today.

“Tuturumuri School is a small rural school that has played an important part in its community, but nonetheless has seen its roll decline to zero over a number of years,” Mr Hipkins says.

“In term three last year the school lost its last three students and the small number of other school-age children living in Tuturumuri already attend other schools in South Wairarapa.

“New students were expected to enrol at the start of this term, but that did not happen. However, two enrolments from a family returning to the area have recently been received,” Mr Hipkins said.  

“Despite these new enrolments we need to seriously consider whether keeping this school open is the best use of taxpayer money. I’ve asked the Ministry of Education to begin consultation on the possible closure of the school.

“This is a legal process and includes the school’s Board consulting with their community and the Ministry consulting with the Boards of schools whose roll might be affected.” 

The former Principal and Board Chair resigned at the end of last year, Mr Hipkins said.

There are a number of vacancies on the Board and a Limited Statutory Manager was recently appointed to support the Board.

This consultation process will take around four weeks, and feedback is due by end March.
