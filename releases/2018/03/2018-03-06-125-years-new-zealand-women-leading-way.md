Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter has today launched a [programme to celebrate the 125th anniversary of women’s suffrage](http://women.govt.nz/about/new-zealand-women/history/suffrage-125/events-celebrations) at an event hosted by the Governor-General Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy.

“It is 125 years since women organised and fought for their human right to vote, and New Zealand led the world in women’s rights,” says Ms Genter.

“While we acknowledge this historic achievement, and how far we have come as the first country in the world where all women could vote, it’s also a time to build a more inclusive and fairer society together.

“Many organisations across New Zealand are holding events and activities to celebrate this occasion. The Ministry for Women’s role is to co-ordinate these events and provide a central presence for the anniversary.

“I encourage community groups and feminists across New Zealand to organise events to celebrate our past, and look forward to the next challenges.

“As a Government, we are focused on improving New Zealand women and girls lives.

“In the first 100 days of the new Government, we extended paid parental leave and we committed to enacting law to enable women to achieve pay equity.

“We are working hard to further our efforts in domestic and sexual violence, as well as sexual harassment.

“I support the groundbreaking #metoo campaign in elevating women’s voices and insisting on change on sexual harassment.

“I am proud of our values as a society but there is more we must do. I wish to use the opportunities this anniversary presents to build better lives for New Zealand women and girls,” says Ms Genter.
