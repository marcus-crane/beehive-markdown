Auckland Barrister Peter Andrew has been appointed an Associate Judge of the High Court, Attorney‑General David Parker announced today.

Associate Judge Andrew graduated from the University of Otago in 1984 with a BA and an LLB, and joined the Auckland Crown Solicitor’s office, Meredith Connell & Co.

 In 1990, after studying with the University of Kiel in Germany and graduating with an LLM in Public International Law, he joined the Auckland office of Russell McVeagh as a senior solicitor. He practiced in the employment law and commercial litigation fields.

 From 1993 to 1999 Associate Judge Andrew was a Crown Counsel in the Treaty Issues and International Law Team at Crown Law, representing the Crown in public law litigation in the courts at all levels, and as a member of the Crown negotiating team for Treaty of Waitangi settlements in relation to Ngāi Tahu and Tūrangi.

 In 1999 Associate Judge Andrew left Crown Law to join the independent Bar.  As a Barrister, he specialised in public law and civil litigation, including litigation over Treaty settlements and trust and equity litigation in the specialist Maori Land Courts.
