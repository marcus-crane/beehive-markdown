Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says the New Zealand government is further expressing its grave concerns at the ongoing situation in Eastern Ghouta, Syria.

Despite the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2401 ordering a cessation of hostilities for 30 consecutive days, fighting in Eastern Ghouta has continued unabated. This has restricted access for much needed humanitarian aid.

“We call on the Syrian Government to end its indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas. We are also disturbed by reports of chemical weapons use against Eastern Ghouta’s civilian population, and the specific targeting of hospitals and medical workers,” Mr Peters said.

“Preventing the passage of aid is unacceptable. All parties should implement Resolution 2401 immediately in order to ease the suffering of the people of Eastern Ghouta.

“New Zealand continues to call for all parties to the Syrian conflict to cease violence. This ultimately will be the only way to bring peace to the people of Syria,” he said.

Since 2011, New Zealand has provided $23.5 million to the Syrian crisis. Last month Mr Peters announced a further $1.5 million contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross’s humanitarian work in Syria.
