The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doubling its annual contribution to Fulbright New Zealand to $1.35 million, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says.

“The increased funding from 1 July 2018 reflects the high value New Zealand places on educational and cultural exchanges between New Zealand and the United States, and the promotion of ideas and understanding that come from it.

“Fulbright New Zealand award recipients are among the best and brightest scholars New Zealand has to offer and contribute hugely to the intellectual, political, social and cultural fabric of New Zealand,” Mr Peters says.

The contribution will fund an increase in the number of educational grants, provide the opportunity for funding a second year of study for Fulbright New Zealand graduate students, and strengthen the financial support to individual Fulbright New Zealand graduates and scholars.

Mr Peters is an Honorary Chair of the Fulbright New Zealand board, along with US Ambassador Scott Brown.

Fulbright New Zealand is an international educational exchange programme established between New Zealand and the United States in 1948, and is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year.

“The programme has enabled more than 1,800 New Zealanders to study, research and teach in some of the United States’ most prestigious universities. It is an excellent pathway for the development and strengthening of people-to-people ties between our two countries,” Mr Peters says.
