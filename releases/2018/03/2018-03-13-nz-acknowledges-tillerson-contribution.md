Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says he wishes to acknowledge the contribution former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has made for the working relationship with New Zealand, and wish him and Mrs Tillerson well for the future.

“Speaking of the future, we look forward to building a similar productive working relationship with the President’s nominee for Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, following Senate confirmation processes.”
