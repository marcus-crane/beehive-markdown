Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters have announced that New Zealand will impose travel restrictions on individuals expelled by other countries following the Salisbury attack.

“We will be asking our security partners to provide those names to us,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“Those names will then be placed on a travel ban list to ensure that individuals who have been found to undertake activities incompatible with their diplomatic status in other countries do not enter New Zealand.”

The Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that New Zealand had clearly registered its deep concern over the Salisbury attack and the inadequate response from Russia to justified questions. New Zealand’s views have been conveyed through media statements and in direct discussions with the Russian Government, both in Wellington and in Moscow.

“Like our partners, we are raising questions on legitimate matters of international concern,” said Winston Peters. 

 “As we said soon after the Salisbury attack, there are serious questions here that Russia needs to answer.”
