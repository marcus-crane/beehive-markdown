Minister of Defence Ron Mark has today met with his Australian counterpart Senator Marise Payne in Wellington for the annual Defence Ministers’ Meeting.

“New Zealand and Australia have a very close Defence relationship,” says Mr Mark.  “This is currently on display in Papua New Guinea where New Zealand and Australian Defence personnel are working hard to deliver aid to the earthquake stricken highlands, and in all the deployments around the world where we stand side by side”.

“Today’s meeting was a great opportunity to discuss shared security concerns, and to explore ways to work better together.  Today, as alliance partners, we are also releasing an updated Joint Statement on Closer Defence Relations.

“The statement acknowledges our mutual commitment to working side-by-side effectively and efficiently for our shared security interests, and sets out the guiding principles that underline our partnership.  It also reiterates our commitment to the South Pacific and our close friends in the region,” says Mr Mark.

Refreshed Closer Defence Relations between New Zealand and Australia will follow six principles:

- We are sovereign, independent states working together both regionally and globally for our mutual security.
- We share an interest in promoting and projecting a region that is secure, open and prosperous, with a particular focus on our cooperation in South Pacific;
- Our defence and security partnership is open, based on mutual respect, and enduring;
- We will work together to deliver capability in the most cost-effective way;
- We will develop and harness the skills of our people and to enhance cooperation; and
- We will focus on, and commit resources to, practical collaborative activities to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.
