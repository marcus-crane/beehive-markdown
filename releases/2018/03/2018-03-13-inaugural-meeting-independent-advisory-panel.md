The Provincial Growth Fund’s (PGF) Independent Advisory Panel held its inaugural meeting in Wellington today, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones says.

The panel – chaired by Mr Rodger Finlay – will play an important role over the lifetime of the PGF and will provide advice to officials and ministers on proposals.

“The panel will add great value to the PGF and I’m confident we’ve got the right people with the right mix of skills, expertise and experience,” Shane Jones said.

“After meeting with the panel today, it’s clear that each member has a passion for regional economic development and for what this Government is undertaking.

“This is the largest capital investment New Zealand’s provinces have seen in decades and the panel will be crucial in assessing proposals and providing the Government with guidance and advice.

“Today, I’ve asked the panel to look at the Ōpōtiki Harbour development – a project which has been in the pipeline for some years.

“The costs of the project have increased significantly because of engineering and geotechnical requirements. While the PGF is intended to boost our regional economies and provide opportunity, we must always be prudent and responsible with taxpayer money.

“The panel will report back to me on the project before the Government makes any final decision on it,” Shane Jones said.
