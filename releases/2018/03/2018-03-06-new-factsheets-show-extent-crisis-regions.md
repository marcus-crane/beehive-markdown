New regional factsheets being published for the first time today show the housing crisis is not just an issue for Auckland but is now a challenge for our regions, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford says.

Factsheets for 11 regions are now available on the [Ministry of Social Development website](http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/housing/quarterly-factsheets/2017.html) and contain the latest data – including regionally-specific public housing supply figures, government support, transitional housing and numbers on the public housing waiting list – from the December 2017 quarter.

“The Labour-led Government isn’t shying away from the housing challenges our regions face. We want the public to understand the extent of these issues,” Phil Twyford says.

“This data gives the regions the information they need to work with central government on solutions to increase the supply of housing in their areas.

“This information is critical for the Government to understand what is happening at the grass roots level. We know what is happening at a national and main centres level, Auckland especially, but these factsheets shed new light on what is happening in heartland New Zealand in places like Northland, East Coast, Bay of Plenty and Canterbury.

“Everyone – no matter where they live – should have a warm, dry, safe home. Solving the national housing crisis is a massive task and one we are rolling up our sleeves and getting on with.

“This is why last week I announced the first tranche of up to 155 new state houses to be built in the regions by the middle of this year. And there will be more to come,” Phil Twyford says.
