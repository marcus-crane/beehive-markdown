Opportunities and challenges for rural women was the key theme of New Zealand’s National Statement at the Sixty-Second Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 62) delivered today in New York.

The National Statement was delivered by Minister for Women Hon Julie Anne Genter.

“New Zealand rural women’s continued resilience and innovative spirit were represented on the world stage today,” Ms Genter said.

“The Provincial Growth Fund will ensure more money is invested in our regions, and this will benefit our rural women.

“New Zealand recognises that women are disproportionately affected by climate change in weather dependent rural economies.

“New Zealand supports the Gender Action Plan, recently adopted by the United Nations, which seeks to promote gender-responsive climate policy.

“Reproductive and sexual health services and rights continue to be of particular importance in New Zealand, and around the world. 

“We were able to shine a light on rural New Zealand women who throughout history have been the backbone of rural New Zealand communities.

“We are pleased their leadership is increasingly being recognised. An example of this recognition is the appointment of Katie Milne as Federated Farmers president, making her the first woman president in its 118 year history”, said Ms Genter.
