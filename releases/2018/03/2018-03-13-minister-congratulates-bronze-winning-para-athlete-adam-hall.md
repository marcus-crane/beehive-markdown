Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni congratulates Kiwi Paralympic alpine skier Adam Hall who has won New Zealand’s second Bronze medal at the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in PyeongChang.

“My warmest congratulations goes out to Adam for his outstanding achievement in PyeongChang,” said Carmel Sepuloni.

“Maintaining a place at the top of his sport for more than a decade is an impressive display of both talent and determination. 

“A great presence in the international para alpine skiing scene, and now representing us at his fourth Paralympics, Adam continues to prove he’s a force to be reckoned with.

“Like many New Zealander’s across the country I’m excited at our progress, and proud of our Kiwi team’s efforts.

“There is a huge amount of work that goes into making sure we’re represented at the Paralympics, and everyone involved should be very proud.

“I look forward to meeting our Para athletes to offer my congratulations in person, and thank them for their efforts, when we officially welcome them home later this month,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
