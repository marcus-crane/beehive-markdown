Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced that three New Zealand Transport Accident Investigators will assist with the investigation into the sinking of the MV Butiraoi in Kiribati.

“New Zealand was deeply saddened by the sinking of the MV Butiraoi in January this year and the large loss of life,” Mr Peters says.

“In response to a request from the Government of Kiribati New Zealand has agreed to provide funding to send three staff from the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission to assist Kiribati’s Ministry of Transport with the investigation. 

“The New Zealand Government is pleased to be able to assist Kiribati with their investigation. The Transport Accident Investigators will play a role in helping establish the causes of the accident and make recommendations for addressing safety issues.”
