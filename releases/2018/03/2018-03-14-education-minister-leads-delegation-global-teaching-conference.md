Education Minister Chris Hipkins leaves for Europe tomorrow where he will lead a New Zealand delegation at a major education conference.

Leaders and representatives of the teaching profession and education officials will accompany Mr Hipkins to the International Summit on the Teaching Profession in Lisbon on 22 March.

The Summit is aimed at identifying best practices worldwide that strengthen the teaching profession and raise student achievement. 

The delegation includes the Secretary of Education, teacher union representatives, and leaders from the early learning and Māori medium education sectors.

Before arriving in Lisbon, Mr Hipkins will discuss education matters with experts and government Ministers in Singapore, London and Edinburgh.

Mr Hipkins said the visits are a valuable opportunity to share the strengths of the New Zealand education system and learn about what others are doing. 

“Education systems the world over are grappling with similar issues including underachievement among some groups and changes to schooling that are needed to prepare students for life in a rapidly changing world. 

“We have a lot to gain by sharing our experiences and I am looking forward to hearing about what really makes a difference in other countries as we embark on our ambitious education work programme here at home.”

In Singapore, Mr Hipkins is due to meet Ng Chee Meng, Singapore’s Minister for Schools, and sign an Education Cooperation Arrangement. He will also meet Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Higher Education and Skills, and Ng Cher Pong, Chief Executive Officer, SkillsFuture Singapore Agency.

In Scotland he will meet the Chair of the General Teaching Council of Scotland, Ken Muir, and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, John Swinney.

In England he will meet with Secretary of State for Education Damian Hinds and visit the Education Institute at the University College London, one of the world’s leading education faculties. He will arrive back in New Zealand on Monday 26 March.
