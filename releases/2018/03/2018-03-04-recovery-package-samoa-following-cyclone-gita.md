Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today announced $3 million in funding to assist Samoa with its recovery work and building resilience following Cyclone Gita.

“Cyclone Gita brought flooding to low lying and coastal areas of both Samoa’s main islands, causing damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure.

“There is much work to do to recover from this and build resilience to these storms so the people of Samoa can ready themselves for these events as much as possible in the future.

“Funding announced today will be provided directly to the Samoan Government to support the recovery and building of more resilient infrastructure.”

The impact of Cyclone Gita on Samoa was the focus of the Prime Minister’s meeting with Prime Minister Tuila'epa and his Cabinet this morning. She was also briefed on the recovery work so far.

“The impact of Cyclone Gita has been felt across the region, including in New Zealand, and the Government is committed to helping communities at home and in the Pacific recover as quickly as possible,” Jacinda Ardern says.
