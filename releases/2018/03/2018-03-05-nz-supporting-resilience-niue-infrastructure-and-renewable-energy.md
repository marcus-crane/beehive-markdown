Infrastructure and renewable energy programmes are getting support today as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announces a package to improve water and roading infrastructure on Niue and further develop renewable energy generation.

“Niue’s remoteness and susceptibility to extreme weather make high quality and resilient infrastructure very important for visitors and the local population of Niue,” says Prime Minister Jacinda Arden.

“New Zealand will invest $750,000 to make immediate improvements to Niue’s roads and water network ahead of the 2018 tourism season. We have also undertaken to carry out an assessment of Niue’s long-term water infrastructure needs to safeguard the resilience of the network.

“We will provide a further $5 million to support the development of solar energy generation in Niue. This builds on the $5 million we have already provided and will help Niue meet its renewable energy target of 80 per cent by 2025**.**

“Achieving this target will create annual savings of close to $1 million for the Government of Niue, which can be applied to other development priorities such as health, education and other public services,” Ms Ardern said.

Niue and New Zealand share a close relationship built on shared citizenship and our unique constitutional arrangements.

Large increases in tourism numbers have been a major success story for Niue’s economy but they have also placed major demands on the atolls roads and water supply.

The Prime Minister is currently in Niue leading the 2018 Pacific Mission.
