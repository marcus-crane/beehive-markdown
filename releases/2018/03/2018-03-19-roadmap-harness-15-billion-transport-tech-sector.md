A new Future Technology Leadership Group will help New Zealand harness some of the $1.5 billion a year estimated value to the economy from Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) as well as the social benefits they create, Transport Minister Phil Twyford said today.

The value of the “T-Tech” industry was highlighted in a new report called *Unlocking Commercial Opportunities of Intelligent Transport Systems* (ITS) released by Business NZ today.

Phil Twyford announced the private and public sector members of the leadership group which will develop the 10-year Land Transport Technology Roadmap at the T-Tech Conference in Auckland today. The conference, hosted by ITS New Zealand, highlights international and domestic trends in urban planning, smart city initiatives, and transport technology and business models.

“Zephyr Airworks which last week announced their world leading trial of their air taxi Cora is just one example of how New Zealand can embrace change and pave the way for ITS.

“New Zealand is seen as a world leader in ITS. This group will bring together the best domestic knowledge, as well as international expertise.

“The Business NZ report focused on three areas – drones, smart logistics and autonomous self-driving vehicles – and found New Zealand has a good regulatory and business environment to benefit from ITS.

“A good example of how technology can save lives was the NZTA ‘hackathon’ Save One More Life which last weekend saw 120 developers, and tech, engineering and transport experts spend 48 hours designing ways to make our roads safer. This resulted in a new app to improve driving by teenagers and those on restricted licenses, expected to save 55 young lives a year.

“This is an exciting time for transport and technology. Intelligent Transport Systems have the potential to not only make transport more efficient, better for the environment and safer, we now know they can make a valuable contribution to New Zealand’s economy,” Phil Twyford says.
