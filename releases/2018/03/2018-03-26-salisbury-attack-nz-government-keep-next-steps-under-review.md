Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters say the New Zealand Government will keep under review what further actions it can take to support the international community over the Salisbury attack.

“We remain steadfast with our international partners in our shared concern about the Salisbury nerve agent attack,” said Jacinda Ardern. 

“While other countries have announced they are expelling undeclared Russian intelligence agents, officials have advised there are no individuals here in New Zealand who fit this profile. If there were, we would have already taken action.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says from the very beginning New Zealand has been clear in expressing its condemnation over the Salisbury attack.

“As part of our ongoing support for the United Kingdom, along with the international community, we will keep possible future actions under review and remain in close contact with our international partners,” said Winston Peters.

“In recent days the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has called in the Russian Ambassador in Wellington to reiterate our serious concern about the likely Russian source of the nerve agent used in Salisbury, and delivered the same message in Moscow,” he said.
