Minister of Health Dr David Clark is encouraging nominations for the 2018 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards to recognise our country’s unsung heroes who support health and disability services.

“I’m pleased to announce that nominations have opened today for these awards, which are a great opportunity to publicly celebrate some of the thousands of volunteers who generously give their time and energy to make our health and disability service better, whether in our hospitals or our communities,” Minister of Health Dr David Clark said. 

“From helping people to navigate their way around hospitals and health services to providing community or at home support and assistance for people who need it, health volunteers make a real difference for New Zealanders in many ways, often without seeking any recognition.

“Nominations can be for a volunteer’s long-term commitment and achievement, an outstanding success, or action above and beyond the call of duty. They come from all walks of life and of all ages. Last year’s recipients ranged from school students to older New Zealanders in their retirement years.

“One of my priorities is tackling inequity in New Zealand’s health and disability services, and I know there are many volunteers who are doing excellent work in this area.”

Last year’s overall Health Volunteer of the Year was Wellington Hospital’s Volunteer Service, established in 2005. This team of around 450 volunteers collectively puts in more than 12,000 volunteer hours each year helping patients and visitors, and providing general assistance. Last year, they produced about 9,000 garments for babies, children and older patients, and contributed greatly to fundraising.

“If you or your organisation knows an individual or team of volunteers who deserve to be recognised, I encourage you to nominate them for one of these awards,” David Clark said.

Nominations close on 18 May 2018. The awards will be presented during National Volunteer Week, 17 - 23 June.
