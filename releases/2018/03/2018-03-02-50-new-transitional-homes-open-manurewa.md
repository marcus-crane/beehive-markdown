More than 600 people will have a warm, safe and dry place to live over the next three years, when a new development of 50 homes is opened today in Auckland, says Associate Housing and Urban Development Minister Jenny Salesa.

“The new studio units, located on Browns Road in Manurewa, will ensure 200 people have a place to go immediately, and are not left out in the cold, while they are supported to find a longer term housing option.” says Ms Salesa.

The development is a joint project between the Ministry of Social Development and Housing New Zealand, and will be managed by the Salvation Army.

Salvation Army will provide a range of tailored social support services to people while they live there. They will also help them to secure more permanent accommodation.

Salvation Army Supportive Accommodation National Director Lieutenant-Colonel Lynette Hutson says the Army is excited to be involved helping address high levels of housing need in South Auckland—especially for vulnerable single people.

“The ongoing support we will provide will assist with maintaining their tenancy when they experience challenges. This is a great outcome both for the individuals, their families, and the community,” Ms Hutson says.

“The Government’s goal is to make sure everyone in need of safe, secure housing has somewhere to stay in both the immediate and long term’ says Ms Salesa.

 

*Note to editor:*

Transitional housing provides short-term housing for people with an immediate housing need while support is put in place to transition them into sustainable housing on a long-term basis. 

Places are managed by specialist emergency housing providers who are skilled in providing a range of social and tenancy-related support.

There are currently just over 1,900 transitional housing places secured for tenanting across New Zealand, which can support around 7,600 households per year.
