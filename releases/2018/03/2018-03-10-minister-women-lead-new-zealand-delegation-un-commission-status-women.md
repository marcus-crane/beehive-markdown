Hon Julie Anne Genter, Minister for Women, leaves today to lead the New Zealand Government Delegation at the Sixty-Second Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).

“I will be proudly representing New Zealand at the UN in New York and working to ensure that New Zealand continues to lead the world in advancing women and girl’s rights,” Ms Genter said.

“125 years after women fought and gained their human right to vote in Aotearoa, we still have issues such as the gender pay gap to address.

“I look forward to hearing from other countries with what they are doing to address gender equality issues.

“Our participation at CSW is an opportunity to help lift New Zealand’s performance, and to support the Pacific region, in improving the lives of women across the Pacific region and globally,” Ms Genter said.

CSW is the principal global policy‑making body dedicated exclusively to gender equality and the advancement of women. This year’s theme is *“Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.”*

Ms Genter will deliver New Zealand’s National Statement in the General Discussion forum at CSW.
