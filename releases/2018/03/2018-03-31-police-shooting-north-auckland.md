Police Minister Stuart Nash has offered his sympathies to the family of the man shot by Police this morning near Puhoi.

“I have been briefed by Commissioner Mike Bush,” Mr Nash says.

“However until we know the full circumstances of the event I will refrain from further comment. My sympathies and condolences go out to the young man’s family.

“It is important to also acknowledge the impact this shooting will have on the officers and other emergency services personnel involved. We trust Police to make the best decisions in extreme situations and the effects of their actions will stay with them. I encourage the officers and other staff to take advantage of all the support and assistance available to them to help deal with this shooting,” Mr Nash said.
