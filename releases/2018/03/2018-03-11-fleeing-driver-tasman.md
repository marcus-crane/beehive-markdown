*Minister of Police Stuart Nash has issued the following statement in response to the fatal crash in Tasman District this morning.*

This crash is a tragedy for the families of those who have died and for the Police officers involved in the incident.

My sympathies are with all of those affected by this, including the other motorists and members of the public who stopped to help, and the emergency response personnel from ambulance and fire services.

Police have to make instant decisions based on the circumstances in front of them at the time, and the road and traffic conditions as well.

Fleeing drivers are always a highly challenging law and order event for Police. Currently they deal with about 300 of these complex situations every month.

Police are currently working closely with the IPCA to review their policies and practices around these unpredictable events and I have asked for an update on progress in this review which is due to be completed later this year.

I also extend my sympathies to the families of five others who have died on the roads this weekend. Our road toll is too high and police are working hard to improve safety and prevent death and injury for all road users.
