**NZ joins condemnation of nerve agent attack**

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says the New Zealand Government has grave concerns over the use of a chemical nerve agent in the United Kingdom resulting in critically serious injuries to some of those exposed.

“We share and support the concerns expressed by other nations about such use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons as a tool of war, or for murder or assassination is totally repugnant, and this incident is an affront to global rules and norms. As New Zealand has stated on many occasions, we are deeply disturbed at any use of chemical substances banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention,” he said.

“The New Zealand Government will express its views at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Executive Council meeting taking place this week in The Hague. We expect that any other OPCW member with information about this incident would support a full and thorough investigation so that the perpetrators are held to account.

“How this military grade nerve agent was transported from Russia and released abroad is the key issue here, and warrants urgent international investigation,” said Mr Peters.
