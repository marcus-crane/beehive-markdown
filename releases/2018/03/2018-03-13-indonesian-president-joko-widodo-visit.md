Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo will visit New Zealand from 18 to 19 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Indonesia. President Widodo’s visit is the centre-piece of a year-long series of engagements to celebrate this significant milestone and strengthen the relationship,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Indonesia has the world’s fourth largest population and is the world’s third largest democracy. It is the largest economy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is a major market for New Zealand meat, dairy and agriculture exports, with total two-way goods trade of NZ$1.76 billion in 2017.

President Widodo will be visiting New Zealand for the first time and will be accompanied by his wife, Ministers and a business delegation.

“President Widodo’s visit is an opportunity to increase trade between New Zealand and Indonesia as well as discuss how we can tackle issues of common interest in the Asia-Pacific region,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Prime Minister Ardern first met President Widodo at the East Asia Summit in November 2017.
