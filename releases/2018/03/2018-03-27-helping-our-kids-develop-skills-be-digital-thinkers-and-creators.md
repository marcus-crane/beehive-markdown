A $6 million ‘All Equity Fund’ launched today will give less-advantaged students better access to digital tools, skills and knowledge, Education Minister Chris Hipkins says.

The Digital Technologies for All Equity Fund is one part of a $38 million Government funding package to make digital technologies more accessible for school kids. This includes around $24 million to help teachers and kaiako prepare to teach the new curriculum [content](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-digital-technologies-schools-and-kura).

The All Equity Fund is available for 12,500 children a year over three years.

“It’s really important that all children are given the opportunity to improve their digital literacy to prepare them for the modern workforce.

“The fund is about ensuring that students who may otherwise have limited access to digital technologies aren’t missing out.

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa) and Karrikins Group have been selected to partner with the Ministry of Education to deliver innovative programmes that captures students’ imagination,” Chris Hipkins says.

Karrikins Group New Zealand General Manager Michelle Kazor says its ‘Digital Ignition’ programme will include robots, 3D printing and coding and overall emphasise an ability to ‘think digitally’.

Te Papa will partner with other museums and bring technology-rich learning to students, who will be able to tell their own stories as they build their knowledge, Te Papa Chief Executive Geraint Martin says.

The two different programmes will support learning in a culturally relevant and meaningful way and open up further options for children. Karrikins Group and Te Papa will work in partnership with schools/kura across the country to achieve these outcomes.
