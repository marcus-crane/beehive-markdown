Customs seizures  at our border in 2017 prevented at least a $1 billion of potential harm to New Zealand communities, says the Minister of Customs Hon Meka Whaitiri.

Methamphetamine and its precursor ephedrine made up the bulk of the seizures at nearly 897kg. Other interceptions included cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, LSD, Class C analogues, psychoactive substances, plus over 238,000 ‘items’ such as tabs and pills.  

“I congratulate Customs for stopping over a tonne of illicit drugs entering the country preventing potential harm to New Zealanders. This is fantastic work. 

“When I started in my role as Minister, I was clear to my officials that keeping methamphetamine off our streets and away from communities should be a big priority.  

“These destructive drugs would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars on the streets – it’s pleasing to know these seizures would have stopped many criminals in their tracks. 

“More importantly, these seizures have protected our families, whānau and the wider community from a considerable amount of potential harm.  

“As Minister of Customs, it is so heartening to know the passion and commitment that our Customs officers share to protect this  country. I commend Customs and the great job they are doing,” says Meka Whaitiri.
