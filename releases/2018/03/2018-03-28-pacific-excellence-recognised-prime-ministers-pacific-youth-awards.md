Excellence and achievement in commerce, the arts, sports, community and leadership among Pacific youth is being celebrated tonight at the prestigious 2018 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards. 

Pacific Peoples Minister Aupito William Sio says the awards provide an opportunity for high achieving Pacific youth in New Zealand to be recognised for their important contribution to the country by the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern.

The nine exceptional individuals aged between 17 and 24 will be presented awards by the Prime Minister at a ceremony held at the Fale o Samoa, in Mangere, hosted by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples.

“It’s my expectation that these recipients and all those who have gone before contribute to making New Zealand a far better and caring country for all New Zealanders,” Aupito William Sio says.

“Each of their respective awards recognises their contribution to society, as well as excellence in their academic work, or demonstrating a skill in business. 

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards recognises and celebrates Pacific youth success while also creating a network of young emerging Pacific leaders, showcasing Pacific talent to key stakeholders.  

As one of the fastest growing and youngest populations in New Zealand, the Government is committed to ensuring the Pacific community thrives and to help individuals achieve their goals and aspirations.  

The 2018 award winners have also been offered personalised leadership development opportunities through the Ministry’s partnership with Leadership New Zealand.  

“I want to grow the next crop of Pacific leaders who are not only achieving excellence in their respective fields, but who are also prepared to give back to their community and hold fast to their heritage of languages and culture.

“Being a recipient of the Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards not only makes their families and communities extremely proud and empowered, but it opens new doors for them, while offering new opportunities for their careers and lives.  

“Congratulations to all the winners tonight and to your families for providing support.  We are all incredibly proud of what you have achieved,” Aupito William Sio says.
