A partnership between the Ministry of Youth Development (MYD) and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu designed to support rangatahi located in the Ngāi Tahu takiwā will continue over the next 18 months, Minister for Youth Peeni Henare announced today.

“I am pleased to commit to this renewed partnership with Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu which will see the creation of rangatahi-led leadership, mentoring and volunteering initiatives which utilise a Ngāi Tahu kaupapa-based approach,” Peeni Henare said.

Funding is made through MYD’s Partnership Fund and the Ngāi Tahu Funds, it builds on the 2017 collaboration between MYD and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu which saw 250 rangatahi take part in activities such as taiaha wananga, coding workshops, and outdoor pursuits. 

Lisa Tumahai, Kaiwhakahaere, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, says this programme will help grow opportunities for Ngāi Tahu rangatahi. 

“We will invest in programmes that will help us create tribal leaders of the future. This investment will focus on growing cultural, entrepreneurial, and leadership capacity in our rangatahi,” Lisa Tumahai said. 

“As we move forward, we hope to build on the success of this collaborative funding approach and increase government partnerships. 

Some of the rangatahi targeted by the partnership face challenges when accessing development opportunities, whether this is due to a lack of financial or social resources, or because they are living in a rural or isolated location.

“Part of this renewed funding will establish a contestable fund for Māori organisations who will deliver initiatives to rangatahi and taiohi from both Ngāi Tahu and other iwi who are living within the Ngāi Tahu takiwā. The other portion will be targeted towards continued support for successful initiatives that were delivered through the initial partnership,” Peeni Henare said.

Up to 250 young people will take part in opportunities with both partners investing $100,000 each to enable this.

“A key aspect of MYD’s direction is to support partnerships with business, philanthropic sectors, iwi, and other funders, to collectively engage with and make investment decisions to support an increase in youth development opportunities. This partnership fits well with our goal of effective collaboration and provides an opportunity to inspire and grow the leaders of tomorrow,” Peeni Henare said.
