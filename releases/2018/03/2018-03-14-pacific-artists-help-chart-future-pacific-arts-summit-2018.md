Associate Minister for Pacific Peoples, and Arts, Culture and Heritage Carmel Sepuloni will today open the Creative New Zealand Pacific Arts Summit 2018 at Te Papa in Wellington.

 The two day summit will involve more than 150 contemporary and heritage Pacific artists who will help chart the future of Pacific Arts by sharing ideas, experiences and their aspirations for the future.

A key aspect of the summit is informing the development of Creative New Zealand’s Pacific Arts Strategy, which will underpin its approach to supporting the long term development of Pacific Arts.

“The contribution Pacific arts make to the wider New Zealand arts community is significant, and it is growing,” said Carmel Sepuloni

“I am sure these two days will be full of constructive talanoa and inspiring ideas, which will help guide Creative New Zealand to support the ongoing development of a vibrant Pacific Arts sector.

“Pacific Arts make a major contribution to the unique cultural identity of our Pacific nation and are a touchstone that helps connect us all to our Pacific neighbours.

“I would like to commend the Arts Council, Creative New Zealand and its partners for putting together such a comprehensive programme that offers so many opportunities for artists to fono with other artists, arts organisations and stakeholders.

“It’s the right approach to enable the development of a future-focused, sector-led strategy that supports Pacific Arts to grow their important contribution to our unique cultural identity,” Carmel Sepuloni said. 

Creative New Zealand plans to complete its strategy later this year.
