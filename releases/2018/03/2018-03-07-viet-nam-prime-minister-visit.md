Viet Nam’s Prime Minister, Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, will visit New Zealand 12–14 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“Viet Nam is an important partner for New Zealand, and I am delighted to have this opportunity to deepen the links between our two countries.”

Viet Nam is one of the fastest growing economies in South East Asia. New Zealand’s two-way trade with the country is now worth over $1.7 billion annually and is growing rapidly. Last year almost 30,000 New Zealanders visited Viet Nam and there is significant potential for further cooperation in agriculture, aviation, education, and other trade sectors.

Prime Minister Phúc is visiting New Zealand for the first time as Prime Minister, and will be accompanied by his wife, senior Ministers and business leaders.

“Viet Nam is an influential member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The visit is a valuable chance to discuss pressing regional issues so I’m looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Phúc again,” said Ms Ardern.

Note: New Zealand and Viet Nam celebrated 40 years of diplomatic relations in 2015. Prime Minister Ardern met Prime Minister Phúc when she visited Viet Nam last November to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Da Nang.
