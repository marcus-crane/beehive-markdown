Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has appointed senior business leader and former diplomat Philip Turner as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Republic of Korea.

Mr Turner has extensive experience working in North Asia. He has held a number of senior positions at Fonterra, and most recently as Director of Global Stakeholder Affairs. Prior to joining Fonterra, Mr Turner held a number of roles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including postings to the New Zealand Embassies in Tokyo and Brussels.

“Mr Turner’s background as both as a diplomat and a policy leader, as well as his extensive private sector experience, will help us grow our economic links, while continuing to deepen the political and people-to-people ties which underpin this vibrant relationship,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand and Korea are natural partners in the Asia-Pacific. We have a wide-ranging and modern partnership, built upon our shared sacrifice during the Korean War.

“Since the entry into force of our Free Trade Agreement with Korea in 2015, trade between our two countries has continued to flourish. There is scope for both sides to grow these benefits.

“We work closely with the Republic of Korea on North Korean nuclear issues, and New Zealand continues to support a diplomatic and peaceful resolution to the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr Peters said.
