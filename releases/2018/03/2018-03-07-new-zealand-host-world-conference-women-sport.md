Minister for Sport and Recreation Grant Robertson and Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter today welcomed New Zealand’s successful bid to host the 8th International Working Group on Women in Sport secretariat from 2018 to 2022.

The honour will culminate with New Zealand hosting the 8th World Conference of the International Working Group on Women in Sport (IWG) in Auckland in 2022. The bid was a joint effort by Sport NZ, Women in Sport Aotearoa (WISPA), the NZ Olympic Committee and Auckland Tourism, Events & Economic Development (ATEED).

“The vision of the IWG is sustainable sporting culture that enables and values the full involvement of women in every aspect of sport – a vision our Government shares,” Grant Robertson says.

“Hosting this influential event will provide an opportunity to connect New Zealand with the global conversation, highlight our achievements and focus our efforts and aspirations on achieving much more.”

“Tomorrow is International Women’s Day, a global day celebrating the immense achievements of women, and is a call to action to accelerate gender equity around the world,” says Julie Anne Genter.

“The hosting of the IWG World Conference and work of the Wonderful Group are reminders of the important role sport can play in this.”

Grant Robertson was in Auckland today to help launch the newly formed Wonderful Group’s ‘It Takes Two’ mentoring programme. The programme helps young women with ambitions to work in sport media by drawing on the experience of women already in the industry, in turn empowering these mentors to strive for leadership roles.

“Increasing the profile, participation and leadership contribution of women across our sporting sector is a key priority for the Sport and Recreation and Women’s portfolios,” Grant Robertson and Julie Anne Genter say.
