Ethnic Communities Minister Jenny Salesa welcomes over 150 members of the Indian community to Parliament tonight to celebrate Holi, the Hindu Festival of colour.

“Holi is celebrated in India and in communities all over the globe where Indians have settled. People irrespective of caste, gender and age take to the streets, to throw coloured water and powder at one another. It is a great leveller,”  Jenny Salesa said.

“I am honoured to have Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern as keynote speaker tonight and while we won’t be throwing water around the Banquet Hall, people can choose to have ‘gulal’ or coloured powder placed on their foreheads, showing we are equal.

“It is fitting that Holi, a celebration about connection and equality, is held at Parliament on the eve of Race Relations day.

“Race Relations Day was first observed in New Zealand in 2003 and like Holi, it emphasises giving equal opportunities to everyone, regardless of ethnicity or religion and I think that’s key to improving our race relations and empowering Ethnic Communities in Aotearoa today,” Jenny Salesa said.
