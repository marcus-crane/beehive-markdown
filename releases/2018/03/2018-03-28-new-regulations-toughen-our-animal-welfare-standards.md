Cabinet has approved a raft of new regulations to strengthen our animal welfare system, says Associate Minister of Agriculture responsible for animal welfare Hon Meka Whaitiri.

“As the dedicated animal welfare minister in this coalition government I am proud of these regulations which will have a significant effect on the humane treatment of our animals.

“Most animal welfare offences are of a lower level of seriousness, which may not warrant a prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act. These new regulations will introduce penalties and fines to deal with this sort of animal mistreatment.

“The new regulations will mean that people who leave distressed dogs in hot cars will be liable for a $300 fine and people can now be fined where sick or injured farm animals are transported to slaughter plants.

 “These regulations were developed over three years working with industry and advocacy groups, and after formal public consultation. Over 1400 submissions were received and analysed during that process. I have to say that the majority of those submissions supported the regulations.

“These changes are part of my vision for the sector which will see better outcomes for our animals and reinforce our international reputation for a strong record on animal welfare in agriculture,“ says Meka Whaitiri.
