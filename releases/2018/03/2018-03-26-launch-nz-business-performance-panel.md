A new resource for small and medium enterprises is being launched by Small Business Minister Stuart Nash.

Mr Nash has announced details of the New Zealand Business Performance Panel, which brings together experts from top universities in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and local organisations, such as the Productivity Commission.

Mr Nash says one of its primary objectives is to help small businesses increase their productivity.

“Small businesses are very diverse, and many of them rely on one person performing many roles. As business owners juggle competing priorities they may not know how or where to tap into the latest expert advice.

 “The Business Performance Panel is a way to share knowledge from local and overseas experts through the website business.govt.nz. It means Kiwi businesses will have access to advice from some of the world’s thought leaders on business performance, tailored to suit a New Zealand business environment.”

The first suite of resources released by the New Zealand Business Performance Panel is focused on management and leadership. The information includes case studies and a free self-assessment tool.  This content will be available on [business.govt.nz.](https://www.business.govt.nz/)

“Improving managerial skills is recognised by the OECD as the single greatest action businesses can take to raise their own productivity.  This point has been supported during research by both the Productivity Commission and business.govt.nz.

“I look forward to seeing more of the resources the Panel creates to help Kiwi businesses, as they continue to draw on expert advice from the global frontiers of innovation and business,” Mr Nash said.

*The Panel members are: Dr Julia Richardson, Curtin University, Perth, WA; Dr Anindya Sen, Otago University; Paul Conway, NZ Productivity Commission; Donna Purdue, MBIE; Daniel Hellyer, Deloitte; and Dr Pranab Majumder, Duke University, Durham, NC.*
