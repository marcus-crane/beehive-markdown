Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis has announced the establishment of a working group to develop solutions to freedom camping issues.

This morning Mr Davis met with 32 mayors and deputy mayors from across the country about freedom camping.

“The meeting was very productive and I want to thank the mayors and deputy mayors for sharing their views and experiences. It was really valuable. The issues with freedom camping are not insurmountable and there is a clear willingness from everyone to work together and find solutions.

“Freedom camping is a complex area. Freedom campers bring economic benefits to our regions, but the behaviour of a small percentage and the sheer increase in volume of freedom campers is causing real problems for some councils.

“The mayors talked about the need for a more consistent approach, including around enforcement and signage, more infrastructure needed in some areas, and the need to look at the Freedom Camping Act. 

“The mayors fully supported the establishment of a working group – made up of central and local government, the tourism industry, and other stakeholders – to discuss and work through the issues. 

“I am keen to get the working group established as quickly as possible. We need to come up with some solutions in time for the next summer peak season. Other issues, such as looking at the Freedom Camping Act, will take more time.” 

Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta has welcomed the establishment of the working group.  

“This is a significant issue for many local authorities who face significant stress and challenges to respond to seasonal influx of freedom camping.

“The Government recognises that tourism is an important industry – it’s our biggest export earner – but it’s also important that councils have the necessary tools and powers to respond when their communities are feeling the impact of high visitor numbers. 

“Collaboration is key in this situation and it’s great to see central and local government are committed to working together, with the tourism industry and other stakeholders.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, in consultation with other agencies, will develop a terms of reference for the working group.
