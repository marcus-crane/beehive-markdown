The passing of the third reading of the Education (Tertiary Education and Other Matters) Amendment Bill will see a range of changes to the tertiary education sector, Education Minister Chris Hipkins says.

“The Tertiary Education Commission will have new powers under the Act to monitor the tertiary sector and to hold providers to account for their use of public funding,” Chris Hipkins says.

“To further address ongoing concerns about provider behaviour, the changes will see the introduction of a new offence provision for falsifying a student’s record and the penalty for this offence has increased to up to $50,000. 

“The Bill also allows wānanga to seek consent to use a protected term, such as a university or polytechnic, giving them the same rights that private training establishments (PTE) have in being able to apply to use this term.

“However, there is a tough test for applicants to use one of these terms. As part of this process, the Minister of Education will have to consult and consider the national interest.  

“Another significant change is that Community Tertiary Education Providers (CTEP) are recognised in the Act as a new type of private training establishment.

“CTEPs are not-for-profit community groups providing tertiary education for the public good. This change will allow the public to distinguish them from for-profit providers. 

“The changes build on the strong foundations of the tertiary education system. We will continue to work to a better, stronger, and fairer tertiary sector that equips New Zealanders for the 21st century,” Chris Hipkins says.
