Kids, parents and whānau to help shape education

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is asking children, young people and their parents to share their vision for education and help shape its future, as part of a major review of the entire sector.

Jacinda Ardern launched the national Education Conversation | Kōrero Mātauranga, with an online public survey at Selwyn College in Auckland this morning, alongside associate ministers Tracey Martin and Kelvin Davis.

The survey is the first step in a national discussion to inform a major review of education for the next 30 years.

“A great education should bring out the best in everyone by providing the learning opportunities we need to discover and develop our unique potential, and to lead happy and fulfilling lives,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“The coalition Government has committed to reviewing how education works and ensuring the entire system – from early childhood, through to schools and tertiary and vocational education – is fit for the 21st century.

“If we’re going to do this work well, we need to hear from young people who are in the middle of their education now, and from those who care most about their future – their parents and their whānau.

“The online survey launched today is an important first step on the road to two national Education Summits that will be held in May. The summits are opportunities for academics, teachers, young people, and their families to come together to help inform the Government’s [Education Portfolio Work Programme](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/ambitious-three-year-work-programme-education).

“We want to know what kids and their parents would do if they were in charge and how they want education to look 30 years from now.”

The survey is available in English, te reo Māori and Pacific languages.

The first summit will be held in Christchurch on May 5 and 6 followed by Auckland (12-13 May).

The Ministry of Education is working with stakeholder groups to help them identify possible participants for the summits. Education Minister Chris Hipkins will consider nominations from stakeholders and send out invitations.
