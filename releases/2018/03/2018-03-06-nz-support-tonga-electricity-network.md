Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced $11 million of funding to complete the first stage of the upgrade to Nukualofa’s electricity network.

“New Zealand has been a long-term partner in efforts to improve Nukualofa’s electricity supply, and access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,” Mr Peters says.

“This funding is for the first stage of a five year project which will improve the reliability, resilience, and safety of electricity supply for more than 2000 households and businesses in Tonga’s capital.

“This is additional to the emergency funding for repairs to the electricity network in Tonga announced by the Prime Minister earlier today.

“The network upgrade will deliver reduced line losses, reduced emissions from diesel generation, and generate savings of around $1 million per annum,” Mr Peters says.

The Foreign Minister is currently in Tonga supporting the Prime Minister’s 2018 Pacific Mission.
