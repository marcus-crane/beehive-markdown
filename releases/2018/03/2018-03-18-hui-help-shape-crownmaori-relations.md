Crown/Māori Relations Minister Kelvin Davis will be holding hui across the country as part of rejuvenating the relationship between the Government and Māori.

Initial thoughts on the new Crown/Māori Relations portfolio include improving the way government departments engage with Māori and respond to Māori issues, ensuring Treaty settlement obligations are honoured, and finding new and different opportunities for more active partnership between the Crown and Māori.

“With the Treaty Settlement process drawing to a close the time is right to look beyond the negotiating table and rejuvenate the relationship between the Crown and Māori. Too often in the past the Crown has told Māori what their relationship will be. That’s not a mistake this Government will make,” Mr Davis says.

“Before finalising the scope and priorities of the Crown/Māori portfolio - exactly how the portfolio is going to foster a healthier relationship between the Crown and Māori – I want to listen widely, and hear ideas from across New Zealand. I have begun to meet with Māori and non-Māori national organisations but also want to talk to groups and people around the country - including rūnanga, hapū, and rangatahi – about what the relationship should look like. Everyone is welcome at our hui.”

“This Government wants to create a thriving, sustainable and future focused economy and environment. That’s why we’re focused on reducing poverty and inequality, better housing, better jobs and higher incomes. To help achieve this, and deliver real benefits for Māori, the Crown/Māori relationship must be strong.”

Mr Davis and officials will hold a series of hui around the country exploring challenges and opportunities in the Crown/Māori relationship. The first public hui will be held in Kaitaia in early April. Other hui will be held in Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, Thames, Rotorua, Hastings, Gisborne, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch and Invercargill before June.
