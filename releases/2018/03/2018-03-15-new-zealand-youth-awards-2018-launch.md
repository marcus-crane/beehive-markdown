Nominations are now open for the New Zealand Youth Awards 2018. These annual awards recognise and celebrate young New Zealanders who have achieved outstanding results, as well as those who have made a significant contribution in their communities, Minister for Youth Peeni Henare announced today. 

“The New Zealand Youth Awards 2018 builds on the success of previous years, and in 2018 we will recognise 18 rangatahi, nominated by their peers and communities, across six distinct award categories,” Peeni Henare said.

“The categories in 2018 recognise crucial skills and personal qualities such as leadership, empathy, working for the benefit of others and caring for our environment. As Minister for Youth, I want to take the time to honour our rangatahi on behalf of the communities they serve and represent.

“It is great to see young people at the forefront of leading initiatives and supporting their communities in areas such as the arts, culture, education, business and the environment.

“I want to encourage more young people to develop their natural leadership skills and mana. These Awards are both to inspire and give confidence to other young people that it could be them receiving an award next.” 

“This year, I am also excited to introduce the junior and senior Supreme Awards to recognise two outstanding young people who have tirelessly worked to advocate for and make a demonstrably significant contribution to address the current needs of young people in their community.

“I want to encourage all New Zealanders, across every community from Kaitaia to Bluff, to nominate someone who deserves recognition for their achievements.” 

“New Zealand is awash with committed, creative and talented young people who, through their own desire for social good, are leading innovative change and developing creative solutions right on our doorstep. The New Zealand Youth Awards are our opportunity to place the spotlight on these rangatahi and show off their leadership achievements and contributions to their communities. With our support, they will continue to achieve nationally and internationally,” Peeni Henare said.

Applications are now open and will close midday 26 April 2018. The award winners will be formally recognised at a celebratory event on 28 June 2018.
