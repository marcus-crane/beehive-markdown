Young New Zealanders will soon be able to set their sights on Portugal to live, work and play.

Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway has announced that up to 50 young New Zealanders a year will be able to live and work in Portugal for up to 12 months.

The announcement follows the signing today of a reciprocal working holiday scheme, during the visit to New Zealand of the Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities Abroad, H.E. José Luís Carneiro.

Mr Lees-Galloway says today’s announcement provides a great opportunity for young Kiwis to broaden their horizons, and for young Portuguese people to enjoy New Zealand’s warm hospitality and incredible environments.

“Portugal is an important partner for New Zealand on a wide range of international issues, and a strong supporter of the effective rules-based international system that underpins our security and prosperity,” he says.  

“It’s important that our political relationship is complemented by strong links between our people, and especially our young people.  The new working holiday scheme will help to strengthen these links, and to deepen the relationship between New Zealand and Portugal still further over the years to come.”

The Portugal-New Zealand working holiday scheme will be open from 20 March 2018 to people between 18 and 30 years old.  New Zealanders wishing to apply should email [vistos@mne.pt](mailto:vistos@mne.pt) or contact the Portuguese Embassy in Canberra (or, if living offshore, the Portuguese Embassy in their country of residence).
