Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni and Minister of Employment Willie Jackson have today officially launched the Work The Seasons website in Pukekohe making it easier for seasonal workers to find the job they need and for employers to find the right person.

 “Seasonal work can be a good option for many people looking to get back into work and for some could provide the type of work life and meaningful employment they are seeking,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

 “It’s been hard for people in seasonal work to plan their employment and gain the skills they need for the next job. The Work the Seasons website puts seasonal workers and employers in touch with each other in one place.

“Workers can see what work is coming up, and when and where that work is, across New Zealand. In the month since the website went live, 225 jobseekers have registered for work.

 “The Government is committed to providing seasonal workers with better training as well as work opportunities. One thousand training places have been purchased for job seekers that can be accessed through the website.

 “The Work The Seasons website has been a real partnership between the Government and business with input from seasonal industry associations from the horticulture, viticulture, hospitality, tourism, seafood and meat processing sectors,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

 Minister of Employment Willie Jackson said that the Work the Seasons website helps address key employment issues for job seekers and employers.

 “We need to address skills and labour shortages and make opportunities like these more visible so we can support the type of labour market booms we have had recently in the Hawke’s Bay, and attract and retain New Zealanders.

“Anyone aged over 15 years and who is eligible to work in New Zealand (citizen, permanent resident or holder of a valid, current work visa) can register as a job seeker on the Working The Seasons website,” Willie Jackson said.

“Work the Seasons is supported by 13,500 seasonal employers who can post jobs, manage the recruitment process and offer essential skills training.

The Work The Seasons website is available at [www.worktheseasons.co.nz](http://www.worktheseasons.co.nz).
