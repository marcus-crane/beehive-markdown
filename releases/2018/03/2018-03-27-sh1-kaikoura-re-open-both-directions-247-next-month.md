State Highway 1 between Picton and Christchurch will re-open for night-time travel from the end of April for the first time since the Kaikoura earthquake in November 2016, Transport Minister Phil Twyford has announced.

“Critical safety work on the coastal corridor is almost complete with the North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery crew making a massive push over the next four weeks to reach this milestone.

“People driving between Picton and Christchurch can look forward to easier journeys from the end of April, with the Transport Agency confirming plans to re-open State Highway 1 (SH1) for night-time travel. This will restore 24-hour access via SH1 for the first time since the Kaikoura earthquake almost a year-and-a-half ago.”

The re-opening of SH1 at night, along with the alternate route (via state highways 63, 6, 65 and 7 through Lewis Pass), will give people two viable 24/7 options for travel around the upper South Island.

“This news will be welcomed by local communities, the freight industry and every day Kiwi drivers alike. I’m delighted that SH1 will soon be available to everyone day and night – bringing further social and economic benefits back to the region.

“It’s important for people to understand that work is still underway in the corridor to make it safe and resilient for the future, and that there will still be multiple worksites throughout 2018,” Phil Twyford says.
