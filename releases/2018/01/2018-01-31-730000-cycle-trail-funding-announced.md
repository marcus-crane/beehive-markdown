Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis today announced more than $730,000 in funding for safety improvements to two Great Rides of Ngā Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail, in the Ruapehu and Wellington regions and an extension to the Waikato River trail. 

“The Great Rides are great regional tourism assets that showcase the best of New Zealand – our landscapes, environment, culture and heritage. They are encouraging domestic and international visitor spending in our regions and smaller communities – to the tune of $37.4 million per year at the last estimate,” Mr Davis says.

“The value of our premiere rides is without question, so it’s important we look after the trails and keep users safe.

“We have identified safety projects on the Mountains to Sea and Remutaka cycle trails that are a priority for funding and will be completed as quickly as possible.

“On the Mountains to Sea Cycle Trail, safety improvements are needed on the Mangapurua and Kaiwhakauka tracks to address fall hazards and narrow and boggy sections. The trail will receive $393,500 from the New Zealand Cycle Trail: Enhancement and Extension fund for these projects.

“The Remutaka Cycle Trail requires a bridge at Siberia Stream, an upgrade to some sections which are currently unrideable, and the installation of toilet facilities on the exposed Wild Coast section of the trail. Government will contribute $334,125 towards these improvements.”

In addition, $38,452 has been allocated from the Tourism Facilities Development Grants fund to extend the Waikato River Trail. This ride, part of Ngā Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail, will be extended by 2.34 kilometres into Atiamuri village, improving rider safety and creating additional economic benefits for local businesses.

Mr Davis also announced the opening of round eight of the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, which aims to ensure the Great Rides are maintained to their current world class standard.

Applications are open to Great Rides governance organisations and close on Friday 2 March 2018.
