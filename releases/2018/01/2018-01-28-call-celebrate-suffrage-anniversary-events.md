Minister for Women Hon Julie Anne Genter is encouraging organisations to celebrate the 125th anniversary of women’s suffrage with events and activities.

“I am putting the call out for communities across New Zealand to celebrate women fighting and gaining the right to vote,” says Hon Julie Anne Genter, Minister for Women.

“New Zealand was the first country in the world where all women could vote, and it is an important part of our national identity and pride as New Zealanders.

“I am excited about the wide range of activities already underway across Aotearoa New Zealand to celebrate Suffrage 125.

“I encourage organisations to list their events on the Ministry’s website to create a hub for the diverse collection of celebrations across the country.

“New Zealand was the first country in the world in which the five highest offices of power were held by women, but we also celebrate the prominent female leaders throughout our communities.

“This year we have the opportunity to celebrate and be inspired by the wonderful New Zealanders who have worked hard on gender equality for women and girls’ lives.

“We are encouraging women and girls to stand up and be counted. The motto for Suffrage 125 is ‘Whakatū wāhine — women stand up’.”

“While we celebrate this historic achievement and how far we have come as the first country in the world where women could vote, it’s also a time to build a more inclusive and fairer society together,” said Ms Genter.

Organisations can list events on the Ministry for Women’s new Suffrage 125 events page on its website.
