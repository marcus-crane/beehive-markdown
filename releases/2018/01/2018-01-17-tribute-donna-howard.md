*Statement on the death of Wairarapa Area Commander, Inspector Donna Howard*

I am saddened by her passing at such a young age.

She was a dedicated member of the Police family and I know it has hit her colleagues hard.

I especially want to acknowledge her long Police career.  

She devoted 27 years to serving the public, here in New Zealand and on overseas deployments.

She was a hugely respected officer with a great reputation for dedication to duty.  Donna always exhibited a strong commitment to really making a difference to the communities she served. 

My thoughts and sympathy go out to Donna’s family and to her friends and her colleagues.
