A 150-year-old pub is among three heritage buildings to receive funding to help with earthquake strengthening, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Jacinda Ardern announced today.

The Hurunui Hotel, a Category One historic place, was built in 1868. Constructed from two layers of local hand-hewn limestone blocks packed with a mixture of tussock, clay and lime, it has been awarded $132,503 in the latest round of Heritage EQUIP (the Heritage Earthquake Upgrade Incentive Programme) funding to help repair stonework damaged in the Kaikoura earthquakes.

“Heritage buildings like the Hurunui pub bring the past to life,”Jacinda Ardern said. “For many rural communities they are an impressive backdrop to everyday activities, reconfigured as shops, offices or restaurants. I am sure locals and visitors alike will be pleased to see the pub up and running again.”

The other two buildings to benefit from the latest round of Heritage EQUIP funding are the Marshall Building in historic Tees Street, Oamaru ($48,000) and a William Gray Young-designed one in Petone’s Jackson Street Historic Area.

The Marshall Building - designed in the 1880s by architectural firm Forrester and Lemon - features an ornate façade which, along with a parapet, will be braced and secured. Once strengthened, the building will be converted into accommodation for visitors to Oamaru.

Two connected buildings dating back to 1926 and located on Petone’s main shopping street have been awarded $100,000 towards foundation and bracing work. They will provide both retail and residential space once they have been upgraded.

The Heritage EQUIP fund assists private owners of heritage buildings throughout New Zealand to maintain and keep them safe.

It has supported 16 projects with a total of $3.1 million in grants since it was established in Budget 2016. Applications for the next funding round close on 28 March.
