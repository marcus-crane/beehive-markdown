Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin today announced the opening of the 2017/18 Lottery Significant Projects funding round. 

This year, the Significant Projects Fund has $21 million available for grants to purchase, create or improve community assets that have regional and/or national significance. 

To be considered for a grant, projects have to involve a total capital expenditure cost of $3 million or more.  Applications can be made for projects from a number of areas: arts, culture and heritage; sport and recreation; conservation and the environment; economic development; and/or visitor services and tourism. Applications close 21 March 2018, and funding decisions will be announced in June.

The Minister said that the reach and impact of the projects is what sets the Significant Projects Fund apart from other Lottery capital works funds.

“The community benefits of Significant Projects are substantial and far reaching.  The impacts go well beyond the immediate community they are located in and can be felt regionally and sometimes nationally.”  

 The 2016/17 Lottery Significant Projects round supported a number of notable projects around the country including the:

- Rakiura Heritage Centre Trust which received $780,000 towards the development and construction of a multi-functional heritage centre on Stewart Island.  The Centre replaces the current museum and will provide better access to the Island’s heritage for an increasing number of tourists.
- Sarjeant Gallery Redevelopment project in Whanganui which received $6 million towards the redevelopment and earthquake strengthening of the existing building including the addition of a major new wing.  The Gallery houses some of New Zealand’s most significant art works.
- Rongowhakaata Iwi Trust which received $1.967 million towards the restoration of Te Hau Ki Turangi, the oldest surviving Whare Whakairo (carved meeting house) in the world.  The Whare is currently housed at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.
