Education Minister Chris Hipkins has asked the Secretary for Education to appoint a Commissioner to take over the governance of Hato Petera College, he said today.

 

“Hato Petera has a proud history, but is facing significant challenges. Relationships within the Hato Petera community continue to be fractured and this intervention is needed so a fitting plan can be developed for the future of the College,” Mr Hipkins said.

 

A Limited Statutory Manager was appointed to the College on March 30 last year to support the governance of the College.  

  

The new Commissioner will now take over the governance role from the Board, which has been dissolved.  The Commissioner will also be involved in discussions with the College community, the Ministry of Education, and the Proprietor, about next steps for the College.

 

The Minister has stated that the “Education Review Office has indicated continuing concern about the performance and future viability of the College and has said that it is not confident that the College is able to offer a quality sustainable education for its students.”

 

“In addition the roll has declined from 210 students in 1995 to an expected 11 this year.”

 

Mr Hipkins said the Proprietor of the College is supportive of the Commissioner appointment.  

 

“No decisions have been made about the future of the College, but its ongoing viability is obviously a matter of discussion,” Mr Hipkins said.
