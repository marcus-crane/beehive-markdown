Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter announced today that the 2018 Aotearoa Bike Challenge, the month-long workplace challenge which encourages New Zealanders to make everyday trips by bike, will begin on Thursday 1 February.

 “Organisations across the country are encouraged to get their staff involved in some friendly competition, and to experience the benefits cycling can have on staff health and wellbeing,” said Ms Genter.

The challenge follows a successful first year in 2017, which saw nearly two million kilometres cycled by more than 14,000 people, from more than 1000 organisations, including almost 4000 new riders.

“The Aotearoa Bike Challenge is a great opportunity to see how easy it can be to fit cycling into your everyday life.

 “A 10-minute ride could be part of your commute to work or a trip to the park with the kids. It’s an achievable goal that will help you feel great and build a positive habit in the new year ahead.

“This year we hope to see even more New Zealanders get on their bikes with some great prizes on offer for participating, including e-bikes,” said Ms Genter.

 Registrations will remain open until 28 February and a 10-minute journey by bike is all it takes to participate.
