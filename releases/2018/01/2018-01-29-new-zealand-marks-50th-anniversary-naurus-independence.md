Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced that New Zealand will make a $2 million contribution to the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund to mark the 50th anniversary of Nauru’s independence.

“New Zealand’s contribution to Nauru’s Trust Fund recognises our shared history and our ongoing connection with the people of Nauru. The Fund was established to provide future generations with a source of revenue to invest in education, health, and infrastructure development,” Mr Peters says.

**“**New Zealand has a long-standing historical connection to Nauru. Prior to becoming independent in 1968 Nauru was under a UN mandate whereby Australia was a trustee and United Kingdom and New Zealand had co-trustee responsibilities.”

“In addition to celebrating 50 years as an independent nation on 31 January, Nauru is also hosting the Pacific Island Forum Leaders’ meeting later this year and will have the opportunity to help shape these important regional discussions,” he says.

Pacific Peoples Minister, Aupito William Sio, has travelled to Nauru this week to represent New Zealand at the Independence Celebrations.
