**New Zealand First Leader congratulates PM**

 New Zealand First Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has congratulated the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Clarke Gayford on news of her pregnancy.

“On behalf of my New Zealand First colleagues we wish the Prime Minister and her partner every joy during the next several months as they adapt to a new challenge,” says Mr Peters.

 “Ours is a novel coalition in many respects and the Prime Minister’s announcement only reinforces its unique qualities. We are committed to supporting the Prime Minister during the months ahead to continue to provide a good and stable government.  We understand that no matter what level a person operates on family life is important,” he says.
