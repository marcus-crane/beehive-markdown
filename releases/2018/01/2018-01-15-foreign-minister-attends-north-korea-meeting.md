**Foreign Affairs Minister to attend international meeting to discuss North Korea**

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is leaving for Canada tonight for an international meeting on North Korea.

Twenty one nations have been invited to the meeting which is co-chaired by Canada and the United States, and is taking place in Vancouver from 15-16 January.

“I look forward to discussions which will seek to find diplomatic solutions,” Mr Peters says.

“This meeting is also an opportunity for the international community to demonstrate solidarity in opposition to the North Korean nuclear tests and missile launches.”

“We want North Korea to understand the importance which the international community places on it returning to a meaningful dialogue on denuclearisation,” says Mr Peters.

Last week New Zealand joined 17 countries in a Joint Statement pledging to enforce UN sanctions on North Korea.

These countries belong to the Proliferation Security Initiative, a global grouping that seeks to block shipments of materials used to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.

“New Zealand is committed to implementing United Nations Security Council sanctions effectively,” Mr Peters says.
