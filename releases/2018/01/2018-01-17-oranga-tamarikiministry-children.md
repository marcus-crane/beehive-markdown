The name change for Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children officially takes effect today.

 The new name and the dropping of the word ‘vulnerable’ were announced in December.

 “What the Ministry does is far more important than its name,” Children’s Minister Tracey Martin says. “However, we want the Ministry’s name to reflect that we have aspirations for all children and young people.”

 The Minister said Oranga Tamariki was only nine months old and it has to focus on its core work: improving the quality and range of care available to children most in need; lifting social work standards; and improving youth justice outcomes.

 “But over the period of this Government’s term, Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children will widen its view. We want a plan and measures in place so that as a country we make sure that we are doing the right thing for all of our kids.”

 The Minister said that the name change had no impact on funding for services.

 “Oranga Tamariki had a budget for its establishment, including new signage for its buildings. The chief executive rightly focused on getting services running before getting signs up, so that money is going to be used now.

 “The name change is a symbolic step, but it means a lot for those in care and the people who work with and care for our tamariki and it signals where we are heading.”
