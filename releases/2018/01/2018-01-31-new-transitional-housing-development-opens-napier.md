Hawke’s Bay people in urgent need of a place to live are benefiting from Napier’s newest transitional housing complex, says Associate Housing and Urban Development Minister Jenny Salesa.

Ms Salesa attended the blessing of the final five homes in Maraenui’s Kelvin Place this morning.

“This Housing New Zealand development is part of an overall response to address housing needs in Hawke’s Bay,” Ms Salesa says.

“The 10 one-bedroom homes in the Kelvin Place development are warm, dry and built to modern building and design standards. 

“They will provide a safe place for individuals and couples to live temporarily, while receiving support to find longer term accommodation.”

The first five homes in the Kelvin Place development were completed and people moved into them prior to Christmas.  

“It’s great to see this development has now been completed, so that people are receiving the help they need and are part of this community,” Ms Salesa says.

“As at 26 January, the Ministry of Social Development has contracted 150 transitional housing places in Napier and Hastings, well above the target that was set for this point in time. Across New Zealand, there are now over 1900 transitional places being tenanted or available for tenanting.”

“This Government is committed to increasing the supply of long-term public housing to support the needs of low income families, including Napier and the wider Hawke’s Bay region.” 

The Ministry of Social Development is partnering with local provider Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga, and Emerge Aotearoa, who will manage the tenancies and provide support to the people living there.
