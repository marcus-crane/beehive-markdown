Local whānau with urgent housing needs are set to benefit from new housing in Northland and the trial of an innovative rent-to-own scheme announced by the Government today.

Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford and Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced Government investment of $8.7 million in housing initiatives in Whangarei, Kaikohe and Kaitaia.

The Ministers visited the Ōtangarei community this morning, which is where a new four-unit transitional housing development will be built.

“The Government is committed to increasing the number of homes available in Northland, and across New Zealand to tackle homelessness and make sure all New Zealanders have access to housing,” Phil Twyford said.  

Minister Mahuta said warm, dry and safe housing is vital for the future of whānau development.

“The new Ōtangarei Papakāinga Limited development will provide transitional homes for up to sixteen Northland families a year, while they receive support to secure a longer-term place to live and rebuild their futures,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Minister Mahuta also announced an innovative trial that will be brought to Kaitaia to assist low-income whānau to move toward owning their own homes.

“We are also supporting He Korowai Trust’s project to test an affordable rent-to-own home ownership model that enables whānau to not just put a roof over their heads, but eventually own it.  

“All these initiatives showcase the success that is possible when Government, rōpū and the wider community can work together and combine expertise and resources to build homes to shelter whanau,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

**Notes to editors:**

Construction on 22 new state homes in Northland is underway or imminent as part of the Government’s drive to boost the supply of warm, dry, secure new homes in areas of high demand.

Of the 22 houses, Housing New Zealand has 14 new homes underway in Whangarei with three new homes in Kaitaia and five in Kaikohe, which are part of the first stage of Housing New Zealand’s [Regional Housing Programme](https://hnzc.co.nz/housing-developments-and-programmes/our-developments/housing-developments/).

With the Whangarei homes, eleven are one-bedroom homes which are under construction on Maunu Road in Whangarei. These will be completed in two stages in August and December this year. Five will be accessible units.

The four unit transitional housing facility in Ōtangarei is being developed by Ōtangarei Papakainga Limited on leased Housing New Zealand land.

The development will provide a warm, safe and dry place for up to sixteen Northland families a year to live temporarily, while they receive support to secure a longer-term place to live.
