Health Minister Dr David Clark says the new Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield has the skills and experience to be an outstanding leader for the Ministry of Health.

Dr Bloomfield is currently Chief Executive of Capital and Coast District Health Board, where he is on secondment from the same position at Hutt Valley DHB. His appointment as Director-General of Health was announced this afternoon by the State Services Commission.

“Dr Bloomfield understands our health system and has sector leadership experience. He has a clinical background and has worked in primary care, public health and health policy.

“That depth and breadth of experience – and the strong relationships Dr Bloomfield has in the health sector - will be invaluable as he takes over leadership of the Ministry of Health. I look forward to working with him."

Dr Clark also thanked Stephen McKernan for his excellent work as Acting Director-General this year.

**NOTE:** Ashley Bloomfield has been appointed Director-General of Health for a five-year term, effective from 11 June 2018.
