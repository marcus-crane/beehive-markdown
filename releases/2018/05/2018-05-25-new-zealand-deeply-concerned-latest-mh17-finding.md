The Government is deeply concerned at the finding announced overnight by the Joint Investigative Team that the missile which brought down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 originated from the 53rd brigade of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

Two-hundred and ninety-eight people died on 17 July 2014 in this tragic event, including one New Zealand citizen and one New Zealand resident.

New Zealand has full confidence in the work and integrity of the Joint Investigation Team. The investigations into this tragic incident have been careful, methodical and impartial.

New Zealand calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the investigation, as agreed in UN Security Council Resolution 2166.

New Zealand supports international efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.

This significant development gives rise to serious questions. The New Zealand Government will assess the latest finding and consider next steps.
