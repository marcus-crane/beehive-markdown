New Zealand’s Defence Force can continue making meaningful contributions to global security and peacekeeping efforts, and respond effectively to events like natural disasters, as a result of Budget 2018 funding, says Defence Minister Ron Mark.

Budget 2018 provides a $367.7 million operating funding boost to the Defence and Veterans portfolios over the next four years, underpinned by an extra $324.1 million for the New Zealand Defence Forces’ operating budget. In addition, Budget 2018 provides $42.3 million in new capital funding for modernisation.

“The extra funding is going to go a long way towards helping the Defence Force meet increasing demand across a range of tasks,” Ron Mark says.

“Defence assets and personnel must be well prepared and ready to respond to whatever tasks the Government expects of them. This applies to both overseas deployments and events closer to home when the Defence Force is required to provide assistance to our communities, and to undertake resource and border protection operations.

“We’ve seen a big increase in adverse weather events in the Pacific in the last few years, driven by climate change. Today’s announcement provides certainty to our friends in the Pacific that New Zealand is ready and able to respond in their times of need.

“The funding announced today is also a huge win for conservation, the environment and fisheries protection.

“It is part of New Zealand’s identity to be a good environmental steward. Pressure on scarce resources, especially in the South Pacific and the Southern Ocean, is increasing. Budget 2018 funding allows for more time monitoring and protecting these vital New Zealand interests,” says Ron Mark.

Alongside the increase of $324.1 million in the Defence Force operating budget, Budget 2018 also sees:

- $41.3 million additional capital investment for the first tranche of investment under the Defence Estate Regeneration Programme Plan
- an additional $22.6 million operating funding over the next four years and $1.0 million capital funding for the Defence Force to deliver the enhanced Limited Service Volunteer programme (supported by a related investment of $4.2 million over the next four years for the Ministry of Social Development to administer the programme)

<!--THE END-->

- as announced earlier, $1.1 million in grants to the Royal New Zealand Returned & Services Association (RSA) and No Duff Charitable Trust over the next four years to support the services they provide to veterans – $250,000 for the RSA and $25,000 for No Duff Charitable Trust annually (*This initiative was announced before Budget Day.*)

<!--THE END-->

- $6.3 million in 2018/19 for the repatriation of the remains of service personnel and their dependents for those buried overseas since 1955
- $13.6 million over the next four years set aside for new capabilities.

“This is a ringing endorsement of the Defence Force from the Coalition Government. It recognises the value it provides New Zealand and its meaningful contributions to peace and security around the world,” says Ron Mark.
