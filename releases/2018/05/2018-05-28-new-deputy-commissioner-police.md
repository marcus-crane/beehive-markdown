Long-serving Police Assistant Commissioner Wally Haumaha has been appointed to a new role as Deputy Commissioner.

“The Deputy Commissioner of Police is a statutory appointment, made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,” says Police Minister Stuart Nash.

Wallace (Wally) Patrick Haumaha, QSM and ONZM, has been appointed for five years from 3 June 2018. The term of the current Deputy Commissioner Vivian (Viv) Rickard ends on 2 June. Mr Rickard was appointed in 2010 and has served two terms.

Wally Haumaha is currently Deputy Chief Executive Maori, at Assistant Commissioner rank.  The Deputy Chief Executive Maori position leads the Maori, Pacific and Ethnic services communities group. He first joined New Zealand Police in 1984.

“Wally Haumaha is a highly respected leader across our communities,” says Mr Nash.

“He has led work to build the cultural capability of Police across all Districts, and is a key advisor on diversity strategies for Police recruitment. He is committed to enhancing Police leadership and responsiveness to Maori, Pacific and ethnic communities.

“Mr Haumaha has driven the development and implementation of the restorative justice initiative *Te Pae Oranga*, formerly known as Iwi Community Panels. The panels provide alternative resolutions for low-level offending and require an offender to plead guilty, work on a plan to identify the harm they have caused, and identify ways to avoid offending again.

“He has been responsible for the Iwi Community Panels since they were established by the previous government as a pilot scheme in 2014. We have now made them a permanent part of the Prevention First operating model. Nine panels are in place and a further four will be established in June. Planning is also underway for another six by early 2019. This work is a crucial component of plans to reform the criminal justice system by reducing reoffending and victimisation and breaking the cycle that leads to imprisonment.

“Wally Haumaha has the clear vision and leadership skills required to deliver on the Government’s priorities for Police. I expect him to play a key role to strengthen Maori leadership within Police and enhance the relationship between Police and Maori communities, in order to reduce both victimisation and offending. He is also superbly placed to work with other justice sector agencies to reduce the prison population.

“I’m very pleased to appoint Mr Haumaha to this role. I also wish to acknowledge and thank Viv Rickard for his commitment and service to Police, especially as a member of the Police Executive for most of the past decade,” says Mr Nash.

Mr Haumaha was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal in 1998 for service to the community, and was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2017 for services to NZ Police and Maori, Pacific and ethnic communities.
