Police Minister Stuart Nash is congratulating the 78 new recruits who graduate today from the Royal New Zealand Police College near Porirua.

“The graduation of Wing 314 takes the total number of new recruits since this government was formed to 455 frontline officers,” says Mr Nash.

“Budget 2018 set aside $298.8 million in new operating funding as a first step towards the Coalition government’s commitment to strive for 1800 new officers over three years. On top of this, we are funding 485 support staff.

“Budget 2018 has provided the foundation for our recruitment drive and the ability to meet our objectives of greater crime prevention and going hard against organised crime.

“Our communities want to know that the growing threat from organised crime is being targeted by specialist Police officers. Twenty-first century Policing requires greater resources and tools to investigate and disrupt transnational drug smuggling, child sex exploitation, cyber-crime and money laundering.

“Our neighbourhoods want a greater uniformed presence for road policing, family harm and child protection, burglaries and aggravated robberies, and the ability to respond to natural disasters and search and rescue incidents. That is what we will deliver.

“The graduation of Wing 314 is the seventh since this government took office. There will be another seven by the end of January 2019. We are building a stronger Police service and giving them tools to prevent offending, enforce the law and keep communities safe.

“The new recruits in Wing 314 bring diverse and talented qualities to Police. The Wing includes 18 migrants who can speak at least eleven foreign languages, 23 officers who have tertiary degrees, 25 who have post-secondary qualifications, and many with sporting and cultural achievements and family connections to Police,” says Mr Nash.
