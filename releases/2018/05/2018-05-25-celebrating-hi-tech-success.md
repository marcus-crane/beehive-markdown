Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran was among those celebrating the successes of New Zealand’s high-tech companies and high-flying individuals at the annual NZ Hi-Tech Awards tonight in Christchurch.

Ms Curran helped present the award for the Most Innovative Hi-Tech Solution for the Public Good, which this year went to Emergency Q by Healthcare Applications.

“Emergency Q can help reduce overcrowding in emergency departments and help people receive medical care more efficiently. It’s a great example of how companies are developing high-tech solutions to improve the lives of New Zealanders,” Ms Curran says.

“Through the app, non-emergency patients can view information to help them decide where to seek treatment. It aims to reduce congestion in A & E’s by creating a digital connection between the emergency departments, community doctors and patients.

“The NZ Hi-Tech Awards are very competitive, and the number of entrants has grown 150 per cent in the last five years. This growth is testament to the calibre of technological skills and innovative thinking in the sector.

“One of my priorities is to grow the tech sector so that it becomes the second biggest contributor to our economy by 2025. I’m also working to close the digital divides by 2020 and to develop a more digitally inclusive New Zealand.

“In addition to the economic and social benefits this will bring, I look forward to seeing new applications to come out of this sector that improve the lives of New Zealanders.”

Other finalists in the Public Good award category include Banqer, a financial education platform for primary and intermediate schools; Collaborate that matches people with volunteering opportunities; and EROAD, which provides solutions for the transport sector to help keep people safe on the road.

“I was also impressed by the other award-winners and finalists, which collectively had applications across a range of sectors and provided high-tech business solutions.
