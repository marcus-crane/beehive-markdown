Minister of Defence Ron Mark has announced Air Vice-Marshal Kevin Short as the new Chief of Defence Force.

“After an extensive recruitment process, led by the State Services Commissioner, I recommended to my Cabinet colleagues Air Vice-Marshal Short as the new Chief of Defence Force,” says Ron Mark.  

"Cabinet have agreed to my recommendation, and Air Vice-Marshal Short has been appointed by the Governor-General for a three year term as the Chief of Defence Force beginning on 1 July 2018.

Air Vice-Marshal Short will be promoted to Air Marshal prior to taking over as the Chief of Defence Force.

“Air Vice-Marshal Short is an outstanding officer and I believe he will make an exceptional Chief of Defence Force.  He has a wide range of experience and has performed with distinction throughout his career.

“He is a person of great integrity and has a leadership style that engenders confidence. He is highly regarded by his colleagues. I congratulate him on his appointment and I’m looking forward to working with him.

“I’d also like to thank the outgoing Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Tim Keating. He has been an excellent Chief of Defence Force and the Defence Force he will hand over is in good shape. 

As Minister, I have been highly impressed with the talent, professionalism and motivation of the men and women of the Defence Force, and that’s a credit to Lieutenant General Keating’s time in charge,” says Ron Mark.
