“The Government is seeking submissions on an update of the law that governs business partnerships before it is introduced into Parliament,” Attorney-General David Parker has announced today.

The Partnership Law Bill, which is on the Government’s current statute revision programme, rewrites the Partnership Act 1908 in modern language and drafting style without changing the substantive effect of the law.

“It is part of the Government’s ongoing work to make New Zealand legislation more accessible and readable,” Mr Parker says.

 “This Bill restates important rules that govern a business partnership, making them clearer and easier for the public to understand and apply.  Rules in the Partnership Law Bill cover, for example, the rights and obligations of partners to each other and to third parties.”

The Bill makes some very small amendments to the law that are permitted under the statutory revision powers and feedback is being sought on these and other issues.

 The Bill and explanatory material are online at: [www.pco.govt.nz/consultation-plb](http://www.pco.govt.nz/consultation-plb) The material includes information about how to make a submission and also some specific questions for feedback.

 More information about the revision programme is available at [www.pco.govt.nz/revision-programme/](http://www.pco.govt.nz/revision-programme/)

 Submissions close on 15 June 2018.
