Supporting Māori students to succeed as Māori and investing to deliver te reo Māori in schools are key to lifting the achievement of our tamariki and rangatahi, says Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis.

“Education is key if we are to improve outcomes for Māori. To build a better future, we must prioritise tools that help lift the achievement and wellbeing of our students,” says Kelvin Davis.

“That is why Budget 2018 advances our plan to strengthen equity, lift the achievement of Māori students, and improve the uptake of te reo Māori across the school system.”

Highlights include:

- **Lifting Achievement for Māori Students:** $1.0 million new operating funding in 2018/19 to investigate how we can better support Māori school students to achieve as Māori in English-medium settings
- **Te Kawa Matakura:** $690,000 new operating funding in 2017/18, plus $2.1 million operating funding in 2018/19 and 2019/20, to develop a programme and qualification for secondary students who exhibit excellence in te ao Māori
- **Te Ahu o te reo Māori:** $1.1 million of new operating funding in 2017/18, plus $11.4 million operating funding over the following three years, for a package of initiatives to lift capability across the system for delivering quality te reo Māori education.

“Quality teaching is one of the strongest levers we have for lifting the achievement of our students. The Government will work with Māori education experts to develop culturally responsive teaching approaches that reduce issues like unconscious bias,” says Kelvin Davis.

“This will consolidate the knowledge gained through previous programmes, including Te Kotahitanga. We are investing in educators, because they have a unique ability to ensure Māori students have positive experiences at school.

“Te Kawa Matakura is part of our plan to enable Māori achievement by investing in students who display excellence in matauranga Māori. They contribute to both the Māori world and all of New Zealand. Te Kawa Matakura will develop a qualification for students to formally recognise their excellence. It is another step forward in the education system’s recognition of the value of Māori knowledge.

“Te Ahu o te reo Māori will support teachers to deliver te reo in the classroom. It will support all teachers – those already teaching te reo, and those who have the potential but may not yet have the confidence. This is the start of our plan to better integrate te reo into early learning, primary and intermediate schools.

"All three initiatives will help enable culturally responsive learning that allows Māori students to succeed as Māori, while promoting the value of a bilingual, bicultural New Zealand,” says Kelvin Davis.
