All existing charter schools have submitted an application to become a state school, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“Of the 12 applications, sponsors have submitted applications for 10 to become designated character and two to become state integrated schools. 

“The Ministry of Education will now take some time to consult on and assess the applications and will report to me by the end of June.   

“I expect to be in a position to make my decisions on all of these applications by the end of July.

“I would like to thank the charter school sponsors for their efforts in getting these applications in. 

“I have also re-convened the advisory group to monitor the schools’ performance while they remain charter schools. 

“The group will now be chaired by Bruce Adin, with Bernardine Vester as Deputy Chair.  The other members are Murray Jack, Te Rau Kupenga, Moe Milne, and Jason Swann.

“The group replaces the previous Authorisation Board, whose members completed their terms in March 2018.  An advisory group is required under section 158C of the Education Act 1989.”
