Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Peeni Henare, has announced that funding of $500,000 is now available for the Community Leadership Fund – Hāpori Whakatipu, a fund established to grow community capability.

This fund provides government grants to not-for-profit organisations with a national focus, whose main role is to provide leadership and build capability across the community and social enterprise sectors.

“This funding will support organisations to strengthen New Zealand communities through guidance and leadership to the sector. I encourage nationally focused organisations who are providing leadership and capability building to apply,” Peeni Henare said.

Last year the fund supported the Volunteer Army Foundation to work with 623 primary schools and their students to engage in volunteer projects including visiting local rest homes and organising local park and beach clean-ups.

Another recipient, Te Whare Hukahuka, is using its grant to bring together a number of sectors to enable Māori social enterprises to succeed including iwi, research institutes, government agencies, philanthropic funders, mentors, investors, and rangatahi.

The priorities of the fund are to build capability with regard to:

- Collaboration and connection across the sector;
- Social enterprise;
- Volunteering; and
- Community led-development.
