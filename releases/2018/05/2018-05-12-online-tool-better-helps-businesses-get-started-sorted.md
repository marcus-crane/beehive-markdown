A popular online tool which lets business owners search company names, domain names and trade marks in one simple search, has been updated with new features to deliver better results and save people time.

“Available on [business.govt.nz](http://business.govt.nz), [ONECheck](https://www.business.govt.nz/onecheck/#_blank) is a free online tool to help businesses get their branding ‘right’ from the beginning of their business journey - with information they need made available through one simple search,” Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Kris Faafoi says.

“This is the first in a series of tools to be provided by [business.govt.nz](http://business.govt.nz) to help businesses get from ‘started to sorted’ including easier registration with government services, and more personalised guidance for small businesses.”

“With the refresh of this tool we are helping Kiwi businesses and innovators get ahead, as ONECheck searches widely across web domains and social networks, which form a crucial part of many businesses’ marketing.

 “Because ONECheck also searches the [NZBN register](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/#_blank), it means your name is checked against all business types registered with NZBN so you will know if for example a sole trader is using your proposed name before you make this important decision.

 After users have researched a name for their business, they are then provided with information and direction on how to register it as a company with the Companies Office, or as a trade mark with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ).

Since ONECheck was launched in 2012, it has been used to perform more than 1.5 million searches – a reflection of the aspirational nature of many New Zealanders – with more than 50,000 companies, and 23,000 trademarks registered in the 2016/17.

“There are many creative Kiwis in New Zealand, and we want to encourage and support those entrepreneurs and businesses to protect their innovations and ideas,”
