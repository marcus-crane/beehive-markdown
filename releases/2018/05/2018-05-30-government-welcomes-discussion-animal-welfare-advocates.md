Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri expects a wide range of animal welfare issues to be discussed with animal advocate groups at the upcoming all-day Animal Advocacy Hui. 

Announced in March this year, the Hui will be held on Friday, 8 June in Auckland, with registrations closing on Thursday 31 May. 

“New Zealand enjoys a strong international reputation in terms of our animal welfare system. But it is important to continue to improve and, as part of that, discuss amongst ourselves what we think the priorities should be,” Meka Whaitiri said. 

“The Coalition Government is committed to talking with New Zealanders, including interest groups, industry and others. We have an active animal advocate sector in New Zealand and it is important they have an opportunity to be heard by Government. 

“I want to provide the opportunity for people to come together and have constructive dialogue about the animal welfare issues that matter to them. 

“I will be speaking at the Hui, as well as listening to what all the attendees have to say. It will also be a chance for our animal advocates to hear from spokespeople for our Confidence and Supply and Coalition Government partners the Greens and New Zealand First. 

“All the groups will be encouraged to share their views and there will be time in the afternoon to break into smaller groups to look at what animal advocate groups want Government working on going forward. It will be up to people attending the Hui to let us know what the really important issues are for them over the next two years and beyond,” Meka Whaitiri said. 

**NOTE:** If you would like to attend the Hui, you must register your attendance by 5PM on 31st May. To register for the Hui, please email [animaladvocacyhui@mpi.govt.nz]()**. Late registrations or registrations on the day cannot be accepted.**
