Forestry Minister Shane Jones has today announced the formation of a new Ministerial advisory group to provide independent advice about the forestry sector and how Government and industry can work together to deliver outcomes for New Zealand.

The Forestry Ministerial Advisory Group is made up of ten forestry experts who will provide industry perspectives and advice to help meet New Zealand’s forestry goals, including the One Billion Tree Programme.

“The group has been selected for their expertise in a wide range of disciplines that I believe are necessary to deliver New Zealand’s forestry goals,” Shane Jones said.

“They will provide direct industry perspectives on a range of topics, including research, commercial and conservation forestry, local government, farm-forestry, wood processing, education and research.

“The group will provide insights on the performance of the overall forestry system, along with advice on future trends, risks and issues.

“I have initially tasked the Forestry Ministerial Advisory Group to focus on supporting Te Uru Rākau to deliver the One Billion Trees planting programme.

"The group will be chaired by Dr Warren Parker, Chair of the New Zealand Conservation Authority and the former Chief Executive Officer of Scion and Landcare Research. Warren brings a wealth of knowledge and experience, and is well-placed to chair the group.

“I’m excited to work closely with the advisory group, and hear the insights they will provide, as we look to the future and drive transformational and sustainable change in the forestry system,” Shane Jones said.
