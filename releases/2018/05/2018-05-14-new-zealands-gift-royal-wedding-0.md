New Zealand’s gift to the Royal wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle will be a donation to Pillars, a New Zealand charity supporting the children of prisoners, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

Prince Harry and Ms Markle have asked that anyone wishing to mark their wedding consider making a donation to charity, rather than sending a wedding gift. Pillars aims to help the children of New Zealand prisoners achieve positive, crime-free futures.

“The couple were happy that their wedding will be acknowledged in New Zealand by a donation to Pillars, which provides fantastic support to a group of very vulnerable children,” Jacinda Ardern said. “The wedding this weekend also coincides with the 30th anniversary of Pillars.

“The couple are both very interested in initiatives that support vulnerable children and young people.”

A donation of $5000 will be made to the charity on behalf of the people of New Zealand.

“This gift reflects the couple’s wish that as many people as possible benefit from the generosity of spirit that has been expressed in response to their engagement and wedding.  I wish them all the best for their very special day on Saturday,” Jacinda Ardern said.
