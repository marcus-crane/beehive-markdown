New members of the Ministry of Youth Development Partnership Fund Board for 2018-2020 were announced today by Minister for Youth, Peeni Henare. Ten board members have been selected from over 150 applicants.

The Partnership Fund Board will oversee investments in partnership with business and philanthropic sectors, iwi, and other funders to increase the capability and resilience of young people and support them in participating confidently within their communities and whānau.

The Board members are Terry Shubkin, Kii Small, Paige Sullivan, Stevie Davis-Tana, Shana Malio-Satele, Duncan Matthews, Rachel Hopkins, Diva-Ataahua Ratu, Bilal Nasier and Ezekiel Raui.

 “The members demonstrate a depth of knowledge and expertise in their fields including youth development, business, not-for-profit, and governance. They represent diverse communities and will bring a valuable range of perspectives to the decision-making process,” Peeni Henare said.

 “The calibre of applicants was exceptional and I would like to acknowledge all who applied, and their demonstrated commitment to our youth.

 “I was delighted to see such strong interest from widely experienced and talented rangatahi.

 “I am keen for more young people in decision-making forums to lead and influence our future, which is why I appointed six rangatahi to this Board.

 “I look forward to supporting the Board in partnering with others to achieve great outcomes,” Peeni Henare said.
