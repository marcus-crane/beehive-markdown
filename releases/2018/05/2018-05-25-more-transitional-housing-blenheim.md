Local families in urgent need of housing will benefit from 17 more transitional housing places opening in Blenheim, says Associate Housing and Urban Development Minister Jenny Salesa.

“Everyone deserves a place to live and to have support when it is difficult to secure housing,” Jenny Salesa said. 

“The 17 apartments, at the former Brydan Motel, will provide families with a warm, dry and safe place to live temporarily, along with support services to help them secure a longer term home.

Christchurch Methodist Mission and Crossroads Marlborough Charitable Trust will manage the transitional housing and actively support the people living there.  A full-time manager will live onsite.

“Today’s opening by Marlborough District Mayor John Leggett brings the total number of transitional housing places in Blenheim to 39 and will help support those in urgent need of housing this winter and beyond.

“By the end of this winter, we’ll also have 10 new state houses to add to the 405 which are already housing people and families in this district.

“Over the next four years, we will deliver around 6,400 more state houses nationwide and many will be in regions like Marlborough where there is a high housing need.

“This government is also expanding the Housing First programme to Blenheim to house and support those who are chronically homeless and face complex issues.

“Over time, as we bring in more public housing, I hope we’ll need transitional housing less and less – but in the meantime it’s important that we have it available for those who need it” Jenny Salesa said.
