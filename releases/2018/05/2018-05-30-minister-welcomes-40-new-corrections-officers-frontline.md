Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis has today welcomed 40 new Corrections Officers to the frontline.

The recruits, who graduated at a ceremony in Upper Hutt this morning, come from a range of previous professions and include a former primary school teacher, youth worker, logging operator and lifeguard team leader.

“It is great to see so many people from different backgrounds wanting to be positive role models in prisoners’ lives to help steer them away from a life of crime,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Corrections staff do an incredible job keeping the public safe by supporting offenders to complete their rehabilitation, education and employment programmes. They are critical in helping break the cycle of re-offending and reducing the harm crime has on our whanau and wider communities.”  

Stephanie Bixley from Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award for the leadership, professionalism and overall excellence she displayed during the 12 weeks of training.

Born and bred in Hastings, Stephanie has a background in early childhood education and hospitality. She worked as a chef and café and bistro manager prior to joining Corrections.

“Stephanie has a real passion for wanting to give people the tools and support they need to change their lives for the better. These are exactly the sort of people we want and need on the frontline, so it is fantastic she has chosen to join Corrections,” Kelvin Davis said.

“She has been described as someone who is calm and confident and able to take challenges in her stride. Like all of today’s graduates, Stephanie will be a big asset to Corrections. I wish all our graduates the best as they begin their new careers.” 

The new graduates will work at Mt Eden, Auckland Region Women’s, Spring Hill and Otago Corrections facilities, and Auckland, Tongariro, Hawke’s Bay Regional, Rimutaka, Arohota, Christchurch Women’s and Christchurch Men’s prisons.
