New investment in police will lift the number of officers, see an unprecedented push to disrupt organised crime and make our families and communities safer, says Police Minister Stuart Nash.

“The Coalition Government’s police package, when fully rolled out, will deliver 1,800 new officers. It will enable the deployment of 1,100 police on the streets and 700 police to combat organised crime, supported by 485 non-sworn staff,” says Stuart Nash.

“Budget 2018 takes the first steps towards that. It includes $298.8 million in new operating funding and $17.8 million capital for the Police over the next four years. In addition, $159.7 million of new funding is provided in 2022/23.

“These increases enable the recruitment of an extra 920 officers and 240 support staff to maintain and build on the 880 officers and 245 support staff announced in Budget 2017.

“Budget 2018 provides tools and support for 21st-century policing, including the latest technology to combat organised and serious crime. We are going after the gangs to disrupt the supply of drugs in our communities. A separate Budget 2018 announcement by the Minister of Customs targets the international networks behind the methamphetamine trade,” says Stuart Nash.

“We are focusing on families and young people on the periphery of gangs, who are at risk of harm from addiction, offending and victimisation. We will enable the Police to identify and intervene with offenders as the first step to reducing crime and apprehend those who commit burglaries, robberies, theft and violence.

“With a focus on making New Zealand the world’s safest country, the Police will work closely with other government agencies and key stakeholders in our communities. Collectively, this will give vulnerable women and children a better chance to break out of cycles of dysfunction and intergenerational offending and help them improve their lives.”

New operating funding also replaces radio equipment for emergency services in 2018/19. Funding for the project totals $17.4 million, of which $11.6 million is allocated to the Police, $2.0 million to Fire and Emergency New Zealand (Internal Affairs) and $3.7 million to St John Ambulance (Health).
