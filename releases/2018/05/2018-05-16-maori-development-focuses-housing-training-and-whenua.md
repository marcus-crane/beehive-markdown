Māori Development funding in Budget 2018 will enable papakāinga housing development, improve administration of whenua Māori, expand training opportunities for our rangatahi, and promote Māori Wardens, says Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“Budget 2018 sets aside $37.0 million of new operational funding across four years for Vote Māori Development to improve outcomes across a range of fronts,” Nanaia Mahuta says.

The funding set aside includes:

- $15.0 million to provide practical assistance and resources to whānau and Māori housing providers to support papakāinga development and housing repairs through the Māori Housing Network
- $7.0 million in 2018/19 for whenua Māori reforms to improve the administration of Māori freehold land, assist with the development of Māori whenua generally and improve governance capacity
- $15.0 million of operating funding over four years to enhance education and employment outcomes for rangatahi, especially young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs), including Māori Wardens initiatives.

“The Coalition Government is committed to improving the lives and wellbeing of all New Zealanders and ensuring a thriving Aotearoa. The initiatives in Budget 2018 recognise the vital importance of whānau development.

“We want Māori to succeed as Māori. We want to see uplift for Māori in all areas of social and economic development,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
