Minister for Racing Winston Peters today announced that the Government has invested $340,045 in 16 projects to improve safety at racecourses.

The grants are made available from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety across two funding rounds.

This year’s second funding round has supported a range of infrastructure projects including track upgrades, new running rails, commentator box upgrade, and tractor equipment purchase.

The Fund plays an important role in supporting the safety of the racing industry for animals, staff, and the wider public. In many areas these facilities are widely used by the community and not just on race days.

The next funding round opens for applications on 1 August 2018 and closes on 26 September 2018.

New Zealand’s racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, are encouraged to apply to the Fund where there are safety improvements that need assistance.
