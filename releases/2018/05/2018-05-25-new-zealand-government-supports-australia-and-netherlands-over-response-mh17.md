New Zealand supports the call by Australia and the Netherlands for Russia to be held responsible for the actions of its military in the use of a Russian anti-aircraft missile against a civilian airliner, says Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

 “As the Minister of Foreign Affairs has said, New Zealand is particularly concerned by the finding of the Joint Investigation Team that the missile system used came from an identified Russian Army Brigade.

 “Russia is responsible for its military and must be held to account for this action.

 “New Zealand has consistently called for accountability for those responsible for the shooting down of MH17, whether that responsibility lies with individuals or states. New Zealand considers that where states are responsible for breaches of international law, they should be held responsible for their actions.

 “We support Australia and the Netherlands in their action, initiated tonight, and urge Russia to engage in good faith in the negotiations they have requested,” says Jacinda Ardern.
