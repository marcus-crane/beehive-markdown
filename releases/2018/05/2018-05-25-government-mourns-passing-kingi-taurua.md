Ka tanuku te maunga o Rakaumangamanga!

Ka ueue te whenua ka tangi te motu whanui mou e Kingi kua riro atu nei!

The Government joins the country in expressing our great sadness at the loss of iconic Ngāpuhi leader and broadcaster Kingi Taurua, said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Crown/Māori Relations Minister Kelvin Davis today.

“The son of Ngāpuhi was an award-winning broadcaster, a Vietnam War veteran, a former corrections officer and Chief Māori Advisor to past prime ministers,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“He brought all those experiences to bear as a tireless and staunch advocate for our country’s largest iwi.”

Kelvin Davis said: “We mourn his loss and send our sincere condolences to Kingi’s whānau, tamariki and mokopuna.

“He was fearless in the way he challenged the Crown, and always did so in true Ngāpuhi style.

“He was an iconic New Zealander and his passion will inspire another generation of leaders to come. 

 “Nō reira moe mai, okioki,” Kelvin Davis said.
