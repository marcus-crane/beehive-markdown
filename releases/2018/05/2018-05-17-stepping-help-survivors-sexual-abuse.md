Survivors of sexual abuse will receive much-needed support with increased funding for sexual abuse assessment and treatment services, ACC Minister Iain Lees-Galloway announced today.

Budget 2018 also begins work to set up a new central agent to lead a national strategy to address family and sexual violence, says Parliamentary Under-Secretary on Domestic and Sexual Violence Issues Jan Logie.

“Sexual abuse can leave deep scars, and treatment can go a long way towards helping someone recover,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

“Today’s announcement of $7.5 million of operating funding over four years for sexual abuse assessment and treatment services, co-funded by ACC, the Police and the Ministry of Health, will provide the help that is desperately needed by many New Zealanders.

“We are committed to helping New Zealanders get better mental health treatment, and this is particularly important for survivors of sexual abuse.

“These services deliver acute and non-acute medical treatment, forensic services and referrals, which are important in helping prevent long-term effects such as ongoing distress and compromised wellbeing.

“ACC works to reduce sexual assault in New Zealand and Budget 2018 has increased funding to services that work to prevent sexual abuse, and support victims through treatment.

“This Government is putting the wellbeing of people at the centre of our decisions,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Justice Jan Logie, who has the first dedicated role in the Executive focused on family and sexual violence in New Zealand’s history, welcomes the increased funding.

“There is also $2.0 million being allocated from Vote Justice to enable work to start on a dedicated government agent to transform the family and sexual violence system. Victims deserve much better and we will do much better,” says Jan Logie.

“Sexual abuse assessment and treatment services are an important part of our response to sexual violence. We need trained medical people to sensitively collect the evidence essential for a case to proceed to court, and to provide the right medical and specialist help.

“This Government is committed to ensuring people are supported and violence is prevented. Our plan includes properly resourcing sexual abuse assessment and treatment services, so I’m pleased that these crucial services are receiving the first significant funding increase from central government since 2008. It has been long overdue,” says Jan Logie.
