Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods today announced a significant investment in New Zealand’s Measurement Standards Laboratory, as the organisation celebrates World Metrology Day.

“Through Budget 2018 we are investing $16.9 million in the Measurement Standards Laboratory which will support the Government’s goal of developing a high tech science and innovation sector in New Zealand,” says Megan Woods.

“Metrology – the scientific study of measurement – plays a critical role in New Zealand’s science sector as well as the wider economy. The Measurement Standards Laboratory is responsible for maintaining the national measurement system essential for international and domestic trade, electricity metering, safe aviation, and high value manufacturing.

“So adequately supporting the metrology sector is integral to lifting R&D spending to two per cent of GDP by 2027, and our investment in the Measurement Standards Laboratory will revitalise this critical science and technology infrastructure.

“The additional funding will support the success of companies selling products and services that depend on accurate and internationally accepted traceable physical measurements, particularly exporters and high-tech industries such as space, smart grids and renewable energy.

“The funding will also be used to replace and upgrade the Measurement Standards Laboratory’s equipment, and support the hiring and training of new metrologists. This will help New Zealand seize the opportunities of disruptive technologies which rely on accurate measurement including space technology and renewable energy.

“This initiative complements the work being done to house the Measurement Standards Laboratory in a new building at the Gracefield Innovation Precinct.”

World Metrology Day is an annual celebration to mark the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875, which set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement.

Metrology, the science of measurement, plays a central role in scientific discovery and innovation, industrial manufacturing and international trade.
