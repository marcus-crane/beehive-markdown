Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern has announced the appointment of Angela Foulkes as chair and Lyn Provost as member of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security’s Advisory Panel.

The two member panel provides advice to the Inspector-General on request or on its own initiative. The panel may report to the Prime Minister on any matter relating to intelligence and security that it considers should be drawn to the attention of the Prime Minister.

The appointments were made by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, after consultation with Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee as required by statute.

Ms Foulkes’s appointment is for a term of two years and Ms Provost’s appointment is for a term of five years. Ms Foulkes was originally appointed to the Advisory Panel for a term of two years in 2014. Ms Provost is a new appointment to the Advisory Panel.

“While the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 does not require the appointment of a chair, I have proposed this to aid the effective operation of the panel,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“In addition, appointing the nominees for different terms will ensure continuity of experience on the Advisory Panel.”

Ms Foulkes has extensive public and private sector consultancy experience and has served on a range of government sector advisory and regulatory bodies, including on state sector standards, educational qualifications and government sector structure.

Ms Provost’s roles have included Deputy Commissioner of New Zealand Police, and Controller and Auditor General. She has wide-ranging experience of parliamentary and government processes working on governance, performance management, public sector reporting, accounting and auditing, machinery of government, technology, employment and financial management.

“I’m pleased to announce these new appointments, which will ensure the Inspector-General’s office is able to meet its responsibilities for independent oversight of the Government Communications Security Bureau and the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service,” Prime Minister Ardern said.
