Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta has announced a new leadership duo to progress the revitalisation of Māori language and culture at Māori Television.

“The Minister of Finance and I, in consultation with Te Matawai (independent statutory entity charged with revitalising Te reo Māori) have jointly appointed Jamie Tuuta as the new chair of the Maori Television Service board. He brings significant strategic change management and governance skills, and will bring a dynamic perspective to the challenges of a changing digital environment,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“Te Mātāwai, the Minister of Finance and I have also jointly appointed Peter-Lucas Jones as the Deputy Chair.”

“This dynamic combination of business and broadcasting expertise enables Mr Tuuta and Mr Jones to use their skills to protect and position the future of the network, while providing unique indigenous content that builds our narrative as a nation proud of who we are as tangata whenua.”

Mr Tuuta is the current Māori Trustee, chair of Te Ohu Kaimoana, Chair of Te Rūnunga o Ngāti Mutunga, Independent Chair of Taranaki Mounga Project and a director of Moana New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand.

Mr Jones is the chief executive of bi-lingual iwi radio Te Hiku Media and brings a wealth of experience in language revitalisation and radio and TV programme making.

“It is great to announce the appointment of such capable reo Māori speakers who’ve proven their commitment and passion for te reo and he tāngata,” said Minister Mahuta.”

Mr Tuuta takes over as chair from Dame Georgina Te Heuheu, while Mr Jones replaces Piripi Walker who resigned at the end of last year. The Minister thanked Dame Georgina and Mr Walker for their service.

Te Mātāwai is the independent statutory entity for revitalising and promoting te reo Māori.
