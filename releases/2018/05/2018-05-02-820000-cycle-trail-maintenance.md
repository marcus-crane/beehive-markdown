The Government is investing $820,000 in the upkeep of eleven Great Rides of Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

The investment comes from the eighth round of the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, which aims to ensure New Zealand’s premier rides are maintained to their current world class standard.

“The cycle trails are tools for regional development, helping attract visitors year round and providing opportunities for local businesses to sprout up or expand. We want to ensure that they are well looked after,” Mr Davis says.

“Most people using the Great Rides are Kiwis, and the trails are big drawcards for domestic tourism.

“Our international visitors who cycle – about 220,000 per year – are high-value in all senses of the word. Not only do they spend around $1000 more than the average visitor, they also stay longer and visit more regions.”

The trails to receive funding are:

- Central Otago Clutha Trails Limited: Roxburgh Gorge and Clutha Gold Trails (Otago), $82,721
- Far North District Council: Twin Coast Cycle Trail (Northland), $284,174
- Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust: Old Ghost Road (West Coast), $24,324
- Nelson City Council: Dun Mountain Trail (Nelson/Tasman), $20,000
- Queen Charlotte Track Incorporated: Queen Charlotte Track (Marlborough), $45,000
- Queenstown Trails Trust: Queenstown Trail (Otago), $15,125
- Ruapehu District Council: Mountains to Sea (Manawatū-Whanganui), $11,890
- Tasman District Council: Tasman’s Great Taste Trail (Nelson/Tasman), $300,000
- Tourism Waitaki: Alps 2 Ocean (Canterbury/Otago), $14,203
- West Coast Wilderness Trail Trust: West Coast Wilderness Trail (West Coast), $23,073.

Maintenance projects include storm damage repairs, trail surface improvements, weed control and installation of signage.

This is part of the Government’s ongoing investment in the Great Rides of Nga Haerenga, including $3.4 million to extend the Hauraki Rail Trail and $2.4m to extend the Tasman cycle trail.
