Minister for Internal Affairs Tracey Martin has received a report from the Chair of the Royal Commission into Historical Abuse in State Care, Sir Anand Satyanand, on the terms of reference for the inquiry and is actively considering his recommendations. 

“I would like to thank all those who have submitted on the terms of reference for the Royal Commission. I know this will have been a challenging process for survivors and I want to acknowledge their engagement,” Tracey Martin said.

 “Sir Anand’s report will be carefully considered by a group of Ministers who did the initial work on establishing the inquiry. We will then take a recommendation to Cabinet which will decide the final terms of reference for the Royal Commission.

 “As is the case with these types of reports, we won’t be releasing it prior to a Cabinet decision.  We aim to confirm a final terms of reference as quickly as we can and we will provide additional comment then.”
