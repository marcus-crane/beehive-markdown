Improving how water management services support healthy communities and a sustainable economy is a focus of Budget 2018, says Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Coalition Government is committed to partnerships with local government to tackle the big-picture issues in managing our ‘three waters’ – drinking water, waste water and storm water,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“The scale of the challenge means we need to work closely with councils, iwi and other stakeholders to better support healthy communities, protect the environment and get our water infrastructure right for development. The new Budget funding will help us plan the best way forward.

“Budget 2018 sets aside $3.0 million of new operating funding over the next two years to respond to problems identified in the first stage of a three-waters review this year.

“The additional work we are funding includes policy advice and support, specialist advice and working with local government on our plan. This is an important investment to ensure that current and future planning of three-waters infrastructure can be better addressed,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
