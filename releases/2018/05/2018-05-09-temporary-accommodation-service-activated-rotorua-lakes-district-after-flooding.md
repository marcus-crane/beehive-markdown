Rotorua residents who were affected by recent severe rain and flooding can now access help finding temporary accommodation, with the Government activating its Temporary Accommodation Service, Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development Jenny Salesa announced today.

“The Temporary Accommodation Service (TAS) has been activated by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to help people whose homes were damaged by the extreme weather and flooding on 29 April 2018,” Jenny Salesa said.

"TAS is working with local authorities to assess the damage and establish how many homes will need to be repaired, but it is clear assistance will be required for a significant number of households for temporary accommodation.

"The TAS team will collect registrations from displaced people who require temporary accommodation, establish what accommodation options are suitable, and connect them together.

“The service proved successful in the Christchurch and Kaikōura earthquakes, and the Edgecumbe floods, and the level of damage and displacement justifies us establishing this service in Rotorua.

“I urge anyone who has a current or expected need following the flooding to register their details at [www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz](http://www.temporaryaccommodation.mbie.govt.nz/#_blank)  Alternatively, call 0508 754 163 to discuss your requirements.

“I would also urge tenants and landlords of rental properties to visit [www.tenancy.govt.nz](http://www.tenancy.govt.nz/#_blank) to familiarise themselves with their tenancy rights and obligations following an event like this,” Jenny Salesa said.
