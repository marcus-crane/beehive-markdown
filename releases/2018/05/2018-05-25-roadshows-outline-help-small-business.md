Small Business Minister Stuart Nash will next week launch the 2018 series of small business roadshows. The roadshows give business owners the opportunity to learn more about assistance available from the Government.

*Taking Care of Business* is a series of 12 events across New Zealand between May and August. The roadshows bring together the private sector with representatives from government agencies to explain what they do and how they can help small businesses.

This Government is working to give every small business in New Zealand the tools and the confidence to meet their potential, and realise their goals as a business,” says Mr Nash.

“New Zealand is a nation of small businesses. This roadshow is designed to help these firms get the most out of their interactions with the Government so they can spend more time on what they do best.

“As well as playing a regulatory role the Government offers a range of services to help businesses be successful. We help owners and operators tap into these resources.

“Whether a small business is worried about meeting health and safety legislation, tax or ACC obligations, or if they want to find help to grow their business, they have someone they can talk to directly.

“Government agencies do a lot for small business, whether it’s providing advice on compliance or ways to improve innovation, growth and productivity. There will also be an opportunity to hear about Budget 2018 support for the business sector,” Mr Nash says.

The roadshow events include short presentations from up to fifteen government agencies. These include ACC, WorkSafe, Immigration New Zealand, Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and StatsNZ.

“There will be opportunities to ask questions and have face to face discussions. Expert advisors will be on hand with practical information,” Mr Nash says.

“For example Immigration New Zealand will discuss how to find, bring and keep the best skilled migrants when a business can’t recruit within New Zealand. Regional Business Partners’ Growth Advisors will explain how they can help a business connect with the right resources and experts to build capability and grow, and IPONZ will explain different types of intellectual property and give some simple tips.

Events will be held in the following towns and cities:

- Wellington, 29 May
- Levin, 30 May
- Rotorua, 5 June
- Taupo, 6 June
- Napier, 7 June
