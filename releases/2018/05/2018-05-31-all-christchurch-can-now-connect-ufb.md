All residents of Christchurch and the surrounding areas can now connect to a faster network with the early completion of the ultra-fast broadband project in the city.

Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran today announced the completion, which makes fibre available direct to nearly 200,000 end users.

“The build is part of the government’s initiative to make fibre broadband available to 87 per cent of Kiwi households and businesses by the end of 2022 and I’m delighted the build in Christchurch has been completed a year ahead of schedule,” Clare Curran said.

“The next step is to encourage more people to use it. Latest figures show only 35.6 per cent of Christchurch business and households are connected to ultra-fast broadband. More people need to make the most of this world-class broadband internet which is now on their doorstep.

“UFB can deliver speeds close to 1,000 Megabits per second. Having ultra-fast broadband in classrooms, businesses or at home, greatly improves access to educational and entertainment content, improves productivity and encourages innovation in the tech sector.”

Greater Christchurch’s ultra-fast broadband infrastructure extends to Woodend, Kaiapoi, Lyttelton, Mandeville, Rangiora, Lincoln, Rolleston, Templeton, Prebbleton, Tai Tapu and Tuahiwi.

“Christchurch is the first of the country’s three major centres to have the ultra-fast broadband infrastructure completely built,” says Ms Curran. 

“This Ultra-Fast Broadband initiative is one of the largest and most ambitious infrastructure projects ever undertaken in New Zealand. We’re making great progress in rolling out fibre around the country, and are currently running five per cent ahead of schedule.

“Being connected has become an essential part of our everyday lives. The completion in Christchurch means existing businesses and emerging businesses are able to connect to the best infrastructure on offer. I hope this will help boost the economy and the fortunes of the people of Christchurch.”

The latest figures in the Quarterly Broadband Deployment update show nearly 1.3 million end users across the country have access to ultra-fast broadband. More than 42 per cent of those end users have already taken up the connection.
