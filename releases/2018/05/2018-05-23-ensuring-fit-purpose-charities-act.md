Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Peeni Henare, has launched a comprehensive review of the Charities Act.

“The Charities Act 2005 regulates more than 27,000 charities in New Zealand, and as it has been in place for more than a decade it is now time to see if it’s fit for purpose,” Peeni Henare said.

“A lot has changed in the charities sector, and it is important to make sure that the Act is still working well for all those who operate within it.

“This is a great opportunity to take a look at the legislation that guides charities.

The terms of reference, which were approved by Cabinet earlier this week, define the structure and scope of the review.

“The review will cover many substantive issues. The extent to which charities can advocate for their causes, and ways to appeal the regulator’s decisions, all need looking at.

Formal consultation will begin later in the year, when stakeholders and members of the public can provide their feedback on what is working, and what is not.

“The broad scope of the review will enable robust discussions on many key issues that are of interest to the sector and the public.

“I urge everyone with an interest in the work of charities to get involved and have their say,” Peeni Henare said. 

The Department of Internal Affairs is leading the review process, working closely alongside a Core Reference Group of representatives from the charity sector.
