Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is travelling to New Caledonia today to coincide with the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, and French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian.

The French President is hosting a high level dialogue with a range of Pacific Leaders.

“France plays an important role when it comes to climate change, and New Zealand welcomes Frances’ role in Pacific climate change issues, including as an advocate for the Pacific in the EU,” Mr Peters said.

During his visit, Mr Peters will also meet with Pacific leaders and the Pacific Community. The Pacific Community is the region’s premier scientific and technical agency.

“The Pacific Community provides an invaluable role in providing technical support to Pacific island countries, and we are looking forward to strengthening our engagement with the agency.

“Deeper partnerships are at the heart of New Zealand’s refresh strategic approach to the region, and participation in these talks will underscore the importance we place on supporting the Pacific with climate adaptation, resilience and disaster risk reduction,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters returns Sunday 6 May.
