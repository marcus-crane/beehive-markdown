Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of Tahamoana Macpherson as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Thailand.

“We have a close and longstanding relationship with Thailand, which we are looking to advancing into new areas of collaboration,” says Mr Peters.

“Business and trade links continue to grow, and Thailand is now New Zealand’s eighth largest trading partner. Trade is underpinned by the Closer Economic Partnership, and the ASEAN-Australia/New Zealand Free Trade Agreement,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Macpherson was until recently Chief of Staff to the Mayor of Auckland.  A diplomat for 20 years, he was Ambassador to the Republic of Turkey, and DPMC Foreign Policy Advisor. Mr Macpherson has also served in London and Washington D.C.

Mr Macpherson will also be accredited as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Cambodia and to Lao People’s Democratic Republic, based in Bangkok.
