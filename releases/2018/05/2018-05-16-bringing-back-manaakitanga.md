“This year’s Budget delivers for Māori,” Māori Ministers Kelvin Davis, Nanaia Mahuta, Peeni Henare, Meka Whaitiri and Willie Jackson said today. 

“The Prime Minister wants this Government to bring back manaakitanga. Budget 2018 realises this vision by building a strong foundation for the future of all Māori,” says Kelvin Davis.

“Nine years of neglect by the previous National Government across housing, education and healthcare have hurt our people. 

“The Families Package now being implemented contributes $1.2 billion over four years to help whānau through accommodation supplements, winter energy payments, boosts to Working for Families and the Best Start payment.

“Budget 2018 continues our focus on whānau, tamariki and rangatahi by rebuilding health, housing and education services, and upholding our commitment to te reo Māori,” says Kelvin Davis.

“The $37.0 million of new funding for Vote Māori Development recognises that whānau are the key to improving outcomes for Māori,” says Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta. 

This investment includes operating funding of:

- $15.0 million in 2018/19 for papakāinga housing
- $7.0 million in 2018/19 for the whenua Māori programme to support and unlock opportunities in whenua Māori for our whānau
- $15.0 million set aside over four years for rangatahi Māori to move from learning to earning, including Māori Warden initiatives.

“We want to see Māori succeed as Māori. We want uplift for Māori in all areas of social and economic development. Budget 2018 funding will improve whānau outcomes in housing and land development and provide opportunities for rangatahi and community development,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Helping our whānau, clothing our tamariki, and ensuring that our kaumatua and kuia can afford to heat their homes is a focus of Budget 2018,” says Peeni Henare.

“Many of our kaumatua and kuia are taking care of their mokopuna. Budget 2018 provides $104.9 million operating funds over four years for Clothing Allowances for children supported by the Orphans Allowance and Unsupported Child’s Benefit. About half of these carers are Māori. Our approach puts whānau at the centre,” says Peeni Henare.

“Budget 2018 will have a huge impact on Māori and their housing,” says Meka Whaitiri. 

“It is estimated that over $250 million from the Families Package changes in the accommodation supplement will benefit Māori over the next four years. Much of the new money for transitional housing and the Housing First programme will improve the quality of life for our tamariki and whānau,” says Meka Whaitiri.

“Budget 2018 delivers real opportunities for our rangatahi to build a bright future through earning and learning,” says Willie Jackson.

“We are investing in our rangatahi who are not in employment, education or training by introducing initiatives, including through the Māori Wardens, to give them the best chance to succeed in the economy and their communities.”

“Budget 2018 will help better integrate te reo Māori into our schools and provide pathways so our tamariki and rangatahi can excel in both te reo and tikanga, with $14.5 million in operating funding over four years,” says Kelvin Davis.

“Growing our language capacity in all schools, while training the next generation of te reo and tikanga experts, will ensure the protection and preservation of our taonga,” says Kelvin Davis. 

“We cannot fix all the challenges Māori face in a single Budget – but we are starting to turn things around. We are building the foundations for a future full of Māori success.”
