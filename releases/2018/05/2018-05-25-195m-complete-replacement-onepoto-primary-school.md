Around $19.5 million will be invested to completely replace and rebuild Onepoto Primary School as part of Budget 2018, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

Mr Hipkins visited Onepoto Primary School in Auckland today to make the announcement.

"This rebuild provides a great opportunity for this Government to address growth pressures and the condition of the school at the same time," Mr Hipkins said.

"The school will be completely rebuilt to accommodate a roll of 350 students. Around 600 more students are expected in this area over the next 10 years as a result of new housing developments, as part of a coordinated multi government agency approach.

"Onepoto Primary is currently run down in parts and battling with reduced maintenance funding. Teaching and learning is taking place in classrooms that are in poor condition.

"Today's announcement demonstrates the Coalition Government's commitment to ensuring schools have enough teaching spaces that are modern and fit-for-purpose to support students to succeed.

"Onepoto Primary can now plan for the future and be in a position to serve as an important hub in the rapidly growing local community.

This funding is a part of the $332 million announced in Budget 2018 to support schools experiencing roll growth pressures.

Further announcements will be made about investments in school property under Budget 2018 in the coming weeks.

Construction on the school is expected to start in about 18 months.
