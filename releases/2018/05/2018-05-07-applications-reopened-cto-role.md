Broadcasting, Communications, Digital Media and Government Digital Services Minister Clare Curran has reopened applications for New Zealand’s first Chief Technology Officer (CTO).

“The Chief Technology Officer will help drive a digital agenda for the nation and respond to the opportunities and challenges of our changing digital world.  This critical role will have a broad mandate to serve as a challenge to, and advisor for, the New Zealand Government,” Clare Curran said.

“I’ve worked with the initial members of our new Digital Economy and Digital Inclusion Ministerial Advisory Group to refine and shape the role to ensure we get the right person to play a lead part in developing a digital strategy for New Zealand.

“We are looking for someone who has a high level of expertise in the digital technology industry, who has the ability to influence a range of different groups, and the passion and drive to instigate action.

“This is the second round of recruitment for this critical role, and to recognise that different skills and abilities will suit this role at different points, we are looking at a one-year appointment with an option to renew for another year,” Clare Curran said.

The position description outlines a skilled chief advisor who can work collaboratively across government and with a range of other stakeholders to provide independent expert advice to Ministers and senior leaders on digital issues.

In the first phase, the key critical work will focus on:

- Planning for future workforce needs and the development of new skills;
- Responding to emerging and disruptive technologies; and
- Ensuring all our communities are supported to improve their digital access and build equity.
