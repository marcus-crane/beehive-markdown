Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters departs Tokyo this evening following a productive three-day visit to Japan.

“This visit reaffirmed the strength and significant mutual benefit of the New Zealand Japan relationship,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand and Japan continue to enjoy a strong trade and economic relationship, which will continue to grow following the conclusion of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement,” 

“We have also long enjoyed friendships through cultural and sporting contacts.  And we have shared interests on defence and security, including on issues like North Korea.”

Mr Peters’ programme included participation at the eighth Japan-Pacific Leaders’ (PALM8) Meeting in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, and a formal meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  In Tokyo, Mr Peters met with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Taro Aso, and with Foreign Minister Taro Kono.

“My meetings with Japan’s senior political leadership confirmed there is much that New Zealand and Japan can do together to harness even more value from the relationship”.

“Our shared commitment to the rules-based international system makes Japan an important partner for New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific” says Mr Peters.

Building on cooperation through the PALM8 process, Mr Peters and Foreign Minister Kono confirmed their strong commitment to strengthening coordination and cooperation in the Pacific region including development assistance.

Mr Peters also announced that New Zealand would continue a tradition of over 50 years by gifting a white horse to Tōshōgū Shrine in Nikkō, Japan.
