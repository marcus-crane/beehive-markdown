Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today released a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters regarding working arrangements while she is on maternity leave.

“Mr Peters will act as Prime Minister while I am on maternity leave from later next month and will work with my office while staying in touch with me, as he does on other occasions when I’m away,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“While it’s no different than other times that he is Acting Prime Minister, because of the public interest in these particular arrangements, I have set them out in a letter to Mr Peters.”
