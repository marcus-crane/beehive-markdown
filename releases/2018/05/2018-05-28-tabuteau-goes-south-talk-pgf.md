Regional Economic Development Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is travelling to Nelson, Christchurch and Invercargill this week to discuss the Government’s key priorities for the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) and hear directly from the regions about their plans.

Since the launch of the PGF in February, Mr Tabuteau has visited several regions including Gisborne, Taranaki and Whanganui.

“There are a number of excellent projects and proposals underway across the South Island and I am excited to learn more about them,” Fletcher Tabuteau says. 

Mr Tabuteau will meet with a wide range of stakeholders while in the South Island including economic development agencies, local councils, businesses and iwi, to discuss ways the Government can best support them to unlock their potential and deliver economic growth.

His visits will include Port Nelson, the maritime gateway for the Nelson-Marlborough regions which services several key local industries including the forestry, fisheries and horticultural sectors. 

He will also learn first-hand about Canterbury’s economic development priorities, Invercargill’s inner city rejuvenation plans, and the Milford Opportunities Project set up to manage the growing tourist numbers in Milford.

“The success of the PGF will rely on strong enduring partnerships and shared aspirations with the regions and I look forward to continuing this important work across provincial New Zealand,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
