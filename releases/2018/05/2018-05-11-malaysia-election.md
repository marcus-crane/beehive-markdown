Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern congratulates Dr Mahathir Mohamad on becoming Malaysia’s Prime Minister, following his party’s victory in national elections.

The result is the first time an opposition party has won the election in Malaysia’s 61 years of independence.

“New Zealand is encouraged by the respect for democratic processes and the early steps towards a peaceful transition to the next government,” Jacinda Ardern says.

“Malaysia and New Zealand enjoy a warm, longstanding relationship underpinned by Commonwealth ties, mutual respect for democratic and legal institutions and historic defence ties that saw New Zealand military deployed during the Malayan Emergency.  Since then we have become close trading partners and have collaborated on many regional and international issues.”

New Zealand also receives increasing numbers of Malaysian tourists with more than 55,000 visitors in the past year.

“The New Zealand Government looks forward to continued cooperation with the new Malaysian Government,” Jacinda Ardern said.
