Transport Minister Phil Twyford apologises unreservedly for making a phone call on a domestic flight after the aircraft doors had shut in preparation for take-off.

“I recognise that I made the call when I shouldn’t have,” Phil Twyford said.

“This is inappropriate for anyone, but particularly inappropriate for me as Transport Minister.

“I apologise unreservedly.

“I have apologised to the Prime Minister and offered my resignation as Transport Minister. She has declined my offer but chosen to transfer my responsibility for the Civil Aviation Authority to Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter.

“I have referred the matter to the Civil Aviation Authority who will follow whatever processes they deem appropriate,” Phil Twyford said.
