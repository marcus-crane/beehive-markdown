The Coalition Government’s plan to enhance education and employment outcomes for rangatahi has been given a boost in Budget 2018, say Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Employment Minister Willie Jackson.

“As we make significant investments to strengthen the foundations of our critical public services and infrastructure, we are also investing in building our communities and the futures of our rangatahi,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Ensuring they succeed in our economy is vital to the future prosperity of New Zealand.”

Budget 2018 sets aside $15.0 million of new operating funding over the next four years to enhance education and employment outcomes for rangatahi. The funding will focus especially on young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs), and will support Māori Wardens initiatives.

“We have around 84,000 NEETs in New Zealand, and it is important to invest in them now to give them the best chance to succeed. They are a vital part of our future,” says Willie Jackson.”

The Government announced earlier this year funding for He Poutama Rangatahi in four regions: Tairāwhiti, Te Tai Tokerau, Eastern Bay of Plenty and Hawke’s Bay. He Poutama Rangatahi connects NEETs to skills training and employment pathways.

“Over the last few months, parts of our labour market have declared skills shortages across the country. We have been listening to industries like building and construction, roading and farming who are concerned about the future workforce.

“Our plan enables rangatahi to upgrade their skills to match the exciting employment opportunities of tomorrow. 

“Our earlier investment in employment outcomes for rangatahi NEETs was focused on our struggling regions. Now we need to ensure that our urban centres are being catered for as well,” says Willie Jackson.
