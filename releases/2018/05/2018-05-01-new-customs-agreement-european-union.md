More streamlined trade between New Zealand and our key European markets will be one of the potential benefits of a Customs Cooperation Agreement with the European Union, says Customs Minister Hon Meka Whaitiri.

“I am delighted that both countries have now completed their respective processes to bring the agreement into force this month, demonstrating our joint ongoing commitment to close cooperation.  

“This Agreement strengthens cooperation with the European Union in terms of customs procedures, and supply chain security and risk management.

“It enables our customs authorities to learn from each other, particularly in areas such as research and development of customs technology. It also sets the scene for possible further agreements between New Zealand and the European Union on other aspects of the customs relationship.”

New Zealand has secure trade schemes with China, Australia, South Korea, Japan and the United States.

Under these schemes, each country recognises the other’s security measures and customs processes, ensuring that imported and exported goods are fully compliant with customs requirements at each step along the supply chain.

“The agreement also represents a significant first step in setting up a mutually recognised secure trade scheme between New Zealand and the European Union. A secure trade scheme with the European Union will give accredited New Zealand exporters a major advantage in the form of faster clearance of goods into the European market,” says Meka Whaitiri.
