Problems with NCEA “credit farming” and overassessment, and the need for more vocational pathways into tertiary education are among the issues raised by Minister of Education Chris Hipkins’ Youth Advisory Group.

They are contained in the report of the Group’s first meeting, in February, released today.

“The Group’s initial insights provide a valuable contribution to the national education conversation, which has already been joined by more than 6700 people,” Mr Hipkins said.

“I’m really pleased with the quality of thinking and the ownership the Group is taking, as representatives of students nationwide. Our young people are one of the ‘expert groups’ I’m really keen to tap into to help guide the changes we need to make to fully modernise our education system.

“I’m looking forward to hearing more from them as we work through these and other issues,” Mr Hipkins said.   

Mr Hipkins urged more young people to join the conversation about the future of New Zealand’s education system.

"Around 200 young people are expected at the two education summits, and they will play an important role.

“But I want all children and young people to have their say by answering the short survey at conversation.education.govt.nz and taking part in the regional roadshow that is planned in coming months.”

The Youth Advisory Group is due to meet the Minister again next week.

**Background**

The Youth Advisory Group was set up in November 2017 to enable young people to have their say and have more influence on the education system and issues that affect them. Insights from the Youth Advisory Group are shared with the Ministry of Education and other education sector agencies.

The 2018 Youth Advisory Group members, aged 14-18, are:

- Shaneel Lal, South Auckland
- Bevan Penn, Wellington
- Abby McRoberts, Porirua
- Liam McLeavey, Levin
- Okirano Tilaia, Christchurch
- Geniqua Samupo, West Auckland
- Brodie Cross, Christchurch
- Nathan Farr, Dunedin
- Hadassah Wharawhara, Kerikeri
- Costa Blackman, Tolaga Bay
- Kate Morris, Darfield
- Watene Campbell, Wellington

The advisory group meets four times each year. The first meeting was on 8 and 9 February and the next meeting take places on 10 and 11 May.

An Online Youth Forum has also been launched. It is open to any young person aged 14-18.

The Forum participants will test insights gathered from the advisory group and discuss aspects of education with other young people on the forum, to ensure a wide range of viewpoints on selected education topics.
