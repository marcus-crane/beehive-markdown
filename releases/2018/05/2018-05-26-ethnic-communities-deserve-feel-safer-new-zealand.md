Over 150 Ethnic Community Leaders and Government Ministers have collaborated at the Inaugural *Safer Ethnic Communities Ministerial Forum* in Auckland today.  

The Forum was opened by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and connected Ethnic communities to several Government Ministers and their agencies to work on long-term plans to improve safety in our communities,

The programme covered:

- The role of social inclusion in creating safer communities
- Family violence and harm
- Small business crime prevention.

“There was robust and candid discussion about Family Violence in our communities and also the impact of racism and targeted violence on families and small businesses,” said Ethnic Communities Minister Jenny Salesa.  

The country’s top Police Officers - Commissioner Mike Bush, Assistant Commissioner Wallace Humaha and dozens of other officers also participated in the Forum.

Wallace Humaha presented on *Te Pai Oranga*, a restorative Justice Programme bringing together Police, Justice agencies, community workers, and Maori Leaders to reduce offending and address the causes of crime. 

Justice Minister Andrew Little, Police Minister Stuart Nash, Associate Justice Minister Aupito William Sio and Minister Salesa adressed the Forum.

Parliamentary Under Secretaries Michael Wood, and Jan Logie and MP’s Raymond Huo and Priyanka Radhakrishnan hosted the group sessions and panels.

“The strong Government representation at the Forum shows our commitment to finding cross ministerial solutions for safer communities. We want Ethnic Communities to feel a strong sense of belonging in New Zealand,” Michael Wood said. 

“In order to have a long term solution to safer and more inclusive communities we need to end the cycle of poverty and have better access to health and education for everyone.” Jenny Salesa said. 

Solutions from the *Safer Ethnic Communities Ministerial Forum* will be used to influence and inform government policy and service design.

**NB - The Forum was an invitation only event with limited media access so that participants could talk openly.**
