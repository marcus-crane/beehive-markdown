The Ngā Rohe Moana o Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Porou Bill (No 2) passed its first reading in Parliament today, says Minister for Treaty Negotiations Andrew Little.

 “The Bill is the first of the Marine and Coastal Area Act legislation. The settlement will give Ngāti Porou customary title over significant parts of the East Coast coastline, as well as customary rights such as fishing and the protection of wāhi tapu.

 “The Bill represents years of good faith negotiations between the Crown and ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou, and provides the East Coast iwi with a statutory regime governing the common marine and coastal area in their rohe moana.

 “Ngāti Porou reached an agreement with the Crown under the repealed Foreshore and Seabed Act.

 “When the Marine and Coastal Area Act (Takutai Moana Act) was passed in 2011, the Crown began negotiating with Ngāti Porou to amend their initial agreement to ensure its alignment with the new legislation. That said, there are some aspects under the Ngāti Porou Bill that are not available under the MACA legislation.

 “Fundamentally, the Bill recognises the mana of ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou over their rohe moana. It provides legal mechanisms to support the mana of the hapū and those specific areas where customary marine title rights are recognised.

 “The Bill also recognises the Crown’s responsibility in maintaining access to the common marine and coastal area. It provides certainty regarding the public use and administration of ngā rohe moana o ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou,” says Andrew Little.
