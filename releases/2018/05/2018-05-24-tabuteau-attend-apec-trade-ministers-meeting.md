Parliamentary Under-Secretary Fletcher Tabuteau is heading to Papua New Guinea today to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) Trade Ministers Meeting in Port Moresby from 25 to 26 May.

Mr Tabuteau will join counterparts from 20 APEC economies to talk about emerging trade and economic opportunities and challenges in the Asia Pacific region, including ways to support the multilateral trading system, remove barriers to trade and investment, and promote inclusive and sustainable growth.

“As an exporting economy, New Zealand strongly supports free trade and the rules-based trading system which has led to greater prosperity for our country and for the Asia Pacific region,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“Protectionism in the region would only take us all backwards.

“This meeting is an opportunity to have New Zealand’s voice at the table and make our views clear on these important issues.

“The Government’s Trade for All Agenda recognises that trade must benefit everyone. I will discuss with APEC partners how we can work together to pursue trade and economic growth that is more progressive and inclusive,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

In the margins of the APEC meeting, Mr Tabuteau will meet with some of his counterparts to discuss wider trade and economic issues.

APEC includes all the major economies in the Asia Pacific Region: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.

APEC includes 14 of New Zealand’s top 20 export markets and covers 71 per cent of New Zealand’s total goods and services trade.
