The Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated the winner of the Ahuwhenua Trophy the Onuku Māori Lands Trust from Rotorua. 

“They have won the country’s top agricultural award with a policy of sharing the benefits from  their dairy farms and always planning actively for the future. 

“I am delighted that the judges said that the Trust had always ‘demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility to their people’ and had brought a wide range of skills to their business. 

“They also praised the Trust’s environmental record and their strong environmental focus. Onuku have been part of Project Rerewhakaaitu which aims to reduce nitrogen and phosphate levels in the lake.” 

Onuku’s winning dairy farm displayed good levels of productivity according to the judges. The Trust’s strategy is to use this winning farm as a pathway for rangatahi to work larger dairy farms on Onuku land. 

“I am pleased that Onuku has a strong focus on supporting their people. Their focus on educational scholarships and training the next generation will make sure their whānau thrive in the future. 

“I thank them for the way they treasure both their land and plan for the coming generations of rangatahi,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
