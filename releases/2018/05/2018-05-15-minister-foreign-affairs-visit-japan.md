Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is travelling to Japan this week to attend the eighth Japan-Pacific Leaders’ (PALM) Meeting and to undertake a number of bilateral calls.

The PALM Meeting, hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Iwaki, will also be attended by Leaders from Pacific Islands Forum member countries and territories.  

Mr Peters will also have meetings with Prime Minister Abe, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Taro Kono. 

“Japan is one of New Zealand’s most important partners with common values and interests.  We have long standing ties at the political, trade and economic levels,” says Mr Peters .

“New Zealand welcomes Japan’s engagement in and development assistance to the Pacific. In the context of our Pacific Reset, New Zealand looks forward to building up our cooperation with Japan on Pacific issues.”

Japan’s hosting of the Rugby World Cup next year provides an occasion for further strengthening these linkages.

Mr Peters will be in Japan from 18 to 20 May.
