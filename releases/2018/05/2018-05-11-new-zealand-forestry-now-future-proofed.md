The Associate Minister of Forestry the Hon Meka Whaitiri says the launch of Te Uru Rākau will mean that the New Zealand forestry industry will be future proofed. 

“In my new role I will make sure that Māori who want to use their land for forestry can by establishing  much closer partnerships between the Government and the Māori people. I have also been delegated all initiatives for afforestation in the Tairāwhiti and East Coast area.  

“I will also make sure that we develop a diverse, skilled and safe workforce. I also have a new role in championing and engaging women in the forestry industry. 

“With this new responsibility for skills training, I hope to be announcing some Forestry Scholarships at Fieldays this year.  

“I was delighted to be on the ground in Rotorua today when the Forestry Service was renamed and rebranded for its big job of planting a billion trees over the next ten years. 

“This not only honours the coalition deal between New Zealand First  and Labour but it recognises the fact that Rotorua is the centre of forestry in New Zealand. I also welcome the decision to spend another $15 million on the work of setting up of Te Uru Rākau. 

“This is a critical industry for the New Zealand economy as it is our third largest exporter with an income of $5 billion.  

“Today’s rebrand will create a new impetus for forestry in our regions, creating jobs and new skills and training opportunities in provincial New Zealand,” says Meka Whaitiri.
