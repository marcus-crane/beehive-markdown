The Ministry of Social Development has been approached with 79 opportunities so far to help house people in need this winter, Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford says.

“Kiwis have heard the Government’s call to arms to help the homeless this winter. MSD is now looking into every one of these offers to see if they are suitable.”

The offers follow an announcement by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Phil Twyford at Te Puea Marae earlier this month of a $37 million investment for at least 1500 more transitional, and Housing First and public housing places by the end of winter.

Phil Twyford said the number of homeless coming forward this winter could be worse than seen in previous years.

“After years of drift and neglect, the number of people needing help finding somewhere to live has soared. Many of these people are only coming forward now they know there is a new Government that not only accepts there is a housing crisis, but is doing everything it can to fix it.

“It took a decade for the national housing crisis to become so acute. It will take time to fix it.

“In the meantime, our Government will make sure everyone is supported to find somewhere warm and dry this winter.

“We’d still like those with vacant seasonal accommodation, housing or unused land that is already connected to facilities such as power and water to contact MSD at [housing@msd.govt.nz](mailto:housing@msd.govt.nz). I’d also like to reiterate that anyone who needs help with housing this winter should go to Work and Income. Our frontline services are ready with a raft of options to help,” Phil Twyford said.
