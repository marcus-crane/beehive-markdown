Significant Contributions to Civil Defence Emergency Management have been recognised by Minister of Civil Defence Kris Faafoi at an event in Wellington tonight.

“Tonight we recognised people who have made a vital contribution to Civil Defence Emergency Management in New Zealand,” Mr Faafoi says. “Through their efforts, they have helped make our communities safer and more resilient.

“Civil Defence Emergency Management attracts dedicated and talented people, and tonight’s recipients are representative of the commitment and innovation we see right across the sector.

“These award recipients have set an excellent example for those who follow, and deserve recognition at the national level.”

One gold and three silver Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) awards were presented this year.

The 2018 CDEM Gold Award was presented to Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management Capability & Operations Manager David Coetzee for his work championing the implementation of Emergency Mobile Alerts.

Silver Award recipients are:

- John Clarke for his significant contribution to emergency management in the Tairāwhiti region over the past 35 years.
- Derek Phyn, a GIS analyst at Waikato regional Council, for the significant contribution he has made to Civil Defence Emergency Management through his efforts in promoting the use of GIS in emergency management.
- Northland welfare manager Claire Nyberg for the significant contribution she has made to local, regional and National welfare arrangements.

Tonight’s awards ceremony also recognised innovation in CDEM through the presentation of the Director’s Innovation Award. This award recognises exceptional innovation or creativity that has pushed the boundaries of current CDEM practice in New Zealand.

This year’s Innovation Awards, presented by Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management Director Sarah Stuart-Black, went to:
