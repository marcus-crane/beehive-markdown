Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Clare Curran has launched New Zealand’s first media hub for children – HEIHEI - which creates a safe place for children to access both local and international stories.

“Tamariki are this country’s future and it’s vital for them to hear and see their own voices and stories and for our culture to be reflected in content, without advertising,” Clare Curran said.

“Through HEIHEI New Zealand kids will be able to access quality content, relevant to their age and culture, 24 hours a day – putting us up with countries such as Australia, Norway and Ireland which have dedicated channels for children’s content.

“New Zealand has the lowest level of public service media funding of almost any developed country. That’s why Budget 2018 has $15m set aside for 2018/19 to increase access to quality content, including children’s content, and to transform RNZ into RNZ+.

“I acknowledge there has been some difficulty in the past getting broadcasters to air local children’s content at all, let alone at suitable times. HEIHEI more than steps into this space.”

HEIHEI content will be available across a range of formats including video, games, audio and music.

“We know children are usually the quickest to adapt to and use new technology.

HEIHEI gives parents and guardians the knowledge their children will be exploring age-appropriate content in a safe place,” Clare Curran said.

“Aimed at five to nine year-olds HEIHEI has been developed in consultation with children representing our diverse culture. And they’ve had a say on the design, branding, name and content.

“My congratulations go to NZ On Air and TVNZ who have worked collaboratively in the development of HEIHEI.

“I am sure this will be the first of many collaborations which will ensure the sector continues to be responsive to providing sustainable and high-quality content across all media channels.”

HEIHEI is available as an IOS app and Android app, or at [www.heihei.nz](http://www.heihei.nz/).
