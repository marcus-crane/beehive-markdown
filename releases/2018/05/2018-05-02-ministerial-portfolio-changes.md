A small number of portfolio changes will take effect from today, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced.

“As signalled in my recent speech to the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs, New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters will be appointed to the reinstated Disarmament and Arms Control portfolio,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“This portfolio is an acknowledgement of the emphasis this government places on our long-held anti-nuclear stance, and the role New Zealand must play now and in the future. Fletcher Tabuteau will be appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to assist Mr Peters in this new portfolio.

“I am also making several other minor changes to reflect the connection between various portfolios and workstreams.

“Hon Shane Jones will be appointed Associate Minister for State Owned Enterprises.  As Associate Minister, he will assist State Owned Enterprises Minister Winston Peters with the detailed work in the portfolio, bringing the portfolio into alignment with his other ministerial responsibilities for Infrastructure and Regional Economic Development.

“Hon Meka Whaitiri has been appointed Associate Minister of Forestry, assisting Minister Jones with the acquisition of land for the Government’s one billion trees programme.

“Hon Damien O’Connor’s Associate Ministerial role in the Trade and Export Growth portfolio will be retitled as Minister of State for Trade and Export Growth.

“No material change has been made to the portfolio responsibilities in this area, with Hon David Parker retaining principal responsibility for Trade and Export Growth matters. The title change will better signal to Hon Damien O’Connor’s international counterparts the nature and extent of his authority in international negotiations,” said Jacinda Ardern.
