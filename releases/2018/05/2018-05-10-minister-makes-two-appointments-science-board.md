This ensures the Board is well placed to continue to deliver high-quality decision-making,” says Woods.

“The Science Board is responsible for investing Government funds in research, science and technology. Board members must have considerable experience in research methodologies, processes and risks, and a great understanding of New Zealand’s research and technology sectors.”

“I welcome Dr Liz Wedderburn to the Board, and Professor Parry Guilford for another term. I am confident that their strong research experience and achievements in the New Zealand Science Sector make them well suited for the role.”
