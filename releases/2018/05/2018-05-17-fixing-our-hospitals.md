The Coalition Government is beginning an historic reinvestment to restore our neglected hospitals and health infrastructure, bringing them up to the standard New Zealanders deserve, says Health Minister Dr David Clark.

“This Government is committed to rebuilding the critical public services, like health and education, that keep our country strong and prepare us for the future,” says David Clark.

“When New Zealanders are sick or injured they deserve world-class healthcare in world-class facilities. They shouldn’t be worrying about mould and rot in the hospitals they are treated in.

“Budget 2018 allocates $750.0 million of new capital to tackle some of the most urgent building problems facing hospitals around the country. That represents the biggest capital injection in health in at least the last decade.

“This marks the beginning of our carefully planned and managed programme to restore New Zealand’s hospitals and health infrastructure. This is a major undertaking and will take years.

“In addition, up to $100.0 million in capital will be available if necessary in 2018/19 to strengthen DHB balance sheets through deficit support.

“The new funding will mean DHBs can plan with more confidence and put forward business cases for important projects that have been put off for too long, such as infrastructure remediation, capacity investments and urgent building projects.

“New Zealanders have been shocked to discover that hospitals in some areas are literally rotting after a decade of neglect and underinvestment by the previous Government. There is a significant backlog of work, which will take more than one Budget to remedy.

“Ministers will make decisions throughout the coming year on projects that are ready for investment. This will be a carefully managed process designed to future-proof our health system and provide the best value for money.

“This is about priorities. In a country like New Zealand, doctors and nurses should be able to trust that the buildings they work in enable them to deliver quality, modern care, and patients should know the facilities are safe,” says David Clark.
