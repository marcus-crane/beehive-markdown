The Health Minister Dr David Clark congratulates the hard work and commitment of New Zealand’s 55,000-strong nursing workforce* ahead of International Nurses Day. 

Every year on 12 May International Nurses Day celebrates and recognises the hard work and contribution nurses make to health sectors all around the world. 

“Recognition of nursing leadership in New Zealand progressed further this year with the introduction in January of the [Health Practitioners (Replacement of Statutory References to Medical Practitioners) Act](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/red-letter-day-health-practitioners), which gives highly qualified Nurse Practitioners and Registered Nurses, among other sector professionals, more abilities when treating patients,” David Clark said.

“Between the Ministry of Health’s Chief Nursing Office and the District Health Boards’ Directors of Nursing, we have an extremely high calibre of leadership and that flows through to a committed and hardworking bunch of nurses throughout the country.

“Nurses are often among the very first health professionals to come into contact with patients.

“I recognise how hard all of our nurses work and realise how important it is for our entire workforce to be acknowledged for their efforts.” 

The theme of tomorrow’s celebration is Nurses: A voice to lead - Health is a human right. It also falls on the anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale – one of the world’s most famous nurses. 

“The theme of tomorrow is apt because Florence was also a leader in the industry – the founder of modern nursing through her committed and passionate approach to patient care-led nursing,” David Clark said.
