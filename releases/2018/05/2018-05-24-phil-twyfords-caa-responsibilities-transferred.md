Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has agreed to transfer Transport Minister Hon Phil Twyford’s responsibilities for the Civil Aviation Authority to Associate Transport Minister Hon Julie Anne Genter, following his admission today of making a phone call on a domestic flight after the aircraft doors had shut in preparation for take-off.

“I expect all my Ministers to act in accordance with the rules. As Transport Minister it is even more important that Phil abides by civil aviation laws,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“It isn’t appropriate for him to have responsibility for the Civil Aviation Authority in the event that it investigates this incident, so it’s appropriate to transfer those responsibilities to Julie Anne Genter.”
