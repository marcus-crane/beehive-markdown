Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says New Zealand will contribute $200,000 to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to assist its work in monitoring North Korea’s nuclear programme.

The announcement follows a phone call between Mr Peters and his Korean counterpart Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha which took place today.

“The phone call was a useful opportunity to speak with Minister Kang about the ongoing developments on the Korean Peninsula, and to also reiterate to her that New Zealand will continue to do all we can to support this peace process,” said Mr Peters.

“Peace on the Korean Peninsula cannot be achieved without complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. We want to make an early contribution to assist the IAEA in its current monitoring efforts and further hope that its inspectors are soon able to return to North Korea,” he said.

United States President Trump will meet North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore on 12 June.
