Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters will travel to China this week for a formal meeting with his counterpart, China’s State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

“China is a very significant relationship for New Zealand. This is an important time for the Asia-Pacific region. State Councillor Wang Yi and I will have in-depth discussions on important regional trade and security issues, including North Korea,” says Mr Peters.

While in China Mr Peters will also engage with other Chinese leaders and members of the business community.

“As well as being an important trade and economic partner, China and New Zealand have extensive people-to-people links, including through tourism, education, cultural exchanges and New Zealand’s racing export industry,” says Mr Peters.

Mr Peters will be travelling from 24-27 May.
