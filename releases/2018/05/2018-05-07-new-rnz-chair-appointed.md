Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran has announced the appointment of Dr Jim Mather as the new Chair of Radio New Zealand.

“Dr Jim Mather is currently the Chief Executive of Te Wananga o Aotearoa, a role he has held since 2013.  Before that he was the Chief Executive of Maori Television for nine years,” Clare Curran says. 

“Dr Mather is highly regarded as a Chief Executive and his understanding of the public broadcasting ethos and landscape means he’ll be able to make a significant contribution as the RNZ Chair.

“This Government believes modern public digital media services that inform, entertain and uplift are vital and we expect RNZ to play a pivotal role in providing high quality, independent journalism and to support people to tell New Zealand stories that reflect and reinforce our unique culture.

“Dr Mather brings effective relationship management and leadership skills to the Board at a time when the important evolution of RNZ into RNZ+ is just starting.

Dr Mather is to be appointed as Chair for a first term of three years.

The appointment papers are being proactively released and are attached.
