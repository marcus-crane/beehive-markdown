Social services dealing most directly with the harm caused by family violence will get much needed support as the Government boosts funding to front line agencies for the first time in ten years.

 “Nearly half of those receiving the increase are women’s refuges who provide vital support keeping women and children safe,” said Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni.

 “The 30 percent increase in funding is critical to the Government’s efforts to begin to turn around New Zealand’s tragic family violence record.

 “Additional funding in 2019/20 will enable these critical front line agencies to expand into areas where there isn’t currently any support or start addressing over demand in existing services.

 “Family violence has a damaging, yet often hidden, impact on victims' lives including their ability to work and lead a normal life,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

 Through Budget 2018, the Government is allocating an additional $76.157 million over four years to support the delivery of Ministry of Social Development-funded family violence services for victims, perpetrators and their families.

 Carmel Sepuloni said, “This funding will provide a boost to around 150 providers of family violence services nationwide.”

 Jan Logie, Under-Secretary to the Minister of Justice on Domestic and Sexual Violence Issues, also welcomed the new funding.

 “This funding is an important first step, supporting organisations which do vital work but have been stretched to breaking point,” Jan Logie said.

 “As we get started on the broader work of challenging and responding to family and sexual violence, it’s crucial that victims and their families are able to get the support they need now. Because they can’t wait.”

 Minister for Children Tracey Martin said Budget 2018 funding would have an impact right across New Zealand.

 “The announcement delivers on the Coalition Agreement between Labour and New Zealand First to increase funding in this area,” Tracey Martin said.

 Approximately 150 existing MSD-funded family violence service providers will receive an increase in funding.

Services that most directly respond to the needs of victims, perpetrators and their families will get extra funding in 2018/19 and 2019/20. These are:

- Family and whānau services, including longer-term recovery, counselling and safety planning
- Programmes for self-referred, non-mandated perpetrators of family violence
- Immediate crisis response and support services for victims of family violence (and their children, where present), and
- Longer-term psychological recovery services for victims.
