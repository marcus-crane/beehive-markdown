Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced the appointment of diplomat Philip Hewitt as Ambassador to Timor-Leste today.

“With a strong background in development, Mr Hewitt is well-suited for this role,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand is working with Timor-Leste to grow its economy and eradicate extreme poverty. Our development programme is focusing on sustainable economic development, education and skills training, and security and justice.

“Mr Hewitt is currently Unit Manager in the Partnerships, Humanitarian and Multilateral Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has also worked as Development Counsellor in Jakarta and as First Secretary Development in Bangkok and Apia, and as Pacific Regional Policy Manager for NZAID,” Mr Peters said.

New Zealand defence and police deployments alongside the New Zealand Aid Programme have played a major role supporting peace, security and development in Timor-Leste following a referendum for independence in 1999.
