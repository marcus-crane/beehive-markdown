Education Minister Chris Hipkins this afternoon joined Newtown School staff, students and community as they celebrated the formal opening of the multi-million dollar teaching block.

The main teaching block at the Wellington school was demolished in 2012 as it was earthquake prone.

The school has been operating from temporary buildings while the new block was being built. The new building provides 14 new, flexible teaching spaces.

“The Ministry of Education worked closely with the school to design the new block which supports their vision for teaching and learning,” Chris Hipkins said.

“The school was founded in 1879, one of the earliest schools established in the country.

“The opening of this fantastic teaching space marks a new chapter in Newtown School’s long and proud history.

The old buildings were built, like many were in those days, to face away from the street and was inward looking.

“The new building includes a new entrance which is outward looking - facing one of Newtown’s main streets – reflecting the diversity of its community.

“The Government is committed to building classrooms that are modern and fit-for-purpose to support students to succeed,” Chris Hipkins said.

“This is a really exciting time for our school community,” Newtown School Principal Mark Brown said.

“We now have amazing flexible learning spaces – built to the highest level for standards of sound, light and air conditions available in New Zealand.

“Our staff and students are enjoying their new space,” Mark Brown said.
