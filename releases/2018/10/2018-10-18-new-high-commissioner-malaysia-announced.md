Mr Nottage is currently Manager of Trade Law at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He has served as Senior Adviser to the Minister of Trade, as a World Trade Organisation dispute settlement Panellist, and in New Zealand’s Embassy to Argentina.

“As High Commissioner Mr Nottage will help establish a strong working relationship with the new Malaysian government,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand and Malaysia enjoy a positive bilateral relationship.

We share close education links and Malaysia is a significant trading partner as well as a key strategic and security partner.
