This week Minister for Small Business, Hon Stuart Nash, is travelling to Canberra for a range of meetings with his Australian counterparts across three of his portfolios.

The first visit is with the Australian Assistant Treasurer, the Honourable Stuart Robert in Canberra to discuss e-Invoicing. The aim of this visit is to discuss opportunities for trans-Tasman collaboration for businesses by using the Australian Business Number (ABN) and NZBN.

“The government is committed to an economy that is growing and working for all of us by encouraging innovation and productivity,” says Mr Nash.

“Our nations are geographically close with significant shared business interests so it is important we take a collaborative approach to help businesses on both sides of the Tasman to facilitate easier trade transactions.

This follows the Prime Minister’s commitment in March with the former Prime Minister of Australia to advance work on common approaches to e-Invoicing as part of the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market Agenda.

While in Australia Minister Nash will also be meeting with Australia’s Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash and Australia’s Minister responsible for Fisheries Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck.

With Hon Kris Faafoi, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Mr Nash will meet with Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnel, and Council of Small Business chief executive Peter Strong. 

In addition Mr Nash will also be attending the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management. This meeting includes discussions on tackling transnational, serious and organised crime.

“Tackling organised crime, which is a major driver for social and family harm in our communities, is a key focus for this coalition government and this is a great opportunity to strengthen our ties in this space.

“I am looking forward to taking our country’s interests to my Australian counterparts.”
