Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Regional Economic Development Fletcher Tabuteau has announced [Economic Development New Zealand](https://economicdevelopment.org.nz/) (EDNZ) will be given critical support from the Provincial Growth Fund to build the expertise of economic development agencies in New Zealand’s regions.

“It is a pleasure to announce the PGF will invest $985,000 over three years to enable the EDNZ to roll out a comprehensive professional development programme and suite of best-practice resources for EDAs,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“From Kaitaia to Invercargill, EDAs have a crucial role as enablers of investment in projects that will better equip people and organisations in the regions to present projects to central government that are investment ready.

“The PGF is well poised for partnering with willing co-investors and therefore robust and well-functioning EDAs play a vital strategic role as intermediaries who can encourage and support others to put skin in the game.

“We have already seen regions benefit from EDAs that are strong.

“This announcement further demonstrates our coalition Government’s commitment to driving sustainable economic development and building strong foundations for investment in our regions.

“Building strong and enduring capability in regional New Zealand will ensure we are able to fully capitalise on the PGF fund for years to come,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
