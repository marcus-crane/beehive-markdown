Transport Minister Phil Twyford says Opposition Leader Simon Bridges’ claim that the Government is in discussion with Wellington councils about a regional fuel tax is categorically wrong.

“The Government has explicitly ruled out a regional fuel tax in Wellington,” Phil Twyford said.

“The Wellington councils have asked for a regional fuel tax. I have ruled it out.

“Like many councils around the country, Wellington was left with a massive infrastructure deficit from the former government. These councils are desperate for funding to build much needed transport infrastructure,” Phil Twyford says.
