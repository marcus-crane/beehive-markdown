Minister of Health David Clark will tomorrow launch a refreshed update to Let’s get real.

Let’s get real is a framework which has helped New Zealand’s mental health and addiction workforce since it was first developed in 2008.

This refreshed version has been developed to apply broader than the mental health and addictions workforce.

“Let’s get real is relevant for anyone working alongside those experiencing mental distress, illness or addiction,” says David Clark.

“It outlines the essential values, attitudes, knowledge and skills needed to deliver effective services to those with mental health and addiction needs.

“There’s strong evidence those with mental health and addiction needs have poorer health outcomes compared to the general population. To make a positive difference on this, Let’s get real has extended so it now applies to everyone who works within health.

“The refreshed Let’s get real outlines six values, five attitudes and seven ‘real skills’ those working with people with mental health and addiction needs should know and understand.

“There’s an increased emphasis on tikanga Maori throughout the refreshed framework and a greater focus on relationships with whanau, parents, tamariki.

“Also reflected in this new version is an acknowledgement of how partnerships between services and sectors are crucial to ensure those who access services get the best possible support.

“I’d like to acknowledge the work of both the Ministry of Health and Te Pou on this new refreshed version of Let’s get real,” David Clark said.
