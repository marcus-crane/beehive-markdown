The Minister for Climate Change is travelling to Poland to take part in preliminary talks around deciding the rules for meeting Paris Agreement obligations to reduce global greenhouse gases.

“Talks in Krakow over the coming days will focus on key issues which will need to be addressed in the Conference of Parties summit (COP24) in December,” James Shaw said.

“It will also be an opportunity for countries to compare notes on our various domestic emissions reduction work programmes.

“Achieving the Paris Agreement in 2015 was a turning point in the commitment to address climate change. When we meet for COP24 in Katowice in December we will be making decisions that put the rules in place to help us meet the Paris commitment.

“There are complex issues and different views to work through about what those rules look like and how they work. So laying preliminary groundwork in Krakow over the next few days should help give us a focus and clear aims for COP24.

“I am also pleased to be attending these pre-COP talks to support New Zealand’s leadership in the process,” Mr Shaw said.

“Our Climate Change Ambassador, Jo Tyndall, will be helping run the Krakow conference as Co-Chair of the working group that was established to develop the guidelines, procedures and processes which will make up the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement.”
