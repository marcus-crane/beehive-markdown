Justice Minister Andrew Little continues the conversation about how to fix the broken criminal justice system by announcing the advisory group visits to the regions.

“Smart on crime for this Government means listening and delivering. I’m pleased to confirm that’s happening as the Safe and Effective Justice Programme Advisory Group ­– Te Uepū Hāpai i te Ora will be visiting New Zealand’s major cities and regions to hear from Kiwis who experience our broken criminal justice system every day.

“The Criminal Justice Summit in August allowed us to kick-start the conservation from all angles. We heard from Maori, victims, practitioners, former criminals and justice representatives with first-hand experience of how to improve the system.

“We want to test what we’ve heard and listen to as many people as we can. The Advisory Group will facilitate meetings from mid-October and provide details of drop-in sessions for the public through local promotions, social media and on Safe and Effective Justice [website](https://www.safeandeffectivejustice.govt.nz/).

 “This is fundamentally about keeping all New Zealand communities safer, and for that to happen we need less offending, less reoffending, and fewer victims of crime.

Advisory group chair and former Minister, Hon Chester Borrows said he’s looking forward to hearing what New Zealanders want from their criminal justice system.  

“We’re focused on hearing from people whose lives and work are affected by the criminal justice system, and canvassing ideas on how it can be improved,” said Mr Borrows.

“We want to hear from as many people as possible and, while we won’t be able to meet with absolutely everyone, we encourage anyone who wants to have their say to submit their ideas to us on the Safe and Effective Justice [website](https://www.safeandeffectivejustice.govt.nz/),” said Mr Little.
