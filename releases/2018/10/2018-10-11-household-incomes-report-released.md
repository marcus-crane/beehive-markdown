Minister of Social Development Carmel Sepuloni welcomed the release today of the thirteenth Household Incomes Report and the complementary Material Wellbeing report.

The Household Incomes Report shows:

- 52% of renters receiving Accommodation Supplement were paying more than 50% of their income for housing, up from 40% in 2007
- 65% of those who stated they had a major problem with dampness, mould, or heating in their house lived in rental accommodation
- After housing cost incomes for low-income households with children were still lower in 2015 in real terms than in the 1980’s.

“I am encouraged that the report shows this Government’s spending priorities are focused in the right places.

“We’ve committed to raising the incomes of low and middle income families though our Families Package, lifting thousands of children out of poverty, providing more affordable housing and rebuilding the public services – like health and education - that keep our people strong and give everyone a shot at success. 

This year’s report does not include low-income and material hardship figures for children in 2016 and 2017 because of sizeable changes in levels that officials cannot fully explain, even when the relatively small sample size (3500) is taken into account.

From next year, the Incomes Report will use improved data from Stats NZ. From 2020, it will provide greater precision by drawing on a sample of 20,000 households.

“Our focus is on making a difference to lives and ensuring our kids have every opportunity to thrive. New Zealand has the potential to be world leading in this space. Putting our children’s well-being at the heart of all of our decisions is the right thing to do,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
