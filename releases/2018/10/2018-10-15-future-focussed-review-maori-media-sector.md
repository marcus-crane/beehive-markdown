The Minister for Māori Development, Hon Nanaia Mahuta, has asked Te Puni Kōkiri to undertake a policy review of the Māori broadcasting sector.

“New and advancing technology has disrupted the broadcasting environment as we knew it. We need to ensure that Māori broadcasting is future proofed and fit for purpose as we move further into the digital age.”

The work, titled ‘Māori Media Sector Shift,’ will ensure that Māori broadcasting entities and organisations are responsive to the changing digital media environment, both now and in the future.

“It will consider options on the funding, delivery, retention and access to te reo and tikanga Māori programming content, and alignment to Public Broadcasting.”

This work, by Te Puni Kōkiri, will also feed in to the review of Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori 2016, which is due to take place in 2019.

As publicly funded Māori broadcasting entities, the groups included in the assessment will be Te Māngai Pāho, the Māori Television Service and Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori (and related iwi radio stations).

While a range of public service imperatives exist for public funding and broadcasters in New Zealand, the Māori broadcasting sector primarily exists to contribute to the promotion and retention of te reo and tikanga Māori says Minister Mahuta.

“For that reason we need a specific focus on the Māori media space to instil a robust system that can tackle future challenges and enable the ongoing delivery of gains for our language and culture.”

The last review of Māori broadcasting was undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce in 1998, and focussed only on iwi radio broadcasting.

“So much has happened since then, including the launch of the Māori Television Service in 2004 that the time has come to take a close look with an eye to the future.

“I want the Māori media sector to transition well to a digital, multi-platform environment, focussed on the creation and distribution of quality te reo Māori content that delivers for all New Zealanders,“ said Nanaia Mahuta.
