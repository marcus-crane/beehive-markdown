A Pacific Aotearoa [website](http://www.pacificaotearoa.org.nz/) has been launched ahead of November’s Summit to share what the Pacific community have said in relation to a refreshed Pacific Vision.

“When we got into Government, I asked the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to engage with our communities about where we’ve come from, what we’re doing now, and where we want to head in the future,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

“November’s launch of the Pacific Vision is the result of four months of *Talanoa* in our search to find inspiration and confirmation from our community. It’s encouraging to see that more than 2,500 people took the opportunity to influence and shape our thinking and co-design a new vision for Pacific peoples in Aotearoa-New Zealand.

“With nearly two thirds of our Pacific population now born in New Zealand, our Pacific story has evolved from a story of migration to one of belonging to Aotearoa-New Zealand. It’s time our Pacific Vision, set back in 1999, was refreshed to reflect this.

Our conversations during the Talanoa process have highlighted key priority areas important to Pacific peoples, such as:

- **Thriving Pacific languages, cultures and identities**
- **Prosperous Pacific communities**
- **Resilient and healthy Pacific peoples**
- **Confident, thriving and resilient Pacific young people.**

“Pacific Aotearoa places the aspirations of Pacific peoples at the heart of thinking and decision-making. It also captures the challenges and creative solutions our communities have determined as being vital to lift our general wellbeing.

“It will see the Government work more closely together with communities to support the creation of more innovative solutions to drive real change in the four goal areas over the next two years and beyond,” says Aupito William Sio.

The Pacific Vision Summit is being held at Eden Park Stadium in Auckland on 13 November and will be live-streamed at [www.pacificaotearoa.org.nz](http://www.pacificaotearoa.org.nz/).
