The Health Minister Dr David Clark says Hawke’s Bay Hospital’s new endoscopy and gastroenterology unit means more coordinated and accessible care for those affected by bowel conditions.

David Clark was in Hastings this morning to officially open the $13m facility.

“I’ve heard the loud and clear calls from bowel patients and whānau for better diagnosis, treatment, access to specialist services, and supportive care,” David Clark said.

“This is exactly the purpose of Ruakopito, which is why I’m proud to have the opportunity to open it.

“All the services these patients need will be available in a single purpose building. They’ll be able to get the help they need in a much more accessible way.”

David Clark also announced that Hawke’s Bay DHB will be joining the National Bowel Screening programme.

“In the Hawke’s Bay DHB region, bowel cancer is the most commonly registered cancer for both men and women.

“The National Bowel Screening Programme is particularly keen to encourage Māori and Pasifika people to participate. Māori are often diagnosed later with symptoms of bowel cancer which can result in worse outcomes.

“I know Hawke’s Bay DHB will be putting a lot of effort into engaging with Māori and Pasifika communities to promote the benefits of early detection through screening and support participation in the programme.

“By bringing gastro services under one roof, the Ruakopito facility will help manage the expected increase in colonoscopy screening,” David Clark said.
