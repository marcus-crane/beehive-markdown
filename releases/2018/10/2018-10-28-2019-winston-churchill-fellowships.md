Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Peeni Henare has announced the 2019 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships. The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (WCMT) was established in 1965 with funds from both the government and the public.

 The Fellowships help New Zealanders from all walks of life to travel overseas, research topics of significance and return with inspiration and experience that benefits their careers, communities and stakeholders.

 “The 12 Fellowships cover a diverse range of topics including programmes for people living with dementia, accelerating Māori economic development through procurement practice, engaging children in science programmes, animal welfare best practice, and heritage building archaeology practice,” WCMT Chair Dr Bronwyn Smits said.

“I would like to congratulate all the recipients. They will be bringing back to New Zealand a wealth of valuable experiences and knowledge. I look forward to hearing more about their experiences,” Peeni Henare said.
