Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Anthony Simpson as Ambassador to Italy.

“Mr Simpson is currently Unit Manager of the Europe Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade. He has previously served as Political Coordinator during New Zealand’s recent membership of the UN Security Council and as First Secretary at New Zealand’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York,” Mr Peters said.

As Ambassador to Italy Mr Simpson will also be cross-accredited to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, San Marino, Serbia and as Permanent Representative to the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

“Italy and New Zealand have substantial trade and economic links, and many Italians still remember the role our armed forces played in liberating Italy, with 2019 marking the 75th anniversary of the battle of Monte Cassino.

“In recent years, New Zealand and Italian forces have worked together as contributors to UN peacekeeping missions, and we are natural partners in international affairs,” Mr Peters said.
