The official 2019 China-New Zealand Year of Tourism opening ceremony will be held at Te Papa in February 2019, announced Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis today.

The opening ceremony will be held on 20 February 2019, with a special event at Te Papa, and coincides with the hosting of 2,300-year-old Chinese artefacts as a part of the *Terracotta Warriors: Guardians of Immortality* exhibition

“The 2019 China-New Zealand Year of Tourism is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealand to showcase what it is that makes us a world class destination, and for us to think about how we can best welcome Chinese visitors to our shores,” Kelvin Davis said.

“It’s also a great opportunity for New Zealanders to learn more about China and its culture, through the Te Papa exhibition and two-way tourism.

“More Chinese visitors are coming to New Zealand than ever before, with 450,000 people visiting in the year to June 2018. This is set to increase to 800,000 visitors per year by 2024, so it’s vital that New Zealand is able to provide the best experience possible.

“New Zealand and China’s shared tourism relationship is a special and enduring one and the Year of Tourism is a fitting way to celebrate this,” Kelvin Davis said.
