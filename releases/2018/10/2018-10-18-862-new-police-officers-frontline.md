Police Minister Stuart Nash says delivering on the Government’s commitment to provide 1800 more police officers is on track, with another 78 officers graduating from the Royal New Zealand Police College today.  

“This brings the total number of new police who have graduated since the Government was formed to 862,” says Mr Nash.

“It’s my priority as Minister to ensure our police men and women have the resources and tools required to meet the promises they make to their communities. That’s why the Government is investing heavily in increased Police resources.

“We’ve committed $300 million in new operating funding and $18 million in capital funding to strive for 1800 extra police officers and 485 new support staff.

“This is the twelfth recruit wing to graduate since the Government took office and 862 new police officers are deployed as a result. Having more police in our communities will allow for a greater focus on crime prevention and help Police achieve its mission for New Zealand ‘to be the safest country’.

“There’s a great depth of talent and diversity in the latest new police officers. Female constables make up 48 per cent of the wing, 15 per cent are Maori, seven per cent are Pasifika and eight per cent are Asian. The youngest is 18 and the oldest is 46. There are former and current sporting representatives and several have volunteered in a range of areas including surf lifesaving, teaching, the emergency services and humanitarian organisations.

“The 78 new constables of Recruit Wing 319 have benefited from the experience and wisdom of their patron the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment Carolyn Tremain,” says Mr Nash.
