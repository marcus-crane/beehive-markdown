The Minister for Māori Development , Hon Nanaia Mahuta says it’s great news that a joint Tainui – Housing New Zealand development, Te Kaarearea on the old Jebson place site in Hamilton is now underway.

“This is a fantastic opportunity to clean up an old site and house up to 50 of our whānau.

“It’s going to be a mix of options from two to four bedrooms and they will be selling for between $450,000 and $550,000.

“As I have always said our people are lagging behind the rest of the population when it comes to home ownership. At the last census says only 28 per cent of Māori adults owned their own home, compared to 50 per cent of the total population,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

Expressions of interest will open next week at [housing@tainui.co.nz](mailto:housing@tainui.co.nz) and registered tribal members who are first home buyers will have the first option to buy a home.

Waikato Tainui says the project will begin this month and will be ready in mid-late 2019.

“My priority is to make sure our people have warm and secure housing. Te Kaarearea is a win for both Waikato Tainui, the Hamilton City Council and Housing New Zealand, “ says Nanaia Mahuta
