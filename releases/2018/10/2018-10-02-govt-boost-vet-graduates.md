Thirty graduate vets will receive a financial boost to help develop their careers through the Voluntary Bonding Scheme for Veterinarians, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.

“Our vets perform a crucial role in the success of our primary industries and our wider economy, but attracting and retaining these vets in our regions is challenging,” Damien O’Connor said.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries Voluntary Bonding Scheme for Veterinarians is designed to support and boost the number of graduate vets in our regions who are working with production animals such as cows, sheep and horses.

“This year’s successful applicants will receive $55,000 each over five years — a total of $1.65 million.

“Our regions are desperate for skilled workers, including vets, so it’s important we give them every encouragement to pursue their veterinary careers in the primary industries, which support our rural communities, regions and economy.

“I congratulate the latest 30 graduate vets for qualifying for the Voluntary Bonding Scheme this year,” Damien O’Connor said.
