Associate Education Minister Tracey Martin today welcomed a report showing activity centres were continuing to successfully keep at-risk students in education.

The Education Review Office’s report into activity centres concluded they were achieving ‘positive outcomes’ for their students. It rated ten of the 14 centres as ‘mostly positive’ or ‘highly effective’.

Minister Martin said that she was encouraged by the report.

“It shows significant improvement from the previous evaluation, and reinforces the view that early intervention with students with specialist support and services really gets results

“Learners need support before they become disengaged. That support needs to be relevant and tailored to individual students. This report shows most centres are doing just that.

“While they attended the centres students increased their attendance, engagement and achievement and there was also evidence of improved social outcomes.

“It’s also positive that the report found that students, parents and caregivers valued the activity centres.”

Activity centres are available for students who are at risk of disengaging from school and might need an alternative education pathway.

Only one centre, Te Kura o Waipuna, received the lowest rating and it is now closed.

**Notes for editors**

Activity centres are funded by the Ministry of Education but managed by individual schools.

There are centres at Herne Bay, Otahuhu, Papakura, Rotorua, Gisborne, Hastings, Napier, Spotswood, Palmerston North, Porirua, Hutt Valley, Wellington, Dunedin and Invercargill.

They are expected to provide a tailored education programme, which is measured against a number of outcomes areas including attendance and achievement, as well as successful transitions back to school, further education or training.

Reports on the 14 individual activity centres were published by ERO in late December 2017.

This report is a collation of all the centre reports.

Each centre caters for up to 20 students who enrolled at the centre for a maximum of two terms. Most students are in Years 9 to 11.
