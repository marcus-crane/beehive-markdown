A series of community workshops with local sporting codes, businesses and the entertainment sector to co-design the city’s new Multi-Use Arena have begun after the Government earmarked $220 million of funding to make the project happen, Minister Megan Woods has announced.

The Minister made the announcement alongside Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel following the first of the workshops held today in Christchurch.

“This funding brings Canterbury’s much needed arena one step closer. This will be a huge boost for the city and it’s important we get it right.

“That’s why we are bringing the sporting codes, local businesses and the entertainment sector together to help us make sure the design is right and the building is fit for purpose.

“We will be holding a series of workshops which each of these sectors to hear what they need from the arena, and how it can be made to work best for them.

“Of the $300 million the Government has put on the table to speed up the city’s recovery, Council has requested that $220 million go towards the new arena. We have agreed to earmark that money to ensure it’s available for the arena. That means the project can move forward with confidence.

“From here a full investment case will be developed to ensure the project is well designed and stacks up financially. These workshops will ensure the business case is strong. We are hopeful of seeing early construction work begin in 2021.”

Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel welcomed today’s announcement as a positive step forward.

“Once it was known that Lancaster Park would have to be demolished this became a much higher priority for our residents. There was significant support for the multi-use arena through last year’s 10-year budget process, so we brought-forward by two years funding commitment to make it happen. Today’s announcement gives us certainty and confidence to push ahead.

“We’ve already started advanced technical works on-site to get the project moving and we’re expecting to see early ground investigations underway by the end of the year.

“This is a project for the people of our region and we want to take them along with us every step of the way. Today’s meeting was an example of the sort of engagement that will continue right across our community. It’s a great project for Canterbury and today’s milestone sees it one step closer,” says Lianne Dalziel

Minister Woods says community engagement will lead to a better arena for the city.

“We’ve seen at the MetroSports Facility how working hand in hand with local people can lead to a better result – there we were able to turn around a $70 million budget blowout and get the project back on track.

“Working with the local community will ensure the arena is fit for purpose and best suited the needs of Christchurch,” says Megan Woods.
