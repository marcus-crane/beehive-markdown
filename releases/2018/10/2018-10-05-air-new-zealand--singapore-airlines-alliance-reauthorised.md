The Government has signed off Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines’ strategic alliance for the next five years, Transport Minister Phil Twyford has announced.

Phil Twyford said the decision will allow the airlines to continue to cooperate to bring more flights and destinations for passengers travelling to and from New Zealand.

“The services the airlines provide through the alliance strengthens New Zealand’s ties with our close neighbours in South East Asia and with other emerging markets throughout Asia.

“Reauthorisation of the alliance will result in more benefits to travellers. These benefits include a wider range of flight times, more seats and reciprocal frequent flyer schemes,” Phil Twyford said.

Singapore has long been a hub for airline services, connecting New Zealand with the rest of the world. The alliance strengthens this role and provides passengers with a range of connecting flights between New Zealand and Singapore on the airlines’ combined services.

This authorisation applies until 28 March 2024. During this period, the airlines will need to continue to show that the alliance provides real benefits to consumers and that it has not had a negative impact on competition.
