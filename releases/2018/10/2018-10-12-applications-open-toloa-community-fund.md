Applications have opened for the Toloa Community Fund to encourage Pacific youth into careers in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).

“In 2019 we have $100,000 available for community groups and organisations who can help us inspire Pacific students into STEM-related careers,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

“We know Pacific people are underrepresented in these workforces. We need communities to champion these high-value career pathways, which are projected to grow as we transition to an increasingly knowledge-based economy.

The Toloa Community Fund is part of a three-pronged approach to get Pacific students into STEM subjects, alongside the Toloa Tertiary Scholarships, and the Toloa Kenese Club programme.

“Earlier this year the fund supported the development of the Tino e Tasi preschool Samoan language app which embraces new technology and supports bilingual education.

Fund applications will close on the 14 November and finalists will be invited to present to the Dragons Den during December and January 2019.  The successful community groups will be announced in February 2019.

“I encourage Pacific organisations to submit your applications before the deadline and take part in this important initiative,” says Aupito William Sio.
