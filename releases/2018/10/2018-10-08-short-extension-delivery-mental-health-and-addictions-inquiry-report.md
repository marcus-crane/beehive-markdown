The Health Minister Dr David Clark says Cabinet has agreed to grant a short extension of time for the independent Inquiry into Mental Health and Addiction to report back to Government.

David Clark said the Inquiry Panel Chair Ron Paterson asked for a one month extension to ensure proper consideration of the more than 5500 submissions received and the information gathered at 400 meetings and public forums.

“This is a hugely important piece of work in a priority area for this Government and it will inform policy for many years to come. Cabinet agreed that we need to give the panel the time to properly consider what New Zealanders have told them and to do the job right,” David Clark said.

The Inquiry was to have reported back by October 31 but will now report back by November 30.
