Economic Development Minister David Parker today announced the appointment of Paul Brock as the new chair of the New Zealand Story Advisory Board. 

Paul Brock was the Kiwibank Group Chief Executive from 2010 to 2017. He has a strong background in governance, management, brand development and marketing.  

“Paul will add tremendous value to the NZ Story project as it works to increase the benefits to New Zealand from export trade,” David Parker said.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Chair, Cameron Harland for his great contribution to the board over the last four years,” David Parker said. 

Paul Brock’s appointment is for a three year term effective from 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2021.

- Cameron Harland is the CEO at CricHQ, and is a director of Weta Workshop and TVNZ Ltd. He was appointed to the NZ Story Advisory Board until April 2020 but is standing down due to changes in other work commitments.
