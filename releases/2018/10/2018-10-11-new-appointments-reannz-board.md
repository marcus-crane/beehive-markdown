Research, Science and Innovation Minister Hon Dr Megan Woods today announced three new appointments to the Board of Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ).

“I would like to extend a warm welcome to Dr Judith Johnston, Ms Sara Brownlie and Mr David Skinner to the REANNZ Board of Directors,” said Dr Woods.

“REANNZ provides specialist telecommunications services to the research sector, supporting international research collaboration and the exchange of research data” says Dr Woods.

“Each of the three newly appointed members brings a wealth of broad experience and valuable knowledge to the Board and will guide REANNZ as it works with its members to develop a sustainable operating model.”

Dr Johnston is a Commissioner for the Library and Information Advisory Commission and has more than 10 years’ experience on governance boards, including the Tertiary Education Commission, the Pharmacy Council and Crown Research Institute ESR.

Ms Brownlie is a chartered accountant and independent director of Catalyst.net Ltd. She was previously Deputy CFO at the Treasury, and held a senior finance manager role at the Ministry of Justice.

Mr Skinner is an executive director of a consulting company with expertise in network economics and engineering. He has previously worked in senior management positions at Telecom NZ, CLEAR Communications and New Zealand Post.

Dr Johnston will sit on the board until 30 June 2020 with Ms Brownlie and Mr Skinner serving until 30 June 2021. Existing Board member, Mr Ross Peat continues as Acting Chair until the appointment process for the Chair is completed.
