More young stars are set to be discovered as a series of popular performing arts shows for young people is rolled out for another year, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

RockQuest Promotions was selected by the Ministry of Education to run Showquest earlier this year after the organisers of Stage Challenge indicated they could no longer put on the event due to falling sponsorship revenue. After a successful run of shows and positive feedback from participants this year, RockQuest Promotions Ltd has been asked to organise the event for 2019.

“Dance, drama and music are important parts of the curriculum. Showquest gives students opportunities to showcase their talents by drawing on personal experiences, imagination and skills,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Students, supported by their schools, develop a performance - from original concept right through to the final show.

“This year some students wrote and produced their own soundtracks. Showquest also provided an LED screen/video wall so students could showcase their technology skills as they designed and produced backgrounds that would enhance their performances.

 “RockQuest Promotions Ltd did a great job organising events in 2018 in a really tight timeframe. Nearly 60 schools signed up and more than 2000 students took part which, given the late start, was really impressive.

“Next year will be even bigger, as organisers will have more time to work with schools. I wish the organisers and every participant the best of luck,” Chris Hipkins said.

**Notes for editors**

RockQuest Promotions will contact schools at the beginning of term four to ensure those that want to take part have time to plan and to register their interest.
