Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Jo Tyndall as High Commissioner in Singapore.

“Ms Tyndall’s experience makes her well suited to her new role. She is currently New Zealand’s Climate Change Ambassador at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and since 2016 she has also been Co-Chair of the UNFCCC’s Ad-hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement, which is responsible for negotiating the rule-book to underpin the Paris Agreement,” Mr Peters said.

“Ms Tyndall also has a background in trade policy, has previously been on posting in Geneva, and worked on the Brexit project.” 

New Zealand has shared a close relationship with Singapore since its foundation in 1965.

“We are both small, outward looking economies with similar interests and strong commitment to a rules-based international system and economic integration,” Mr Peters said.

“Singapore is New Zealand’s largest trading partner in South East Asia. Ms Tyndall will continue to ensure our relationship grows and modernises as we progress negotiations on the Enhanced Partnership, which seeks to deepen our cooperation across numerous fields including trade, defence and security, and science and technology.”
