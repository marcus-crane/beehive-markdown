Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Matthew Hawkins as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.

“Mr Hawkins is well qualified for the role. He is currently Unit Manager of the Middle East and Africa Division and has previous experience in New Zealand embassies in Addis Ababa, Washington DC and Tehran,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand and the UAE share a growing relationship based on a broad range of political, security, development cooperation, and trade and economic ties.

“New Zealand will participate in Expo 2020 in Dubai to share our story of kaitiakitanga, our care for people and place, to a global audience of millions,” Mr Peters said.

The UAE is the entry point into the Middle East region for many New Zealand businesses and travellers, with two way trade over $3 billion in 2017.

The New Zealand Embassy in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, is also accredited to Qatar.
