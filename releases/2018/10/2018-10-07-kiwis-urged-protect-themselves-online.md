Minister for Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Hon Kris Faafoi is encouraging everyone to take a few easy steps to protect themselves online this Cyber Smart Week.

“We live in an increasingly digital world, where everything and everyone is connected. Our relationships, our jobs, our finances — everything is online. And, while we all enjoy the benefits of our digital lives, our online security deserves more than ‘set-and-forget’,” said Kris Faafoi.

Now in its second year, Cyber Smart Week is New Zealand’s cyber security awareness week and runs from 8 – 12 October. It is organised by CERT NZ, which is collaborating with more than 70 public and private sector partners to help keep Kiwis safe online.

“The latest statistics from CERT NZ show that everyday New Zealanders have lost almost $10 million to cyber-attacks in the last year,” Kris Faafoi said. “There’s also serious harms that aren’t monetary – so these reports are a great reminder to us all that we need to take a minute to review our online security.

“The good news is that protecting your online self can be as simple as taking a few basic steps,” said Kris Faafoi. “This Cyber Smart week the team at CERT NZ are encouraging all New Zealanders to do a few simple things to protect themselves online, like making sure they use unique passwords, setting up two-factor authentication, making sure apps are up-to-date, and checking on your privacy settings.

“Like many things, a little bit of time spent now can help keep you and your family safe in future. So do a little bit of maintenance to stay on top of your own cyber security.”
