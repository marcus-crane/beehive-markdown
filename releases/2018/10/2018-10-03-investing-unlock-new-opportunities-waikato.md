The Government will support the Matamata-Piako District on work to unlock new opportunities in tourism and infrastructure with an up to $1.7 million initial investment from the Provincial Growth Fund, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

The Prime Minister is in Matamata today to announce the funding– the first initiatives in the Waikato to receive support from the Provincial Growth Fund.

“It’s good to be in the region today to announce Government investment towards initial work on projects which could unlock huge potential in the area and capitalise on strong forecast growth in the Waikato,” Jacinda Ardern says.

"The Matamata-Piako District is well placed to build on its strategic location between Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga. The completion of the Waikato Expressway in 2020 will further enhance opportunities across the region and local people are keen to make the most of the improved transport connections.

Projects being funded are:

- Up to $900,000 towards a feasibility study and business case for the Te Aroha Tourism Precinct
- $800,000 towards a feasibility study for the Waharoa Industrial Hub.

“The funding being announced today will support the development of the Te Aroha Tourism Precinct and the Waharoa Industrial Hub.  These two projects are widely supported across the community and the preparation of business cases will ensure the projects are suitable for further investment.

“I am proud of today’s announcement.  It further demonstrates how the government is partnering with regions to invest and progress projects which will deliver sustainable regional economic development and improve outcomes for local people,” said Jacinda Ardern.
