Applications for the Toloa Tertiary Scholarships aimed at Pacific students pursuing STEM-related studies in 2019, are now open.

Now in its fourth year, the Toloa Tertiary Scholarships initiative funded by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples (MPP), offers significant opportunities for young Pacific people to participate in New Zealand’s future growth areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM).

Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio says the Toloa initiative recognises that Pacific people have an important role to play in the future workforce of New Zealand and we will need more Pacific people in these fields.

Encouraging young Pacific people to pursue STEM studies is the first step, and then careers in anticipation of an increasingly knowledge-based economy.

“The prestigious Toloa Tertiary Scholarships will be awarded to Pacific students who are looking to pursue STEM related studies in 2019 and each scholarship recipient will receive up to $18,000 over three years” says Aupito William Sio.

“With the Government bringing in the first-year fees free policy this year, scholarships are offered to students in their second year of tertiary study onwards, and for postgraduates, scholarships will cover their first year of study onward.

“In 2018, the Ministry funded 13 scholarships, and all 13 recipients have completed their studies successfully.

“The Ministry has worked hard to encourage 25 young Pacific people into STEM related careers over the past three years, and it is striving to continue the momentum.

“The scholarships will provide opportunities to recognise high achievers and increase the number of young Pacific people in these sectors.

“The scholarship programme, now in its fourth year, is part of a three-pronged approach in getting Pacific students involved in STEM subjects, along with the Toloa Kenese Club programme and the Toloa Community Fund,” says Aupito William Sio.

The scholarships will be presented at an awards ceremony to be held early next year for the top deserving students.
