Minister of Transport Phil Twyford today opened the new cycleway in New Lynn that will ease congestion and make Auckland a healthier and safer place to live.

The $2.2 million project provides an off-road cycleway on Seabrook Avenue, as well as improve four local intersections between Willerton Avenue and the New Lynn train station and town centre. It also includes new bike parking racks, upgraded street lighting and new signage.

The project will connect to the Waterview Shared Path, via the upcoming New Lynn to Avondale Shared Path, improving the West Auckland cycleway network.

“The Seabrook Avenue Cycleway will encourage more walking and cycling trips in the area and help children cycle to and from New Lynn School safely,” Phil Twyford said at the ribbon cutting ceremony today.  

“More Aucklanders are cycling, with 19 per cent of Auckland bike riders regularly commuting to and from work. Safe and accessible cycle routes give people a heathier travel option to get to work, school and play without adding to the traffic.”

“Our government is committed to saving lives on the road and this project will help do that by slowing down vehicles at intersections and prioritising pedestrians and cyclists,” Phil Twyford said.

The NZ Transport Agency is investing $390 million in walking and cycling over the next three years through the National Land Transport Programme (NLTP). This is a $96 million increase on the previous three years.

Phil Twyford said that $260 million of the funding is going to cycling and walking facilities in our three main cities – Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch – where it can have the greatest impact on congestion by improving connections and making active travel safer.

“Together, we are creating safer, healthier, and more accessible cities where people of all ages and abilities can choose to bike every day,” said Phil Twyford.
