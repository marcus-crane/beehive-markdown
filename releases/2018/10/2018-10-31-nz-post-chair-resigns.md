Jane Taylor is leaving the board of New Zealand Post, Finance Minister Grant Robertson said on Wednesday.

“Jane has decided to resign from the NZ Post board, and I have accepted her resignation,” Grant Robertson said.

“We’d like to thank Jane for her significant work in setting up NZ Post’s strategy, and guiding the organisation through a significant period of change,” Grant Robertson said.

Current deputy chair Jacqueline (Jackie) Lloyd has been appointed NZ Post acting chair.
