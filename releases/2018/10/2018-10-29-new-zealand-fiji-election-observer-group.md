Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced today that New Zealand will contribute thirteen observers to participate in the Multinational Observer Group which will report on the Fiji General Election.

“New Zealand is proud to be able to support Fiji’s election in this way. The Multinational Observer Group will help to give the people of Fiji, and the international community, confidence in the election outcome.” Mr Peters said.

New Zealand’s group is being led by former Labour MP Ross Robertson who has already commenced his observation role in Fiji. He is being joined by MPs Darroch Ball, Poto Williams, Louisa Wall and Michael Wood, and a number of New Zealand officials.

“The calibre of New Zealand’s observer delegation reflects the strength of our relationship with Fiji, and our ongoing commitment to support Fiji’s democratic processes.

“This will be Fiji’s second election since its return to Parliamentary democracy in 2014. New Zealand has been supporting Fiji’s election preparations, including by donating election supplies and providing technical assistance to the Fiji Elections Office.

“New Zealand welcomes Fiji’s upcoming election and looks forward to working with the new Government in Fiji to continue strengthening New Zealand – Fiji relations,” said Mr Peters.
