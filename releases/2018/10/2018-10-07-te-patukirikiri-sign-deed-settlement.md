Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little has announced Te Patukirikiri signed a Deed of Settlement with the Crown in Thames.

“The Deed, settling the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Te Patukirikiri, includes a Crown apology, agreed historical account and redress for historical breaches of the Treaty and was signed yesterday,” said Mr Little.

“The Deed’s signing acknowledges the relationship between Te Patukirikiri and the Crown. The settlement package represents a great deal of hard work and commitment by Te Patukirikiri to move forwards. We look to the future and to the solid base, provided by the settlement, on which to build.

“The settlement package includes a total value of $3 million in financial and commercial redress and the return of several sites of cultural significance to Te Patukirikiri.

“I want to acknowledge that the settlement can never fully compensate for the wrongs of the past. But I congratulate Te Patukirikiri on the settlement they have achieved with the Crown.  This provides groundwork for their cultural, social and economic future and is an important step in restoring the Treaty relationship between the Crown and Te Patukirikiri," said Mr Little.
