Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau will travel to South Africa this week to lead New Zealand’s first ever senior-level business delegation to the country.

“The South African market presents significant potential for New Zealand businesses and is our most diverse trading partner on the African continent with more than $300 million in exports,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“Our Government supports New Zealand exporters to showcase their products and services to the world. Visits like this one are an important part of promoting the New Zealand brand and highlighting our values to a global audience of consumers.”

The visit will provide an opportunity for Under-Secretary Tabuteau to discuss New Zealand’s wider relationship with South Africa.

“New Zealand’s relationship with South Africa is our deepest and most diverse in Africa, highlighted by strong historical, political and sporting ties.

“I am looking forward to meeting with my South African counterparts and leaders of businesses in South Africa to showcase our world leading trade and innovation credentials, and further strengthen the ties of trade and friendship between our two countries,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

The engagements in South Africa follow a bilateral visit to the United Arab Emirates earlier in the week.
