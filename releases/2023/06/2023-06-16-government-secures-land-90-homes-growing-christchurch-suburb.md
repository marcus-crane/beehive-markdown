The Government’s plan to increase the housing choices has taken another step forward with the acquisition of a large parcel of land in Halswell, Christchurch, to keep up with housing demand as part of the Kāinga Ora Land Programme.

Kāinga Ora has purchased the 36,800m2 land parcel at 66a Quaifes Road from the Christchurch City Council.

“The Kāinga Ora Land Programme is about making strategic land purchases, with the backing of councils, iwi and other infrastructure partners, in areas where the market alone struggles to deliver the quantity and type of housing needed,” says Megan Woods.

“This Land Programme purchase – the first in the South Island – will enable the delivery of a mix of housing. While the proportion of each type on the site is yet to be determined, the purchase enables Kāinga Ora to begin to explore options for developing the land and the mix of housing that could be incorporated on the site.

It is anticipated the site will be developed to mostly include a range of privately owned housing options at different price points, with a small proportion of public housing. Kāinga Ora is also in initial discussions with Paenga Kupenga (economic arm of local mana whenua) about partnering to investigate opportunities to enable affordable housing for Māori.

“Ultimately this purchase will provide a range of housing choices for people at all stages of life, from first home buyers right through to those looking to downsize, by improving affordability for people wanting to live in Halswell.

“Early estimates suggest the site could provide up to approximately 90 homes in the well-connected suburb of Halswell.

“The site’s location means that the people who live here will be close to shops, healthcare providers, employment, education, public transport, and be within walking and cycling distance to many amenities,” said Megan Woods.

The land at 66a Quaifes Road, Halswell was purchased for $6.5 million (plus GST) following the Council declaring the land surplus to its requirements.
