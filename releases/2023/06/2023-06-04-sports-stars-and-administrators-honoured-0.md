Sir Wayne Smith has been knighted for services to rugby. Sir Wayne was Assistant Coach of the All Blacks at the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cups and Head Coach of the Black Ferns at the 2022 Rugby World Cup.

“Sir Wayne’s commitment and passion for the game has shone through in the range of roles he has taken on. He took over coaching the Black Ferns six months before the World Cup, and helped them to their sixth title. ‘The Professor’ is a ground breaking coach and mentor and thoroughly deserves this accolade,” Grant Robertson said.
