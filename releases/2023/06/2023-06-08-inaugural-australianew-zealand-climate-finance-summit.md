Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Climate Minister James Shaw have met in Wellington with their Australian counterparts, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, for the inaugural Australia–New Zealand Climate and Finance Ministers’ meeting.

The Ministers discussed areas of enhanced cooperation, supporting accelerated climate action and once-in-a-generation economic opportunities that the clean energy transformation offers both countries.
