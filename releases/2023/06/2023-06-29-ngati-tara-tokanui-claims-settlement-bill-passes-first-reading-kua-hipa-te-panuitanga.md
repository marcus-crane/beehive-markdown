The Ngāti Tara Tokanui Claims Settlement Bill has been read for the first time at Parliament in recognition of Ngāti Tara Tokanui’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Ngāti Tara Tokanui is one of the twelve iwi of Hauraki. Their area of interest centres around Paeroa and the Karangahake Gorge. They have approximately 830 members.

“This milestone is possible because of the many years of hard work from all parties involved, and it is through their determination, dedication and commitment that we are here today,” Andrew Little said.

“This is a significant step towards the restoration of the relationship between Ngāti Tara Tokanui and the Crown, based on trust, co-operation and partnership, as it should have been from the very start.”

Ngāti Tara Tokanui’s historical grievances relate to the Crown’s actions and omissions that severely undermined their wellbeing, eroded their tribal structures, resulted in the dispersal and displacement of their people, and the loss of most of their ancestral lands.

The Crown’s promotion of laws and policies also damaged the environment, including the discharge of cyanide-treated waste from mining into water sources they relied on for washing, drinking and growing crops. The discharges also caused illness and death.

“This settlement includes acknowledgements and a Crown Apology for its harmful actions against Ngāti Tara Tokanui that they have carried for generations,” Andrew Little said.

“It will also enhance Ngāti Tara Tokanui’s ability to participate in resource management processes, including around the Karangahake area which has been described as the heart of the Ngāti Tara Tokanui rohe,” Andrew Little said.

The settlement also includes:

1. financial and commercial redress of $6 million.
2. the vesting of seven sites of cultural significance, and two sites jointly vested with Hako and Ngāti Tamaterā
3. Relationship protocols with Crown agencies.

“No settlement package could ever fully compensate for such a magnitude of loss, suffering and prejudice, but it is my sincere hope that this package will provide a foundation for prosperity for Ngāti Tara Tokanui,” Andrew Little said.

Kua pahawa i te Ngāti Tara Tokanui Claims Settlement Bill te pānuitanga tuatahi i te Pāremata hei āhukahukatanga o ngā kerēme Tiriti o Waitangi a Ngāti Tara Tokanui nō mai rā anō.

Ko Ngāti Tara Tokanui tētahi o ngā iwi 12 o Hauraki. Ko te pokapū o tō rātou wāhi whai pānga ko Paeroa me te āpiti o Karangahake. Ko tōna 830 ngā tāngata o Ngāti Tara Tokanui.

"Kua taea nei tēnei tohu hira nā te whakapau werawera a ngā tāngata katoa i whai wāhi mai, ka mutu, nā tō rātou ū, ngākaunui me te pūmau e tū pēnei ai mātou i tēnei rā," hei tā Andrew Little.

"He hipanga hira tēnei ki te whakaoranga anō o te hononga i waenga i a Ngāti Tara Tokanui me te Karauna, e pūtakea mai ana i te whakawhirinaki taharua, te mahi tahi me te rangapū, ā, e tika ana me pērā kē taua hononga mai rā anō i te tīmatanga."

E pā ana ngā nawe mai anō o Ngāti Tara Tokanui ki ngā mahi me ngā hapanga a te Karauna i tino whakararu i tō rātou toiora, i whakangāhorohoro i ō rātou hanganga ā-iwi, me te aha i korapa, i peia atu te iwi, i ngaro anō hoki te nuinga o ō rātou whenua tupuna.

He mea tūkino te taiao e tā te Karauna whakamana i ngā ture me ngā kaupapahere, tae atu ki te tuku i te para whai pakuriki cyanide mai i ngā mahi maina ki roto i ngā puna wai i te whakamahia mō te horoi, te inu me te whakatupu hua kai. I pā mai te māuiui me ētahi hemonga nā aua tukunga.

"Kei roto i tēnei whakaaetanga whakataunga ētahi kōrero āhukahuka me te whakapāhatanga a te Karauna mō ana mahi tūkino ki a Ngāti Tara Tokanui kua tino whakataumaha i a rātou mō ngā whakatupuranga maha," te kī a Andrew Little.

"Ka whakarei anō hoki i tō Ngāti Tara Tokanui kaha ki te whai wāhi ki ngā hātepe whakahaere rawa, taea noatia ērā i te takiwā o Karangahake e kīia ana te uho o te rohe o Ngāti Tara Tokanui," ko te kī a Andrew Little.Kei roto i te whakaaetanga whakataunga:

1\. te puretumu ahumoni, arumoni hoki o te $6 miriona.

2\. te tuku i ngā wāhi ahurea whakahirahira e whitu, me ētahi wāhi e rua ka tuku ngātahitia ki a Hako me Ngāti Tamaterā

3\. ētahi kawa hononga ki ngā tari kāwanatanga.

"E kore rawa e taea e tētahi whakaaetanga whakataunga te utu anō i te ngaromanga e pēnei ana te korahi, te paremata i te pāmamae me te whakahāweatanga, engari ko taku tino tūmanako nei, ka tautoko tēnei mōkī i te tūāpapa mō te noho taurikura o Ngāti Tara Tokanui,” hei tā Andrew Little.
