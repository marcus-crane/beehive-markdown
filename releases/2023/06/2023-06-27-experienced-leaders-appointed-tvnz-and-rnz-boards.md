The Minister for Broadcasting and Media Willie Jackson has appointed a group of experienced and skilled leaders to the boards of RNZ and TVNZ. 

“This Government supports RNZ and TVNZ in being world leaders in providing trusted news and stories that reflect our unique way of life and culture and these appointments will help drive both outlets into a new era,” said Willie Jackson. 

“The boards of RNZ and TVNZ have an incredibly important role in shaping the direction of public media in Aotearoa.

“We are excited to have selected a range of talented individuals to take up these vital leadership roles. The line-up includes some familiar faces and a wide range of expertise across public media, governance, marketing, finance, law and cultural development,” Willie Jackson said.

“I am excited to see these two Boards take shape to lead RNZ and TVNZ into the future. 

“I am especially pleased to see the mix of commercial and public media experience, alongside a good balance of fresh faces and institutional knowledge.
