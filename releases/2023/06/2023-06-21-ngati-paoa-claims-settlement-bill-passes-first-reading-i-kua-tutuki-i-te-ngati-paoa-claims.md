Ngāti Paoa has witnessed the passing of the first reading of the Ngāti Paoa Claims Settlement Bill at Parliament today for their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

“Today is another step forward in the restoration of the relationship between Ngāti Paoa and The Crown based on trust, co-operation and partnership,” Andrew Little said.

“I am pleased this Bill has passed its first reading and I Iook forward to supporting it through the house.”

Ngāti Paoa’s area of interest stretches from Te Aroha to Warkworth, and includes the Hauraki Plains, the Gulf Islands and parts of Mahurangi and Auckland. Ngāti Paoa has approximately 4800 members.

“Ngāti Paoa’s historical grievances include loss of life, language, and devastation caused by war and raupatu, including the bombardment of Pūkorokoro village, as well as the Crown’s promotion of laws and policies that led to Ngāti Paoa being virtually landless,” Andrew Little said.

The redress package includes:

- financial and commercial redress of $23.5 million
- cultural redress including 12 sites of traditional, historical and cultural significance to Ngāti Paoa
- protocols and relationship agreements with a number of Crown agencies

“This settlement also includes an apology from The Crown to Ngāti Paoa for the Crown’s actions, including those that undermined Ngāti Paoa’s economic, social and cultural development,” Andrew Little said.

“While no settlement can fully compensate Ngāti Paoa for what has been lost, a wide range of redress has been negotiated to provide for the historical and cultural recognition of Ngāti Paoa, and to regrow their economic base.

“I sincerely hope this settlement will support a prosperous future for Ngāti Paoa for many generations to come,” Andrew Little said.

**Kua tutuki i te Ngāti Paoa Claims Settlement Bill te pānuitanga tuatahi**

I kitea e Ngāti Paoa te pānuitanga tuatahitanga o te Ngāti Paoa Claims Settlement Bill i Pāremata i tēnei rā mō ā rātou kerēme Tiriti o Waitangi nō mai rā anō.

"E whakanui ana tātou i tēnei rā i tētahi mahi whakaora anō i te hononga i waenganui i a Ngāti Paoa me te Karauna, e pūtakea mai ana i te whakawhirinaki taharua, te mahi tahi me te rangapū," hei tā Andrew Little.

"E hari ana taku ngākau kua tutuki i tēnei Pire te pānuitanga tuatahitanga, me tōku rikarika ki te tautoko tonu i ana pānuitanga i Pāremata."

E whai haere ana te wāhi whai pānga o Ngāti Paoa i Te Aroha ki Mahurangi, ā, kei roto ko te Mānia o Hauraki me ngā motu kei te Tīkapa Moana o Hauraki, me ētahi wāhanga o Mahurangi me Tāmaki Makaurau. Kei te takiwā o te 4800 ngā tāngata o Ngāti Paoa.

"E pā ana ngā nawe mai anō o Ngāti Paoa ki te hekenga ā-toto, te ngaromanga o te reo, me te mahi whakamōtī nā te pakanga me te raupatu, tae atu ki te taiparatanga o te kāinga o Pukorokoro, me tā te Karauna whakamana i ngā ture me ngā kaupapahere i noho tata whenua kore ai a Ngā Paoa," i kī a Andrew Little.

E whai wāhi ana ki te mōkī puretumu:

- te puretumu ahumoni, arumoni hoki o te $23.5 miriona
- te puretumu ahurea kei roto ngā pae 12 kua whai hiranga taketake, hītori, ahurea anō hoki ki a Ngāti Paoa.
- ngā kawa me ngā whakaaetanga hononga ki ētahi tari Karauna

"Kei roto hoki i tēnei whakaaetanga whakatau tētahi whakapāha a te Karauna ki a Ngāti Paoa mō ngā mahi a te Karauna, tae atu ki ērā i raru ai te whanaketanga ā-ōhanga, ā-iwi, ā-ahurea hoki o Ngāti Paoa," hei tā Andrew Little.

“Ahakoa e kore rawa e taea te utu anō a Ngāti Paoa mō ngā mea kua ngaro, kua whiriwhirihia te whānuitanga o te puretumu hei tuku i te āhukahuka ā-hītori, ā-ahurea ki a Ngāti Paoa me te whakatupu anō i tō rātou taha ōhanga.

"Ko tāku e tino tūmanako nei ka tautoko tēnei whakaaetanga whakatau i te anamata tōnui ki a Ngāti Paoa mō ngā whakatupuranga maha kei te heke tonu mai," te kī a Andrew Little.
