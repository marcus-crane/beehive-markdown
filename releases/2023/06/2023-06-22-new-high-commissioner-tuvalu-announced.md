Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the appointment of Naomi Kyriacopoulos as Aotearoa New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Tuvalu.

“Tuvalu is a close Pacific partner with which we share key ambitions, most notably to mitigate the impacts of climate change on small island states,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We are building on the partnership we were able to provide through the COVID-19 pandemic, which included significant vaccination and wider pandemic health support, and we will continue to invest our support in climate change response and mitigation, economic strengthening, fisheries, and education.

“Our recent cooperation included a $4.5 million repair of one of Tuvalu’s two passenger ferries and $415,000 in emergency drought support to the outer islands. We have also appreciated Tuvalu’s contributions to labour mobility and the role its workers play in the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Naomi Kyriacopoulos has previously been Deputy Head of Mission to New Zealand’s Embassy in Jakarta and has also had postings to Fiji and the Solomon Islands during her 25-year diplomatic career.

She holds a Master of Arts and speaks Bahasa Indonesia and Solomon Islands Pijin.

As a non-resident High Commissioner, she will be based in Wellington and will take up the position officially on June 14.
