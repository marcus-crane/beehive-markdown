The Government has announced extra support to help remove sediment and debris for whenua Māori in Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay, in the latest initiative to support communities recover from Cyclone Gabrielle. Funding will help whenua Māori owners with the clean up of sediment and debris on whenua Māori.

This $30 million in funding will be made available through grants to help owners of whenua Māori with costs related to the clean-up of sediment and debris. 

“Māori landowners who have completed or who continue their clean-up phase are eligible for funding, along with those seeking support to begin clean-up activities on whenua Māori,” says Māori Development Minister Willie Jackson.

“We recognise that months on, Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay communities are still dealing with the aftermath of the cyclone and we remain committed to supporting their post-cyclone recovery.

“This funding is the latest in our rolling maul of initiatives to support recovery and is in addition to the [$172 million announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/funding-silt-and-debris-removal-hawke%E2%80%99s-bay-and-tair%C4%81whiti) last month to help local authorities and commercial property owners manage sediment and debris.

“The Whenua Māori Service in Te Puni Kōkiri is working with whenua Māori owners to understand their needs and aspirations and will be providing support to make applications,” Willie Jackson said

Te Puni Kōkiri is also administering $2 million of the $10.15 million woody debris fund announced as part of Budget 23. This $2 million fund has been allocated specifically to manage woody debris in catchments on whenua Māori.

“The community has made clear the need for immediate action on removing woody debris, we recognise it will take a multi-faceted approach, and this goes someway in supporting action,” Peeni Henare said.

“With more rain in these regions there is a clear need to remove woody debris as soon as possible to avoid it causing any further damage,” Peeni Henare said.

Whenua Māori owners within Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay should contact the Whenua Māori Service team at their nearest Te Puni Kōkiri regional [office](https://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/whakapa-mai) or email [SedimentandDebrisWhenua@tpk.govt.nz](mailto:SedimentandDebrisWhenua@tpk.govt.nz) for more information about how to apply.
