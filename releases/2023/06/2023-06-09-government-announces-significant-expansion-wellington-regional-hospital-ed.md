The Government is backing a significant expansion of Wellington Regional Hospital’s Emergency Department, Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall has announced.

“Government funding to expand Wellington ED will enable Te Whatu Ora to progress plans for a new, larger, fit-for-purpose facility, featuring an additional 35 spaces. Enabling works are due to start early next year with construction set to begin a year later,” said Ayesha Verrall.

“It’s an exciting project which will dramatically improve the layout of the ED, to better enable contemporary models of care and deliver the improved experiences for patients and their whānau.

“The existing ED isn’t able to meet the growing demand for emergency services across the region. This project will help future-proof Wellington-wide health facilities, so that communities can rely on accessible, quality health services.

“The Front of Whare project will feature an expansion and redesign of the emergency and acute assessment spaces (the Medical Assessment and Planning, Surgical Assessment and Planning, and Clinical Measurement Units), as well as the Transit Lounge and Main Outpatients’ area.

The places of care in ED will increase by 35 points of care. The number of Medical and Surgical Assessment and Planning spaces will increase by 26, while the ICU will increase by another four beds and the number of inpatient beds will increase by 12.

“The project will also encompass a rapid refurbishment of the ground floor of Te Pae Tiaki Wellington ED, as well as seismic resilience works to ensure it meets the levels needed in the event of a significant earthquake and can continue to operate.

“The initial $10m investment we’re announcing today will enable Te Whatu Ora to progress planning and design.

“The development of Wellington ED is one of 104 health infrastructure projects worth a total of $6.8 billion we’re currently planning and delivering around the country.

“The Wellington project is significant. It is a project which will ultimately deliver health benefits to hundreds of thousands of people across the lower North Island,” said Ayesha Verrall.
