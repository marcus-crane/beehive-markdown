Recognising the critical role, value and diverse contributions of volunteers is key to National Volunteer Week which kicks off today, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Priyanca Radhakrishnan says.

“National Volunteer Week 2023 sits against the backdrop of a particularly trying year, as so many communities around Aotearoa New Zealand have responded to severe weather events.

“While it continues to be a challenging time for many, as this week’s theme indicates, it’s also a ‘Time to Shine - He wā pīataata’. We now have a great opportunity to recognise the efforts of our extraordinary volunteers who have contributed so much around Aotearoa New Zealand.

“We know that over 50 percent of Kiwis volunteer in some way, shape or form. Their efforts range from being first responders in emergencies, working to conserve the environment, and supporting individuals and families who might be struggling.

“A key theme for the King’s Coronation last month was to recognise volunteers. This week, there’ll be an opportunity to give volunteers a Big Shout Out through a campaign to publicly acknowledge their efforts.

“The Government is supporting Volunteering New Zealand to celebrate throughout the week. There will be activities at volunteer centres, and Kiwis are also encouraged to ‘shout out’ to their local volunteers, either in person or via social media.

“I hope everyone will play a part in giving volunteers a big shout out,” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.

Best practice guidelines for volunteering are also being launched this week to help community organisations better support their volunteer workforce. These have been developed by Volunteering New Zealand with support from the government, and several non-governmental organisations.
