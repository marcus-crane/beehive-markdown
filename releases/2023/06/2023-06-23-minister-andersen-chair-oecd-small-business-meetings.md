Small Business Minister Ginny Andersen will chair several OECD Ministerial meetings on Small Business on behalf of Aotearoa New Zealand in Paris next week.

A meeting on SMEs and entrepreneurship brings together representatives from 44 countries and will discuss ways to tackle current challenges facing small businesses around the world, including sustainability, digital transitions and mental health pressures in the sector.

It will build on previous work driven by New Zealand to elevate the profile of small businesses into a standalone OECD committee.

An SME and Entrepreneurship Stakeholder Dialogue session with the private sector will include senior OECD officials and involve bilateral engagements with ministerial counterparts from the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland, Malaysia, and South Korea.

“This is an opportunity to gain vital insights into advancing New Zealand’s priorities around Small Business,” Ginny Andersen says

“With SMEs around the world currently facing a range of economic and other challenges, including supply chain issues, cost increases, and access to finance, this Ministerial meeting, which is themed *Managing Shocks and Transitions* - *Future-Proofing SME and Entrepreneurship Policies,* is a valuable opportunity to learn from each other to tackle common issues.

“We have the opportunity to create a more resilient future for Aotearoa New Zealand through developing sustainable, digitally enabled and innovative SMEs.”

Ginny Andersen will be travelling from 24-30 June 2023.
