**ENGLISH: Whakatōhea and the Crown sign Deed of Settlement**

A Deed of Settlement has been signed between Whakatōhea and the Crown, 183 years to the day since Whakatōhea rangatira signed the Treaty of Waitangi, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little has announced.

Whakatōhea is an iwi based in the Bay of Plenty and its six hapū include Ngāi Tamahaua, Ngāti Ira, Ngāti Ngahere, Ngāti Patumoana, Ngāti Ruatākena and Te Ūpokorehe. They have a population of approximately 16,000 members.

“The signing of this Deed of Settlement follows three decades of negotiations between Whakatōhea and the Crown and marks the beginning of a new relationship based on trust, co-operation and partnership as was intended 183 years ago,” Andrew Little said.

“Reaching this milestone on the path to settlement has not been without its challenges, but this is a major step towards realising the aspirations of Whakatōhea for its people today and future generations to come.”

The Deed includes a Crown apology, agreed historical account, and financial and cultural redress for historical breaches of the Treaty that caused harm to Whakatōhea.

The redress package includes

- The reservation of 5,000 hectares of marine space for aquaculture - a first in Treaty settlements to date
- More than $100-million financial, cultural, and commercial redress
- The transfer of 33 sites of cultural significance, bespoke natural resource and conservation arrangements
- Relationship agreements with core Crown agencies

“It is fitting that the Deed of settlement signing was held here today in Ōpōtiki, where Whakatōhea rangatira signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi those many years ago with a vision of prosperity for their people.

“While no settlement can fully compensate for the Crown’s past injustices, it is my sincere hope this redress package will support the economic future, the aspirations and prosperity of Whakatōhea for many generations to come,” Andrew Little said.

**TE REO MĀORI: Kua waitohua e Te Whakatōhea me te Karauna he Whakaaetanga Whakataunga**

Kua waitohua he whakaaetanga whakataunga i waenganui i Te Whakatōhea me te Karauna, i te rā ōrite pū i te 183 tau i muri mai i te hainatanga a Te Whakatōhea i te Tiriti o Waitangi, i kī te Minita mō ngā Take Tiriti o Waitangi, a Andrew Little.

Ko Te Whakatōhea he iwi e noho ana i Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi, ā, ko ōna hapū e ono ko Ngāi Tamahaua, Ngāti Ira, Ngāti Ngahere, Ngāti Patumoana, Ngāti Ruatākena me Te Ūpokorehe. Ko tōna 16,000 ngā tāngata o Te Whakatōhea.

"Kua whakamanatia tēnei whakaaetanga whakataunga i muri i ngā tekautau e toru o ngā whiriwhiri whakaaetanga i waenga i Te Whakatōhea me te Karauna, ka mutu ka tohu i te tīmatanga o te hononga kua whakahoutia nei, e pūtakea mai ana i te whakawhirinaki taharua, te mahi tahi me te rangapū, e ai ki tērā i hiahiatia i te 183 tau ki mua," te kī a Andrew Little.

"Ehara i te mea kāore he uauatanga i te haerenga mai ki tēnei tūāoma, ki tēnei tohu nui i te ara ki te whakaaetanga whakataunga, engari ia he tino nekenga whakamua tēnei ki te whakatinanatanga o ngā tūmanakohanga o Te Whakatōhea, ōna tāngata o nāianei me ōna whakatupuranga e heke mai nei."

Kei roto i te Whakaaetanga Whakataunga he kōrero tuku iho kua whakaae tahitia, te puretumu ahumoni, ahurea hoki mō ngā mahi o mua i takahi i te Tiriti o Waitangi ka pā kino ki Te Whakatōhea.

E whai wāhi ana ki te mōkī puretumu

- Tētahi wāhi rāhui e 5000 heketea te rahi o te takutai moana mō ngā mahi ahumoana, he tuatahitanga tēnei mō ngā whakataunga Tiriti.
- Te whakawhitinga o ngā wāhi ahurea hira e 33, me ētahi whakaritenga rawa taiao me te whāomoomo e ahurei ana;
- Neke atu i te $100 miriona hei puretumu ahumoni, ahurea, me te arumoni;
- Ētahi whakaaetanga hononga ki ngā tari kāwanatanga matua; me

"E tika ana kia tū te waitohu i te Whakaaetanga Whakataunga ki konei i tēnei rā ki Ōpōtiki, te wāhi i hainatia ai te Tiriti o Waitangi e ngā rangatira o Te Whakatōhea i ngā tau tini i mua, me tō rātou wawata kia tau mai te tōnuitanga ki runga i ō rātou iwi.

"Ahakoa e kore rawa e taea e tētahi whakaaetanga whakataunga te utu anō i ngā mahi kino a te Karauna i mua, ko taku tino tūmanako nei, ka tautoko tēnei mōkī puretumu i te taha ohaoha, ngā wawata me te taurikura o Te Whakatōhea mō ngā whakatupuranga maha kei te heke tonu mai," te kī a Andrew Little.
