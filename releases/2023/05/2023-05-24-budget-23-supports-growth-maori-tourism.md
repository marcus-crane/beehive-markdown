An $8 million boost to New Zealand Māori Tourism will help operators insulate themselves for the future.

Spread over the next four years, the investment acknowledges the on-going challenges faced by the industry and the significant contribution Māori make to tourism in Aotearoa. It builds on the $15 million invested in New Zealand Māori Tourism in Budget 2021.

Minister of Māori Development, Hon Willie Jackson said Māori enterprises offered some of the best examples of indigenous tourism in the world.

“This investment is needed to help keep the waka steady during these turbulent times,” Willie Jackson said.

“It will help the industry continue to recover from COVID-19 disruptions, and also to meet increasing demand as international travel resumes.”

The investment will enable the New Zealand Māori Tourism to provide business support to Māori tourism where there is a high demand for marketing advice and expertise, and support for compliance. 

New Zealand Māori Tourism is committed to working with the Māori tourism sector to contribute to our economy, to provide compelling visitor experiences, and to build a strong commercial and cultural leadership.

Associate Minister for Māori Development, Hon Nanaia Mahuta said supporting Māori tourism in this way enabled Māori operators to take a leadership role in how visitors experience Aotearoa.

“Māori culture is at the heart of our visitor experience,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The Māori tourism industry employs thousands of people and cares for some of our most globally renowned tourism attractions.

“While the effects of COVID-19 have been devastating for many, some have seen this as an opportunity to adapt their business to the changing environment.

“This investment will help ensure a future for Māori tourism that strengthens regional economies for the ultimate benefit of local whānau and manuhiri," Nanaia Mahuta said.
