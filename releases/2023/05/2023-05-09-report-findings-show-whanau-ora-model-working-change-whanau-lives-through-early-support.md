Ngā Tini Whetū, a whānau-centred early support prototype involving Te Puni Kōkiri, Oranga Tamariki and ACC is having a positive impact on whānau lives and improving the safety and wellbeing of tamariki, says Whanau Ora Minister Peeni Henare.

“Whānau involved in Ngā Tini Whetū have increased their independence and hopefulness for their future. They have the tools and skills they need to improve their family life, health and prevent injuries.

“When whānau are supported to realise their own aspirations, they, their community and all of Aotearoa New Zealand thrive. This is why the Government continues to support Whānau Ora,” says Minister Henare.

Two reports released by Te Pou Matakana called E Tipu, E Rea – The Collateral Change for Reducing Child Poverty and The Blueprint for System Change report show that whānau experience was positive and their involvement in the Nga Tini Whetu prototype has been life changing.

Among the 800 North Island whānau that were supported through Ngā Tini Whetū, almost all of these whānau involved experienced a positive shift in their wellbeing.

208 whānau began the programme needing intensive support such as resolving crisis, by the end of the programme this number decreased to only 50 whānau needing that level of support.

At the beginning of the programme there were 113 whānau who were flourishing in many areas of their lives, by the end of the programme this number increased dramatically to 402 whānau.

“By improving outcomes for tamariki and their whānau, the findings show that Ngā Tini Whetū, and the underlying Whānau Ora approach, supports the child poverty reduction focus of the government’s Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy.

“Whānau Ora and whānau-centred approaches is about building on the capability and strength of whānau so that they can determine their own goals and aspirations, and then wrapping the support and services around them to achieve those aspirations,” says Minister Henare.

Ngā Tini Whetū, is a successful example of a whānau-centred approach in action. The joint investment was delivered through Whānau Ora commissioning agency Te Pou Matakana, 16 collectives, 53 partners, 80 kaiārahi, and 14 programme managers.

“As the report notes, through Ngā Tini Whetū the government and Te Pou Matakana were able to pool resources and expertise to support whānau.

“I’m delighted to see government agencies working together to use Whānau Ora delivery and mātauranga Māori practice to support transformational whānau outcomes.”

**Notes**

- $42.2 million over two years (2020 to 2022), jointly funded through Te Puni Kōkiri, ACC and Oranga Tamariki.
- The programme was delivered by Te Pou Matakana through 16 Collectives, 53 Partners, 80 Kaiārahi, and 14 Programme Managers.
- 800 whānau were supported (2,056 individuals).
- Ngā Tini Whetū was launched in 2020 with two priorities. Firstly, to support whānau by navigating them towards a brighter future, preventing injuries and averting a care, protection, or youth justice intervention from Oranga Tamariki. And secondly, to reduce the number of incidents of family harm and improve access to services for whānau Māori using a Whānau Ora approach.
- Te Hīnātore is a framework developed by Emeritus Sir Mason Durie for understanding the journey of whānau to wellness. According to the Framework, Mauri noho is the state in which whānau are languishing. Within this state whānau experience cultural, spiritual, and social isolation, negative emotions, relationships, and chronic health issues. Many whānau in this state are also unaware of the potential they possess and lack the supports they need to initiate positive, mana-enhancing change. The framework then describes the whānau journey to Mauri Oho, a flourishing state. Within this state, whānau are engaged socially and culturally with the mental, spiritual, and physical vitality to participate in sustainable and rewarding relationships and activities. The mana of whānau is enhanced.
