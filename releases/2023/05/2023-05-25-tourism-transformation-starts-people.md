- Tourism and hospitality employer accreditation scheme to recognise quality employers
- Better education and career opportunities in tourism
- Cultural competency to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces
- Innovation and technology acceleration to drive satisfying, skilled jobs

Strengthening our tourism workers and supporting them into good career pathways, pay and working conditions is why this Government is backing the Tourism and Hospitality Better Work Action Plan.

“New Zealand continues to be one of the world’s top tourism destinations, and with the borders open, international visitors are returning. We need to support our sector to rebuild a more resilient future that leaves people, communities and the environment better off than before,” Peeni Henare said.

An investment of $18.22 million will help to implement initiatives like the establishment of a tourism and hospitality accreditation scheme – a voluntary scheme that identifies businesses in tourism and hospitality who are treating their staff well. This investment will also contribute to better education and training and improve opportunities for those who choose tourism as a career. 

“Being able to demonstrate you are good employer will go a long way to helping a business attract quality staff and helping workers to find great employers.

“Ensuring staff have a pathway to upskilling is also a focus and there will be closer collaboration between industry and education providers so the right skills are being taught to fill the jobs the sector needs. Education and training will look ahead to better prepare workers for the tourism jobs of the future.

“We will also test whether employee-sharing can reduce the unstable and seasonal elements of tourism.

“Aotearoa New Zealand has a powerful identity as a tourism destination, shaped by our values of manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga. We have a lot to be proud of and a solid foundation to build on, and post-Covid we have had a unique opportunity to rethink our approach,” Peeni Henare said.

“Our ambition is a tourism industry that gives back more than it takes from people, communities and the environment. The Tourism Industry Transformation Plan is driving the long-term change needed to address systemic issues standing in the way of that aspiration and to make the most of opportunities.

“This change must start with looking after the people at the heart of every tourism experience – our tourism kaimahi. We will deliver better outcomes for employees, businesses and visitors if we offer better experiences within the industry,” Peeni Henare said.

**Notes to editors:**

The Better Work Action Plan is the first phase of the Tourism Industry Transformation Plan and is a partnership between industry, Māori, unions and government. All partners will have a role to play in implementing the actions.

$18.22 million from Budget 2023 will be used for:

- A tourism and hospitality employer accreditation scheme to identify good employers who meet a voluntary set of standards, shifting the dial towards better pay and conditions across the whole industry.
- A programme to bring NCEA learning to life and build on the new Tourism NCEA Achievement Standards as part of a move towards education and training that delivers the skills learners, employers and communities need.
- A pilot programme to develop cultural competency resources, aimed at creating more diverse and inclusive workplaces where cultural values are understood and respected.
- Systems analysis of barriers to employee-sharing to better understand how the industry can offer long-term stable employment and smooth seasonality challenges, enabling people to more easily move between employers.
- An expo to showcase existing and emerging technologies that can boost business efficiency and productivity and free up workers to focus on quality customer service and skilled work.
- An accelerator programme that links business leaders with tourism leaders to generate innovative ideas and provide intensive support so firms are better focused and can grow more quickly.
- Industry workshops that encourage tourism businesses to learn about and adopt more innovative business models.
- Funding for MBIE to support the implementation of the Better Work initiatives.
