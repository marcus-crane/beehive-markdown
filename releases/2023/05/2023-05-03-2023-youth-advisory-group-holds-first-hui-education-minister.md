The 2023 Ministerial Youth Advisory Group (YAG) held its first hui of the year with a positive, constructive kōrero on education issues that are important to rangatahi across Aotearoa, Minister of Education Jan Tinetti said today.

The meeting was held on 3 May 2023 at Parliament. It was the first in a series of meetings that will take place in 2023 between the Youth Advisory Group members and the Minister of Education.

“This hui was my first engagement with the Youth Advisory Group as Education Minister. I am impressed by the quality of thinking and their perspectives on important topics such as wellbeing, refreshing the curriculum, attendance and engagement,” Minister Tinetti said.

The Ministerial Youth Advisory Group has been providing advice to the Minister of Education and the Ministry of Education since 2018. They’ve been sharing important insights and feedback to help inform ongoing work to improve the education system.

Four new members also joined this year and Minister Tinetti welcomed them at the hui.
