The report of the Ministerial Inquiry into woody debris (including forestry slash) and sediment in Tairāwhiti/Gisborne and Wairoa has today been presented to the two lead ministers, David Parker and Peeni Henare.

“The impact of slash on the East Coast communities has been devastating. More than 10,000 Tairāwhiti people petitioned for land use to be better managed. This report responds to that call,” David Parker said.

“We thank the panel for its excellent work in preparing this major report in such a short timeframe. Our special thanks go to the Tairāwhiti and Wairoa communities, who were so generous in sharing their concerns and aspirations.

“The panel received 318 submissions, many of them substantial. The report has been delivered on time, after ministers agreed a short extension to allow time for the panel to properly consider the high volume of submissions.

“Ministers will now promptly and carefully consider the report and make decisions on its recommendations, to be announced as soon as possible,” David Parker said.

The report will immediately inform the current review of the National Environmental Standards on plantation forestry, he said.

The Inquiry panel is chaired by Hekia Parata. The other members are Matthew McCloy and Dave Brash.
