The Government is continuing to invest in our regional economies by announcing another $24 million worth of investment into ten diverse projects, Regional Development Minister Kiri Allan says.

“Our regions are the backbone of our economy and today’s announcement continues to build on the Government’s investment to boost regional economic resilience and set up our communities so they can continue to thrive in the future,” Kiri Allan said.

“Through a mix of grants and loans, we’re investing in projects that will enable our regional businesses to continue to grow. From innovative crop farming to training projects, orchard development to sporting facility revamps, these investments will help accelerate business developments and advance work and training opportunities, adding to the vibrancy and appeal of our regions,” Allan said.

The projects are funded through the Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, which aims to support regional economies to become more productive, resilient, inclusive and sustainable by delivering local approaches tailored to regions' particular needs and advantages.

Since coming into Government $3.2 billion has been paid out from Kānoa’s eight funds to support our region’s economies and 1,148 projects have been completed.
