Prime Minister Chris Hipkins met with Niue’s Premier Hon Dalton Tagelagi for the first time on Monday in Wellington.

“It was great to meet with Premier Tagelagi for an introductory call and welcome him back to New Zealand,” Chris Hipkins said.

“We touched on many issues facing our region, including climate change, economic development and discussed the progress made at the Pacific Islands Forum Special Leaders Meeting last week.

“New Zealand and Niue’s shared focus in these areas will be crucial in the years to come,” Chris Hipkins said.

Prime Minister Hipkins and Premier Tagelagi also discussed Niue and New Zealand’s special and long standing relationship and reflected on the significance of the upcoming 50th anniversary of Niue’s decision on self-government in free association with New Zealand.

“The last three years has been challenging for both New Zealand and Niue. I want to acknowledge Premier Tagelagi’s impressive pandemic management, and reaffirm New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to providing health support to Niue,” Chris Hipkins said.

Chris Hipkins was due to travel to Nadi Fiji last week to attend the Pacific Island Forum Special Leaders meeting but was unable to due to Cyclone Gabrielle, making the Premier the first pacific leader he has met with since becoming Prime Minister.
