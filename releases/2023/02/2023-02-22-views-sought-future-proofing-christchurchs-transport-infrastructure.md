Residents of Greater Christchurch are being asked to share their views on how we can futureproof the city’s transport infrastructure, Transport Minister Michael Wood has announced.

The Huihui Mai (let’s come together) engagement opens this week and runs to Sunday, 26 March. It covers planning for transport in urban areas of Greater Christchurch including a potential ‘turn up and go’ mass rapid transit system, alongside the wider spatial plan for the city.

“The Government is upgrading New Zealand’s transport infrastructure to future proof the network for future generations to come, securing New Zealand’s economy and supporting our regions to thrive,” Michael Wood said.

“Greater Christchurch’s population is forecast to double to a million people over the next 60 years or even earlier, following rapid growth over the past 15 years.

“This means Christchurch’s public transport network requires significant changes to make it a viable option for the city’s residents, who have some of the highest dependency on private motor vehicles in the country.

“The Urban Growth Partnership is proposing a mass rapid transit system that is more reliable, sustainable and high frequency so residents want to make the switch from using private cars and can do so with confidence.

“The service would run along a dedicated corridor from the central city north to Belfast and south-west to Hornby. This turn up and go service would create a strong connected spine through our city, helping reduce travel time and making it easier for people to get to where they want to go.

“We’re also exploring what type of mode will be best suited for the proposed route, either Bus Rapid Transit or light rail, but it would be frequent, convenient, zero emission and be able to move large numbers of people.

“Christchurch is a fantastic city, which our government backs 100 per cent. We’re committed to continuing to invest in the city to help it grow and succeed.  

“This proposal will provide more travel options with easy links to the rest of the public transport network, building new and improved infrastructure and using the best technology to ensure Greater Christchurch continues to be a great place to live as it grows” Michael Wood said.

The city’s mayors – of Christchurch City, Waimakariri and Selwyn Districts – and Environment Canterbury’s chairperson Peter Scott are enthusiastically encouraging participation.

The feedback received will help develop the business case for Christchurch Mass Rapid Transit, which is due for completion later this year.
