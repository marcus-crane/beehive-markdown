Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed on behalf of the New Zealand Government his condolences to the family of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has passed away at the age of 100 at his home in Connecticut.

“While opinions on his legacy are varied, Secretary Kissinger was an accomplished diplomat and a towering figure in international affairs, who remained an influential voice to the end,” said Mr Peters.

“During his time in government, and beyond, Mr Kissinger was a driving force in a range of events that reshaped American diplomacy in the second half of the twentieth century, including the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China and the ending of the war in Viet Nam.” 

Secretary Kissinger served as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.
