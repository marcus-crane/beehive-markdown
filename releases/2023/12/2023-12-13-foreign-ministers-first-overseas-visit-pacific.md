Foreign Minister Winston Peters will meet with Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Pacific Islands Forum Secretary-General Henry Puna, during his first overseas visit this term.

“The Coalition Government is deeply committed to the Pacific and to ensuring New Zealand has the connections and relationships to help the region succeed,” Mr Peters said.  

“I look forward to meeting again with Mr Rabuka and Mr Puna, thereby reaffirming the close ties between New Zealand and Fiji – and with the Pacific region as a whole.”  

Mr Peters will be in Suva for around 24 hours on 15-16 December and will be accompanied by a media delegation. His visit will also include engagements with other political leaders in Fiji, as well as a visit to a New Zealand development programme.
