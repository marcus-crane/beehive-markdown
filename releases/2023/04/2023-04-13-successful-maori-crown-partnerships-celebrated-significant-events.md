The regifting of Te Ara o Tūrongo demonstrates the Government’s commitment to strengthening partnerships with Māori, Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti Kelvin Davis said.

As part of the Maniapoto Claims Settlement Act 2022, Te Ara o Tūrongo will be vested in Ngāti Maniapoto and through a process of reciprocity, it will be regifted back to the Crown for all New Zealanders.

“This event is not only significant for the groups involved but to all of Aotearoa New Zealand. It’s an acknowledgement of our shared history and the future pathways we are setting together for our nation”. Kelvin Davis said.

The South Waikato section of the North Island main trunk line was built in 1885. While its purpose initially was for freight, passenger travel was later introduced. To mark the occasion, a 100-year-old locomotive will be used to carry dignitaries to the historic event.

“Te Ara o Tūrongo has a long history for Ngāti Maniapoto. With it being vested in their settlement and in turn regifting it back to the Crown is an expression of the mana of the Ngāti Maniapoto people and their thoughtfulness to Aotearoa, New Zealand” Kelvin Davis said.

In Northland, hundreds gathered to celebrate the centennial of Te Tii Marae in Waitangi. This event is part of a wider celebration of Paihia200, an event commemorating 200 years of the Paihia township and Ngāti Kawa and Ngāti Rāhiri’s relationship with early missionary Henry Williams and his descendants.

“Te Tii Marae has a rich and colourful history. Since the 1970’s it has been a bedrock of political dialogue and robust debate between Māori, successive governments and parliamentarians. It’s important that we pause to celebrate this milestone.” Kelvin Davis said.

These events have been made possible with the commitment of Te Arawhiti and Māori. Te Arawhiti’s Whai Hononga fund supports events significant to Māori and is an opportunity to strengthen genuine working relationships between the Crown, Māori and communities.

“We’ve come a long way in the way the Crown works with Māori. What I’m now beginning to see is cohesion and authenticity. The gold we see when Kāwanatanga and rangatiratanga work together”, Kelvin Davis said.

“Other countries are looking to Aotearoa New Zealand to understand what best practice partnerships look like between indigenous peoples and the Crown. Partnerships like these are an example of success built on reciprocity”.
