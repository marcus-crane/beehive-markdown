The Government is strengthening its commitment to delivering a new state of the art hospital in Dunedin, with an additional funding being invested in the facility, Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall has announced.

“There will be no further substantial re-designs and now it’s time to get on with the build. It’s likely that further design changes would lead to increased cost and delay which no one wants.

“I have allocated an extra $10 million for the hospital which will include an additional MRI machine, and a complete fit-out of collaborative workspace. This is a reversal of a previous decision to ‘shell’ these spaces,” Ayesha Verrall said.

“On top of that, the Minister of Finance and I have agreed to an additional $97 million to go towards the data and digital infrastructure required to make the new hospital operational. The now $1.68 billion hospital is the largest ever health infrastructure project in New Zealand.

“Now set to be 25 percent bigger, the new hospital will include over 40 additional beds and nine additional theatres.

“Its design and use of the latest technologies will mean better patient flow and improved access to diagnostics and treatment spaces which will help reduce unnecessary delays.

“I have asked for further advice on the proposed pathology arrangements and am open to alternatives. I expect to receive the answers to those questions in the coming months.

“To make sure we meet the mental health needs of older people, I can also announce a review to determine the most appropriate range of services to meet the needs of not only the Dunedin community in this regard, but also the wider region.

“I would also like to thank the clinicians who contributed to the design and services that matter. Delivering exceptional clinical services has always been at the front and centre of the plan for the new Dunedin Hospital.

“This Government’s commitment to building a state of the art health facility which will deliver the health services the people of Dunedin and the wider region deserve remains unchanged,” said Ayesha Verrall.
