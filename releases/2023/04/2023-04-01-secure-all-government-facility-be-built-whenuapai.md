A secure facility that will house protected information for a broad range of government agencies is being constructed at RNZAF Base Auckland (Whenuapai), Public Service, Defence and GCSB Minister Andrew Little says.

The facility will consolidate and expand the government’s current secure storage capacity and capability for at least another 25 years.

“We are well and truly living in a digital age and the way in which protected government information is managed into the future is becoming more and more important,” Andrew Little said.

“The construction of this facility is an essential and long-term investment to further ensure core public service information storage well into this century.”

The Government Communications Security Bureau, as the government lead for information security, is partnering with NZDF on this project, and will operate this facility on behalf of the broad range of government agencies that will use it. 

The groundworks and foundations are well underway with above-ground construction commencing in the coming months. The facility is expected to be operational by 2025.
