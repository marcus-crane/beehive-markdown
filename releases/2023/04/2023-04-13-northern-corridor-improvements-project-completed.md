Minister of Transport Michael Wood marked the completion of the Northern Corridor Improvements project this morning, opening the final six kilometre section of shared path on Auckland’s North Shore between Constellation Station and Oteha Valley Road.

“The Government is upgrading New Zealand’s transport system to make it safer, greener, and more efficient for now and future generations to come,” Michael Wood said.

“By giving people more transport choices, like we’ve done through this project, we can reduce transport emissions, reduce congestion on our roads, and build healthier, better connected communities.

“Through the Northern Corridor improvements project we’ve added a five kilometre extension to the Northern Busway, completed the western ring route along with state highway upgrades, and created 10km of shared paths and local connections in the last five years.

“With population numbers increasing, changing our transport mix in cities to provide more choice is crucial to improving people’s quality of life.

“While private vehicles won’t disappear anytime soon, providing transport options that reduce the need to drive every journey make a big difference.

“Reducing the number of trips made in cars and growing the number of people who opt to get around on foot or by bike or use public transport, makes our transport system safer for everyone.

“The Government is investing significantly in transport infrastructure in Auckland. In addition to this project we’ve started construction on the Eastern Busway extension, brought forward construction of the additional Waitematā Harbour crossing, broken ground on Auckland Light Rail, started construction on O Mahurangi – Penlink, and opened the Old Māngere Bridge Replacement.

“Whether travelling to work, school or visiting whānau and family, an efficient, safe, modern, and resilient transport network is central to ensuring Auckland thrives,” Michael Wood said.
