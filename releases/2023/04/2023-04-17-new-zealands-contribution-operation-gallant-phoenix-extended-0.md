Minister of Defence Andrew Little and Minister of Police Ginny Andersen have confirmed New Zealand’s ongoing contribution to the Operation Gallant Phoenix multinational intelligence mission in Jordan.

Cabinet has extended the mandate for New Zealand’s multiagency deployment for two years until June 2025. The number of deployed New Zealand personnel remains fewer than 10.

Established in 2013, Operation Gallant Phoenix is a platform where partners collect and share information about potential and existing terrorist threats, irrespective of threat ideology. The mission is made up of a large number of countries and agencies, including law enforcement, military and civilian personnel.

“As we tragically saw in Christchurch and West Auckland, New Zealand is not immune to threats from violent extremism,” Andrew Little said.

“New Zealand is made safer by working with countries around the world to understand and respond to current, evolving, and future terrorist and violent extremist threats.

“The report of the Royal Commission into the Christchurch mosque attack highlighted the value of Operational Gallant Phoenix. I know our contributions are highly valued by partners,” Andrew Little said.

“New Zealand’s deployment to Operation Gallant Phoenix provides Police and other agencies with valuable information,” Ginny Andersen said.

“It helps us to build and strengthen relationships with international partners, and gain experience for our Police officers and other personnel in ways that cannot be achieved elsewhere.

“The public can feel reassured that this government is prioritising their safety with the renewal of this commitment over the coming two years,” Ginny Andersen said.
