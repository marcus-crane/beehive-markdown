Transport Minister Michael Wood has kicked off construction for a crucial roundabout on Aotea Quay which will improve road safety and usability for a crucial gateway to Wellington City.

“The Government is upgrading New Zealand’s transport system to make it safer and more efficient for now and future generations to come,” Michael Wood said.

“Aotea Quay is a key corridor for accessing the Wellington CBD and carries around 32,000 vehicles per day, nine per cent of which are heavy commercial vehicles.

“The new roundabout will streamline traffic headed to the ferry terminals, and improve the safety of vehicles heading to the freight yards along Aotea Quay, that currently have to cross two lanes of oncoming traffic.

“Vehicles destined for the Interislander will be able to continue on the State Highway and exit at Aotea Quay to turn around via the new roundabout rather than taking the earlier exit onto Hutt Road. This will make a big difference to improving congestion on Hutt Road, especially during peak traffic times. 

“The roundabout on Aotea Quay will also allow us to extend raised median separation on Hutt Road to improve road safety, ensure we can cater for the expected tripling of cycling traffic expected with the completion of Te Ara Tupua to the North, and deliver real safety benefits for the more than 1,300 cyclists who currently use the corridor every day.

“By delivering Let’s Get Wellington Moving projects like Aotea Quay, we’re making mode shift more attractive through safer walking and cycling routes. And by reducing congestion through Hutt Road, we’re helping the more than 6,000 daily bus passengers get to where they’re going more efficiently.

“It’s great to see this project move into the construction phase, so we can get on and deliver safe and reliable transport choice for the people of Wellington and the wider region,” Michael Wood said.
