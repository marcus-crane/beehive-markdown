The Government is proposing new unit pricing measures that will help Kiwis make informed decisions at the checkout and improve competition at the supermarket, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Dr Duncan Webb announced today.

“The cost of living is the number one issue for the Government, and the rising cost of groceries is an issue we are working to address. We’re putting new rules in place to give better information to consumers about the best deal for their needs,” Duncan Webb said.

“We are proposing to introduce rules that require supermarkets to clearly display unit pricing – such as the price of a product per kilogram or litre.

“New Zealanders need this type of information to make informed choices when they shop. It’s particularly helpful where products are sold in different sized packaging and by different brands.

“Along with helping shoppers make informed decisions about what they buy, this will also support inter-brand competition and encourage grocery retailers to compete on value,” said Dr Webb.

“Taking action on unit pricing, alongside a suite of grocery reforms shows this Government is committed to ensuring people get a fairer deal at the checkout.

“Once in force, unit pricing will be mandatory in supermarkets. It will also be required in online grocery stores and in some forms of advertising,” Duncan Webb said.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) has opened consultation on the draft regulations that will put this new unit pricing standard in place. The consultation will run for four weeks and closes on 12 May 2023.
