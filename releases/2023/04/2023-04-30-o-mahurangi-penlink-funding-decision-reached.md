Transport Minister Michael Wood has announced the decision to toll O Mahurangi Penlink to futureproof the vital connection in Auckland’s transport network.

“The Government is upgrading New Zealand’s transport system to make it safer, greener, and more efficient for now and future generations to come,” Michael Wood said.

“O Mahurangi Penlink is more than just a road, it is a vital connection for north Auckland, linking the Whangaparāoa Peninsula with the wider Auckland region.

“The road will not simply support the surrounding community through more lanes for cars, it will provide safer and more sustainable transport choices – becoming a key public transport route while also promoting walking and cycling on a separated shared path.

“This additional route will reduce travel time to North Auckland by about 20 minutes during peak hours.

“The Government recognises the importance of this transport corridor and funded the construction through $8.7 billion of capital investment from the New Zealand Upgrade Programme.

“However, beyond the Government’s upfront investment the road will cost $3 million each year to maintain.

“The road will mostly serve specific communities, and so the Government has decided the fairest option is for drivers who will use the road to contribute through its ongoing maintenance costs through tolls.

“By using a tolling model the community can be assured the road will be maintained to a high level as there will be guaranteed income that will only be used to maintain this road,” Michael Wood said. 

The initial toll for a light vehicle that passes through both tolling points will be $3 during peak congestion periods and $2 during interpeak periods. Heavy vehicles will pay double this rate. Public transport operators and cyclists will not be tolled. This price is aligned with other toll roads in New Zealand

Toll camera points will be installed at two locations, one near State Highway 1 and the other just east of the Weiti Bridge.

“Based on community feedback we reduced the tolls for peak trips by 25 per cent to help address concerns that the toll rates were too high. We also removed a third proposed toll point at the Stillwater interchange to improve the efficiency of the tolling scheme,” Michael Wood said.

“Travel between four other access points on Penlink will remain untolled to ensure there is a free route for vehicles that have no alternative but to use Penlink.

“The Government is investing significantly in transport infrastructure in Auckland. In addition to O Mahurangi Penlink we’ve completed the Northern Corridor Improvements Project, started construction on the Eastern Busway extension, brought forward construction of the additional Waitematā Harbour crossing, broken ground on Auckland Light Rail, and opened the Old Māngere Bridge Replacement,” Michael Wood said.

The construction of O Mahurangi – Penlink is expected to be completed in 2026.
