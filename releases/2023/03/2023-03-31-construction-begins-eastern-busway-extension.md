The Papakura to Botany extension will deliver:

- 5km of separated busway
- Five new bus stations
- 20mins of commuter savings between Botany Town Centre and Britomart
- 12km of safe and separated walking and cycling routes

Faster travel times and more reliable bus services for Auckland’s eastern suburbs are now a step closer, with construction commencing today on the next stage of the Eastern Busway, Transport Minister Michael Wood has announced.

“The Government is upgrading Auckland’s transport system to reduce congestion and maximise the city’s growing potential,” Michael Wood said.

“Auckland’s eastern suburbs have one of the highest levels of work journeys by car and lowest use of public transport in Auckland. With this investment, 24,000 more Aucklanders will live within 1 km of a rapid transit station, which will provide a public transport service catered to the needs of the city.

“I’m excited to see the city transform as we create community assets to provide sustainable, congestion-free, and reliable travel for generations to come.

“The project is another example of how we can successfully stage major infrastructure investments in a way that is economically viable and brings forward the benefits. Each stage will be opened to deliver immediate benefits as soon as construction is completed as the project has been already been designed and consented in full.

“This is consistent with our broader approach to staging the delivery of a linked up mass transit system for Auckland which includes the Eastern Busway, Auckland Light Rail, the Alternative Waitemata Harbour Crossing, and Rapid Transit to the Northwest.

“This project is expected to generate employment opportunities in the short-term, providing work for people and businesses in the construction sector.

“In the long-term, a reduction in journey times and better accessibility to other parts of Auckland will improve access to a wider range of employment, schooling and leisure options for east and south Aucklanders.

“As a result, we will have a more sustainable, inclusive, safe and accessible transport system that better supports economic activity and community life,” Michael Wood said.
