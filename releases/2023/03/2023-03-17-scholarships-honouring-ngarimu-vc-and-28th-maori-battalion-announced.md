Fifteen ākonga Māori from across Aotearoa have been awarded the prestigious Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships and Awards for 2023, Associate Education Minister and Ngarimu Board Chair, Kelvin Davis announced today.

 The recipients include doctoral, masters’ and undergraduate students. Three vocational training students and five wharekura students, all who were celebrated today for their achievements at an award ceremony at Te Papaiouru Marae, Ōhinemutu in Rotorua.

 “These scholarships and awards are a tribute to the heroes of the 28th (Māori) Battalion and were established to commemorate second Lieutenant Te Moananui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu, the first Māori to be awarded the Victoria Cross,” Kelvin Davis said.

 The scholarships aim to support the opportunities for Māori students to reach their full potential by reducing some of the financial barriers to study or training.

 “All scholarship recipients demonstrate characteristics that align with the values of the 28th (Māori) Battalion and have a desire to give back to their communities and whānau.” Kelvin Davis said.

 Over 200 scholarships have been awarded since the formation of the Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund Board in 1945 and today Minster Davis welcomed this year’s recipients in joining a distinguished line of Ngarimu scholars.
