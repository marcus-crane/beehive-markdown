Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the appointment of Peter Zwart as Aotearoa New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.

“Aotearoa New Zealand and Papua New Guinea have a warm and long-standing relationship, underpinned by shared history, growing people-to-people links, and partnerships spanning a range of sectors — including defence, agriculture, gender, education, health, energy, and policing,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Our countries share mutual membership of regional fora, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Pacific Islands Forum.

“Papua New Guinea is a key partner with whom we engage closely on global and regional issues, and collaborate actively to promote a stable, resilient and prosperous Te Moana-nui-ā-Kiwa,’’ Nanaia Mahuta said.

Mr Zwart is a senior diplomat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, most recently serving as manager of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (MFAT) Strategic Policy Unit.

He is a previous manager of MFAT’s Organisational Resilience Team, response manager in the Ministry’s COVID-19 Emergency Coordination Centre and unit manager in the Pacific and Development Group.

Mr Zwart has held prior overseas postings in Beijing, Addis Ababa, and Apia and brings a career focus on international development and the Pacific. He takes up his new position in March.

“Papua New Guinea is a key partner with whom we engage closely on global and regional issues, and collaborate actively to promote a stable, resilient and prosperous Te Moana-nui-ā-Kiwa,’’ Nanaia Mahuta said.
