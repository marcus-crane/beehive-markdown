The Lead Coordination Minister for the Government’s Response to the Royal Commission’s Report into the Terrorist Attack on the Christchurch Mosques travels to Melbourne, Australia today to represent New Zealand at the fourth Sub-Regional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Security.

“The Government is committed to reducing the threat of terrorism and violent extremism to New Zealanders,” Andrew Little said.

“The countries attending the meeting include Australia, Indonesia, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Republic of the Philippines, Singapore and Kingdom of Thailand and we all have the same mission – to make it safer for people within their own countries and within the South East Asia region.”

Co-Chaired by Australia and Indonesia, the meeting provides an opportunity for discussion and collaboration on matters of security important to the region including global security, cyber resilience, and countering and preventing terrorism and violent extremism.

“As friends and neighbours, our countries recognise we have mutual global security challenges and working together will ensure we share insights and best-practise,” Andrew Little said.

“Key to the work we do is engaging and having open conversations with NGOs, private sector, academia and community leaders – New Zealand has embedded this into our response to the Royal Commission of Inquiry recommendations.

“I acknowledge I am travelling on the anniversary of March 15, as is my responsibility, but as always the shuhada remain in my thoughts,” Andrew Little said.

Minister Little arrives back in New Zealand Friday March 17.
