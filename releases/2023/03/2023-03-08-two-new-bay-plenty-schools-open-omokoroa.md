Ōmokoroa, in the Bay of Plenty, will get a new primary school and secondary school in the southwest of the township, with construction expected to begin in 2024, Education Minister Hon Jan Tinetti announced today.

“The recent consultation with Iwi, other schools, and the local community shows there is strong support for new schooling to manage the demands of a growing population.

“Ōmokoroa Primary School will initially provide 350 places for Year 1–6 students, with capacity to expand the roll to 550 student places.

“Ōmokoroa Secondary School will initially provide 800 places for Year 7–13 students, with capacity to expand the roll to 1200 student places.

Minister Tinetti said the Ministry of Education will be calling for nominations for an Establishment Board which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. When appointed, the Board will work with the community to develop the vision and values for the schools and determine how they will operate. The Board will also work with the community and Ngāti Ranginui to establish a new name for the school.

The Ministry of Education has worked in partnership with Ngāti Ranginui, Ngāi Te Rangi and the Western Bay of Plenty District Council to plan the new school. In particular, the Ministry has been working with Pirirakau, one of the hapū of Ngāti Ranginui who are the mana whenua for this rohe.

Budget 22 allocated funds for planning and design of the schools, with the intention that construction on the Prole Road/Ōmokoroa Road site would commence in 2024.
