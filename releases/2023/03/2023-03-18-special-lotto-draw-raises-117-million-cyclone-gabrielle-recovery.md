Internal Affairs Minister Barbara Edmonds has thanked generous New Zealanders who took part in the special Lotto draw for communities affected by Cyclone Gabrielle.

Held on Saturday night, the draw raised $11.7 million with half of all ticket sales going towards recovery efforts.

“In a time of need, New Zealanders rally together to help each other. This is a fantastic effort and I want to thank everyone across the country who contributed to the draw,” Barbara Edmonds said. 

“I also want to acknowledge Lotto NZ and Lottery Grants Board for their strong support in making this happen.

“The damage from Cyclone Gabrielle is extensive and we still have a long road ahead. This result will make a huge difference in helping people and businesses recover and build back better.

“In addition the draw, the Cyclone Gabrielle Appeal Fund has also raised over $830,000 for communities. Every little bit helps and it has been humbling to see people continue to make donations and offers of assistance. 

“While we are only at the start of recovery, I want to assure communities that we are committed to working closely with regions to provide long-term support. This funding will be there to support their needs and locally-led solutions,” Barbara Edmonds said.
