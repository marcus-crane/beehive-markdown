Ngā Iwi o Taranaki and the Crown have today initialled the Taranaki Maunga Collective Redress Deed, named Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little says.

“I am pleased to be here for this significant event, not only for the Crown but importantly for the eight iwi of Taranaki to ultimately recognise their maunga in law as a person, a tūpuna, and as an indivisible and living being.”

Ngā Iwi o Taranaki is the collective name for the eight iwi of Taranaki: Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Mutunga, Taranaki Iwi, Ngāti Maru, Ngāruahine, Ngāti Ruanui and Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi.

Ngā Iwi o Taranaki has an estimated population of approximately 60,000 and encompasses the whole of the Taranaki region.

Through Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo, Egmont National Park will be renamed Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki, meaning ‘the highly regarded and treasured lands of Taranaki’.

The National Park including Taranaki Maunga and the surrounding peaks will be vested in a legal person, named ‘Te Kāhui Tupua’ and will effectively own itself.

“As has been the case with Te Urewera, and Whanganui’s Te Awa Tupua, a representative entity will be established to act as the face and voice of Te Kahui Tupua,” Andrew Little said.

“Known as Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi it will be made of up both Crown and iwi appointees who are required to act in the best interests of the Maunga.”

The Collective Redress Deed has been named by the iwi as ‘Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo’, to reflect the settlement’s intention, which is ‘a commitment to bring about harmony or balance’.

“The Crown remains committed to working together with Ngā Iwi o Taranaki in partnership to enhance the health and wellbeing of this most special place and the legal person Te Kāhui Tupua,” Andrew Little said.

The National Park will continue to be managed by the Department of Conservation, the National Parks Act 1980 will continue to apply, and the existence of the legal person and a set of values agreed by iwi and the Crown will form the foundation for the ongoing governance and management of Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki. A number of culturally significant sites will also be re-named and culturally important minerals will be vested in Te Kahui Tupua.

Ngā Iwi o Taranaki will vote to ratify the Taranaki Maunga Collective Redress Deed over the coming months.

**Ka waitohu ā-pū tuatahi Ngā Iwi o Taranaki me te Karauna i te whakaaetanga puretumu ngātahi mō Taranaki Maunga**

Nō te rā nei kua waitohu ā-pū tuatahi Ngā Iwi o Taranaki me te Karauna i te Whakaaetanga Puretumu Ngātahi mō Taranaki Maunga, ko tōna ingoa ko Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo, ko tā te Minita mō ngā Take Tiriti o Waitangi, ko tā Andrew Little.

"E waingōhia ana ahau kia noho mai ki tēnei huinga whakahirahira, ehara i te mea mō te Karauna anake, engari kē ia ka whai tikanga mō ngā iwi e waru o Taranaki kia whakaae rawa ake ki tō rātou maunga i te ture hei tangata, hei tupuna, ā, hei maunga mataora tē taea te whakawehe i a ia."

Ko Ngā Iwi o Taranaki te ingoa whakatōpū mō ngā iwi e waru o Taranaki: arā ko Ngāti Tama, rātou ko Ngāti Mutunga, ko Taranaki Iwi, ko Te Āti Awa, ko Ngāti Maru, ko Ngāruahine, ko Ngāti Ruanui, ko Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi. Kei Ngā Iwi o Taranaki te taupori kua whakatau tatangia kia tata ki te 60,000, ā, ka whātoro ai ki te katoa o te takiwā o Taranaki.

Mā Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo ka tapaina anō a Egmont National Park ki a Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki, ko tōna tikanga ko 'ngā whenua kairangi, puipuiaki hoki o Taranaki'.

Ka tukuna te National Park tae atu rā ki a Taranaki Maunga me ngā tihi e karapoti ana i a ia ki tētahi tangata ā-ture, ko tōna ingoa ko 'Te Kāhui Tupua', ā, ko te whakatinanatanga kei a ia te mana pupuri i a ia anō.

"Pērā i te āhuatanga i a Te Urewera, i a Te Awa Tupua o Whanganui hoki, ka whakatūria tētahi hinonga māngai ki te mahi hei kanohi, hei reo mō Te Kāhui Tupua," te kōrero a Andrew Little.

"Ka mōhiotia hei Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi, ka hangaia ki ngā kopoutanga o te Karauna, o ngā iwi hoki e herea ai rātou kia mahi mō ngā tino pānga o te Maunga te take."

Kua tapaina te Whakaaetanga Puretumu Ngātahi e ngā iwi ki 'Te Ruruku Pūtakerongo', hei whakaata i te takune o te whakataunga, arā 'he ruruku kia tōia mai te aumārire, te whārite rānei'.

"E ū tonu ana te Karauna ki te mahi ngātahi ki Ngā Iwi o Taranaki ki te pātuitanga hei whakapiki i te hauora, i te oranga hoki o tēnei wāhi tino motuhake, i te tangata ā-ture, i a Te Kāhui Tupua anō hoki," i mea a Andrew Little.

Ka whakahaerehia tonuhia te Papa ā-Motu e Te Papa Atawhai, ā, ka hāngai tonu te National Parks Act 1980, ka mutu ka noho te tūnga mai o te tangata ā-ture, o tētahi huinga uara ka whakaaetia e ngā iwi rātou ko te Karauna hei tūāpapa mō te mahi kāwana, mō te mahi whakahaere e haere tonu ana mō Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki. Ka tapaina anō ētahi wāhi hira ā-ahurea, ā, ka tukuna ētahi kohuke whakahirahira ā-ahurea ki Te Kāhui Tupua.

Ka pōti Ngā Iwi o Taranaki kia whakapūmau i te Whakaaetanga Puretumu Ngātahi mō Taranaki Maunga ā roto i ngā marama e heke mai nei.
