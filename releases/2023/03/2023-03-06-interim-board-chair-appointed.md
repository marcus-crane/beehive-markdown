Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall has appointed Naomi Ferguson as the interim Board Chair for Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand.

“Naomi Ferguson is a highly accomplished leader and brings a wealth of experience both in governance and as an executive, having served as Commissioner and Chief Executive of Inland Revenue.

“She successfully led a transformational change at Inland Revenue, and this experience will be invaluable as Te Whatu Ora continues to settle into its role.

“Her governance roles include serving with the Ministry of Justice Risk and Assurance Committee since 2016.  She is also the Chair of Education Payroll Ltd.

“She has worked across the tax administration, health and social welfare sectors in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and in international forums such as the OECD,” said Ayesha Verrall.

Naomi Ferguson will serve as interim Chair - effective immediately - until a permanent appointment is made.
