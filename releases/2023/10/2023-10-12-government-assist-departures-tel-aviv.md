The Government is partnering with Etihad Airways to facilitate the departure of New Zealanders and other eligible passengers from Pacific countries out of Tel Aviv, following the outbreak of armed conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has announced.

Details will be provided via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [SafeTravel](https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories) system regarding how to register.

“The situation in Israel and the OPT remains highly volatile. Therefore any New Zealanders who can depart the region by other commercial airlines should do so now,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The Government will assist New Zealanders and Pacific island nationals who are having difficulty securing a commercial seat out of Tel Aviv, due to the high demand of bookings.

“The initial flight will depart Tel Aviv, in coming days, arriving into Abu Dhabi. Passengers will be responsible for onwards travel from Abu Dhabi to New Zealand, including costs incurred for that leg.

“There is only a limited number of seats we can secure at any given time, so it is important that those wishing to leave, who already have commercial bookings, do not forgo those tickets for these flights because there is no guarantee a seat can be assigned.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in direct contact with those New Zealanders and eligible travellers in the region. Work remains ongoing, alongside partners, on how we can support those New Zealanders having difficulty securing flights out.

“We encourage all New Zealanders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories to register on Safetravel in order to receive the most upto date government information, and ensure all their details are accurate and up to date,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
