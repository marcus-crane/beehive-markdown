174 new affordable rental homes will built across New Zealand with the help of Government grant funding, Housing Minister Megan Woods has announced.

The Affordable Housing Fund was set up to increase the supply of affordable housing with a priority on rentals, in areas with the greatest housing need.

“174 new affordable rental homes will be built across the country because as a result of this second round of the Fund, bringing to 266 the total number approved to date.

“The Affordable Housing Fund is making a real difference in bringing on more affordable homes for New Zealanders, which the National Party says it will cut, if it gets into government.

“This Government has pulled multiple levers to turn around the housing crisis we inherited, and we are starting to see the green shoots of change with record building consents and more affordable housing being built, as a result.

“These partnerships will support and grow the affordable housing sector, who are critical to addressing the needs of New Zealanders who struggle to meet the cost of a market rental, but for various reasons can’t access public housing,” said Megan Woods.

These new affordable rental homes are for low-to-moderate income families and whānau.

The second round of funding will support the building of homes in the following areas of New Zealand:

- 65 homes for Hawke’s Bay
- 64 homes for the Bay of Plenty, including 38 in Rotorua
- 16 homes for Northland
- 24 homes for Christchurch
- Five homes for Blenheim

The Affordable Housing Fund focuses on increasing affordable housing provision (rental and home ownership) on land owned by iwi and Māori groups, Councils and community groups.
