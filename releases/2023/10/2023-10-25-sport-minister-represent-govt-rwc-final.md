The Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson will represent the Government at the Rugby World Cup final in Paris this weekend.

The Minister’s trip has been approved by the Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and endorsed by the National Party leader Christopher Luxon.

“I am delighted to be able to attend the Rugby World Cup final on behalf of the New Zealand Government.

“The team is in top form to take on the Springboks, with both sides vying to win the cup for a fourth time,” Grant Robertson said.

Grant Robertson will depart tomorrow for Paris, returning next week.
