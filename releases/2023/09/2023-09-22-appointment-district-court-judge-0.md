Susie Houghton of Auckland has been appointed as a new District Court Judge, to serve on the Family Court, Attorney-General David Parker said today. 

Judge Houghton has acted as a lawyer for child for more than 20 years. She has acted on matters relating to the Hague Convention, an international agreement to safeguard inter-country adoptions. She has also served for six years on the Executive of the Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society.

Ms Houghton started work as a solicitor in 1989 with Nicholson Gribben, which later became Phillips Fox, before joining Davenports where she led the family law team. 

In 1998 she joined Galvin Law, becoming a partner in that firm. She has been a barrister in chambers in Auckland since 2001. 

Judge Houghton will be sworn in on 27 October 2023 and will take up her appointment at the Wellington District Court.
