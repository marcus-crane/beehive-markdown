The Government is helping businesses recover from Cyclone Gabrielle and attract more people back into their regions.

“Cyclone Gabrielle has caused considerable damage across North Island regions with impacts continuing to be felt by businesses and communities,” Economic Development Minister Barbara Edmonds said.

“Building on our earlier business support, this $10 million package targets nine projects which will support economic recovery in Hawke’s Bay, Tairāwhiti and Northland.

“It includes regional tourism recovery programmes, infrastructure resilience, and training and accommodation support to rebuild workforces.

“As we focus on helping businesses transition from response to recovery mode, these projects will be locally-led and build resilience so they’re better set up for the future,” Barbara Edmonds said. 

Regional Development Minister Kieran McAnulty highlighted the need to fund projects that back local communities and economies. 

“Work on these projects is ready to begin and will make an immediate contribution towards local recovery and resilience,” Kieran McAnulty said.

“In the Hawke’s Bay, funding will be used to develop much-needed accommodation for tradespeople, so building crews can take on urgent rebuild projects. Longer term, this will be used to house horticulture trainees and workers.

“These are also some of our biggest tourist destinations and we want to see more people going back to provide a boost to economies, especially as we look ahead to the summer months.

“The Government remains committed to helping businesses and people recover from the severe weather events. We’re continuing to work with local communities on their needs and support regions to build back better,” Kieran McAnulty said.

Funding for the projects comes from the final allocation of the $75 million interim recovery package established earlier this year to provide support for businesses impacted by the North Island weather events.

The regional recovery package includes support for the following projects:

**Tairāwhiti**

This funding will provide training and build the workforce needed for essential recovery and rebuild works across Tairāwhiti, including the roading network. 

- Tourism support: $1.5 million to Te Runanganui O Ngati Porou Trustee Limited to support the establishment of a new i-SITE and deliver more compelling visitor experiences.
