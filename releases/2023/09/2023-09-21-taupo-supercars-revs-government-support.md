The future of Supercars events in New Zealand has been secured with new Government support.

The Government is getting engines started through the Major Events Fund, a special fund to support high profile events in New Zealand that provide long-term economic, social and cultural benefits.

“The Repco Supercars Championship is a premier motorsport event showcasing some of the world’s best touring car drivers,” Economic Development Minister Barbara Edmonds said.

“Since the first ever international championship round for Supercars was held in 2001, the event has grown to become one of the largest sporting events in our country.

“After a one-year hiatus, we’re helping the high-octane event return to our shores. The Government will contribute $5 million to support the Taupō International Motorsport Park round between 2024 and 2026, providing long-term confidence to organisers and commercial partners.

“This investment will open a new chapter for racing in New Zealand. It will support local economies by generating cultural and economic opportunities, as well as supporting the region’s post-COVID recovery.

“We know this will be a huge boost to the region. The Supercars Championship is expected to attract over 100,000 attendees to Taupō each year, including almost 9,500 international visitors and 1,500 personnel.

“With the event broadcast into more than 95 countries and over 300 million homes, Taupō and surrounding areas will have plenty of opportunities to highlight all the region has to offer.

“We look forward to supporting the organisers to kick these events into gear and maximise the benefits for Kiwis,” Barbara Edmonds said.
