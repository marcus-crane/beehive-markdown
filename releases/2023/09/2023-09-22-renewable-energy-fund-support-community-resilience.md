- 40 solar energy systems on community buildings in regions affected by Cyclone Gabrielle and other severe weather events
- Virtual capability-building hub to support community organisations get projects off the ground
- Boost for community-level renewable energy projects across the country

At least 40 community buildings used to support the emergency response during this year’s North Island severe weather events will be fitted with solar and battery systems to boost community resilience, Energy and Resources Minister Hon Megan Woods today announced.

“As the next round of $46 million Community Renewable Energy Fund gets underway $6.5 million is going towards solar energy systems on key community buildings in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Eastern Bay of Plenty, Tairāwhiti, Hawke’s Bay and Wairarapa,” Megan Woods said.

“The community buildings could include marae, places of worship and halls or some schools used as community hubs following Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland floods.

“We’ve seen just how important it is for communities to rally together in major events. By installing solar energy systems on key buildings in communities, particularly in more remote areas, we’re building stronger, more resilient communities.

“We also know there are barriers in getting these types of projects off the ground, that’s why alongside funding we are setting up a capability-building hub to help communities address barriers and help create robust, informed plans to take their projects forward,” Megan Woods said.

From mid-2024, $27 million in funding will be available to help communities deliver a mix of energy resilience projects, ranging in scale and complexity, and bespoke community energy scheme opportunities across New Zealand.

- The Community Renewable Energy Fund builds on previous work with the [Māori and Public Housing Renewable Energy Fund](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/low-emissions-economy/energy-efficiency-in-new-zealand/maori-and-public-housing-renewable-energy-fund/maori-housing-renewable-energy-fund/list-of-funded-projects/) and discussions with the community energy sector.
- A [small amount of funding was released early in May this year](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/five-community-energy-projects-kick-start) to support five solar energy projects on community housing. Information on these projects is on the [MBIE website](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/low-emissions-economy/energy-efficiency-in-new-zealand/community-renewable-energy-fund/list-of-funded-projects/).
