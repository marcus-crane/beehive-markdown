The Government has agreed to a request from the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 for extra three months to deliver its final report.

The Royal Commission was [established in 2022](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/royal-commission-draw-lessons-pandemic-response) to strengthen New Zealand’s preparedness for any future pandemics. It was originally due to conclude mid-2024.

“The Commission has been considering extensive reviews on our pandemic response, along with other relevant publicly available information,” Internal Affairs Minister Barbara Edmonds said.

“Commissioners have made it clear that more time is needed to fully understand the complex impact of the pandemic on our social and economic wellbeing, and what lessons we can learn from it.

“Following a request from the Commission, the Government has agreed to a short extension to the final report date to 30 September 2024. No other changes will be made to its terms of reference.

“This three-month extension will enable the Commission to engage directly with a wide range of groups and communities, beyond existing reviews or written information.

“The work of the Royal Commission is extremely important. We want to ensure they can deliver a report that best prepares New Zealand for the future,” Barbara Edmonds said.
