Pokia ana te tihi Taiarahia e Hine-Pūkohu-rangi

Hotu kau ana te manawa!

Horahia ana te whārua o Ruātoki e te kapua pouri

Tikaro rawahia ko te whatumanawa!

Rere whakamuri kau ana te awa o Hinemataroa

Ki te kawe i te rongo ki te mātāpuna i nga pōngaihu

Maungapōhatu, tuohu kau ana ngā māhunga

Kia eke rawa te karere a mate ki te tī rawa o Te Urewera,

Pakaru kau ana he roimata i ngā kamo,

Whakapukepuke ana ki te moana tukiri o Waikaremoana.

 

Tuhoe-Pōtiki, kua hoki atu rā tō uri a Te Paki Nikora

ki te tauawhi  o tō uma, kua wetekina i te ao tūroa.

 

E te kaiwhakaueue i ngā tini marae o Tūhoe,

takoto mai i te ngūtanga o te tini,

Okioki i ō kawenga, pōhara ana te ao i tō ngaromanga,

Rangatira ana i ō whakawhiwhinga te mahue mai nei

hei tohu i pahure pēnei koe.

 

Haere e koro, haere oti atu koe.

 

It was with much sadness that I learned of the passing of Paki Nikora on Monday.

“He was an influential Tūhoe leader, and his strength for also supporting others remains a lasting testament to the mana of the man. Paki was courageous. He was the voice for many who wanted to challenge the system and he did that right to his last days.

“He always remained vigilant and kept others to account in emphasising tikānga Māori

“His contribution to his iwi and its Treaty of Waitangi claims will be remembered by many” says Minister Willie Jackson.

While he was an astute farmer and businessmen, it was his rich knowledge from te ao Māori that best enabled him to inspire both the hearts and minds of those who knew him. In addition to his work on tikanga and rangatiratanga, Paki was also a staunch advocate for the development of Tūhoe marae. He helped to renovate 11 marae with the help of the Provincial Growth Fund.

After being appointed chair in 2009, he went on to help convert the Tataiwhetu Trust farm near Ruātoki into an organic dairy farm, which won the Ahuwhenua Trophy in 2021. The Trophy is the most prestigious award for excellence in Māori farming. It acknowledges and celebrates business excellence in New Zealand's important pastoral and horticultural sectors.

“Where Paki led, others followed. Our thoughts and prayers stay with his whānau at this time”
