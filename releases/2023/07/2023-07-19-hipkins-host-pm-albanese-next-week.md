Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will visit Wellington next week to mark a year of special anniversaries, including the 40th anniversary of Closer Economic Relations, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

This will be the third official bilateral meeting of the two Prime Ministers, and Prime Minister Albanese’s first official visit to New Zealand.

“I believe that the trans-Tasman relationship is the strongest it has been in decades,” Chris Hipkins said.

“In both Australia and Prime Minister Albanese, New Zealand has a close friend and ally, so im very pleased to host him here during this year of milestone anniversaries.

“2023 is the 40th anniversary of Closer Economic Relations, the 50th anniversary of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, and 80th anniversary of diplomatic representation.

“Prime Minister Albanese’s visit is a chance to recognise our past achievements, to celebrate the progress we have made this year and to set ambition for where Australia and New Zealand want to go next.

“This visit will provide me with another opportunity to thank Prime Minister Albanese for his instrumental role in one of this year’s major achievements: the announcement of the new direct pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders living in Australia, which came into effect this month,” Chris Hipkins said.

While in Wellington, the two Prime Ministers will celebrate New Zealand and Australia co-hosting of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, which kicks off on 20 July.

“The FIFA Women’s World Cup is an example of how our countries work together to deliver on the world stage, and is a clear demonstration of our two countries’ strong commitment to gender equality and fairness,” Chris Hipkins said.

The visit will take place from 26-27 July.
