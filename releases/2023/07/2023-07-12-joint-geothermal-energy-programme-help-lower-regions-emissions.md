Aotearoa New Zealand has strengthened its support to Indonesia’s geothermal energy sector with a further investment in a joint Geothermal Energy programme with Indonesia that will help lower climate emissions, and benefit our wider Indo-Pacific region, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta says.

“New Zealand is contributing it’s fair share in the global race to tackle climate change through our climate finance funding which assists developing countries to protect lives, livelihoods and infrastructure from the impacts of climate change,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Indonesia is making good progress in transitioning to low emission energy production. However, geothermal resources remain under-utilised, and a three fold increase in the rate of investment and human capacity is needed to support Indonesia’s ambitious geothermal capacity targets.

“This commitment of $15.6 million will help Indonesia achieve its renewable energy targets through the provision of technical assistance and capacity building across three key areas: regulatory frameworks, geothermal exploration, and increase workforce technical skills and capacity,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The funding will be provided over five years and builds on New Zealand and Indonesia’s long-standing relationship in geothermal development. Cooperation first began in the 1970s, and is part of the renewable energy cooperation which New Zealand and Indonesia committed to under our new Comprehensive Partnership in 2018.

“I’ve witnessed and heard first-hand the impact climate change is having on New Zealand communities and our region. We must continue stepping up our support and contributing positively towards global efforts if we are to improve the very real and harmful effects of climate change,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
