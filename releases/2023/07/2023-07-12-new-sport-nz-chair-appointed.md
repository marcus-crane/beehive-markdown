She takes over from Bill Moran, who stepped down as chair of both boards at the end of June after five years in the role.

“I would like to acknowledge and thank Bill Moran for his work on the board since 2016, both as a board member and as chair over the last five years, Bill has been a stalwart in steering the sector, and Sport NZ and HPSNZ through some challenging times,” Grant Robertson said.

“I am pleased to see him continue as a board member for another year to provide support for the new governance leadership.”

Raewyn Lovett was appointed to the Sport NZ Board in 2018, becoming Deputy Chair in August 2021. She was appointed to the HPSNZ Board at the beginning of 2022 as Deputy Chair. She is a partner at Duncan Cotterill specialising in commercial law and has experience in a variety of governance roles in the sport and not-for-profit sectors.

Duane Kale has been appointed as deputy Chair of both Boards.

He was appointed to the Sport NZ Board in 2021 and the HPSNZ Board in September 2022. He is a Paralympian with significant governance and commercial finance experience. Mr Kale was an elected member of Paralympics New Zealand for eleven years and has been appointed by the International Olympic Committee to the Evaluation Commission for the 2024 Paralympic and Olympic Games.

“I welcome the new leadership team with Raewyn and Duane bringing a wealth of experience and knowledge to their new roles. I look forward to working with them,” Grant Robertson said.
