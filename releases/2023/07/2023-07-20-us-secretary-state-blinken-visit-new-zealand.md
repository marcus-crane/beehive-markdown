United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Aotearoa New Zealand next week for bilateral meetings and to attend the FIFA Women’s World Cup.

“The United States is a close friend and partner of New Zealand and I’m delighted to host Secretary Blinken on his first official visit to Aotearoa,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Our countries have a strong and longstanding relationship, which is based on close cooperation across our many shared values and issues of strategic interest to us both.” 

Secretary Blinken will be hosted in Wellington 26-27 July, and will undertake a formal bilateral meeting with Nanaia Mahuta and will meet with Prime Minister Chris Hipkins. 

“I look forward to productive discussions with Secretary Blinken on global and regional security issues that matter to both our countries including, our wider bilateral relationship, the war in Ukraine, climate change, Pacific resilience and regional economic recovery,” Nanaia Mahuta said. 

“I’m confident this visit will further our strong relationship and it continues to grow from strength to strength.”

Secretary Blinken will be welcomed to Wellington with an official Pōwhiri at Parliament. Outside of bilateral meetings, he will undertake sporting and cultural engagements – including cheering on the United States Women’s National Team in their match against the Netherlands.

“Co-hosting the FIFA Women’s World Cup provides a great opportunity through some good old-fashioned sports diplomacy to strengthen our international relationships,” Nanaia Mahuta said
