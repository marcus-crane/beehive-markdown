Minister for Emergency Management Kieran McAnulty today announced further appointments to the Government Inquiry into the response to the 2023 North Island severe weather events.

“There are always lessons that come from responses to severe weather events. We began an inquiry to ensure New Zealand’s emergency management system is properly set up so that we’re ready for and can respond to future emergency events,” Kieran McAnulty said.

“The members of the Inquiry, announced today, have broad knowledge and experience across a wide range of relevant areas including governance, primary sector and rural communities, emergency response and recovery, and iwi and Māori development.”

Sir Jerry Mateparae, who was announced as chair the week before last, will be joined on the Inquiry by:

- John Ombler CNZM QSO, who has held numerous senior public service leadership roles including Deputy State Services Commissioner, Chief Executive of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), and being one of the Controllers of the all-of-government response during the COVID-19 pandemic
- Julie Greene, who is based in Hawke’s Bay and brings over two decades of experience across the horticulture and rural sector within New Zealand, including senior leadership roles at Heinz Watties
- Rangimarie Hunia (Ngāti Whātua), who brings significant governance experience through her current roles as Director of Moana New Zealand, Chair of Te Ohu Kaimoana Trust and Chair of Ngā Pūkenga mo Te Tai Ohanga (Treasury).  She has also been Chief Executive of Ngāti Whātua Ōrakei Whai Māia.

The Panel will be appointed for the duration of the Government Inquiry, which is due to be completed in March 2024.

“The Inquiry will look at how prepared local and central governments were to be able to respond to the severe weather events.

“The Government has committed $6.8 million to meet the costs of the Inquiry. It is important it’s done right and has the resources it needs.

“Many agencies involved in the severe weather response are undertaking their own reviews, which will be more specific. The Government Inquiry will not seek to duplicate this work and will be informed by the findings of those reviews when making recommendations.

“I’d like to welcome the members of the Inquiry and thank them for being a part of this work. The weather events have been extremely tough on communities and it’s important we learn lessons and keep improving.”
