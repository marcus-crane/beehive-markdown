Work will start this year on the first 94 projects under a dedicated fund for early preventative works to protect our state highway network from future severe weather disruption, Transport Minister David Parker said today.

Waka Kotahi has confirmed that the Transport Resilience Fund projects will start in 2023/24. The list covers projects across the country, and it includes some substantial projects in Northland and the West Coast in particular.

“Budget 2023 established the $419 million Transport Resilience Fund. It complements the Government’s funding of more than $1 billion in 2023 for immediate works to repair cyclone-affected roads.

“We know that severe weather events will be an ongoing challenge. This fund will help identify and repair vulnerable points in the network to help mitigate the risk of them failing in future storms or other natural hazards,” he said.

“Nearly $44 million will be invested in Northland, including a $25 million project to help stabilise subsidence risks across the region’s highway network. This will focus on 92 sites where urgent works are required. The works will be programmed over seven years.

“On the West Coast, $22.7 million will go into several projects including river erosion protection works at the Gates of Haast bridge on State Highway 6, which borders Mt Aspiring National Park and connects the West Coast to Central Otago.

“A long list of other regions will benefit from the small to medium-scale resilience project funding. The list doesn’t yet include cyclone-hit Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay, because immediate recovery efforts are the priority in those regions this year.

The projects announced today are part of a wider, multi-year programme that will help ensure essential transport connections around the country remain open and accessible, now and in future,” David Parker said.

**Notes to editors:**

The Transport Resilience Fund is a $419 million investment package to build resilience on the national roading network, it was announced as part of Budget 2023. It is comprised of three Crown funding components:

- $100 million for Low-Cost, Low Risk (LCLR) resilience projects on state highways
- $179 million for more complex resilience projects on state highways
- $140 million for resilience projects on local roads

Waka Kotahi is administering the Transport Resilience Fund through a seven-year programme that aims to advance resilience improvements on the roading network to minimise the future damage caused to our roads by future weather events, which are increasing in frequency and severity because of climate change.
