Walking and cycleway trail restoration, improving roads for all weather access, fit for purpose toilet blocks, and rebuilding walkways to regain access to beaches, are some of the projects funded through the Tourism Infrastructure Fund,” Tourism Minister Peeni Henare announced today.

“Supporting projects which provide resilience and aid recovery for regions hit by the extreme weather events earlier this year was a priority for the final round of funding through the Tourism Infrastructure Fund,” Peeni Henare said.

The Tourism Infrastructure Fund is investing in projects repairing infrastructure impacted by recent extreme weather events and improving future resilience, including $2.6 million for Thames-Coromandel, as part of a $14.3 million fund for tourism projects across Aotearoa.

“We recognise the impact extreme weather events had on local infrastructure and visitor numbers which is why we intentionally prioritised funding to help support communities restore and upgrade tourism infrastructure to pre-cyclone conditions to help local communities recover.

The Tourism Infrastructure Fund is intended to protect and enhance Aotearoa New Zealand’s reputation both domestically and internationally by supporting robust infrastructure which contributes to quality experiences for the visitor and to broader community support for tourism in the area.

“A total of 56 projects will receive support from the fund. From upgrades to carparks, public wifi, smart lighting, CCTV installation and improving the Taipa Beachfront in the Far North, to construction of new Motorhome facilities in Gore, to trail and viewing platform repairs on the Tarawera Trail in Kawerau, to safer roads and lookouts on the Chatham Islands, projects being funded truly span the breadth of Aotearoa New Zealand,” Peeni Henare said.

"Some communities will start to see the benefits of the fund immediately with some projects ready to go, joining other projects which will continue to benefit communities over the next few years. 

“I am confident the projects being funded today will add to the success of the Tourism Infrastructure Fund which has supported almost 300 projects to enhance visitor’s experiences and provide quality infrastructure which locals benefit from daily,” said Peeni Henare.
