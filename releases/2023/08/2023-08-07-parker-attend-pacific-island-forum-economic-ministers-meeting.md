Associate Finance Minister David Parker will represent New Zealand at this week’s Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Economic Ministers Meeting in Suva, Fiji.

“Ministers will discuss the key economic and socio-economic issues facing the Pacific,” David Parker said.

“The meeting will aim to promote regional stability through shaping the regional architecture so that it is fit for purpose and can generate Pacific-owned solutions to the challenges of today.

“This meeting will discuss the draft Pacific Roadmap for Economic Development.”

The meeting will focus on strengthening relationships and discussing regional priorities with fellow forum members and observers, including Australia as a fellow Forum member and a United States Treasury delegation attending the Forum for the first time.

David Parker will travel to Suva on Tuesday and return to New Zealand on 11 August.
