**He mea pāhi e te Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill te pānuitanga tuatahi**

I kitea e Te Whakatōhea te pānuitanga tuatahitanga o Te Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill i te Pāremata i tēnei rā mō ā rātou kerēme Tiriti o Waitangi nō mai rā anō.

Ko Te Whakatōhea he iwi e noho ana i Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi, ā, ko ōna hapū ko Ngāi Tamahaua, Ngāti Ira, Ngāti Ngahere, Ngāti Patumoana, Ngāti Ruatākena me Te Ūpokorehe. Ko tōna 16,000 ngā tāngata o Te Whakatōhea.

"Ko tēnei tohu nui i tēnei rā kua puta i muri i te neke atu i te toru tekau tau o ngā whiriwhiri whakaaetanga i waenga i Te Whakatōhea me te Karauna, ka mutu ka tohu i te tino nekenga whakamua ki te whakatinanatanga o ngā tūmanakohanga o Te Whakatōhea, ōna tāngata o nāianei me ōna whakatupuranga e heke mai nei," te kī a Te Minita mō ngā Take Tiriti o Waitangi, a Andrew Little.

Kei roto i ngā nawe mai anō a Te Whakatōhea ki te Karauna ko te urutomo, nohowheta me te raupatu kīhai i tika i ngā whenua o Te Whakatōhea i ngā tau 1860. He tokomaha ngā tāngata o Te Whakatōhea i whakamatea e ngā hōia o te Karauna, tae atu ki ētahi ehara i te kairiri, ka mutu ka whāia e ngā hōia kia anea katoa te whenua, me te urupatu i ngā kāinga, huanga kai me ngā kararehe.

"I tuku petihana a Te Whakatōhea mō te puretumu i te tau 1914, ā, ko rātou tētahi o ngā iwi tuatahi ki te whai wāhi ki ngā whakariterite whakataunga ki te Karauna i ngā tau 1990," hei tā Andrew Little.

"E tohu ana te pānuitanga tuatahi i tēnei rā, he wā nui ake i te kotahi rau tau i muri i taua petihana tuatahi, i tētahi hipanga hira ki te whakaoranga anō o te hononga i waenga i a Te Whakatōhea me te Karauna."

Kei roto i te whakaaetanga whakataunga ko te whakapāhatanga a te Karauna, ngā kōrero tuku iho kua whakaae tahitia, te puretumu ahumoni, ahurea hoki mō ngā mahi o mua i takahi i te Tiriti o Waitangi ka pā kino ki Te Whakatōhea.

E whai wāhi ana ki te mōkī puretumu

- Tētahi wāhi rāhui e 5000 heketea te rahi o te takutai moana mō ngā mahi ahumoana, he tuatahitanga tēnei mō ngā whakataunga Tiriti
- Neke atu i te $100 miriona hei puretumu ahumoni, ahurea, me te arumoni
- Te whakawhitinga o ngā wāhi ahurea hira e 33, me ētahi whakaritenga rawa taiao me te whāomoomo e ahurei ana
- Ētahi whakaaetanga hononga ki ngā tari kāwanatanga matua.

"Ahakoa e kore rawa e taea e tētahi whakaaetanga whakataunga te utu anō i ngā mahi kino a te Karauna i mua, ko taku tino tūmanako nei, ka tautoko tēnei mōkī puretumu i ngā wawata o Te Whakatōhea mō te anamata taurikura mō tō rātou iwi," te kī a Andrew Little.

**Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill passes first reading**

Te Whakatōhea has witnessed the passing of the first reading of the Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill at Parliament today for their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Whakatōhea is an iwi based in the Bay of Plenty region and includes Ngāi Tamahaua, Ngāti Ira, Ngāti Ngahere, Ngāti Patumoana, Ngāti Ruatākena and Te Ūpokorehe hapū. They have a population of approximately 16,000 members.

“Today’s milestone follows more than three decades of negotiations between Whakatōhea and the Crown, and marks a major step towards realising the aspirations of Te Whakatōhea descendants today, and for generations to come,” Treaty Negotiations Minister Andrew Little said.

The historical grievances of Te Whakatōhea against the Crown include the unjustified invasion, occupation and raupatu (confiscation) of Whakatōhea land in the 1860s. Crown troops killed many members of Whakatōhea, including non-combatants, and adopted a scorched earth policy, destroying homes, crops and livestock.

“Whakatōhea first petitioned Parliament for redress in 1914, and they were among the first iwi to enter settlement negotiations with the Crown in the 1990s,” Andrew Little said.

“Today’s first reading, more than a hundred years on from that first petition, marks a significant step in the restoration of the relationship between Whakatōhea and the Crown.”

This settlement includes a Crown apology, agreed historical account, and financial and cultural redress for historical breaches of the Treaty that caused harm to Whakatōhea.

The redress package includes

- The reservation of 5,000 hectares of marine space for aquaculture - a first in Treaty settlements to date
- More than $100-million financial, cultural, and commercial redress
- The transfer of 33 sites of cultural significance, bespoke natural resource and conservation arrangements
- Relationship agreements with core Crown agencies

“While no settlement can fully compensate for the Crown’s past injustices, it is my sincere hope this settlement will support Whakatōhea’s aspirations for a prosperous future for their people,” Andrew Little said.
