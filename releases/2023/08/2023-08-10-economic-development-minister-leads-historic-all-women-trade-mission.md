Economic Development Minister Barbara Edmonds will lead the first all-women trade mission to Australia this week, with a 26 strong business delegation.

While in Melbourne, Barbara Edmonds will attend several business engagements including an event with Aboriginal businesswomen and meet with the Governor of Victoria, Her Excellency Margaret Gardner.

“With our trans-Tasman relationship stronger than ever, it’s a great time to keep building on our trade momentum and continue providing greater economic security for New Zealanders,” Barbara Edmonds said.

“Australia is often the first place that our businesses look to when they start exporting. It’s our most popular export market with over 7,200 Kiwis exporting across the Tasman and our relationship worth over $29 billion in total trade value last year alone.

“Not only does our visit coincide with the top women’s sporting event, the FIFA Women’s World Cup, but it is a milestone for our economic ties. It marks the 40th anniversary of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations, one of the most advanced free-trade agreements in the world.

“This mission allows us to raise the profile of New Zealand’s export offerings, add commercial value for our women exporters and bolster our brand in Australia. 

“Bringing together an all-women trade mission will connect a diverse group of leaders from a wide range of sectors, including food and beverage, health products, technology and brand and marketing.

“The delegation features the very best of New Zealand innovation, sustainability, and a long-term commitment to the welfare of communities. We’re also fortunate to be joined by a number of Māori and Pacific delegates who promote indigenous economic growth and positive change in our region.

“I’m thrilled to be leading this historic trade mission to further show the world what Kiwi women in business can achieve,” Barbara Edmonds said.

The delegation will be in Australia from 13 – 17 August.
