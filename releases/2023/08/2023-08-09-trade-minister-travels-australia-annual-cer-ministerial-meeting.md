Trade and Export Growth Minister Damien O’Connor will depart for Adelaide tomorrow to meet his Australian counterpart, Senator the Hon Don Farrell for the annual Closer Economic Relations (CER) Ministerial Meeting.

“The Government’s trade agenda has seen us sign or upgrade seven FTAs since 2017. In turning 40 this year, CER holds a special place for New Zealand as our most successful and enduring trade agreement,” Damien O’Connor said.

“CER has delivered great benefit to Kiwis and currently represents 15 per cent of our exports. The Government has overseen a 12 per cent increase in two-way trade with Australia from $26 billion in 2017 to $29 billion in 2022.

“Our two Prime Ministers met recently in Wellington, and this next meeting provides the opportunity for further discussion with Senator Farrell.

“These regular meetings are about ensuring that CER continues to earn its world class reputation and that it remains fit-for-purpose in an ever-changing world.

“Senator Farrell and I will also discuss Australia and New Zealand’s shared interests across a range of regional and global trade issues. For example, our continued commitment to a multilateral rules-based trading system,” Damien O’Connor
