- Additional investment of $9.1 million for catchment projects across New Zealand.
- We’re backing farmers and growers to improve land management practices and water quality to restore rivers and streams within a generation.
- Since 2020, the Government has committed more than $47 million to catchment groups.

The Government continues to invest in the work of farmers and rural communities to restore rivers and streams with an additional $9.1 million distributed across the country to improve land management practices, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor has announced.

“The future of our food and fibre export growth will depend on walking the talk when it comes to sustainability. The Government’s strategy is to work with and invest in our farmers and growers to shift the dial,” Damien O’Connor said.

Farmers across New Zealand are taking the lead to restore waterways within a generation and improve the environment in catchments where they live and farm.

“This funding is for eight catchment projects in the Waikato, Manawatū-Whanganui, Taranaki, Canterbury, West Coast, Otago, and Southland regions, and two national organisations that are assisting farmers and growers to transition to more sustainable land management practices.

“We recognise the passion that many farmers and growers have for their waterways and are backing them to work together to improve land management practices and water quality.”

Since 2020 the Government through Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has committed more than $47 million to catchment groups across the land. This includes large catchment projects that still have significant funding until 2026.

“Our investment has helped support more than 35 catchment projects, which are supporting hundreds of catchment and sub-catchment groups,” Damien O’Connor said.

“For example, Thriving Southland, which is receiving $2.4 million, now has catchment groups covering more than 90 percent of Southland more than 2,000 farmers taking part in events.

“The Rangitīkei Rivers Catchment Collective has grown from seven to 23 sub-catchment groups since we began funding it in 2021.

“Our support of the New Zealand Landcare Trust will enable the continued employment of a national catchment coordinator and six regional coordinators in Northland, Waikato, Tairāwhiti, Marlborough, West Coast, and Canterbury to support the establishment of new catchment groups.

“A further $1.2 million has been allocated to a farmer-led network supporting farmers to share knowledge about developing and implementing regenerative agriculture systems.

“Quorum Sense began an extension project in July 2020 to support farmers to achieve more environmentally and financially sustainable land use change using regenerative agriculture systems,” Damien O’Connor said.

“This funding will enable Quorum Sense to expand from a regional approach to a national network of farmer-based groups. This will lead to greater reach and impact.

“Catchment groups are helping thousands of farmers to access expertise and tools to improve their environmental and economic sustainability and wellbeing.

“We remain committed to the important work, research, and programmes being undertaken by catchment groups.”

In June, the Government announced $6 million to support seven catchment projects in the Northland, North Waikato, Whanganui, Hawke’s Bay, Tasman, and Canterbury areas. Three of the projects are in regions devastated by Cyclone Gabrielle earlier this year.

The funding supports a key sustainability component of the Government and sector’s *Fit for a Better World* roadmap that aims to restore New Zealand’s freshwater environments to a healthy state within a generation.
