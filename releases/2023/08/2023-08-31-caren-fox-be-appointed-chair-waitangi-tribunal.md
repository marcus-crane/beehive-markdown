He mahi pai, hiko ana te manawa

He mahi nui, mīharo kau ana

He mahi tōtika, he mea i tika te hangā

He mahi tūturu, ka mau tonu

He mea kīhai i kitea te otinga, i takea mai i te rangi

Ka horahia ki te motu nei

He mea whakatapu ki te ha o te ora, i tohia e ngā mana Atua, hei taonga ki te ao tangata.

E te Hōnore Kaiwhakawā Matua, Caren Fox, mana o Te Kooti Whenua Māori, ko koe nei ra taua taonga

Associate Minister of Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta today announced Māori Land Court Chief Judge Caren Fox as the new Chairperson for the Waitangi Tribunal for a period of five years.

"I want to congratulate Chief Judge Fox on her appointment as chair Waitangi Tribunal after two decades of presiding on numerous historical, urgency and kaupapa treaty claims,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“This is yet another remarkable milestone for Chief Judge Fox who will become the first wahine and wahine Māori appointed into the role by the Governor General.

“I recently acknowledged Chief Judge Fox for her in depth understanding of the Tiriti o Waitangi, her work in the judicial sector and leadership roles, all of which positions her well to undertake this new role.

“I want to thank Judge Sarah Reeves for acting as chairperson since 1 May 2023 following former chairperson Judge Isaac retiring from his role on 30 April 2023,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The Waitangi Tribunal is a standing commission of inquiry which makes recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to legislation, policies, actions or omissions of the Crown that are alleged to breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi.

“I also want to make special acknowledgement of the service of Judge Wilson Isaac who was the Chair of the Tribunal until his retirement in April earlier this year,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
