The Government has reconfirmed New Zealand’s commitment towards sustainable and inclusive trade with the release of our refreshed *Trade, Environment, and Climate Change Framework* and *Trade and Labour Framework*, says Trade and Export Growth Minister Damien O’Connor.

“Our existing frameworks were originally developed in 2001 and act as the guiding principles for our trade negotiations. In the two decades since, the world has changed significantly and our work to revise the frameworks is about keeping pace with that change.

“The refreshed *Trade, Environment, and Climate Change Framework* and *Trade and Labour Framework* sit alongside the Government’s Trade for All Agenda and build on the core pillars of our trade policy whilst addressing contemporary issues such as the climate crisis and modern slavery.

“It goes without saying that trade is key to our economic successes, but it is also a tool for good.

“These frameworks help to ensure that the trade agreements we negotiate don’t just bring prosperity for New Zealanders but that they improve standards of living, protect labour rights, enhance environmental outcomes, and take action on climate change,” Damien O’Connor said.

“Since 2017, the Government has secured seven new or upgraded Free Trade Agreements. These FTAs have not only created new opportunities for Kiwi businesses, they have also reflected New Zealand’s international leadership on sustainable and inclusive trade.

“For example, the EU and UK FTAs feature the most comprehensive trade and environment provisions we have ever negotiated, with commitments to reduce fossil fuel subsidies, combat over-fishing, and promote sustainable agriculture,” Damien O’Connor said.

These refreshed trade frameworks have been informed by public consultation and involve commitments to continued engagement with business, unions, Māori and wider communities throughout the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements.
