Carmel Sepuloni, Minister for Social Development and Employment, has activated Enhanced Taskforce Green (ETFG) in response to flooding and damaged caused by Cyclone Hale in the Tairāwhiti region. Up to $500,000 will be made available to employ job seekers to support the clean-up. We are still investigating whether other parts of the country also require support from Cyclone Hale.

 “While damage assessments are still being carried out, The Ministry of Social Development will work with local organisations and communities to ensure that assistance is provided as quickly as possible to those who need this support,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“The recent flooding has caused significant damage to the region, including to farms, homes, roads, and bridges. The ETFG programme will provide unskilled and semi-skilled jobs for local people who will support farmers, growers, and communities by completing clean-up work on their properties. It helps to return affected farms, orchards, community assets and recreational areas to the conditions they were before.

 “We activated the same funding in the Tairāwhiti and Wairoa regions in April 2022, after extensive flooding, and I know this support was greatly appreciated. We will continue to back Tairāwhiti, our rural communities, and those who have been significantly impacted by adverse weather events,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

 Farmers, growers and communities can self-register for clean-up help by contacting 0800 834434 TFG HELP, Pania King,Tairawhiti Wairoa Rural Support – East Coast Rural Support Trust.

 Local job seekers available to help with the clean-up effort can register their interest by emailing [eastcoastjobsteam@msd.govt.nz](mailto:eastcoastjobsteam@msd.govt.nz) or by contacting Work and Income on 029 2005545.
