As the Mayor of Auckland has announced a state of emergency, the Government, through NEMA, is able to step up support for those affected by flooding in Auckland.

“I’d urge people to follow the advice of authorities and check Auckland Emergency Management for the latest information. As always, the Government is assisting as much as possible.

“NEMA have been closely monitoring throughout the course of this event and we have now activated the National Coordination Centre in the Beehive to coordinate further assistance to the response.

“New Zealand Defence Force and NEMA have staff on the ground to help and further assess what more support can be given at this time.

“I’d like to acknowledge all the agencies whose staff are working hard to manage the impacts of this server weather. Stay safe and call 111 if you or anyone else is in danger”, said McAnulty.

Auckland Emergency Management has opened a Civil Defence Centre to assist those that have been displaced or need assistance following today’s severe weather. The centre is open now and is based at Saint Leonards Road School, 15 St. Leonards Road, Kelston.
