More than 200 top business people will join Communications Minister Amy Adams for New Zealand’s first Cyber Security Summit in Auckland onThursday (5 May).

Ms Adams signalled the summit at the launch of New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy in December, with a call to action for the public and private sector to come together to keep the economy cyber secure.

“Cyber-attacks can and do damage our economy. Businesses are acutely aware of the $257 million lost to cybercrime last year. As a Government, we’re serious about improving New Zealand’s cyber security and ensuring New Zealand is an open and safe place to do business,” Ms Adams says.

“The challenge cyber security presents can’t be met by the public sector alone. What’s clear is that we need a joined up response – the private and public sectors working together to share information and expertise.

“The Summit is an opportunity for chairs and chief executives from across New Zealand to continue the conversation around how as a country we tackle the threat of cybercrime, and improve our resilience and security in this increasingly digital age.”

International keynote speakers include:

- Jim Lewis from the US Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington
- Matt Thomlinson, Vice President of Security at Microsoft
- Richard Bejtlich, Chief Security Strategist at FireEye.

“Since the Government launched our refreshed Cyber Security Strategy in December, the business community’s awareness of, and interest in, cyber threats has continued to grow. Cyber security is rightly a key issue for businesses in 2016,” Ms Adams says.

“The refreshed Cyber Security Strategy signalled a step-change in how we manage the security challenges and opportunities resulting from our increased connectivity. A strong partnership between the public and private sectors sits at the heart of the strategy, and it’s essential that we work together to improve our nation’s cyber security.”

The theme of the inaugural Summit is “Keeping New Zealand’s Economy Cyber Secure”.
