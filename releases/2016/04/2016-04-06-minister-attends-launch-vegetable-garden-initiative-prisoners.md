Corrections Minister Judith Collins has today attended the launch of a new initiative; *Seedlings, Grow, Cook and Eat* that will see prisoners in self-care units growing their own seasonal vegetables and using them to cook basic nutritious meals at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.

Prisoners in self-care units are nearing the end of their sentence and do their own cooking to prepare themselves for release. Currently, the 48 prisoners in the prison’s 12 self-care units grow vegetables in gardens of varying size, with some of the produce supplementing store-purchased vegetables.

“The *Seedlings, Grow, Cook and Eat* initiative will see these gardens expanded so that prisoners learn to grow seasonal produce from seed and maintain the gardens year round. The prisoners will also construct raised gardens with in-built irrigation and maintain a compost heap.

“The prisoners will be offered cooking classes and will get recipe books which they will be able to take with them on release.

“Not only will prisoners learn useful gardening skills, this initiative will help them learn to cook meals economically. Initiatives such as this support positive life changes that can help prisoners to lead a crime-free life on release,” Ms Collins says.
