Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today opened the QRC Tai Tokerau Resort College, a new tourism and hospitality management training campus in Northland that will provide training and job opportunities for local young people in the fast-growing tourism industry.

The Government has invested an additional $1.2 million, through the Tertiary Education Commission, to the Queenstown Resort College (QRC) to support the establishment of the Tai Tokerau Northland campus in Paihia. The College will offer a Diploma in Hospitality Management and a Diploma in Adventure Tourism Management, which includes a paid work experience placement component.

“Establishing the QRC Tai Tokerau Resort College is one of the key priorities identified in the Northland Action Plan, launched in February this year, as part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme,” Mr Joyce says.

“In the last year, tourism spending in the North grew to $661 million, and the local tourism industry employs around 3000 people. However, there are opportunities to further capitalise on the region’s remarkable natural resources, talent and history and grow it further.

“This College provides a great opportunity to train young Northlanders for a career in this fast-growing industry. Graduates will be equipped with the knowledge, skills and expertise to create world-class experiences for visitors to the region. And the industry will benefit from a stream of talented young Northlanders qualified to work in their industry.”

The new College has been developed with support from NZ Māori Tourism, and has attracted investment from Chinese company Shanghai CRED, which runs Peppers Carrington Resort, at Karikari.

“The College is a good example of the collaborative focus of the Regional Growth Programme,” Mr Joyce says.

“Positive partnerships like this are helping to achieve the investment Northland needs to generate sustainable, high-paying jobs, boost the standard of living and increase business confidence and growth.”
