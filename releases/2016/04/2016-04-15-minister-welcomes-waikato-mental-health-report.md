Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s report by the Ministry of Health’s Director of Mental Health into Waikato DHB’s mental health services.

“It’s crucial that the public has confidence in the quality and safety of Waikato’s mental health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“We know there are families and patients distressed by the incidents that occurred last year – the death of a patient, patients absent without leave, and the employment of an overseas doctor who faces court charges.

“I also know that it’s been a difficult time for staff who remain dedicated to providing the best appropriate care to patients.

“Mental health and addiction services across the country are responding to increased demand. DHBs prioritise funding to meet the needs of their local community. The Government has increased mental health and addiction services funding from $1.1 billion in 2008/09 to over $1.4 billion for 2015/16.”

In July 2015, the Director of Mental Health, Dr John Crawshaw, was asked to conduct a formal inspection of Waikato DHB’s mental health services using his legislative powers under Section 99 of the Mental Health Act.

“While the report took longer than expected, it’s been a thorough and complex process which involved interviews with over 300 people and analysis of a large number of DHB documents,” says Dr Coleman.

“The service was found to be well managed and led, with a good standard of care provided, however, a number of recommendations have been made to improve the DHB’s mental health services.

“The report highlights the need to address staff shortages and to ensure the necessary clinical and system changes towards a more integrated, patient-centred model of care are properly led and managed. The service needs to be supported through this process, and needs to engage with partners and the wider community.

“Waikato DHB has been implementing its strategic plan for mental health services, and the DHB has already made progress on a number of areas highlighted in the report.

“It’s my expectation that the DHB continues to improve its mental health services to deliver high quality care to the people of Waikato.”

The DHB appointed an Executive Director of Mental Health Services in February. Waikato DHB is also strengthening its clinical governance, and beginning a process of greater community engagement.

The service will be required to regularly report back to the DHB Board and to the Director of Mental Health.

The DHB is also working with the Ministry of Health to develop a business case for a new facility to replace the Henry Rongomau Bennett Centre.
