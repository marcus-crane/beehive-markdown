Small business owners are now able to quickly and easily create employment agreements online with the launch of a refreshed Employment Agreement Builder tool, Minister for Small Business Craig Foss says.

“Hiring an employee can be stressful for a small business but, with the updated Employment Agreement Builder, we’re making the process easy. This means less time working on contracts and more time working on your business,” Mr Foss says.

“Using the Employment Agreement Builder, you can quickly create an agreement on your mobile, tablet or PC tailored to your business and to each person you employ.

“In New Zealand a written employment agreement is compulsory no matter who you employ, what they do, or for how long. It means both you and your employees know where you stand from the beginning and, if there is a disagreement, all parties have rights and protection under the law.

“A good employment agreement is the foundation of a good employment relationship.”

Since it was first launched in 2010, the Employment Agreement Builder has proven popular with employers. The tool has been refreshed by Business.govt.nz, part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, to enable employers to easily identify what clauses are mandatory, what clauses are voluntary and when they are appropriate to use. It will also help employers comply with recent employment law changes.

“This project demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improving services to small businesses through user-friendly and simplified tools that help meet their compliance obligations,” Mr Foss says.
