Education Minister Hekia Parata today planted poppies and white crosses with children at a Palmerston North early learning centre to commemorate New Zealanders who served in World War One, as part of the Fields of Remembrance project.

“I was delighted to join Secret Garden Childcare in establishing their Field of Remembrance, singing the national anthem and exploring a light armoured vehicle,” says Ms Parata.

“Following the success of the Fields of Remembrance project in schools last year, it’s great that early learning services are now being given the same opportunity to honour our wartime contributions as schools did last year.

“World War One is one of the most significant events in New Zealand history. It’s important that our youngest New Zealanders have the opportunity to learn of the sacrifice of the heroes and heroines who fought and died in the war.”

As part of a partnership between the Ministry of Education and the Fields of Remembrance Trust, around 4,600 early learning services and kōhanga reo are being offered support to run commemorative activities and have received kits which include three small cross.

The crosses represent Sergeant Dick Travis, New Zealand’s most decorated soldier killed in action in July 1918; Staff Nurse Nona Hildyard, killed on 23 October 1915 on-board the Marquette which was hit by a German torpedo; and Second Lieutenant Thomas Grace, killed in action on 8 August 1915 at Chunuk Bair.

“Events like today’s commemorative service are a good way to bring communities together to learn about the sacrifice of their forebears and the part the war played in establishing New Zealanders’ sense of identity,” says Ms Parata.
