Corrections Minister Judith Collins welcomed 37 new Corrections Officers and Offender Employment Instructors who graduated today from their 12 month Corrections Officer Development Pathway programme.

“The role of a Corrections Officer is challenging. Being a role model and shaping the lives of some of society’s most difficult members is not one to be taken lightly,” says Ms Collins.

The new staff will be based at prisons in Northland, Hawke’s Bay, Whanganui, Manawatu, Christchurch and Otago.

Among the new recruits was 33 year old Dale Clark, of Christchurch Men’s Prison, who was presented the Minister’s Excellence Award, established by Minister Collins seven years ago.

The Minister congratulated Dale, saying he had been singled out for this honour because he stood out from day one. 

“Dale won the praise of his managers who said he had a maturity beyond his years and an easy confidence when dealing with prisoners and staff. His leadership, professionalism and excellence were recognised today.

“Dale said he wanted to; keep the community safer, make a positive change in people’s lives, be a role model, be challenged every day and have a job his kids could be proud of.

“We are fortunate that Corrections ticked all the boxes on his list and very pleased he chose a career at Corrections,” says Ms Collins.
