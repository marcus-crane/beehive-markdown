The Minister for Pacific Peoples, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, has expressed his condolences to the family of Pacific business leader Rob Neru, who died on Friday.

Mr Neru was the CEO of the Pacific Business Trust.  He collapsed and died at work on Friday.

“Rob was passionate about the work of the Trust and dedicated to helping more pacific people in to business.  His drive and warmth will be sadly missed,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Mr Neru was 46.

“Before he started working with the Trust, had had 25 years owning and operating businesses in a variety of industries.”

“My sympathies to his wife Marianne, his children Andrew, Kimberly, Jessica, Michael and Zoe and all his extended family.  My thoughts are with you,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
