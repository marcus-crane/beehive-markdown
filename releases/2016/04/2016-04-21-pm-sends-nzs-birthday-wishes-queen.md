Prime Minister John Key has written to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on behalf of the New Zealand government to mark her 90th birthday.

“Like many New Zealanders, I greatly admire Queen Elizabeth’s lifetime of dedicated service and leadership,” Mr Key says. 

“Queen Elizabeth is a beloved figure here and we value her role as Queen of New Zealand. I am sure New Zealanders will join with me in wishing her a very Happy Birthday.”

The Queen’s birthday will be celebrated here on Monday 6 June.

New Zealand’s gift will be announced closer to that date.
