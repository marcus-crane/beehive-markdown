A new, two-storey classroom block will be built as part of a $4.2 million upgrade for Papatoetoe Central School in South Auckland, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The new block will have eight learning spaces and will replace six older classrooms at the school. It will also provide two additional classrooms, to accommodate expected roll growth,” says Ms Kaye.

Papatoetoe Central School is one of 12 schools in New Zealand that are over 150 years old.

“The school is an established part of the local community and continues to evolve over time. It was entirely rebuilt in the 1980s, and today has a diverse student population.

“This latest investment will ensure the school has enough room for more students, and its facilities reflect modern approaches to learning.

“All of the new learning spaces will support an innovative learning environment. This means they will be flexible, to support different ways of teaching and learning, and they will have high standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation. They will also feature the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“The new block’s two-storey design will ensure the school can retain and continue to make the most of outdoor learning and recreational areas.

“Yesterday I announced a $4 million upgrade for Bayswater School on Auckland’s North Shore, so today’s announcement is another step in the ongoing upgrade and expansion of schools across Auckland.

“Last July, I confirmed that over 230 new roll-growth classrooms and over 50 replacement classrooms would be delivered in the city over 18 months.

“The Government is committed to modernising school facilities and getting ahead of demand, as population growth from urban intensification and greenfield developments occurs in many areas of our largest city.”

Construction work at Papatoetoe Central School is expected to begin in July, and be completed by April 2017.

**Notes**

**About Papatoetoe Central School**

Papatoetoe Central School is a contributing primary school (years 1 to 6). Its roll is projected to increase to 750 by 2017.

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
