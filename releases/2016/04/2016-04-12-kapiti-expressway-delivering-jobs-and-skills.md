Young people in Kapiti are being given more employment and qualification opportunities thanks to the Government’s MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway project, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley.

Subcontractor Dellta Contractors Ltd has been working closely with Work and Income staff to provide jobs and training on the expressway project.

Eight young men have been employed on the expressway project under the partnership to date, with more to be signed up over the next year.

“This is a major infrastructure project for the Wellington region. It will form part of a transport corridor that will help the entire region to grow and prosper. It’s great that it’s able to use this project as an opportunity for young people to gain meaningful employment and skills,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Government is investing in critical infrastructure at a record pace, and through partnerships like this we are also investing in our communities.”

Under the partnership, Work and Income advertises the positions, screen applicants and recommend the best candidates. The contractor then interviews the candidates and offers suitable applicants a job and training at precast yards and on bridge construction sites.

“This partnership is working to provide jobs and training for young people considered to be at risk of becoming long-term beneficiaries and will position them well for future employment opportunities,” Mrs Tolley says.

“We know that young people who go onto a benefit before they turn 20 have some of the highest lifetime costs and spend the longest on welfare. We need government, the community and businesses to invest in supporting them to live independent, successful lives.”

The MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway is part of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance. The expressway will improve safety, reduce travel times and reduce congestion on local roads. It is designed to provide a transport lifeline after natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes.
