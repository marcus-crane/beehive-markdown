New Zealand’s economy will get a boost of more than $50 million when an additional 10,000 Chinese visitors holiday in Queenstown in 2018, says Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key. 

Each year, Amway China rewards its top sales people with an all-expenses paid international trip as part of the company’s sales incentive scheme. 

Thanks to a competitive business bid led by Tourism New Zealand, Amway’s top sales people will enjoy five days of New Zealand’s famous tourism experiences and hospitality in Queenstown. 

They will arrive in groups of 500 during the shoulder and off-peak tourism season, and will be spread over four months in autumn 2018.  

The Prime Minister confirmed the announcement during his visit to Shanghai, China. 

“This is by far the biggest incentive business New Zealand has ever won, and it sends a strong message that New Zealand is a serious contender in the global incentive market,” says Mr Key.

“It will provide a welcome $50 million boost to the economy, plus additional value from any personal spending by each delegate and the potential for staff to return in future, bringing family and friends. 

“China is now our second-largest and fasting growing tourism market, contributing nearly $1.7 billion to the economy in 2015. And Chinese tourists have the highest daily spend of any of our visitors.   

“In 2013, the Government committed an additional $34 million over four years for the purpose of securing international business events and incentives like this one because of the value they bring to our economy.

“This single win demonstrates why this investment was so important,” says Mr Key.

“I congratulate Tourism New Zealand, Destination Queenstown, Queenstown Lakes District Council, Air New Zealand and Immigration New Zealand on their successful pitch.”
