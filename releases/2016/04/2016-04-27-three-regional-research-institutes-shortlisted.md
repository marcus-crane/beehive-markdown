Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced that three proposals to establish new Regional Research Institutes (RRIs) have been shortlisted and that applicants will now enter the business case development stage of the selection process.

Regional Research Institutes are to be new research centres developed in areas outside of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch that help build research and development intensity and lift innovation in key regional industries.

“Our regional economies have unique resources and strengths. The Regional Research Institutes initiative looks to harness these and build on economic potential by establishing independent and industry-focused R&D facilities,” Mr Joyce says.

A total of 24 proposals, from 16 different locations, were received for consideration.

“There were a number of credible and exciting proposals submitted, and the three shortlisted represent those considered at this stage to have presented the best plans for delivering the strongest growth in business R&D and innovation in regional areas,“ Mr Joyce says.

“For New Zealand to achieve its economic potential, we need all our regions to thrive. Regional growth is a priority for the Government and this initiative supports the Business Growth Agenda and its goal to increase business R&D expenditure to 1 per cent of GDP.”

The three shortlisted proposals are:

- New Zealand Institute of Viticulture and Oenology, Marlborough, led by the New Zealand Winegrowers – research to support the growth and continuing success of the New Zealand wine industry.

<!--THE END-->

- Centre for Space Science Technology, Central Otago, led by Bodeker Scientific – research allowing the use of space-based measurements and unique to New Zealand satellite imagery to develop solutions tailored to regions and key sectors, for example, in water resource management and regional planning.

<!--THE END-->

- Earth+Vantage, Southland, led by Venture Southland – research using real time satellite and ground-based data to lift primary industry productivity across New Zealand, in areas such as precision farming, forestry and marine management.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will work with the three applicants on a more detailed analysis of their proposals and determine the preferred options that deliver the greatest value from the potential institutes. Once this process is complete, Cabinet will make its final decision on which new institutes will be established.

The development of privately-led regional research institutes was announced as part of Budget 2015, with funding for up to $25 million over three years to support the initiative. Proposals were invited from groups of businesses, researchers and private investors in November 2015.

“MBIE will also contact those applicants who were not successful in proceeding to the next stage at this time and provide evaluation feedback for them to consider when building on their initial concepts and for applying to any future funding rounds,” says Mr Joyce.

“The high level of interest from all applicants illustrates that there is plenty of potential for further regional growth in research and development.”
