Bayswater School on Auckland’s North Shore will get six new learning spaces as part of a $4 million upgrade, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This project includes the construction of a new, four-classroom block, as well as a satellite unit of Wilson Special School, comprising two learning spaces,” says Ms Kaye.

The upgrade will allow Bayswater School to cater for growing numbers of students.

“The North Shore is one of many parts of Auckland experiencing population growth driven by urban intensification. Demographic projections show that Bayswater School will benefit from two additional classrooms to accommodate expected roll growth.

“The other teaching spaces in the new four-classroom block will replace two existing, ageing classrooms, which will be demolished to make way for the new block.

“All of the new learning spaces will support an innovative learning environment. This means they will be flexible, to support different ways of teaching and learning, and they will have high standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation. They will also feature the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“Temporary classrooms are onsite at Bayswater School to enable learning to continue with minimal disruption while the upgrade is underway.”

Construction of the new learning spaces is expected to begin in June, and be completed later this year.

“Today’s announcement is another step in the ongoing upgrade and expansion of schools across Auckland.

“Last July, I confirmed that over 230 new roll-growth classrooms and over 50 replacement classrooms would be delivered in the city over 18 months.

“The Government is committed to getting ahead of demand in our biggest city by building new schools and new classrooms. We’ve also announced a number of major school redevelopments, including Takapuna Grammar School on the North Shore, where I unveiled a plaque last Tuesday to mark the start of a $26 million redevelopment.”

**Notes**

**About Bayswater School**

Bayswater School is a contributing primary school (years 1 to 6) and part of a Community of Learning with Takapuna Grammar School. It has a current roll of 213, and the additional classrooms will allow the roll to grow to 260.

**About Wilson School**

Wilson School is a state school which welcomes students with a wide range of disabilities and special learning needs. It has a base school in Takapuna and also provides a number of satellite classes in mainstream schools.

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
