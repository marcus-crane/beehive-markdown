Prime Minister John Key has today announced the establishment of a new ministerial portfolio, supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration, which replaces the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery portfolio.

“The rebuild of Canterbury is one of the most ambitious undertakings in New Zealand’s history, and supporting the rebuild remains of one of National’s main priorities,” says Mr Key. 

“The passing of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act and the disestablishment of CERA marks a new phase in the Canterbury rebuild. 

“The Government is moving more towards a supporting role and the change in portfolio reflects that,” says Mr Key. 

Gerry Brownlee will become Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration and Nicky Wagner will become Associate Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration, effective from 11 April 2016.
