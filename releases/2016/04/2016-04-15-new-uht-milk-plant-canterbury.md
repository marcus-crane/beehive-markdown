The official opening of Westland Milk Products’ new UHT plant in Rolleston is a significant boost for the Canterbury dairy industry and is a sign of the continuing shift to value-added products, says Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew. 

“It is important to celebrate good news stories such as this new UHT facility, which combined with the strong medium to long-term outlook for the sector, gives dairy farmers confidence that the period of low prices they are currently experiencing is only temporary,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The new plant can process 14,000 litres of milk per hour and has been constructed by Westland Milk Products, New Zealand’s second biggest dairy cooperative and third biggest dairy company overall.

“Liquid UHT milk is a growing global market with huge opportunities, with exports to New Zealand’s top Asian trading partners doubling between 2013 and 2015.

“Investments such as these help to deliver more jobs and add value and diversity to New Zealand’s dairy exports.  I’d like to congratulate Westland for reaching this milestone,” says Mrs Goodhew.
