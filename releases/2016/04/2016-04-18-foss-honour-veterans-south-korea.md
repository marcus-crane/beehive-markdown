Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss will travel to South Korea tomorrow to mark the 65th anniversary of the Battle of Gapyeong.

The 16th Field Regiment of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery played a significant role in defeating the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army during the Battle of Gapyeong on 24 April 1951.  The Regiment was awarded the Republic of Korea’s Presidential Citation.

“It is a privilege to be going to Korea for this commemoration, and attending an Anzac service in Seoul the following day makes it extra special. No matter where or when our military personnel served, they deserve to be honoured,” Mr Foss says.

“While in Korea I will pay my respects to our fallen soldiers buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan and visit New Zealand Defence Force personnel deployed to the United Nations-controlled Demilitarised Zone (DMZ).

“It will be my honour to present five New Zealand General Service Medals — Korea, and two New Zealand Operational Service Medals to military personnel finishing their deployment to the DMZ.”

Mr Foss will also meet his South Korean counterpart, Minister of Patriots and Veterans’ Affairs Sungchoon Park, and in his role as Minister for Small Business, the Korean branch of the International Council for Small Business.
