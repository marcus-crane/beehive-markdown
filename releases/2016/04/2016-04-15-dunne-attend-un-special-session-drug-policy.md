Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne is travelling to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS), which takes place over 19-21 April.

“Major themes of the UNGASS meeting are likely to include the death penalty, new psychoactive substances and the impact of technology,” says Mr Dunne.

Along with a number of other health ministers and heads of state from across the globe, Mr Dunne will participate in panels and policy roundtable events ranging over human rights, international cooperation and evidence-based policy.

“The Conference provides an excellent opportunity to discuss drug policy at a global level. New Zealand is one of a number of countries that have in recent years moved towards treating drug use as a health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue. While we still have work to do here in New Zealand, it is my view that we are making good progress in how we address wider drug-harm issues.

“At an international level, we often share common problems but frequently differ in our solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all approach as geographical, social and cultural features all play a role, but UNGASS nonetheless represents an outstanding opportunity to discuss and share ideas, views and approaches”, Mr Dunne said.
