Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says it’s been another successful yachting season with 653 yachts visiting New Zealand.

“I’m pleased Customs’ joint initiatives with the marine industry are helping attract yachts to our shores and allowing them to remain here for longer.

“It’s great to have these yachts arriving in New Zealand to enjoy our beautiful natural environment, renowned hospitality and marine services, and maximise on our tax treatment of overseas yachts.

“Customs has a range of maritime patrols organised to ensure the high rates of compliance seen during summer’s arrivals are mirrored during departures. Customs’ maritime patrols offer assistance and keep watch on any suspicious illegal activity as well as helping to keep yachts safe.      

“It’s good to see Customs working so closely with partner agencies to keep our country, people and visitors safe” Ms Wagner says.
