Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has congratulated the recipients of this year’s Prime Minister’s Sport Scholarships.

“The Prime Minister’s Sport Scholarships provide financial assistance to high performance athletes, coaches, officials and support members as they juggle the demands of sport and study,” says Dr Coleman.

“Each year the Government invests around $4.25 million in the programme which is managed through High Performance Sport New Zealand. 

“The scholarships recognise the hard work and sacrifice made by athletes, coaches, officials and support personnel. We want to help them to ensure they can combine both their sporting and academic aspirations.”

There are 493 recipients this year. 346 have been awarded to athletes, 17 to retiring athletes, 23 to coaches, 50 to officials, and 57 to support personnel. 

Three ceremonies are being held across the country to acknowledge the scholarship recipients. Dr Coleman tonight presented around 100 certificates to recipients at the Don Rowlands Centre at Lake Karapiro, Cambridge. 

The 2016 scholarship recipients include: 

- 2014 Women’s Single Sculls World Champion, Emma Twigg, who has completed a Bachelor of Communication Studies and an International Masters in Management, Law and Humanities in Sport through FIFA;
- Four time Olympian, Tour de France and Giro de Italia stage winner, Julian Dean, who is completing postgraduate studies in Sport Management;
- Black Sticks Women’s Hockey Goalkeeper, Sally Rutherford, who has completed a PhD in Physiology and Bioengineering;

- International Equestrian Eventing Judge, Stuart Bishell, whose goal is to become a Championship Judge at the World Games, Olympic Games, and 4 star events.

Recipients agree to a study plan in conjunction with High Performance Sport New Zealand and can apply for up to $10,000 a year to cover academic fees. Support can also be provided to cover some study-related costs.
