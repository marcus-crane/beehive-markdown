Primary Industries Nathan Guy has concluded a successful trip to China as part of a delegation led by Prime Minister John Key with Trade Minister Todd McClay and New Zealand businesses.

“This visit has reinforced the strong and growing agricultural ties between our countries. Not only is China our biggest export market, there is now a depth of two-way investment and cooperation between our primary industry sectors,” says Mr Guy.

“We have made great progress on an updated meat protocol that includes chilled meat access which will be significant for exporters and farmers. This will help put premium chilled meat cuts on the tables of high end restaurants.

“A new Halal Arrangement will recognise New Zealand’s halal standards and will provide our producers with a first mover advantage in this culturally diverse market that takes 33 percent of our total halal certified exports.

“In Beijing I signed an Agricultural Growth Partnership with Chinese Agriculture Minister Han. This partnership is about sharing New Zealand’s experience and opening doors for further commercial opportunities in areas such as livestock technology, animal health, and disease control,” says Mr Guy.

While in China, Mr Guy also attended several events highlighting progress in Chinese-New Zealand agricultural business partnerships.

“Fonterra held a ceremony to celebrate their partnership with Beingmate through an environmental cooperation project and the development of the Anmum brand in China.

“Alliance has announced that it now has exclusivity of supply for branded products into a number of high-end Chinese hotels, supermarkets and restaurants through its long-term partner in Heilongjiang Province, Grand Farm Meats.

“Zespri celebrated the start of the new kiwifruit season in China and their new status as importer of record in China. They have also partnered with two major fruit producers in Shaanxi Province – the world’s largest kiwifruit producing region.

“A forum with online platform Alibaba founder Jack Ma highlighted real opportunities for our businesses in China. He spoke about New Zealand’s image of sustainability and food safety, and outlined the potential for New Zealand to exploit growth across China’s burgeoning e-commerce platforms.

Mr Guy finished the trip by leading a New Zealand dairy delegation to the World Dairy Expo in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province where he spoke to 500 international delegates.

“Current dairy prices are challenging for farmers all around the world. The Expo highlighted an opportunity for greater cooperation between dairy industries so we are better placed to react to changes in market demands.”
