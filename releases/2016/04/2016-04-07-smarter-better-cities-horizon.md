Fewer traffic jams, better water quality, and safer streets are just a few things we can look forward to thanks to work Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is doing with councils, Land Information Minister Louise Upston said today.

“LINZ is currently working with Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington councils on the Smart Cities Programme to better understand – and ultimately improve – how our cities function,” says Ms Upston.

“In Auckland, this includes installing sensors to monitor water quality in the Wynyard Quarter. If water quality drops, the Council will know within a matter of hours and can – among other things – let people know not to swim there.

“Meanwhile, Christchurch City Council is trialling an IT platform that all types of sensor can plug into – laying the foundation for more Smart Cities work in the future.”

In the capital, Wellington City Council (WCC) is using CCTV and new sensors to better monitor traffic and pedestrian flow.

“Wellington is facing increasing issues with traffic congestion. The improved data gathered through this trial will inform future investment decisions and one day make this problem a thing of the past.”

“Smart sensor technology is already in use overseas and it’s great to see it being trialled here.

“Combining this technology with the geographic information that we already have available creates a myriad of opportunities to enhance and improve life in our cities,” Ms Upston says.
