Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has today arrived in Dubai following his second visit to NZ Defence Force (NZDF) troops training members of the Iraqi Security Forces at Camp Taji, near Baghdad.

Mr Brownlee was accompanied on his visit by Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little, Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Mark Mitchell, and Chief of the Defence Force Lt Gen Tim Keating.

“Task Group Taji has trained over 4000 Iraqi troops since being deployed alongside Australian troops in April 2015, considerably improving the Iraqi Security Forces’ chances of removing D’aesh from their country,” Mr Brownlee says.

“NZDF’s deployment in Iraq is part of a multi-country Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programme across five sites, which have trained around 19,000 members of the Iraqi Security Forces since November 2014.

“I thought it was important to offer the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to see Task Group Taji in action for himself, and for Mr Mitchell, as the relevant select committee chair, to have first-hand experience of the mission.

“I’m very pleased Mr Little accepted the invitation.

“As I observed in June last year, Task Group Taji is an extremely professional operation providing a range of training to the Iraqi Security Forces.

“This training includes basic weapons handling, counter IED, combat first aid, obstacle breaching techniques, planning for combat operations, the laws of armed conflict and human rights.

“It was pleasing to hear from senior Iraqi commanders that Task Group Taji-trained troops have on a number of occasions captured and held towns and territory from D'aesh using their newly attained skills.

“These commanders speak highly of the training and intend to cycle units back through Taji for further training when possible.

“The training is also highly appreciated by the Iraqi Government, a point reinforced by Iraqi Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi when I, and Mr Little, met with him on Tuesday,” Mr Brownlee says.
