Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says proposed driver licensing changes will improve the system while maintaining high safety standards.

The Driver Licensing Review discussion document, released by the Ministry of Transport today, proposes moving the driver licence renewal process online and streamlining heavy vehicle and specialist driving endorsements.

“A lot has changed since the current driver licensing system was introduced in 1999.  While fundamental elements of the system such as the photo driver licence and minimum licensing age are not part of this review, there are a number of opportunities to modernise processes and improve efficiency,” Mr Foss says.

“New Zealanders expect government services to be available online.  A digital licence renewals process will save drivers, businesses and government time and money.”

Last year there were about 238,000 licence applications and 294,000 renewals.

Mr Foss says proposed changes to heavy vehicle licences aim to improve the availability of properly trained heavy vehicle drivers without compromising safety.

“This proposal is about balancing the heavy vehicle industry’s need for more drivers with government and road users’ high safety expectations.  I urge anyone in the heavy vehicle sector to consider the options and make a submission,” Mr Foss says.

“The discussion document also looks at reducing the frequency of eyesight testing.  This option will also make it easier for New Zealanders to complete licensing transactions online.”

Submissions close 2 June 2016. The discussion document and submission form are available at: [http://www.transport.govt.nz/dlr](http://www.transport.govt.nz/dlr)
