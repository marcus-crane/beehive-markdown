The successful release of three young Coromandel Brown Kiwi on Motutapu Island off Auckland yesterday is testament to the power of working together, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

"Two female kiwi and one male – who was renamed Ropata in honour of renowned conservationist Rob Fenwick – were brought to Motutapu from Rotoroa Island in double-hulled and masted waka hourua," Ms Barry says.

"This release is the result of dedicated work by many different groups pulling together to save a vulnerable species – only around 1700 Coromandel brown kiwi remain. This collaboration is a great example of what we need to do to save our kiwi from extinction in the wild."

A partnership between the Department of Conservation, Motutapu Restoration Trust, Rotoroa Island Trust, Auckland Zoo, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, Ngāti Paoa, Ngāti Tamaterā and the Coromandel Kiwi Collective made the translocation possible.

"Three eggs were collected in Te Mata by the Thames Coast Kiwi Care group, one of the volunteer projects which make up the Coromandel Kiwi Collective," Ms Barry says.

The eggs were incubated and hatched at Auckland Zoo and the chicks then taken to Rotoroa Island as part of Operation Nest Egg.

"Now teenagers in kiwi terms, aged between three and five months, they’re ready for release. Through kiwi crèche programmes like this one chicks can be raised into adulthood free from the risk of introduced predators and used to bolster populations in places like Motutapu."

The three kiwi take the number of kiwi on Motutapu to 25, closer to the 40 birds needed for a sustainable population.

"That we’re able to use Motutapu as a home for vulnerable species is a tribute to the work of the island’s Restoration Trust and local iwi, who have worked together to eradicate pests like cats, possums and hedgehogs," Ms Barry says.

"This was a fitting way to celebrate the Motutapu Restoration Trusts’ 21st birthday. I also commend local iwi Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki for using their waka to transport the birds – a stunning symbol of their dedication to these precious taonga.”

"As part of Budget 2015 we have committed to reversing the 2 per cent annual decline of wild kiwi, and seeing the spirit and commitment of the groups involved in this project I have no doubt we will succeed."
