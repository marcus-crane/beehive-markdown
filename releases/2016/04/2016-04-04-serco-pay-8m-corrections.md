Corrections is to receive $8 million from Serco to cover the costs of Corrections Stepping-In last July to manage Mt Eden Corrections Facility, as well as settling performance notices, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

“An agreement with Serco has also been reached that effectively narrows down the contractual arrangements with Serco to a labour supply agreement with other transition services for the balance of the contract through to 31 March 2017,” Ms Collins says.

Corrections will continue to manage Mt Eden Corrections Facility with Serco providing personnel at cost until the end of the contract. Serco will make no profit from the arrangement. 

“This is a pleasing outcome as it both recovers costs and gives more certainty over the future management of the prison.”

In July 2015, Corrections Chief Executive Ray Smith invoked the Step-In clause in the contract, effectively giving management of the prison to Corrections.

In December 2015, Mr Smith announced that he had invoked a break point clause which would effectively end the contract on 31 March 2017.

“The agreement reached provides for a smooth transition until Serco’s involvement with the prison ends on 31 March 2017,” Ms Collins says.

 “Corrections will continue to run the prison from that time. The longer term management structure will be determined by the government at a later date following advice from Corrections.

“The decisions outlined above are separate from the Chief Inspector of Corrections’ report into Serco management of MECF which is currently before the courts and therefore can’t be commented upon at this time,” Ms Collins says.
