Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced that the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Board is now the official administrator of the 28th (Māori) Battalion’s name, emblem and trademark.

This role was previously the responsibility of the 28th (Māori) Battalion Association, which held a National Commemorative Ceremony in 2012 to mark its closure.

Ms Parata, who chairs the Board, says the Association saw the Board as the natural successor to protect the name and emblem of the 28th (Māori) Battalion.

“Between 1941 and 1945 the men of 28th (Māori) Battalion forged an outstanding reputation on the battlefields of Greece, Crete, North Africa and Italy. Their bravery and sacrifice earned them a special place in New Zealand’s history and the Board takes its role as kaitiaki very seriously.

“We will ensure that the legacy of the 28th (Māori) Battalion endures and continues to inspire future generations,” says Ms Parata.

The signing of the Deed of Assignment of Trade Mark and Authorisation of Successor makes the Board responsible for protecting the name, references and use of the 28th (Māori) Battalion’s emblem under the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981.
