Corrections Minister Judith Collins has today visited Upper Hutt Community Corrections to view safety and security enhancements designed to keep frontline Corrections staff safe while doing their job.

“Safety and security features were demonstrated at Upper Hutt Community Corrections, which had a $4.68 million refurbishment last year that included upgrading the site’s security and technology.

“As well as controlled entry, the reception counter is anti-roll to prevent people from jumping over it, interview rooms are glazed to improve visibility, have duress alarms and two points of exit.

“There’s an increased line of sight throughout the building, and the front doors can be locked from several places in the building to provide controlled access.  Staff also have access to portable duress alarms for use in the building.

“Sixteen CCTV cameras monitor activity throughout the building and its entrances.  All of these features are integrated to improve safety while maintaining an environment that is conducive to working with cases.

“Frontline staff based in the community are able to activate an app on their smartphones that sends key details back to Corrections to act on if they feel unsafe during a visit to an offender’s house,” Ms Collins says.

The safety features available at Upper Hutt have also been implemented at many other Community Corrections locations as part of an ongoing national upgrade programme. More than half of the Community Corrections sites across the country are being upgraded by early 2019 to improve safety, security and facilities.

“The demonstration also included Corrections officers from Rimutaka Prison wearing personalised stab resistant body armour

“All Corrections officers are issued with personalised stab resistant body armour. Pepper spray, slash resistant gloves, tactical communications and exit training have all been introduced to prisons in recent years.

“Three prisons have introduced Site Emergency Response Teams to support staff safety by enhancing the initial response to prison incidents, and other prisons are also introducing the teams.

“With the suite of safety and security enhancements available, I am confident Corrections is taking staff and public safety seriously,” says Ms Collins.
