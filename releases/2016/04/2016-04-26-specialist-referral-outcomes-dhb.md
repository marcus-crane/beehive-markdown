Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the first release of preliminary DHB data from the National Patient Flow project.

“The National Patient Flow project will help the sector to better understand the outcomes of referrals to hospital specialists,” says Dr Coleman.

“The snapshot of national data published last month has been updated as more data has become available, and it now includes a breakdown by DHB.

“Between 1 July and 30 September 2015 there were 158,214 referrals for a First Specialist Assessment. 87 per cent (138,314) of referrals were accepted, and 5 per cent (7,229) were declined as they did not meet the threshold.

“As the data builds we expect the number of patients sent back to their GP for care as they did not meet the threshold, may rise to around 10 to 15 per cent.

“Patients will be interested to know what is happening in their DHB - it’s important to provide transparency. For DHBs and primary care, this data will help them to further improve services.

“As a result of implementing the National Patient Flow project, DHBs are already making improvements to their referral management systems, administration processes, and communications with patients.”

In 2014/15 there were 542,645 surgical and medical First Specialist Assessments carried out across the country. This is compared to 432,048 in 2008/2009. That’s an increase of 26 per cent (110,597).

DHBs adjust threshold levels for publicly funded surgery from year to year, and have always done so. DHBs determine thresholds for their communities using national clinical prioritisation tools to ensure access is fair and equitable.

The project is being supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year, taking the health budget to a record $15.9 billion.
