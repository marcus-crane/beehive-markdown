Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today acknowledged World Intellectual Property Day, an international initiative celebrating the role intellectual property plays in fostering human innovation and creativity.

“In our increasingly knowledge-driven economy, intellectual property is of growing importance to New Zealand businesses,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Every year around 30,000 trade mark, patent, design and plant variety rights applications are made by individuals and businesses to the Intellectual Property Office (IPONZ).”

“I want to ensure New Zealanders continue to benefit from their creativity and innovation with a robust intellectual property regime that supports the development of new and forward thinking products and services.”

The Creative Sector Study, led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, is currently underway to gain a better understanding of how the creative sector interacts with the copyright and designs regimes in the context of a rapidly changing technological landscape.

“The study is part of a broader government work programme to ensure that different regulatory systems, such as intellectual property and communications regulation, work together to promote economic growth in our constantly evolving digital economy,” says Mr Goldsmith.
