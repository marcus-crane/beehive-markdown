Associate Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration, Nicky Wagner congratulates CERA, the Christchurch City Council and the Matapopore Charitable Trust who jointly won the Strategic Planning and Guidance best practice award from the New Zealand Planning Institute.

The award acknowledged the Street and Spaces Design Guide, a jointly written benchmark document in terms of the type of information it combines and the format in which the information is presented for urban regeneration.

“It is pleasing to see CERA, the Council and the Matapopore Charitable Trust being acknowledged for their hard work and producing excellent results.”

“There was no guidebook on how to solve some of these very difficult problems after the earthquakes in collaboration with multiple organisations.

“To be recognised for simplifying complex concepts into usable information to such a high standard is something that CERA should be proud of. It is a testament to the quality of the staff working there.

“The guide not only contributes to the recovery of Christchurch but also the long term focus of building the city’s economic and social vigour.

“I wish all the best to the staff who were involved with the guide and hope they continue to make a positive contribution to the recovery of Christchurch,” Ms Wagner says.
