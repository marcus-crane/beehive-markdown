Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for Turkey, where he will be New Zealand’s official representative at Gallipoli for this year’s Anzac Day commemorations.

“As we mark the centenary of the first Anzac Day, it is important we remember and reflect on the enormous sacrifices Australia and New Zealand made at Gallipoli and across other battlefields in the First World War,” Mr Brownlee says.

Gallipoli was the first major combat role for New Zealand forces in the First World War. It was where 2,779 New Zealanders were killed, and a further 4,852 were wounded – a precursor to the horrific losses suffered over the course of the coming four years.

“At these commemorations we’ll be honouring their sacrifice, and remembering all the men and women who have fought and lost their lives in subsequent conflicts,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Brownlee will attend a number of commemorative services on the Gallipoli Peninsula, including the Dawn Service and the New Zealand Service at Chunuk Bair.

“We recognise the profound historical significance of Anzac Day for New Zealand, Australia, and for the people of Turkey.

“New Zealand and Turkey share a strong relationship built on our shared history at Gallipoli, and I wish to thank our Turkish hosts for undertaking the enormous task of holding these commemorations year after year.

“I look forward to sharing this once-in-a-lifetime experience with other New Zealanders as we pay tribute to the courage, sacrifice, and loss of all those who have served our country,” Mr Brownlee says.
