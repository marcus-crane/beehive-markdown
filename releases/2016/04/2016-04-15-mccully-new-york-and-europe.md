Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York this weekend for UN Security Council related meetings, and will then travel to the UK, Germany and France.

Minister McCully will participate in a UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East region on Monday 18 April and will undertake a series of related bilateral meetings in New York.

In London Minister McCully will be meeting with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and will be attending a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group.  Minister McCully will also travel to Berlin to meet German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and will continue on to Paris for meetings in support of New Zealand’s engagement in the UN Security Council.

“My meetings in the UK, Germany and France are an opportunity to discuss how New Zealand can work with our European partners on issues of common interest on the UN Security council agenda,” Mr McCully says.

“I will also be using my time in Europe to support Helen Clark’s candidacy for UN Secretary-General, and to discuss the New Zealand/ EU Free Trade Agreement.”

In France, the Minister will represent New Zealand at centenary commemorative services in Longueval in the Somme.

“New Zealand has a long history with Europe, and our First World War centenary commemorations underline this shared history, and our shared values. I welcome the opportunity to pay my respects in this centenary year of the Battle of the Somme,” Mr McCully says.
