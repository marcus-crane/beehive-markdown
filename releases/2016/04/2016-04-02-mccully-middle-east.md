Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to the Middle East this weekend for meetings in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. 

“As an elected member of the United Nations Security Council, New Zealand has a role to play in addressing the pressing crises affecting the Middle East, including the conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq,” Mr McCully says.

“My visit to the region is an opportunity to meet with senior Ministers to advocate for the de-escalation of these conflicts and discuss regional issues such as the Middle East Peace Process.

“New Zealand has strong trade and economic links with the region and I will be meeting with the Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council while in Riyadh, as well as New Zealand and local businesses.

“Progressing the New Zealand – Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement will also be on the agenda during my meetings with regional leaders,” Mr McCully says.
