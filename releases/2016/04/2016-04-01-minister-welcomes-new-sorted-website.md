Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today welcomed the relaunch of the popular financial planning website Sorted.

“With a refreshed look and mobile friendly interface, the new Sorted website will make it easier for people to see their finances and the choices that can help them get ahead,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Better financial capability means having the skills, understanding and confidence to make good financial decisions at all stages of life.”

“Building the financial capability of New Zealanders will help improve the wellbeing of our families and communities, reduce debt and hardship, increase investment and grow the economy,” Mr Goldsmith says.

The new Sorted website provides a personalised a range of tools, such as mortgage calculators, debt management, retirement planning and the KiwiSaver Fund Finder. It can be accessed at [www.sorted.org.nz](http://www.sorted.org.nz/).
