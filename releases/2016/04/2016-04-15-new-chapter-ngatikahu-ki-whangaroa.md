The Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Settlement Bill passed its first reading in Parliament yesterday, signalling a new chapter in the 15-year endeavour by the iwi to seek redress for Treaty of Waitangi breaches by the Crown.

“The first reading of this Bill is validation of the hard work, tears, arguments, and terse moments that the people of Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa have endured to have their Bill discussed in the House”, says Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell.

The settlement recognises the Crown’s failure to properly investigate pre-Treaty land transactions within the Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa tribal area.

Treaty breaches by the Crown resulted in hefty losses of land for Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa, and left many of its people virtually landless. This had a devastating impact on the iwi which was then forced to live outside of its tribal region.

The Crown recognises that when it took land for public works and a scenic reserve it did not ensure the customary interests of the iwi was properly considered.

“Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa have suffered greatly because of the Crown’s failure to meet its Treaty obligation, and Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa has shown great leadership to begin to heal the rift between itself and the Crown, which is evident in today’s milestone”, says Mr Flavell.
