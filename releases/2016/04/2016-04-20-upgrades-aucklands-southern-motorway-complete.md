Transport Minister Simon Bridges says newly completed upgrades to Auckland’s Southern Motorway at Ellerslie will help improve travel times for motorists and ease freight movement.

The $20 million SH1 Ellerslie Widening project has seen the motorway widened from three to four lanes northbound and better electronic motorway signs and lighting have been installed.

Improvements at the interchange will also make it safer for traffic merging from Ellerslie-Panmure onto the state highway.

“The Southern Motorway is a key route connecting Auckland with the rest of the country. These widening and safety upgrades to the motorway will help to reduce congestion and improve traffic efficiency while creating safer journeys for motorists,” Mr Bridges says.

Ellerslie Train Station was also upgraded part of the overall project.

“Residents and rail commuters are now benefiting from a safer, more accessible train station.

“This project forms part of the Government’s overall commitment to deliver better, safer transport options. It also supports planning for the rapid population growth expected in Auckland over the next 30 years.”
