Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is meeting with the Filipino community in Winton today.

“The Filipino community is heavily involved in our dairy sector in the south. Forums like this give us an opportunity to talk about issues, opportunities and challenges,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Filipino community in Southland has expanded dramatically in the past decade.  From 57 people in 2006 to 582 people now.  That’s equivalent to 921.1% growth.

“I want this meeting to be a productive discussion about our joint aspirations and goals and any barriers they may face.

“New Zealand is seeing the benefits of ethnic diversity, both economically and culturally. Our diversity continues to grow every year, many ethnic communities are becoming more established and continue enriching our cultural landscape,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Minister has previously held forums  in Northland, greater Wellington, Christchurch, Palmerston North, Hamilton,Taupo and several parts of Auckland.
