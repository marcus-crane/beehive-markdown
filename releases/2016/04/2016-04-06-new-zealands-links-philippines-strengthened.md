Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a new Auckland-Manila air service will create the first non-stop link between New Zealand and the Philippines.

Air New Zealand today announced a new year-round service from Auckland to Manilla three times a week, starting in December.

“New Zealand and the Philippines have a strong relationship with 40,000 Filipinos permanently residing here. This new Manila service is a reflection of the people to people and valuable trade and tourism links between our two countries,” Mr Bridges says.

“Last year nearly 21,000 New Zealanders travelled to the Philippines and more than 19,000 Filipinos visited New Zealand so it’s clear there’s growing demand for this service.”

Mr Bridges says it’s another example of the Government’s International Air Transport Policy bringing benefits to New Zealand.

“Since the policy was implemented in 2012 more than 50 new or amended air agreements have been negotiated, bringing the total to 76. Most of the major airlines in the world are now able to operate services to New Zealand without restriction, with 18 new air routes announced in the past year alone.”

In December last year, Philippine Airlines began operating a service between Manila and Auckland, via Cairns, four times a week.

Both this and Air New Zealand’s new service are a direct result of an enhanced air services arrangement the Government signed with the Philippines in 2014.

“Our success in negotiating Air Services Agreements is providing New Zealand access to a large wealth of benefits including tourism and trade. New Zealand is heavily reliant on its air links with other countries, and we will continue our efforts to grow and enhance these connections,” Mr Bridges says.
