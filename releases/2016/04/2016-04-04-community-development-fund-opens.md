The opening of the 2016/17 round of funding from the Community Development Scheme, will benefit communities across New Zealand, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

The Community Development Scheme helps fund projects where communities are working to become more self-reliant, resilient, and generate their own solutions to local issues.  Successful grant recipients receive funding to employ a community development worker for three years to help their community thrive.

“Communities across New Zealand are eligible for funding from the Community Development Scheme. This year funding is available for a further seven communities to be granted $80,000 each year for the next three years.

“Previous grants help to demonstrate what a big difference the scheme can have in a local community, and funding up to a total of 32 communities at any one time,” says Mrs Goodhew.

In the Otangarei community in Whangarei, a Community Development Worker, with support from One Double Five Whare Awhina Community House Trust, is supporting the community in a range of projects, such as:

- Local environmental projects
- Building a community bike storage facility
- Supporting young men into employment.

“With the support of the Community Development Scheme, a wide-range of community events are bringing the community together in new and fun ways, and bringing pride to the area” Mrs Goodhew says.

Organisations applying to the scheme must be community based, use a community or hapū development approach and have support from the wider community to undertake the project.

The Community Development Scheme funding round opens on 6 April and closes on 18 May 2016. Application information is available at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
