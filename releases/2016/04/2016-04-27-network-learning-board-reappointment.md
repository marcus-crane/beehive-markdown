Jack Matthews has been reappointed as a director of Network for Learning Ltd (N4L) for a full three-year term, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

Ms Kaye also announced the retirement of Martin Wylie, who has served on the board since 2012.

“Both Mr Matthews and Mr Wylie have provided strong leadership and guidance,” says Ms Kaye.

“Mr Wylie brought to the table considerable expertise in law, IT and telecommunications, and I’d like to acknowledge the contribution he has made over the past four years.”

N4L has now connected over 2,300 schools across the country to its Managed Network, which provides schools with fast, reliable internet, including uncapped data, web filtering, network security services and helpdesk support.

“The government is investing more than $200 million in the N4L Managed Network, so that all state, state-integrated and partnership schools can have safe, secure and uncapped internet funded by the Crown.

“N4L is part of the Government’s wider investment in school IT infrastructure. I recently announced the completion of the $280 million School Network Upgrade Project, which upgraded schools’ internal ICT network infrastructure such as cabling and switches.

“Minister Adams also announced the completion of work laying fibre to school gates under the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RFB) programmes.

“Providing state-of-the-art infrastructure is crucial to helping schools make the most of digital technology for learning, and ensuring New Zealand has a world-leading, digitally-enabled education system.”

The rollout of the N4L Managed Network continues to run well ahead of schedule, with the remaining five per cent of New Zealand’s roughly 2,500 state, state-integrated and partnership schools expected to be able to connect by the end of 2016.

**Notes**

**About N4L**

Network for Learning (N4L) is a Crown company. It was created to build a managed network specifically designed for New Zealand schools, and to create an environment that encourages the uptake of digital learning.

**What is the N4L Managed Network?**

The N4L Managed Network provides participating schools with fast, reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering, network security services and helpdesk support.

Because it’s centrally managed, schools don’t need to support their own internet connection and related services, reducing ICT complexity and costs.
