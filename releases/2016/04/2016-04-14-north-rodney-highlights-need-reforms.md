Local Government Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga says today’s decision on North Rodney’s unitary authority proposal highlights the need for local authority reforms.

The Local Government Commission announced today that all of the Auckland Council area is affected by the Northern Action Group’s application to form a North Rodney unitary authority.

“The Local Government Commission is constrained by its current legislation and had little choice but to reach the decision that it has.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Better Local Services package, on the other hand, includes more flexibility to collaborate and develop shared services and contains reorganisation processes that can be locally led and driven.”

The reforms will also enable the Commission to consider other options for areas like North Rodney.

The Minister says the reform package also contains improved accountability tools to safeguard local democracy.

“The Better Local Services package proposes that all current reorganisation applications accepted by the Local Government Commission will be processed under the new legislation unless the Commission issues a final determination,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Commission is currently progressing applications relating to Northland, North Rodney, Waiheke, Wellington, and West Coast.
