Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Communications Minister Amy Adams have welcomed today’s announcement by Hawaiki confirming it will build a submarine cable linking New Zealand, Australia and the United States.

“Hawaiki’s new cable system will provide more international data choice and resilience for Kiwi consumers and business and help progress New Zealand’s digital economy.” Mr Joyce says.

The New Zealand Government has supported the Hawaiki project via the Crown-owned research network company REANNZ. REANNZ has taken a long term anchor tenancy on the cable for its research network including an initial $15 million capital contribution.

“The contract between REANNZ and Hawaiki means REANNZ can lock-in long-term international connectivity arrangements essential for delivering high quality research-grade data services to its research and education members,” Mr Joyce says.

Ms Adams says the Government’s Ultra-Fast and Rural Broadband programmes are already delivering faster connectivity to over one million homes, schools, hospitals and businesses.

“Confirmation of this project provides further assurances to New Zealanders of our growing connections to the world and our place in the global digital economy,” Ms Adams says.

“International connectivity is critical for New Zealanders and the new cable will increase capacity in internet services.”

Once built the Hawaiki cable will be the third provider and the fourth physical cable connecting New Zealand to the rest of the world (the others being the two Southern Cross cables and the Tasman Global Access cable).
