Prime Minister John Key yesterday met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the positive progress in the New Zealand-China relationship since entering into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2014.   

“New Zealand’s relationship with China is broader and deeper than ever before,” says Mr Key. “It was great to see President Xi again, to take stock of what we have achieved and to discuss further opportunities for collaboration.” 

Mr Key and President Xi had useful discussions on the intention to upgrade the NZ-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA). 

“Good progress has been made in determining the scope of what an FTA upgrade might cover, and I appreciate the open and frank conversation I have been able to hold with President Xi,” says Mr Key.   

“President Xi and I agreed to find a pragmatic way to finalise the launch of the upgrade and Trade Ministers will meet soon to progress this.   

“We also discussed New Zealand’s term on the UN Security Council, which has provided a valuable and unique opportunity for us to work together on international security and United Nations policy issues.  

Mr Key raised former Prime Minister Helen Clark’s bid for the role of UN Secretary-General.  

“The UN needs strong leadership, given a number of global challenges it is facing.

"I explained to President Xi why New Zealand believes Helen Clark is the best person for the job.”
