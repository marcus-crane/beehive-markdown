A new $7 million wastewater treatment plant was opened in Shannon today by the Environment Minister, marking another successful step in the clean-up of the Manawatu River.

“The Manawatu is one of New Zealand’s most polluted rivers and inadequate town wastewater schemes are part of the problem. This new land based treatment system for Shannon is a significant milestone in the collective effort by councils, iwi and Government to improve water quality. It will reduce the amount of discharge into the river by 144 million litres per year,” Dr Smith says.

“I commend the efforts by the Horowhenua District Council, its Mayor Brendan Duffy and the partners in the Manawatu River Leaders Accord for achieving this result for the river. Cleaning up the Manawatu River is going to require significant changes for both urban and rural communities across the region.

“My optimism is based on the progress that has been made since the shared action plan was agreed in 2011. This includes the progress with this Shannon wastewater project, 380 kilometres of stream fencing, planting more than 120,000 plants and shrubs, 100 farm environment plans and over 23 community based initiatives.

“It is unusual for the Government to contribute to council wastewater schemes but we recognise the size of the challenge and want to support the huge collaborative effort that has gone into the difficult problems with the Manawatu River.

“The $1.115 million from the Government for this Shannon project is part of a grant of $5.2 million that is being invested in the wider Manawatu River clean-up programme. The Government is investing $350 million nationwide to clean-up our most iconic lakes, rivers and wetlands.”
