A historic global climate change agreement has been signed today on behalf of New Zealand by Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett.

The Paris Agreement was concluded in December 2015 and is the first truly global deal to address climate change. 188 countries took part in the negotiations, covering more than 90 per cent of the world’s emissions.

New Zealand has signed the deal on the first day it is open for signature at the United Nations in New York. The ceremony, held on Friday 22 April Eastern Standard Time, is being hosted by Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon and coincides with Earth Day.

“This is a huge achievement for New Zealand and every nation that is committed to seeing the world transition to a low carbon future,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Paris deal gives all countries, developed and still developing, a common platform to change our impact on our world.”

Mrs Bennett told delegates that the New Zealand Government’s number one priority is economic growth and the Agreement is the foundation of efforts to do that in a sustainable way for the planet.

New Zealand’s 2030 target, tabled during the Paris negotiations, sees it commit to reducing emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels.

“While I am incredibly confident we will meet our fair and ambitious target, I am already thinking about what we have to do domestically to grow our economy with fewer emissions,” says Mrs Bennett.

Countries will also need to adopt the agreement within their own legal systems through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. The agreement will enter into force when joined by at least 55 countries, which together represent at least 55 per cent of global emissions.

“The next step is for more of the operational details to be fleshed out so New Zealand can consider timing and the best way to ratify the agreement,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Today is a huge milestone but this is by no means the end of the road. Implementation won’t be easy. I know New Zealanders are up for the challenge.”
