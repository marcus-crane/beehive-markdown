Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett travels to the United States today to represent New Zealand at several major international events. 

Mrs Bennett will sign the Paris Climate Change Agreement on behalf of New Zealand at the United Nations in New York on Saturday 23 April.

“It’s an incredible privilege to represent our country at this historic event. The Paris deal is the first truly global deal on climate change, and it’s appropriate the event is being held to coincide with Earth Day,” says Mrs Bennett. 

She will also represent New Zealand at the Major Economies Forum on Climate Change. This grouping of 17 of the largest economies, chaired by the United States, seeks to generate broad consensus and progress in the global transition to a low-emissions economy.

“As one of very few small nations invited, it’s a sign of the high regard in which New Zealand is held,” says Mrs Bennett. 

While in New York, Mrs Bennett will speak on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. These are the main strategic priorities the global community sets itself to eradicate poverty, combat climate change and make cities more liveable.

She will also host a ministerial breakfast to promote fossil fuel subsidy reform and campaign with New Zealand’s nominee for UN Secretary-General Helen Clark at a gathering of Pacific Island leaders.

Mrs Bennett will also visit Washington, D.C. to meet Congressional representatives and think-tank leaders to discuss the US’s climate change policy.

“I’m particularly looking forward to meeting Obama Administration officials including Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr Jonathan Pershing, Senior Adviser to the President on climate change issues Brian Deese and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy,” Mrs Bennett says.
