The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass the Tauranga Moana Iwi Collective Redress and Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui Claims Settlement Bill, the Ngāti Pūkenga Claims Settlement Bill and the Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bill through their first readings. The bills have been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.

“These bills provide important redress and acknowledgement of the wrongs of the past for these groups,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today we reflect on the history and future of Tauranga Moana iwi and of Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa in the Far North.”

The Tauranga Moana Iwi Collective Redress and Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui Claims Settlement Bill is an omnibus bill. It will give effect to the collective redress of three iwi centred around the Tauranga Harbour (Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui and Ngāti Pūkenga).

The bill will also give effect to the individual settlement of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui.

The Ngāti Pūkenga Claims Settlement Bill will give effect to the individual settlement of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Tauranga Moana iwi Ngāti Pūkenga.

The Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bill will give effect to the full and final settlement of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa, a claimant group whose area of interest lies between the Whangaroa and Mangonui Harbours in the Far North.

“For the second time in less than a month the House has sat in extended sitting hours to progress Treaty legislation,” Mr Finlayson said. “The cross party support for these Treaty bills demonstrates the importance of resolving all historical Treaty claims in a fair, just and timely way.”
