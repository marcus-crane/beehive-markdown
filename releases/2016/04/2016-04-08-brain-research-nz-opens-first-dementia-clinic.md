Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today opened the Brain Research New Zealand Dementia Prevention Research Clinic in Auckland.

The clinic is part of the $29.8 million Brain Research Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE.) 

“The Clinic will allow New Zealand researchers to carry out world-leading studies about how to slow the progression of dementia,” Mr Joyce says.

The first clinic will open in Auckland and similar clinics are planned in Christchurch and Dunedin later this year.

“The clinics will work closely with patients, allowing researchers to investigate the progression of the disease. This could lead to new treatments and therapies which could ultimately increase the quality of life of patients and reduce health care costs.”

The CoREs Fund was established in 2001 to encourage the development of excellent tertiary education-based research that is collaborative and strategically focused.

A total of ten CoREs have now been funded through to 2020. Government has provided over $635 million in funding to current and previous CoREs.
