Corrections Minister Judith Collins visited Rolleston Prison today as the thirty-fourth house to be refurbished at the prison left the Construction Yard to return to the community.

The Construction Yard is a partnership project between Corrections and Housing New Zealand.

It provides offenders with the opportunity to gain employable trade skills and qualifications while they refurbish quake-damaged Housing New Zealand homes.

“A large amount of the social housing stock was damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes and offenders are expected to refurbish 150 houses by 2018.

“Projects like the Construction Yard are about practical employable skills. Prisoners get training and employment skills while contributing to the Canterbury rebuild.

“Over 340 prisoners have worked on the damaged housing stock since the project began, as well as a large number of community offenders.

“Corrections staff have heard of four offenders in apprenticeships since leaving the Rolleston Yard and many others gaining employment in building and related trades on release.

“The Prison has recently started training offenders in building and construction industry training organisation certificates.  This training can be transferred to a part apprenticeship enabling prisoners to continue their studies through a Polytechnic on release.

“This project is a win for everyone in the prison and community. Tenants and their families get a warm refurbished home, offenders get to give something back while gaining skills and qualifications for employment,” Ms Collins says.
