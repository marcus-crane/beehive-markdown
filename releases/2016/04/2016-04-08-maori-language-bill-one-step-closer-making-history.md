Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is pleased Te Pire mō Te Reo Māori (Māori Language) Bill has progressed to third reading following widespread debate by the Committee of the Whole House last night.

During the debate, the committee considered four amendments. 

“I am pleased my acknowledgement received a majority of support from the House.  It is an acknowledgement to recognise the detrimental effects of the Crown’s past policies and practices regarding te reo Māori.  As part of the acknowledgement, the Bill will progress with a clause that recognises the Crown’s commitment to work in partnership with iwi and Māori to continue actively protecting and promoting te reo as a taonga for future generations”, says Mr Flavell.

Three other proposed amendments failed to gain support from the committee with all three suggested changes receiving 75 votes in opposition.

“Despite members opposing the proposal to guarantee women and rangatahi representation on Te Mātāwai, the suggestion maybe explored more closely when Te Mātāwai is established”, says Mr Flavell.

The Committee of the Whole House also opposed an amendment to establish a panel independent of the Crown and Te Mātāwai to review the operations and effectiveness of the Bill.

Mr Flavell says “Debating these amendments has been important because it has inspired robust discussion which would help improve the Bill”.

Mr Flavell says he is delighted members voted 108 to 12 in favour of Te Pire mō Te Reo Māori (Māori Language) Bill.

“I look forward to the Bill progressing to third reading very soon”, he says.
