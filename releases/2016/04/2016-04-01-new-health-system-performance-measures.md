Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new system wide performance measures for primary and secondary care will help to further improve health services.

“Last year I indicated to the sector that we need to move primary and secondary care performance measurements from a transactional approach to one based on outcomes,” says Dr Coleman.

“Feedback from the sector was that the burden of reporting was too high. With the refresh of the New Zealand Health Strategy it was also timely to look at moving to a system wide view of performance.”

The Ministry of Health has worked closely with the sector to develop a suite of performance measures which are proposed for introduction in 2016/17:

- acute hospital bed days per capita;
- ambulatory sensitive hospitalisation rates for 0-4 year olds;
- patient experience of care;
- amenable mortality;
- youth access to and utilisation of youth appropriate health services;
- number of babies in smoke-free households at six weeks post-natal.

Three of these new measures - acute hospital bed days, preventable hospitalisation rates and patient experience of care - will be financially incentivised in 2016/17, along with the two existing primary care national health targets (better help for smokers to quit and increased immunisation).

The package of performance measures and incentives are supported by a $23 million per year investment.

The new performance measures and incentives will be negotiated into the DHB Annual Plans and Primary Health Organisation (PHO) Services Agreement.

“It’s my expectation that DHBs, PHOs and district alliances work together to co-develop agreed Improvement Plans,” says Dr Coleman.

“Financial incentivised measures help to drive quality improvement and deliver better health services to New Zealanders.

“It’s important DHBs and PHOs take advantage of this opportunity to strengthen relationships between primary and secondary care clinicians and continue to drive more patient-centred integrated health services.”
