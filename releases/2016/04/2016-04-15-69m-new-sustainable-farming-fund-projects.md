A total of $6.9 million has been awarded to 25 projects around the country after the latest round of the Sustainable Farming Fund (SFF), Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy has announced today.

This year’s funding includes six projects in the horticulture and dairy industries, three in arable sector, two each in meat and fibre, and one in forestry.

“Some examples of the successful projects include reducing nutrient run off on lowland farms, reducing use of antimicrobials when managing mastitis and increasing the market share for New Zealand olive oil.

“These are grass-roots projects that help farmers, growers and foresters to tackle problems and develop new opportunities. They are driven by local stakeholders and will make a real difference to regional communities,” says Mr Guy.

“Over the past 16 years the SFF has invested over $125 million in projects benefiting New Zealand’s primary industries. It is an important tool in our goal to double the value of our primary sector exports by 2025.”

**About the Sustainable Farming Fund**

- The funding investment by MPI in each project is matched by significant cash co-funding and in-kind support by industry, community groups and individuals.  The SFF can fund up to 80 percent of the projects, however on average projects leverage approximately 50 percent of cash and in-kind from other parties.
- The fund has been independently evaluated four times since its inception, with each evaluation highlighting the economic, social and environmental benefits of the investment. The most recent evaluation was completed in 2014.
- The 2014 evaluation concluded that it is achieving its goals of funding projects that contribute to the economic, environmental and social well-being of New Zealand’s primary industries.
