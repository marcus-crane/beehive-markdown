The second funding round for the Afforestation Growth Scheme (AGS) opens today and comes at an important time for forestry, Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“The goal of the AGS is to increase the planting of new forests and the rate of afforestation.

“Estimates suggest that 1.1 million hectares of land is at serious risk of erosion, and forest cover is the best form of erosion control.  Through the AGS, we aim to plant 15,000 hectares of new forest by 2020, and we are on track to meet this goal,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The first year of the AGS resulted in contracts of $3.77 million to plant around 2,900 hectares of new forest.

“The AGS enables positive economic outcomes for farmers and landowners, while also reducing some of the high costs associated with marginal land, by increasing forest cover. The AGS will also boost regional economies by taking currently underutilised land and using it for economic and environmental gain.

“New forests enabled by the AGS will improve land-use productivity and regional economic development.  It will also deliver environmental benefits such as reducing soil erosion, improving water quality, and absorbing around 1.9 million tonnes of carbon every year” Mrs Goodhew says.

Applications for the Afforestation Grants Scheme open on 27 April 2016 and close on 8 June 2016 for planting in Winter 2017.
