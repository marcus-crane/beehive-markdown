Prime Minister John Key has today announced French Prime Minister Manuel Valls will visit New Zealand in the first week of May.

Prime Minister Valls and his delegation arrive on Sunday 1 May for a series of events in Auckland, including an official welcome at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, followed by a wreath laying and bilateral talks.

“This is the first time in 25 years that a French Prime Minister has visited New Zealand,” Mr Key says.

“We have a close and long-standing relationship with France and I am looking forward to discussing a number of issues with Prime Minister Valls, including trade, our mutual interest in the Pacific and the international response to terrorism.

“I am pleased that New Zealand is able to host Prime Minister Valls for this short but very important visit.”

Prime Minister Valls will depart New Zealand on May 2.
