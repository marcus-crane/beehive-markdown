Associate Minister of Tourism Paula Bennett today welcomed a decision by the Office of the Chief Censor to ban three slogans on Wicked Campers’ vans.

The Censor has ruled that the slogans meet the criteria for objectionable publications.

“This is a real victory for everyone that has seen the vans and been offended by the awful slogans and images on them,” says Mrs Bennett.

“This will send a clear message to Wicked Campers that their offensive slogans are not welcome here and its time they cleaned up their act.

“If Wicked Campers continue to use the three slogans banned today they could face a fine of up to $200,000 per offence.

“We can all take a joke, but vans that promote drug use to children and sexual violence totally overstep the mark.

“We want high quality tourist operators in New Zealand so visitors have a great experience,” says Mrs Bennett.
