Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today launched New Zealand’s new Health Strategy at a Health Symposium in Wellington.

“The new Strategy has been developed to guide change in the health sector and to lead the transformation to a more innovative, integrated and patient-centred approach to healthcare in New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

The Health Strategy has not been updated since 2000. The new Strategy sets a clear direction for the health system over the next 10 years.

It covers five strategic themes - people-powered, closer to home, value and high performance, one team, and smart system. It includes a roadmap of actions to put the Strategy in place over the next five years.

“We need a unified health system with shared values. We need better ways of working together to ensure all New Zealanders have access to the healthcare they need,” says Dr Coleman.

“We want to see more services delivered in the community, a stronger push on prevention and self-management, as well as care closer to home.

“This new Strategy will ensure better integration of health and social services, a health workforce that’s well equipped and supported by strong leaders and networks, more involvement in service design by users, and a system well placed to take advantage of emerging technologies.”

The Ministry of Health led the update of the Strategy and engaged extensively with the sector, social service providers and health users over the last year.

“A range of people and organisations have contributed to developing this Strategy. Their feedback added significant value and shows people want to play an active role in creating our future health system,” says Dr Coleman.

To support the Strategy’s implementation, the Ministry of Health is currently reorganising the way it operates.

“We need a strengthened and streamlined Ministry, which is empowered to lead the health system. This reorganisation will ensure clearer roles and accountabilities, and reduce duplication,” says Dr Coleman.

The Powering Up Our Future Health Symposium is being hosted by the Ministry of Health. Senior health and social sector leaders will discuss how New Zealand can build a modern people-powered, technology-enabled healthcare system.
