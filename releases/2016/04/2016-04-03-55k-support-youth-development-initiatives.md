Organisations offering youth development opportunities through Shakespearean drama, a flagship civics education conference and financial literacy courses will benefit from funding of $55,000 announced today by Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This funding will go to three established, reputable organisations who have a good track record working directly with young people to provide mentoring, leadership and development opportunities,” says Ms Kaye.

The three recipients are:

- Shakespeare Global Centre New Zealand, which receives $10,000 to help foster skills and qualities such as self-confidence, collaboration and project management through participation in Shakespearean festivals and associated activities
- UN Youth Aotearoa New Zealand, which receives $10,000 to support participation in Aotearoa Youth Declaration 2016 – a four-day conference in Auckland later this month, which will see participants from around the country come together to discuss and create policy statements on a range of social, economic and cultural issues faced in New Zealand
- Massey University Financial Education and Research Centre, which receives $35,000 to support the delivery of leadership and financial literacy training for disadvantaged youth.

“These organisations are all helping to cut across social and economic barriers to provide opportunities that inspire young people, and enable them to gain new skills and confidence to help put them on a path to a successful future.

“I expect that almost 500 young people will benefit from taking part in the initiatives supported by the funding announced today.

“Late last year I announced a new direction for youth development in New Zealand, which takes effect tomorrow.

“This is about increasing the number of youth development opportunities available to young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and developing greater cohesion between the Government and business and philanthropic sectors to create these opportunities.

“I expect the new direction will increase the number of youth development opportunities from around 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.

“We have amazing young people in New Zealand with unlimited potential. It’s important we support them to realise this potential, whether through mentoring, volunteering, sport, leadership or cultural activities, and that we recognise the contribution they make to society.”
