The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) has today launched a new codebook of updated broadcasting Codes of Practice, Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams says.

The BSA’s Codes of Practice for free-to-air television, pay television, and radio have been reviewed and updated into user-friendly principles which will accommodate the wide range of delivery platforms used today by New Zealand audiences.

“The new codebook is the product of the BSA’s extensive consultation with broadcasters and members of the public, spanning over a year,” says Ms Adams.

“It contains a collaborative set of principles which reflect contemporary social values and the different ways that New Zealanders access broadcast content in a rapidly changing media landscape.

“The modernised codes will also assist the public, the broadcasters and the BSA itself, in the case of any future regulatory change.”

Key changes to the codebook include the addition of the Children’s Interests and Violence standards for radio, and a new Discrimination and Denigration standard for television broadcasters.
