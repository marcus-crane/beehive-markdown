Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed Corrections’ latest drug and alcohol strategy released today.

The strategy, *Breaking the Cycle: Our Drug and Alcohol Strategy through to 2020* will set the direction for how Corrections manages alcohol and other drug treatment and misuse among offenders.

Sixty per cent of offenders in the community have an identified alcohol or drug problem and 87 per cent of prisoners have experienced a problem during their lifetime. Approximately 50 per cent of crime is committed by people under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Many offenders have no experience of alcohol or drug treatment or support before they enter the Corrections system. All prisoners are screened for their drug and alcohol dependencies on their entry to prison and community offenders are assessed by Probation Officers. Offenders are also screened for mental health concerns, which can be linked to substance abuse.

“The government is committed to helping offenders address their drug and alcohol problems because we know it is a significant driver of crime.

“Significant progress has been made in improving prisoner access to timely and high-quality alcohol and drug interventions. More than 4500 prisoners accessed treatment in 2014/15 compared to just 500 in 2008/09. In the last few years, the number of residential Drug Treatment Units has increased from six to eleven and the number of prisoners placed in residential Drug Treatment Units has doubled from 500 in 2008/09 to 1000 in 2014/15. Funding for the residential Drug Treatment Units has increased from $3.8 million to $5.2 over the same period,” Ms Collins says.

“Corrections also received $8.63 million from the Justice Sector Fund in late 2015 to develop and deliver an aftercare programme for prisoners who have completed treatment in prison. This programme will run as a pilot over the next two years. We know that many prisoners need ongoing support with their drug and alcohol issues when they leave prison.

“The Justice Sector Fund has also been used to support a package of road safety interventions for community work offenders, including brief drink drive programmes and fully-subsidised alcohol interlocks for eligible community based offenders.

“Since October 2015, the brief drink driving programme has been delivered to 803 offenders, with a further 537 expected to receive the intervention before 30 June 2016.

“The Alcohol Interlock pilot has enrolled 71 offenders in the six months to 31 March 2016. Uptake has been higher than expected, and the pilot has been expanded to 175 participants from 120. To be eligible for the interlock subsidy, an offender must have been granted an alcohol interlock order by the Court. The Alcohol Interlock Pilot is helping to deter people from drink-driving and holds repeat drink drivers to account,” Ms Collins says.  

The Alcohol and Drug Strategy is aligned with the Ministry of Health’s recently released National Drug Policy 2015-2020. The National Policy outlines three strategies for action – demand reduction, supply controls and problem limitation – which form the framework of Corrections’ strategy.

“Addressing an offender’s alcohol and drug problems will help reduce re-offending which means better lives for offenders, fewer victims and safer communities,” Ms Collins says.
