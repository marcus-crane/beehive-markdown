Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams today announced appointments to the boards of two of New Zealand’s iconic media organisations, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) and NZ On Air.

“These appointments will ensure there is a good balance of new expertise and experience at a time when the way we communicate, do business and access information and entertainment is changing rapidly,” says Ms Adams.

Joan Withers has been appointed for a further term as Chair of TVNZ.

Ms Withers was named Chairperson of the Year at the Deloitte 200 Business Awards last year. 

“She is an outstanding leader and has provided clear direction and leadership to TVNZ over the last year and I am delighted that she has agreed to continue as Chair.”

Auckland-based advertising and marketing specialist Kevin Malloy has been appointed to the TVNZ Board.

“With a significant career in advertising both here and internationally, Mr Malloy’s expertise and experience in advertising, media buying and digital convergence will add real value to the TVNZ Board at an important time,” says Ms Adams.

Wellington lawyer John McCay is appointed as a board member of NZ On Air.

“Mr McCay brings more than 20 years of experience in corporate and commercial law to this role in broadcasting. His work in the film and entertainment industries has involved many significant New Zealand projects and I welcome the contribution he will bring to the board,” says Ms Adams.

Previously an adviser to the New Zealand Film Commission, Film New Zealand, and NZ On Air, John McCay has been a member of the board of the New Zealand Film Commission since 2015.  He also has considerable expertise in the retirement village, infrastructure and technology sectors and has advised some of New Zealand’s largest sporting bodies.

These board members’ terms all begin on 1 May.
