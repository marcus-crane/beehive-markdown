Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett announced today that New Zealand’s next Climate Change Ambassador will be Mark Sinclair. 

Currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to Japan, Mr Sinclair is a senior and experienced diplomat with extensive international negotiation experience.

“Mark has a deep understanding of New Zealand’s interests and is an exceptional choice to lead the next steps of our negotiating effort,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in December 2015 was a historic achievement, but it is by no means the end of the road.”

Negotiators are now focused on the work programme to flesh out the operational details of the Paris Agreement. This will provide clarity on the rules to be applied to countries’ commitments. 

“I’m looking forward to working with Mark to keep up New Zealand’s reputation as an important and effective voice in the world’s effort to transition to a low carbon future,” says Mrs Bennett.  

“I also want to thank outgoing Climate Change Ambassador Jo Tyndall, who has been an outstanding and expert voice for New Zealand on the world stage.”

Mr Sinclair will take up the new role in the next few months.
