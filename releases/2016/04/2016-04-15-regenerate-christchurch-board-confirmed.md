Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee says the four Ministerial appointees to the board of Regenerate Christchurch bring an impressive range of skills and experience working in greater Christchurch.

Mr Brownlee has appointed Andre Lovatt (as Chair), Ross Butler (member, Designate Chair of Otakaro Limited), Manaia Cunningham (nominated by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu) and Richard Holden to the board, who will serve alongside three Christchurch City Council appointees to be announced today.

Regenerate Christchurch is a new agency jointly owned and funded by the Crown and Council, with a focus on development in Christchurch’s central city, residential red zones, New Brighton and potentially other areas. 

“This agency is going to be crucial in shaping the future of these key areas of the city,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Brownlee had previously announced the appointment of Andre Lovatt as Chair of Regenerate Christchurch, alongside Ross Butler as Chair of Otakaro Limited. He notes that Manaia Cunningham and Richard Holden bring a wealth of experience to their new roles.

“We know from his long-standing involvement with Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and previous community roles, that Mr Cunningham has a range of leadership skills and experience which will broaden the perspective of the Board,” Mr Brownlee says. 

“Mr Holden, who is the Managing Director and Chair of Milestone Financial Services Limited, brings extensive experience in financial services and senior governance processes to the Board, having previously been a member of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission.

“The four board members I have confirmed today all have a strong grasp on the issues facing the city and I’m confident will provide excellent leadership, alongside the city council-appointees, in the future direction of those regeneration areas,” Mr Brownlee says.

Regenerate Christchurch has been established through the passing of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act, and will exist until June 2021, after which time it will transition into a solely Council-owned organisation.

Some parts of the Act are in effect following the Royal Assent process last week, and further parts come into effect on April 19, after the expiry of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority is disestablished.
