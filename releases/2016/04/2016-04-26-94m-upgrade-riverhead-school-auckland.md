Riverhead School in North-West Auckland will benefit from a $9.4 million upgrade, which will see the construction of a new two-storey classroom block and a new administration building, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

This follows last week’s announcements of a $4 million upgrade for Bayswater School on Auckland’s North Shore, and a $4.2 million upgrade for Papatoetoe Central School in South Auckland.

“The new classroom block at Riverhead School will contain 12 learning spaces. Seven of these will replace ageing, existing classrooms, and the other five will cater for the school’s growing roll,” says Ms Kaye.

Weathertightness issues in some other buildings will also be addressed as part of the upgrade.

“Like many areas across the Auckland region, Riverhead is growing rapidly. The school’s current role is 319, but it’s expected to grow to 450 in the next couple of years.

“The new learning spaces will enable the school to meet this demand, and will also support an innovative learning environment.

“All of the new learning spaces will be flexible, to support different ways of teaching and learning, and they will have high standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation. They will also feature the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.”

To minimise disruption to teaching and learning, temporary learning spaces will be provided while the new classroom block is being built.

“This project is further proof that the Government is committed to modernising school property and getting ahead of Auckland’s population growth, which is being driven by urban intensification as well as greenfield developments.

“Projections indicate there will be an extra 107,000 school students in Auckland over the next 30 years.

“Last July, I confirmed that over 230 new roll-growth classrooms and over 50 replacement classrooms would be delivered in the city over 18 months.

“Two new schools have also been confirmed for Scott Point and Kumeu, and in the last six months we’ve announced major redevelopments for schools such as Red Hill Primary School, Western Springs College and Takapuna Grammar School.”

Construction work at Riverhead School is expected to get underway in June and be completed by the end of 2017.

**Notes**

**About Riverhead School**

Riverhead School is a full primary school (years 1 to 8).

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
