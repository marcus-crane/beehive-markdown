Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will unveil a plaque this morning to mark the official start of a major redevelopment at Takapuna Grammar School.

“This $26 million project will see the restoration of the school’s 90-year-old main block, which is regarded as a heritage icon by the school and local community,” says Ms Kaye.

“I’d like to acknowledge local MP Maggie Barry, who has worked with the school on its property issues.

“It’s great for the school and for Auckland that the heritage value of the iconic main building has been recognised.

“The redevelopment has been designed to strike a balance between restoration and modernisation. The main block’s striking brick façade and parapets will continue to be a landmark feature of the school site, whilst the building’s interior will be upgraded to provide improved functionality.

Once it’s restored and strengthened, the main block will contain 20 revamped learning spaces, as well as an upgraded administration area and adjoining hall.”

The redevelopment, which will also see two new learning spaces added to the existing technology block, is expected to take around 30 months to complete.

“This is a complex project which has required a fair amount of planning, so today is an important milestone.

“With the main block out of operation, a lot of learning is taking place in relocatable classrooms, but most of these will be removed once the main block is back up and running.

“When the project is completed, the school will have 65 learning spaces in total, with the vast majority designed to support an innovative learning environment.

“This means the learning spaces will be flexible, to support different ways of teaching and learning, and they will have high standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation. They will also feature the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“The redevelopment of Takapuna Grammar School is testament to the Government’s commitment to invest in improved school facilities across New Zealand.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation. This is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”

**Notes**

**About Takapuna Grammar School**

Takapuna Grammar School is a co-educational secondary school (years 9 -13) with a roll of more than 1,400 students.

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
