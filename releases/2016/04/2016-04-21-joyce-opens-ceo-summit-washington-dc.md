Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today opened the NZ Exporters CEO Summit in Washington DC, with 11 New Zealand hi-tech exporters in attendance.

The Summit is being held to discuss new opportunities for NZ companies to participate in the world’s largest and most sophisticated government procurement market.

“The US Federal Government alone purchases $500 billion worth of goods and services every year,” Mr Joyce says. “Now by joining the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, New Zealand companies can compete on a level playing field for those contracts, from their New Zealand base.”

Mr Joyce is currently leading a delegation of New Zealand exporters targeting government procurement in Washington DC, organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).

The purpose of the two-day CEO summit is to highlight and leverage New Zealand’s 2015 accession to the GPA and to bring together companies seeking to expand opportunities in the US public sector.

With more than 4.1 million employees – almost the population of New Zealand – the United States Government is a mega employer and has contracts with about 200,000 suppliers.

Through the US GPA agreement New Zealand companies can now more easily and readily join this list of suppliers and the purpose of the Summit is to identify tangible ways that New Zealand industries and sectors can benefit.

“US procurement is committed to transparent and competitive government procurement that delivers the best value for money,” Mr Joyce says. “It is a very lucrative, open, complex market, which does not discriminate against foreign bidders. There are opportunities for New Zealand businesses in almost every sector in the US.”
