Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s opening of the new $15.3 million national youth forensic mental health unit.

The new facility at Kenepuru Hospital in Porirua was opened by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“Ngā Taiohi Youth Forensic Inpatient Service is the first secure facility of its kind in New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

“I know that Capital & Coast DHB and other agencies have played a key role in supporting the development of Ngā Taiohi. It’s important health and other agencies work together to ensure there’s a co-ordinated approach.

“The unit has 10 beds dedicated to providing appropriate care for vulnerable young offenders with a mental illness, and, or alcohol and drug problems.

“Previously youth offenders with mental health issues were treated in adult facilities or in the community with variable care across the country.

“Ngā Taiohi will ensure youth offenders with mental health or addiction issues get the care they need. This will also help to address some of the underlying causes of youth offending which is one of the Government’s key goals.”

In 2011 the Government announced funding of $33 million over four years for the development of a youth forensic mental health service. This includes court liaison services, and assessment and treatment services in youth justice residences and youth prisons.

$15 million has also been invested into an extra 40 youth mental health positions to support youth forensic community services, taking the total number of youth mental health workers to over 70.

“The expanded community based youth forensic mental health services will also help to ensure we can more effectively respond to the needs of these young offenders,” says Dr Coleman.
