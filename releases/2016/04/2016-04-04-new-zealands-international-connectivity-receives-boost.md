New Zealand will further expand its growing network of air services with new agreements set to be signed with several new countries, Transport Minister Simon Bridges has announced.

Ten new agreements and arrangements were negotiated at the International Civil Aviation Negotiation Conference, held in Turkey in October 2015.

Cabinet today approved the signing of new air services agreements with Israel, Mauritius, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama and Portugal. 

Other arrangements negotiated include:

- A negotiation with Turkey to permit airlines from each country to commence services using their own aircraft, where previously airlines were only allowed to code-share. New arrangements allow the airlines to operate up to 14 passenger and seven cargo services per week.
- An amendment to New Zealand’s 1967 Air Transport Agreement with France. This introduces new route opportunities for New Zealand and New Caledonia airlines.
- The negotiation of a code-share arrangement with The Bahamas.

“Air services agreements pave the way for airlines to operate new routes in and out of New Zealand, creating more links with the rest of the world,” Mr Bridges says.

“Growing competition and increasing the number of available seats can be expected to drive down prices and give prospective visitors to New Zealand more choices.”

Mr Bridges says more flights also allow for more high-value freight connections, and increasing regional connections to international flights creates more opportunities for provincial exporters.

“The Government’s success in negotiating Air Services Agreements is providing New Zealand access to a large wealth of benefits including tourism and trade.

“Most of the major airlines in the world are now able to operate services to New Zealand without restriction. More than 70 air services agreements are in place with 17 new air routes announced in the past year.

“This is an unprecedented flourishing of air services in terms of services starting, connecting us to more and more of the world.

“New Zealand is incredibly reliant on its air links with other countries, and we will continue our efforts to grow and enhance these connections,” Mr Bridges says.
