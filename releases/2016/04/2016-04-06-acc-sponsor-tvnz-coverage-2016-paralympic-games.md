As broadcast sponsor of TVNZ’s live, free-to-air coverage of the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games, ACC will help inspire all Kiwis, including those living with a disability and those recovering from a serious accident, says ACC Minister Nikki Kaye.

TVNZ and Attitude Pictures today announced plans for more than 180 hours of dedicated Games coverage, made possible by support from ACC and NZ On Air.

“The achievements of New Zealand’s Paralympians have made a major contribution to changing public perceptions of disability,” says Ms Kaye.

“Through their accomplishments on the world stage, our Paralympians are showing that with drive, determination and perseverance you can achieve great things.

“The Rio 2016 Paralympic Games in September promise to be a great sporting occasion. It’s fantastic that Kiwis will be able to watch live, free coverage, and this will help strengthen acceptance of Paralympic competitions alongside mainstream sports.”

The live coverage of the Games, plus extensive delayed and highlights coverage, will be on TVNZ’s DUKE channel. Along with ONE News coverage, a special highlights programme will also air every night on TV ONE, and be available online through TVNZ OnDemand and AttitudeLive.com.

The New Zealand team’s performances will be the focus of the live and highlights coverage.

“ACC’s sponsorship will highlight the success of our Paralympians to motivate New Zealanders to achieve an active life after an accident.

“This is about inspiring New Zealanders and promoting sporting activity as a contributor to wellbeing and positive rehabilitation.

“It’s also fantastic to see that the production team for the highlights coverage from the Games will be led by three Paralympic Gold medallists. Wheelchair rugby athlete Jai Waite will be programme editor, former captain of the New Zealand Wheel Blacks Dan Buckingham will be the anchor in Rio, and former Paralympic cyclist Paula Tesoriero will be reporting from the field.

“Our Paralympians are role models who can inspire us all to achieve and take part in an active life. I wish them every success and look forward to watching their performances from Rio.

“In addition to the sponsorship agreement announced today, I announced last September that ACC had entered into a partnership with Paralympics New Zealand (PNZ) to be a major partner in 2015 and 2016. This period includes the build-up to the 2016 Paralympic Games.”

Objectives of ACC’s partnership with PNZ include:

- creating opportunities for ACC clients with disabilities to try Para-Sport as part of their rehabilitation and return to independence
- promoting injury prevention
- using inspirational story-telling and Paralympic role models to encourage New Zealanders to lead active, healthy lives.
