The number of people on the Social Housing Register has again declined, the result of a more targeted approach to meeting individual needs, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

Figures for the March 2016 quarter show there were 4585 people on the register, down 223 or 4.6 per cent on the same time last year. Of those on the register in March 2016, 1036 are already housed and are awaiting a transfer to a more suitable property.

“The Ministry of Social Development’s more targeted approach is reducing the number of vulnerable people on the register for social housing,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Regular contact with people on the register ensures Ministry staff have the most up to date information about their circumstances, housing and social assistance needs.

“Frontline staff working more closely with people to explore all alternative housing options, including staying in their current homes with extra financial help or support services is also helping to reduce the number of people on the register,” Mrs Bennett says.

The Ministry is also helping people on the register move into private rentals with financial help totalling $1.36 million for things such as bond and rent assistance, help with moving costs, the accommodation supplement and help finding paid work.

Through the Tenancy Review process, Ministry of Social Development staff have helped 500 households move into private rentals and 66 tenants have bought their own homes.

“I am thrilled that we have also been able to help so many people buy a property, some for the first time,” Mrs Bennett says.
