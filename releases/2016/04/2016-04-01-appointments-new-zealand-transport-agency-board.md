Transport Minister Simon Bridges has appointed Fran Wilde, Chris Ellis and Leo Lonergan, and reappointed Gill Cox, to the board of the New Zealand Transport Agency.

Ms Wilde will replace Dame Patsy Reddy as Deputy Chair of the board.

“The new members have significant backgrounds in governance, leadership, regulation, decision-making and financial management,” Mr Bridges says.

“Combined with Mr Cox’s reappointment, they ensure the board will continue to have the skills and experience needed to oversee the Government’s significant investment in land transport.

“I would also like to thank Dame Patsy for her work as Deputy Chair. Dame Patsy has played a crucial role in steering NZTA through the delivery of record investments in our transport network. I wish her all the best for her new role as Governor General,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Ellis, Mr Lonergan and Ms Wilde’s appointments are for three years and will commence on May 1. Mr Cox will serve another one year term.

NZTA is a Crown entity established in 2008 through the merger of Land Transport NZ and Transit NZ. It invests over $3 billion per year in New Zealand’s transport network, and is one of the Government’s biggest procurers.

The board has eight members, appointed by the Minister of Transport.
