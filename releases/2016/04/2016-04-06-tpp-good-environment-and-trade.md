The Environment chapter of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement offers real benefits for both New Zealand’s environment and trade, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Trade Minister Todd McClay said today.

“TPP is not just good for the New Zealand economy but good for the environment. It goes much further than any other New Zealand trade agreement on issues like protecting endangered species and preventing pollution, and also provides a valuable avenue for New Zealand to advance its environmental and conservation interests by working with, and pooling resources with other TPP countries,” Dr Smith says.

“There are specific undertakings or obligations around reducing carbon emissions, the conservation and sustainability of marine fisheries, and combating the illegal trade in wild flora and fauna. The protection of threatened fish stocks is a priority for New Zealand and the Chapter includes requirements in relation to fish subsidies, which contribute to over-fishing and over-capacity, as well as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing,” Mr McClay says.

For the first time in a free trade agreement, there is a platform for environmental cooperation with some of the world’s most advanced economies alongside developing countries.

“It is a huge step forward to have environmental issues better recognised in trade agreements. There are real wins for the environment through the ability to address issues such as protection of endangered species, illegal fishing, marine pollution, and controlling invasive species. The TPP reflects our Government’s Bluegreen agenda of ensuring economic gains and environmental improvements go together,” Dr Smith says.
