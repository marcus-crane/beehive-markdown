Statistics and Small Business Minister Craig Foss is welcoming a new online data tool that will help businesses grow and thrive by providing easily accessible and understandable data.

Officially launched today, Business Figures is the result of an innovative public-private partnership between Figure.NZ, ASB Bank and Statistics NZ.

“Figure.NZ has produced a free online service for businesses using data from a range of sources, including Statistics NZ. This is the type of innovative data reuse and presentation that adds extra value to information already collected by government,” Mr Foss says.

“Small businesses are vital to New Zealand’s economy. Business Figures will help small businesses continue to punch above their weight by providing valuable insights into their industries, communities and markets.

“For example, a plumber in Masterton can now view a simple graph showing how many households — and therefore potential customers — are in their area, as well as the number of businesses involved in construction.

“Statistics NZ’s recent Business Operations Survey shows firms are backing themselves to win. Business spending on research and development has grown by more than 15 per cent in one year, from $1.25 billion in 2014 to $1.44 billion in 2015.

“The Government backs New Zealand businesses and will continue to develop and promote tools that make it easier for businesses to do what they do best,” Mr Foss says.
