The new $16.8 million West Rolleston Primary School is a welcome addition to the thriving greater Christchurch schooling network says Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye, who officially opened the school today.

The region’s newest school opened its doors at the beginning of the school year and is part of a $1.137 billion investment to rebuild and renew 115 schools in greater Christchurch over the next decade.

“Today is a celebration of everyone’s collaborative efforts and highlights the continued progress being made in the Christchurch school build programme,” says Ms Kaye.

“Since the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes, Rolleston has experienced substantial and rapid population growth. The new primary school provides for the growing population in the area and gives local families a wider range of schooling options.”

The school is built for a capacity of 750 students and includes the Waitaha School satellite, catering for 16 students with additional learning needs.

“The school’s new innovative learning spaces have endless potential which the staff and students have been exploring together this term,” says Ms Kaye.

“Greater Christchurch’s schooling network continues to strengthen. By the end of the rebuild programme it will be the most modern in the country, creating a solid platform for learning and success in the 21st century.”
