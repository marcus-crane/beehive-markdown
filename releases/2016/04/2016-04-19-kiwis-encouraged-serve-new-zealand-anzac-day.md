The launch of a new initiative which encourages New Zealanders to volunteer in their community on days of national significance has been welcomed by Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

‘Serve for New Zealand’, founded by Christchurch’s Student Volunteer Army (SVA), in partnership with the RSA and the University of Canterbury, is to be launched on Anzac Day and will invite New Zealanders to pledge an hour or more of their time to give back to the community.

“This is a modern twist on a tradition, and a great way to honour the Anzac spirit while also giving back to your community through volunteering.

New Zealanders have a long history of volunteering, and do so in large numbers, with an average of 3.1 million hours volunteered every week by an average of 416,000* volunteers,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“New Zealanders are well-known for their generosity, which was highlighted by our recent ranking as the second most charitable country in the world.

“The work of the SVA during the Christchurch earthquake five years ago showed the nation how coming together to do good as a community can have a powerful, positive and long-lasting impact.

“There is enormous personal satisfaction in making a positive difference for others. Whether it’s helping out your neighbour, or offering your skills or time to a charity, every Kiwi can make a meaningful contribution to their community,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“This government is keen to help New Zealanders build stronger communities and to make them more resilient, starting at the grass roots. Serve for New Zealand is a fantastic way of connecting neighbours, communities, and the nation through service,” says Minister Goodhew.

“I recommend it to anyone who wants to contribute their skills and time to help make New Zealand an even better place to live.”
