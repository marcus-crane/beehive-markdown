Local community groups can now apply for grants under the Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS), which is open for applications from today.

“COGS is a community-driven scheme in which the government provides funding to non-profit organisations and groups that deliver community-based social services,” Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew says.

Around 260 volunteer committee members are elected by local communities to sit on 37 Local Distribution Committees.  The Committees make decisions based on local needs and priorities, assessing requests for help to fund costs such as rent, travel, administration and volunteering expenses.

Last year, local COGS committees distributed a total of $12.5 million by making 4159 grants to community groups across New Zealand.

“This funding is crucial to many organisations that wouldn’t otherwise be able to provide programmes and services to people and causes that need a helping hand.

“For example the Geraldine Children Social Work Trust received a 2015 COGS grant of $4,000. It enabled two qualified social workers to work with children and young people, particularly those from vulnerable or disadvantaged backgrounds, and alongside local schools, early childhood education providers and other social service agencies.

“Benefits for the 151 organisations which received support from the Trust have included improved educational outcomes such as learning and attendance, better school-family relationships and communication, and positive relationships with, and support from, external social agencies,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The 2016/17 COGS funding round will be open from 27 April 2016 to 8 June 2016.
