Economic Development and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce leaves for the United States tomorrow to promote US-New Zealand business links, and leverage New Zealand’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).

In August 2015, New Zealand joined the GPA, providing New Zealand companies guaranteed access to US government contracts.

“The US Government is the world’s largest purchaser of goods and services. Federal government spending is worth more than US$600 billion per annum. New Zealand’s GPA accession improves the contracting environment for New Zealand firms. We also value the US as a key science and innovation partner,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation for honesty, integrity, quality of government and reputable business practices and legal systems. This is a great “brand” for New Zealand companies to build from.”

The mission aims to attract interest in New Zealand solutions for US state and federal government and to secure the attention of key US government department leaders, buyers and influencers.

Mr Joyce leads a delegation of New Zealand exporters targeting government procurement at a two-day CEO Summit in Washington DC, organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).

“US procurement is committed to transparent and competitive government procurement that delivers the best value for money. It is a very lucrative, complex market, and GPA membership gives New Zealand businesses the right to bid for government contracts,” Mr Joyce says. “There are opportunities for New Zealand businesses in almost every sector in the US.”

While there, Mr Joyce will also visit Berkeley and Georgetown universities, and call on the Assistant Secretary of State to talk about New Zealand's wide range of academic, cultural and educational flows between both countries.

Mr Joyce will also visit San Francisco and Houston. He will return to New Zealand on 22 April.
