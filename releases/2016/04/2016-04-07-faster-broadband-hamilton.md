Communications Minister Amy Adams has today announced the rollout of Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) is now finished in Hamilton, the largest area completed so far.

“Hamilton is the sixteenth urban area to have their UFB built completed, and now more than 63,000 homes, schools, medical centres and businesses are able to connect,” says Ms Adams.

“The completed rollout will be welcomed by those living in Hamilton. Broadband is vital to New Zealanders, and connects us to one another and new markets across the world.”

The Hamilton rollout commenced in July 2011, and total investment exceeds $85 million.

“This also marks Ultra-Fast Fibre’s final candidate area to be completed, so more than 183,000 end users in the Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki can now connect to UFB,” says Ms Adams.

“I’d like to congratulate UFF on the completion of their six candidate areas, six months ahead of schedule and on budget.”

New Zealand’s UFB build is 60 per cent complete, and over 875,000 New Zealanders are now able to connect to the network.
