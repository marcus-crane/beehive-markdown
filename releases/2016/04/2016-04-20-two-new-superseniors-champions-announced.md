Two inspirational older New Zealanders are the latest to join the SuperSeniors Champions programme, Seniors Minister Maggie Barry says.

Commonwealth Games weightlifting gold medallist Precious McKenzie and renowned actress Dame Kate Harcourt have accepted the role to promote positive ageing and raise awareness of senior’s issues.

Ms Barry announced the new Champions at the Grey Power Federation AGM in Christchurch this morning.

“Both Precious McKenzie and Dame Kate Harcourt are outstanding advocates for older New Zealanders who epitomise the importance of positive ageing, and will be superb Champions,” Ms Barry says.

“Their role is all about seniors talking to seniors, speaking up for the positive contribution older people make to our society and promoting the challenges and opportunities which come with our ageing society.

Dame Kate was the 'face' of falls prevention campaign for the Health Quality & Safety Commission and remains actively involved in the arts after a long and successful career on stage and screen.

South Africa-born McKenzie won four consecutive Commonwealth Games weightlifting golds representing England and later New Zealand.

They join Taranaki newspaper editor Lance Girling-Butcher, the first Champion announced last month.

“Being a SuperSeniors Champion is a voluntary, non-political position, and we’re looking for more nominees to join Mr Girling-Butcher, Dame Kate and Mr McKenzie,” Ms Barry says.
