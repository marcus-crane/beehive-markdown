Corrections Minister Judith Collins today opened the new Ashburton Community Corrections site at 5 Mona Square.

The new site is part of a $70 million nationwide renewal programme to make Community Corrections sites more secure and better equipped to support offenders to turn their lives around. 

The site manages 120 offenders serving 163 community-based sentences and orders including home detention and community work

Community Corrections manages offenders to hold them to account to comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of re-offending, help them become productive members of society and keep local communities safe. Offenders are also provided with rehabilitation programmes, education and job-training.

There are a number of new benefits to the new site, including a dedicated community work area, enhanced safety provisions for staff including CCTV technology, a climb proof reception desk and duress alarms.

The community work centre includes space for programmes delivered by both Corrections’ staff and external groups.

“From the site, Corrections staff and community partners will deliver rehabilitation and work and living skills programmes, as well as managing the sentences and orders of offenders.

“We want to ensure we do everything we can to keep our staff safe, while ensuring that offenders have the best chance possible to move away from a life of crime” said Ms Collins.
