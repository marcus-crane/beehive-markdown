Honey produced by bees in hives at Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison is feeding families in the Hastings area, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says. 

Almost 38 kg of honey was extracted from the hives in the Young Offenders Unit when the first extraction of the season took place recently. 

“This is a terrific example of giving back to the community.  Prisoners are learning real life employment skills and gaining a qualification that will help them on release.  

“Families who receive the honey are in for a tasty treat; I was given a jar on my recent visit to the prison and was most impressed,” says Ms Collins. 

‘Rangatahi Honey’ as it is known, has been distributed to the community in 250ml containers via Hastings Miracle Centre/Connect Community Trust.  The Trust will then distribute the honey to Women’s Refuge and families in need.  A small amount has also been used in the prison’s kitchen.

The prison’s Young Offenders Unit has four hives which serve as a teaching tool for four prisoners who are enrolled and studying their Certificate in Apiculture, a 12 month correspondence course. Course theory is complemented by the practical training the men receive onsite which includes checking the hives daily.  

“Having hives in the prison is a great initiative that increases the skills and knowledge of young prisoners and one where the community also benefits,” Ms Collins says.
