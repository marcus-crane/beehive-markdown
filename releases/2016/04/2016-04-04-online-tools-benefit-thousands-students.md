Education Minister Hekia Parata says thousands of secondary school students will have free access to new online tools to help them with maths and literacy.

E-Ako Maths is an interactive online resource currently used every year in primary schools. Since 2012, tens of thousands of students have solved maths problems and answered questions at their own pace to enhance their class work.

“This is one of many innovative ways we are building kids’ confidence in maths, and we’re now extending it to secondary students in both numeracy and literacy,” says Ms Parata. “From today, it will be available to every one of the country’s state and state-integrated schools.

“Students struggling to obtain NCEA Level 2 will particularly benefit from the literacy and numeracy modules, especially as they’ll be able to use them anytime. Teachers, parents and families will also be able to view students’ progress online.”

Ms Parata says that secondary students will also now have access to the Tertiary Education Commission’s Pathways Awarua literacy and numeracy modules.

“TEC is helping us to make Pathways Awarua freely available to all secondary students.

“This resource has been designed for those needing help with literacy and numeracy and includes relevant, real-life examples. With over 390 interactive learning modules, secondary students will be able to access support for their numeracy, reading, writing and listening.

“These tools will support young people to obtain NCEA Level 2 and set themselves up for a brighter future,” says Ms Parata.
