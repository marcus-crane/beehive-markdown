An iwi-led housing project in Christchurch has been lauded today by the Minister for Māori Development as another string to the bow of positive initiatives being driven by Te Rūnanga o Ngai Tahu for whānau in their takiwā. 

Speaking today at the launch of the Addington housing project, Te Ururoa Flavell said three earthquake-affected houses relocated from Sumner and now fully renovated for whānau, “added impetus to the Rūnanga priority to enhance the economic and social wellbeing of the iwi.”

“Providing modern comfortable homes for whānau who have struggled with the impact of the earthquakes is not a rescue package - as much as it is a basic human right for all whānau.”

“I am extremely pleased that the Addington pilot is just the beginning of a much greater focus for the Rūnanga on housing initiatives.”

Mr Flavell said Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu had kept its gaze firmly planted on the critical importance of housing to the health and wellbeing of whānau, with a home ownership pilot also underway which will support 15 whānau into their own homes.

“Today’s event adds further momentum to the Rūnanga vision of ensuring its people are housed securely and safely and are therefore able to live in a healthy and happy environment.”

The Addington project has been completed in partnership with The Rata Foundation and Te Puni Kōkiri with community social housing provider Comcare responsible for managing and tenancy of the houses.

Mr Flavell says Te Puni Kōkiri has supported more than 42 new housing projects through the Māori Housing Network since the Network launched in October last year.

“The housing projects we’ve supported are in regions that have high Māori housing needs including the East Coast and Northland.

“The Network’s goal is to work with whānau, hapū, iwi and Māori to realise their own housing aspirations.”

The Māori Housing Network was launched after securing $35.3 million in last year’s budget.
