Prime Minister John Key today met with China Premier Li Keqiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing for wide-ranging talks, which included the upgrade of the NZ-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  

“The NZ-China FTA has been a real success for both our countries,” says Mr Key. “China is now our second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than doubling since the agreement came into force.    

“Premier Li and I discussed our intention to upgrade the FTA, to reflect the growth in trade between our two countries and to ensure it continues to drive our relationship forward.   

“We also discussed the importance of continuing to cooperate across the board, including in science and innovation, UN Security Council issues and tourism. 

“We talked about the growing law enforcement and legal cooperation between our two countries, and agreed to foster increased communication on international legal issues between our two foreign ministries.  

“Following our talks, Premier Li and I witnessed the signing of a number of arrangements, which reflect the significant engagement between New Zealand and China. 

These include arrangements on: 

- Developing an Agricultural Growth Partnership that will underpin agricultural cooperation programmes across a range of technical areas
- Promoting Trade and Investment between the New Zealand Export Credit Office and the Export-Import Bank of China which will promote greater cooperation and export credit financing
- Chinese recognition of New Zealand halal standards for New Zealand exports
- Implementation of the Strategic Research Alliance Joint Projects which will facilitate the allocation of funds to ongoing and previously-agreed science projects.

“In addition, earlier today I was pleased to witness the signing of a cooperation arrangement between New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) and Chinese internet giant Alibaba. 

“NZTE and Alibaba have agreed to work together to provide services aimed at helping New Zealand businesses maximise the opportunities on Alibaba’s online platform.

“This is good news for New Zealand exporters looking to grow their business through direct sales to Chinese citizens.

“Our relationship with China is increasingly broad based and these arrangements will help ensure this continues,” says Mr Key.
