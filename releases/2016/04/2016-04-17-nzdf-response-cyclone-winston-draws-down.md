Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee and Foreign Minister Murray McCully have announced that the New Zealand Defence Force have completed post-Winston relief operations in Fiji and are preparing to return home.

"The NZDF’s operation in Fiji is one of our biggest peacetime deployments to the Pacific, with close to 500 personnel, two ships and six aircraft, involved in delivering hundreds of tonnes of critical aid," Mr Brownlee says.

"The operation has strengthened relationships with the Government of Fiji and Royal Fiji Military Forces, and NZDF equipment and personnel have made a real difference to the people of Fiji."

HMNZS Canterbury is now preparing to leave Fiji after a month and a half of supporting relief and recovery operations and New Zealand’s focus will now turn to the long-term reconstruction effort.

"The New Zealand Government responded rapidly to Cyclone Winston, and we have committed more than $15 million for relief and recovery activities to date," Mr McCully says.

"The withdrawal of the NZDF marks the transition to the reconstruction phase of New Zealand’s support to Fiji, which will focus on rebuilding schools, evacuation centres and medical facilities on Vanua Balavu and elsewhere in Fiji, as well as efforts to stimulate the local economy post-Winston."

NZDF assets and personnel have begun drawing down and HMNZS Canterbury is due back in Auckland on 21 April.
