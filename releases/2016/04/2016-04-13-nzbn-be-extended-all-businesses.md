Legislation has passed this evening allowing New Zealand Business Numbers (NZBNs) to be allocated to all businesses operating in New Zealand.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says this will be welcome news to businesses and government agencies.

“NZBNs are a key initiative of the Government’s Better for Business programme. They are a unique identifiers that reduce the time and energy businesses spend providing government the same information in different ways,” Mr Joyce says.

“A change to NZBN information will, over time, change the same information on other databases held by government. Ultimately businesses will only need to tell government their information once.

“For businesses it will save time and cost through reduced form filling and data entry processes, and speed up dealings with government agencies.

Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith says this is an initiative firmly being driven by business.

“We already have great examples of the private sector using the NZBN to improve customer processes. For instance, Air New Zealand is using the NZBN as part of the registration process for businesses signing up online for its Airpoints for Business programme,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“All companies registered in New Zealand have had NZBNs since 2013. This new legislation means that by the end of the year, NZBNs will be allocated to other kinds of businesses such as sole traders, partnerships and incorporated societies.”
