Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today officially opened the new purpose built health centre Kaikoura Health Te Hā o Te Ora.

“This state-of-the-art $13.4 million facility enables Canterbury DHB to deliver on its vision of a more integrated health system which provides care closer to home,” says Dr Coleman.

Parts of the old Kaikoura hospital were more than 100 years old. In 2013 the Government agreed to contribute $10 million for a new facility. The community raised $3.4 million which was underwritten by the Kaikoura District Council.

“It’s fantastic to see such community buy-in for this project which shows what a small community can do when they work together,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new facility will continue to provide the same services including primary care, aged care, acute care, maternity, radiology, and trauma stabilisation.

“Located on the old hospital site which had 26 beds plus the medical centre and physiotherapy, the new health centre accommodates 21 beds including 14 long stay rooms, six medical/acute beds, a delivery/postnatal maternity suite, a resuscitation room, observation bed, and radiology.

“It also has multi-purpose GP rooms, physiotherapy, community dental, optometry, and space for visiting health specialists.

“Kaikoura Health allows the DHB to look at expanding services so patients can receive care closer to home. This may include palliative care, post-surgery support, pre-operation care, nurse-led fracture clinics, dementia patient support, health promotion activities, and wound care clinics.

“Video conferencing technology will also enable patients to have consultations with their specialist health provider without having to leave Kaikoura.”
