Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today opened the new Toto Ora Dialysis Unit in Mangere, Auckland.

“This is the first dialysis centre of its kind in New Zealand with Counties Manukau DHB partnering with international specialist provider Diaverum,” says Dr Coleman.

“To meet the projected six per cent annual growth in the number of people needing dialysis, the DHB has entered into a 10 year contract with Diaverum to provide additional community dialysis.

“As a result, patients will no longer have to travel to other parts of Auckland to get their dialysis as they will be able to receive care closer to home.

“This service agreement is unique and I congratulate Counties Manukau DHB for its innovative, cost effective approach to providing more dialysis capacity.

“Diaverum operates in 20 countries and has a strong track record of working in partnership with public healthcare providers across Australia, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Latin America.”

The $2.9 million unit is funded by Diaverum who also employ the nursing and technical staff. Medical oversight is provided by DHB nephrologists and allied health.

Toto Ora Dialysis provides 30 dialysis chairs and space for up to 120 patients a week. It provides the same quality of care to patients, with similar staffing models as Middlemore and Manukau Health Park community dialysis units.

Over 257,000 New Zealanders live with diabetes. The Government is implementing a number of initiatives to prevent diabetes and to ensure those living with the disease lead healthier lives.

The national diabetes plan was launched in November 2015, and the initiative Healthy Families NZ is being rolled out in ten communities.
