Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the appointment of two contractors for Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) in the Metro Sports Facility is another important milestone in the development of what will be a multi-generational asset for the city.

“In order to keep some competition in the process, we have awarded the ECI contract for stage one to two contractors – a joint venture between Australian company CPB and Christchurch-based Southbase, and Leighs Cockram Joint Venture Ltd,” Mr Brownlee says.

The contractors will be working with the Government and Christchurch City Council, providing their advice and expertise to plan the design and build of the facility.

“During the first stage of preliminary design, the ECI contractors are expected to provide advice on construction solutions, timeline and innovation,” Mr Brownlee says. 

“In late August a decision to continue on with one contractor will be made.

“Subject to their performance and commercial negotiations, they may then have the opportunity to stay on and be involved in the build itself.”

The ECI contractors are joining a multi-national design team which reflects the importance Government and Council are placing on good planning and design of this facility.

Warren and Mahoney, along with Peddle Thorp Architects and MacLennan Jaunkalns Miller Architects are providing architectural design services for this facility, while engineering design services are being provided by Aurecon, with ARUP, Powell Fenwick Consultants and Aquatic Design and Engineering.

“We are on track to deliver a facility that’s going to be a key attraction for the city,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As this is a large and complex project, caution must be taken as we progress towards a completed facility with the Christchurch City Council.

“It will be the second largest sport and recreation facility of its type in Australasia and we want to make absolutely sure what we’re building will meet the needs of the community, now and in the future.”

It will include an indoor aquatic hall with a 79 metre, 10-lane competition pool and seating for a minimum of 1000 spectators, a leisure area including hot pools and hydroslides, nine indoor courts for sports such as netball and basketball, and retractable seating for a minimum of 2500 spectators. There will also be a dedicated base for High Performance Sport New Zealand, and spaces for fitness and other activities.
