Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the upcoming visit to New Zealand of the President of the Republic of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee.

“New Zealand is looking forward to hosting the President on this historic visit, the first by an Indian President to New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

“It will be an opportunity to highlight our warm relationship, based on a shared Commonwealth heritage, commitment to democracy and the over 160,000 New Zealanders of Indian-origin, who make an important contribution to business, cultural and sporting life in New Zealand.”

President Mukherjee and his delegation arrive on Saturday 30 April for a series of events in Auckland, including an official welcome at Government House Auckland, a State dinner hosted by the Governor General, and talks with the Governor General and the Prime Minister.

While in Auckland, President Mukherjee will also address students at AUT Business School, and meet with Indian business and community leaders.

“India is an increasingly important trade and economic partner for New Zealand. Our total trade in goods and services with India topped $2 billion last year, and more than 23,000 Indian students studied in New Zealand last year alone.”

President Mukherjee leaves New Zealand on Monday 2 May.
