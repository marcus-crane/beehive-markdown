A new book featuring research by New Zealand historians will provide unique insights into the battlefields of Gallipoli, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

*Anzac Battlefield: A Gallipoli Landscape of War and Memory* details the first comprehensive archaeological survey of the battlefield and is the result of a joint project by New Zealand, Australian and Turkish experts.

“Ministry of Culture & Heritage military historian Dr Ian McGibbon was one of the experts involved in the work, from 2010-2014,” Ms Barry says.

“Using modern archeological techniques to survey the battlefield, the team mapped approximately 20 kilometres of remnant trench-lines, uncovering a range of artefacts including jam tins, water bottles, bullets, bayonets and German-manufactured barbed wire,”

Now in the Turkish Naval Museum at Canakkale, these discoveries enabled the authors to shed new light on the environment in which Anzac and Turkish soldiers endured the Gallipoli conflict.

“As we approach Anzac Day it’s timely a book like this, which details quite a remarkable piece of research, is available for people to expand their knowledge on such a significant event in our military history,” Ms Barry says.

“*Anzac Battlefield* represents the very best of the Anzac spirit, with its truly collaborative nature spanning three countries.”

The book, published by Cambridge University Press, is available now.
