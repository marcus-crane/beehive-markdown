I tēnei rangi i whakaaetia te pānuitanga tuatoru a Te Pire mō te Reo Māori e te Whare Pāremata, ākuanei, ka whakamanahia tēnei pire i raro i te ture. He mea nui whakaharahara tēnei.

Kua tuhia tēnei pire ki te reo Māori me te reo Ingarihi, waihoki, ko te tuhinga reo Māori te kape matua i raro i te ture.

"He tohu nui whakaharahara tēnei ki a tātou katoa o Aotearoa. Ko te whakatinanatanga tēnei o te wawata kia rangona te reo Māori i ngā horopaki katoa o te ao o te tangata, ko te ture anō tētahi o aua horopaki," te kī a te Minita Whanaketanga Māori, a Te Ururoa Flavell.

Mā te Ture hou e tū ai te hinonga o Te Mātāwai. Māna e ārahi te whakarauoratanga mai o te reo Māori mā ngā iwi me ngāi Māori.

"Ko ngā iwi me ngāi Māori ngā kaitiaki o te reo Māori. Mā Te Mātāwai rātou e hāpai ake. Huri noa i te motu, kei te takatū ngā iwi me ngāi Māori ki te whiriwhiri i ngā māngai mō Te Mātāwai. Ka tīmata ake ngā mahi a Te Mātāwai hei te mutunga o tēnei tau.

He tohu te Pire o mahi nui a ngā tini toa o te reo Māori. Kei te mihi au ki ngā kaiarataki o te whakarauoratanga mai o te reo."

Koia nei anō te wā tuatahi kua whakaae te Karauna, i mua tonu i te motu whānui, nā āna kaupapa here me āna mahi o mua e pā ana ki te reo Māori kua raruraru te reo me ngā tikanga Māori.

Hei tā Mr Flavell anō, kua matua whakatakotohia hoki e te Karauna tōna hiahia ki te mahi tahi ki ngā iwi me ngāi Māori ki te whakamarumaru me te whakatairanga i te reo Māori.

"Ahakoa ngā whakapaunga werawera i tērā whā tekau tau, kotahi anake te reo o Aotearoa, ko te reo Ingarihi. E tohu ana tēnei Pire i te wāhi ki te iwi Māori me te wāhi ki te Karauna i te whakarauoratanga mai o te reo.

“He reo motuhake te reo Māori ki Aotearoa. Mā tēnā me tēnā e ora tonu ai tēnei taonga," te kī a Mr Flavell.

"Ko te wawata, mā tēnei Pire e whakaara ake anō i a tātou mō te whakarauoratanga o te reo Māori, waihoki, ka whakaawea ngā tāngata o Aotearoa ki te kōrero Māori. Mā reira e piki ake ai te nui o te hunga kōrero Māori."

 

 

**Parliament passes historic reo Māori law**

The historic Te Pire mō Te Reo Māori (Māori Language) Bill has today passed its third reading and will soon be enacted into law.

The Bill in te reo Māori and English will be New Zealand’s first law with the Māori text prevailing as the language of law.

“This is a milestone in our nation’s history. It reflects the aspiration for te reo Māori to be a living language in all spheres of our lives including the legal system”, says Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell.

The new Act establishes Te Mātāwai, a new entity that will lead te reo Māori revitalisation efforts on behalf of iwi and Māori.

“Te Mātāwai affirms the role of iwi and Māori as kaitiaki of the language. Hui around the country are underway to prepare iwi and Māori for selecting members on to Te Mātāwai. Te Mātāwai will be ready to start operating by the end of the year.

“The Bill is testament to the efforts of many reo Māori warriors who have worked tirelessly to revitalise Māori language. I pay tribute to those who have led its revival.”

This Bill is also the first national acknowledgement by the Crown of the detrimental impact its past policies and practices have had on Māori language and culture.

Mr Flavell says the Crown also expressly states the Crown’s commitment to work in partnership with iwi and Māori to actively protect and promote te reo Māori.

“Despite the tremendous efforts put into reviving the language over the last forty years, Aotearoa remains a largely mono-lingual country. This Bill recognises the role of Māori and Crown in its survival.

“Te reo Māori is unique to New Zealand. Everyone in our country has a contribution to make in keeping this taonga alive”, says Mr Flavell.

“My ambition is for the Bill to re-energise the renaissance of te reo Māori and inspire New Zealanders to kōrero Māori because we all need to be involved in boosting the numbers of Māori language speakers”.
