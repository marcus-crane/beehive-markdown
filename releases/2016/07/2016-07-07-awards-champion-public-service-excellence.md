Greater collaboration and strategic thinking by the public sector is delivering real benefits for the public, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

Close to 400 public servants from across New Zealand attended the 2016 Deloitte IPANZ Public Sector Excellence Awards in Wellington last night.

“It’s always a great privilege to celebrate our hard-working and dedicated public servants who provide the outstanding services New Zealanders expect,” Mrs Bennett says.

Auckland Council’s Bylaws Review Programme won the Prime Minister’s Award for its work to consolidate 158 legacy bylaws from the previous councils into 32 simpler regulations.

The Council’s Review Programme also won the Excellence in Regulatory Systems Award. 

“New Zealand have high expectations of our public services – from both local and central government – to work together, provide value for money, and most importantly to deliver results.

“I have challenged the public sector to be brave and constantly think about how they can provide an even better level of service. They have a hugely important role to play in the future direction of our country. 

The Institute of Public Administration NZ (IPANZ) organises the annual event, and this year’s awards attracted a record 92 entries from a large range of organisations including government departments, district health boards, Crown agencies, local government, and tertiary education organisations.

“These awards are a fantastic opportunity to recognise the ongoing dedication and positivity of so many people. IPANZ is doing great work fostering collaboration and promoting a culture of shared success,” Mrs Bennett says.
