Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today announced that Leighs Construction has won the construction contract to build Christchurch Hospital’s new $72 million Outpatients facility.

“Currently outpatient services are scattered within temporary or outdated buildings across various sites in Christchurch. This new facility will benefit patients and staff by having all key outpatient services together,” says Dr Coleman.

“The facility has been designed in close consultation with clinical leaders, ensuring it will be a great addition to the Canterbury Health System.”

The new facility will be located at the health precinct on St Andrew’s triangle, directly opposite Christchurch Hospital, and is close to the CBD and adjacent to the proposed Bus Super Stop.

Spanning five storeys and 10,500 square metres in size, the new building will provide general outpatient consultation clinics along with dental, ophthalmology, allied health and diabetes services.

Construction is expected to get underway in mid-July, with the project expected to be completed in 2018.

“The awarding of this contract is another significant milestone in what is already the largest hospital redevelopment project in New Zealand’s history,” says Dr Coleman.

Close to $1 billion is being invested in new hospital facilities in Canterbury over the next few years. This includes a new $445 million Acute Services Building which recently commenced construction on the Christchurch Hospital Campus, and a $215 million redevelopment of Burwood Hospital which is now operational.”

Canterbury DHB has an annual budget of $1.417 billion – an increase of $331 million over the past eight years.

The Government has also provided the DHB with an extra $86 million to meet the additional costs of the earthquake recovery, including delivery of services like mental health. This includes a $16 million funding boost for 2015/16.

In addition to this the Government recently announced a $20 million package of initiatives to increase mental health support to the people of Canterbury.
