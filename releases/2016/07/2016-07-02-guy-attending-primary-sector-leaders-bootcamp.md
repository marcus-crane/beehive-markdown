Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy departs for Stanford University today to attend a primary sector leaders bootcamp, focused on developing collaboration and innovation. 

“The week-long conference is part of the Te Hono movement, bringing together Chief Executives and leaders with a vison to accelerate the transformation of the primary sector by adding value and creating demand,” says Mr Guy.

“As a Government we have a goal of doubling the value of primary sector exports by 2025 and sector leaders share our ambition to explore new ways of collaboration and building capability in our people.

“The Stanford Bootcamp has been run annually since 2012 and gives us a unique opportunity to use Stanford University business professors and world renowned entrepreneurs and business leaders.

“It provides a platform to understand key trends for innovation, technology and investment, and how to identify the opportunities and challenges the primary sector faces.”

The Te Hono Movement started in 2012 as the New Zealand Primary Sector Bootcamp and now comprises diverse alumni of more than 130 chief executives and leaders, representing 80% of the New Zealand primary sector.

Two young winners of an Emerging Leaders Scholarship will also be attending. Bruce Hunter and Daniel Boulton are recipients of the inaugural scholarship which is sponsored by the Ministry for Primary Industries, AGMARDT (The Agricultural and Marketing Research and Development Trust), and Te Hono Movement.

Mr Guy will be in the United States from 2 – 10 July and also meeting US primary industries representatives in the areas of irrigation, agri-tech, viticulture and the red meat sector.
