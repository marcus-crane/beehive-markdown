Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says a Bill to expand the Youth Service has passed its final reading in Parliament today.

The Social Security (Extension of Young Persons Services and Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill expands the wraparound support provided by the Youth Service to all 19-year-old parents and 18 and 19-year-olds at significant risk of long term welfare dependence.

“This Government is committed to better supporting young people to reach their potential and ensuring they have the skills and knowledge to lead successful lives,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Budget 2016 invests $61.2 million in the expansion of the Youth Service so that more young people are still able to access the intensive support service and providers are able to work with their clients for longer.

“The Youth Service pairs young people up with a youth coach who helps them to find or stay in education, training or employment and works with them to manage their budget and meet their obligations.

“We know that 75 per cent of the future cost of current benefit system clients is attributable to those who first go onto a benefit before age 20 and that they spend, on average, the longest time on welfare.

“We also know that children who grow up in benefit dependent homes are more likely to be notified to Child, Youth and Family, receive a benefit as a young person and are less likely to achieve NCEA Level 2.

“This Bill is about putting practical measures in place to assist our most at-risk young people and their families so they have better long term outcomes and are able to thrive,” Mrs Tolley says.
