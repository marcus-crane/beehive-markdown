Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that Halswell Residential College in Christchurch will become fully co-educational from next year.

Since 2014, the boys’ school has been able to take up to five girls, or 40 percent of its roll. The school has a waiting list of female students whose families wish them to attend a co-educational school.

“Making Halswell Residential College fully co-educational will make its services available to more of our young people with the highest needs,” says Ms Parata.

The college provides a stable and nurturing learning environment for children and young people with high and complex needs. Students are supported by highly-trained staff with specialist resources.

Two independent reports have confirmed that Halswell can safely provide for boys and girls.

“My decision comes after consultation with parents, the community and the education and health and disability sectors,” says Ms Parata.

“The need for residential schooling has been significantly reduced by the Intensive Wraparound Service (IWS), which successfully supports children with the highest needs to live and learn in their own schools and communities. Most families find this is the best option. However, residential schooling remains available for children in the IWS programme, and a co-educational Halswell will continue to meet this need.”

Halswell Residential College is currently undergoing a $9m upgrade as part of the Christchurch rebuild. This includes four new family-style villas to accommodate up to 32 students.
