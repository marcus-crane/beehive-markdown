Statistics Minister Craig Foss is counting down the days until the 2018 Census — 613.

The Government Statistician today announced, by proclamation from the Governor General, that the next census will be held on Tuesday 6 March 2018.

“The census provides the Government, iwi, businesses and our communities with robust and independent data that is invaluable for making smart evidence-based decisions,” Mr Foss says.

“For example, the last count in 2013 told us that, if New Zealand was a village of 100 people, 24 were born overseas, 21 had a tertiary qualification, and two were machinery operators and drivers.

“For 2018, Statistics NZ is building new, responsive mobile versions of the census forms, along with tablet and desktop versions, to make it as easy as possible for all Kiwis to access and complete their forms.

“We’re aiming for 70 per cent of forms to be completed online. This is an ambitious goal, doubling the 34 per cent achieved in 2013.

“Collecting census data online means Statistics NZ can produce the census counts and other robust census-related information much, much faster. 

“Each week day I tweet an interesting or quirky fact based on Statistics NZ data — much of which comes from the census — using #statsfacts.  I’m looking forward to seeing how we’ve changed since 2013,” Mr Foss says.

Paper forms will still be available for those who prefer them.
