The Government and the transport sector are better placed to understand and meet future challenges with the release of the Transport Domain Plan and Research Strategy, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

Mr Foss launched the two complementary documents during an event at Parliament this afternoon.

“Each year, central and local government invest over $5 billion in developing, operating and maintaining our transport system. This investment relies on a foundation of high quality information,” Mr Foss says.

“The new Domain Plan will ensure the sector has access to more comprehensive data and information, while the Research Strategy will guide investment in research that better meets our future transport needs.

“We have some significant transport challenges ahead. These two documents will help us understand those challenges and how we can best manage, plan for and invest in a smarter, safer and more efficient transport system.

“The way we travel in 20 years is likely to be very different from the way we travel now. The Domain Plan and Research Strategy provide a new direction for transport research and will help, through high-quality data, ensure New Zealand is ready to meet and embrace changes within the transport sector.”
