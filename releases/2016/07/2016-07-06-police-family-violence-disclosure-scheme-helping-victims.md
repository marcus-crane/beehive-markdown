The new Police Family Violence Information Disclosure Scheme is providing victims and potential victims with the information they need to leave potentially dangerous situations, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

A total of 38 cases have been referred to the scheme since it was launched in December 2015.

A request for the disclosure may be made to the Police by the partner of the potentially violent person, or a concerned third party.

“People have the right to know about a partner or potential partner’s violent past in order to make an informed decision about their own safety and whether or not they want to continue that relationship,” Ms Collins says.

“In the past there have been too many cases where concerned family and friends have not been able to find out that important information. Now they have that ability and their friends and loved ones are safer as a result.”

Police can also proactively release family violence information if they believe someone is at risk from their partner. Police have done this 21 times since the scheme was launched.

Responding to family violence accounts for 41 per cent of a frontline Police Officer’s time.

“New Zealand’s rate of domestic violence is far too high. Every person has a right to feel safe, especially in their own home, and this Government is committed to protecting our most vulnerable.”
