Police Minister Judith Collins has congratulated New Zealand Police on its success at last night’s IPANZ Public Sector 2016 Excellence Awards.

New Zealand Police was the winner in ‘building trust and confidence in government’, as a result of its ongoing initiative Enhancing Trust and Confidence through culture change at NZ Police.

“Earning public trust and confidence goes to the heart of New Zealand Police and the work it does to keep our communities safe.

“Police work hard every day to build and maintain public trust and confidence and this is evident with trust and confidence increasing from 69 per cent in 2007/8 to 78 per cent in 2014/15.

“Continued efforts to improve diversity and inclusion have also been a success, helping to strengthen a workforce that more visibly reflects the diverse communities it serves.

“This award recognises the benefits of this modern approach to policing and the importance of Police working closely and openly with government and other agencies to best serve New Zealanders,” Ms Collins said.
