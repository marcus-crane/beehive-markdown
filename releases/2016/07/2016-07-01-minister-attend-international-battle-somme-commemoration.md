Social Development Minister Anne Tolley will today represent the New Zealand Government at the International Battle of the Somme Commemorative Service in Thiepval, France.

The commemoration, organised by the French and British governments, marks a hundred years to the day since the battle began on 1 July 1916.

The New Zealand Division joined the battle in September 1916. It’s estimated that there were 8000 New Zealand casualties at the Somme, including 2000 troops who were killed, in what was the division’s first major engagement on the Western Front.

“I am honoured to be representing New Zealand as we pay tribute to the memory of the many thousands who served our country,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This is a very emotional day. Both of my grandfathers survived the Battle of the Somme, and I will proudly be wearing their war medals today. Many other men did not make it back home, and they will be at the forefront of our minds on this poignant occasion.”

Services to mark New Zealand’s involvement in the Battle of the Somme will take place on 15 September in Longueval, France.
