Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says patients with musculoskeletal conditions like arthritis are being seen by new mobility action teams.

“The Government invested $6 million in Budget 2015 to create community based multi-disciplinary early intervention teams,” says Dr Coleman.

“The first Mobility Action Teams projects are now accepting patients in Counties Manukau, South Canterbury and Bay of Plenty.

“There are many people with arthritis where early intervention in a community setting is appropriate. These Mobility Action Teams can provide a range of services such as physiotherapy, exercise programmes, dietary advice, and self-management support.

“The strength of this approach is that it draws professionals together from across the sector, including DHBs, physiotherapy practices and public/ private collaborations. It’s also tailored to what each local community needs.”

Active+ in Counties Manukau is running a community based group exercise and education programme to help people better manage hip and knee osteoarthritis.

Physiotherapy Primary Intervention Group in South Canterbury is building on its long-running early intervention programme for people with early to moderate hip and knee osteoarthritis.

Body in Motion in the Bay of Plenty is taking groups referred by their GP through a programme of education, exercise, and nutrition advice, equipping people with the tools to continue independently beyond the programme.

There are also Mobility Action Teams based in Northland, Hutt Valley/Mid-Central, and Canterbury.

Seven Mobility Action Team projects were selected by the Ministry of Health from nearly 50 proposals.

A second series of projects from more than 30 applicants are now under consideration by the Ministry of Health.
