Queenstown’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) build is complete, and over 7000 households and businesses are now able to connect to faster and more reliable internet, says Communications Minister Amy Adams.

In Queenstown today to mark the completion of the rollout, Ms Adams says over 1200 connections have already been made to New Zealand’s growing fibre network.

“The UFB build is New Zealand’s biggest infrastructure build that’s being delivered on time and within budget,” says Ms Adams.

“Queenstown is the nineteenth completed build and total investment is nearly $10 million.”

Six schools in Queenstown are able to connect to UFB and N4L, including the new Wakatipu High Frankton Flats School, which is under construction.

“UFB helps amplify the tourist experience in Queenstown, as visitors can share their travels domestically or internationally. It also helps tourism businesses in remote locations to promote themselves and take advantage of New Zealand’s tourism industry,” says Ms Adams.

The UFB rollout in Queenstown began in September 2012.

Since the UFB initiative began, the Government has allocated a further $360 million to extend faster broadband across New Zealand, and cover mobile blackspots.

The UFB build is now complete in 19 towns and cities. The first stage of the initiative will enable at least 75 per cent of New Zealanders to access fibre to the premise by 2019, with UFB phase two extending reach by at least an additional five per cent.

**Background:**

Towns now complete: Whangarei, Te Awamutu, Oamaru, Cambridge, Tokoroa, Hawera, Ashburton, Blenheim, Whanganui, Taupō, Timaru, Greymouth, Masterton, New Plymouth, Tauranga, Hamilton, Waiuku, Rotorua and Queenstown.
