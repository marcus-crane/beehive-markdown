Justice Minister Amy Adams has today announced the Government’s response to a Parliamentary Select Committee report on the 2014 General Election.

After each General Election, as a matter of routine, the Justice and Electoral Select Committee conducts an inquiry, and makes recommendations for potential changes to electoral laws and administrative procedures.

The Select Committee’s report made 28 unanimous recommendations about issues including voter enrolment, participation and turnout, voting and Election Day processes, as well as broadcasting and election advertising.

"The Committee’s inquiries help ensure that electoral law and processes can be adapted to reflect lessons learnt from previous elections, and to keep pace with changing public expectations,” says Ms Adams.

”The Government will look at how to best implement the three inquiry recommendations that do not require changes to the law.  In particular, we will encourage agencies and stakeholders to work more closely with the Electoral Commission to increase voter enrolment and turnout.”

The Government will consider the inquiry’s recommendations about election broadcasting as part of its review of media content regulation.

 “The Government generally supports the remaining recommendations that require changes to the Electoral Act and/or regulations. We are working through these to establish what practical changes can realistically be put in place before the 2017 General Election.”

“I expect to introduce an Electoral Amendment Bill into the House shortly to implement those recommendations,” Ms Adams says.

"I thank the Committee for its thorough consideration of the issues and the more than 200 people and organisations who made submissions."
