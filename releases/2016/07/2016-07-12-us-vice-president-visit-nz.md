Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the announcement that United States Vice President Joe Biden will make an official visit to New Zealand next week.

“New Zealand places great value on its relationship with the United States and the Vice President’s visit is an opportunity to discuss key regional and international issues,” Mr Key says.

“Vice President Biden’s visit will allow us to discuss ways we can work closer together on issues like economic and trade ties, as well as international peace and security matters.”

Vice President Biden and his delegation arrive in New Zealand on Wednesday 20 July for a series of official engagements on Thursday 21 July.
