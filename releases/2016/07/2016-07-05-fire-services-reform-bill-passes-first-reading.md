The Bill to modernise New Zealand’s fire services has passed its first reading and heralds the most significant change in the sector for 70 years, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The Fire and Emergency New Zealand Bill will amalgamate more than 40 separate organisations, 600 fire brigades and forces, 12,000 volunteers, and 3000 paid staff into a single unified fire services organisation, to be set up on 1 July 2017.

“This landmark legislation, the first comprehensive reform package since the aftermath of the Ballantyne’s fire in 1947, will give the legal mandate for all the work that the modern firefighter does, including search and rescue, responding to flooding, and call-outs to road accidents.

“It introduces a more transparent and fairer way to fund fire services, by expanding the pool of people contributing to the fire levy, which will be the principal source of funding for urban and rural fire services.

“Local committees will support Fire and Emergency New Zealand to provide fire services that reflect the risks and needs of different communities.

“Our fire workforce of career firefighters and volunteers will be supported and valued,” Mr Dunne said..

In April the Minister announced funding of $303 million over five years to fund the changes, including money to address gaps in rural fire services and to better support fire volunteers.

“We are committed to building a world class fire organisation that delivers services for the community, in the community and by the community. I believe this legislation will deliver that goal,” said Mr Dunne.

New Zealanders will have the opportunity to have their say on the Bill when the Government Administration Select Committee calls for submissions in the next few days.
