Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has awarded a number of grants to enable more Kiwi kids to play winter sport.

“Participating in sport is a key part of a Kiwi childhood. It helps keep our kids active, making them healthier and happier, and teaches them valuable life skills,” says Dr Coleman.

“However, for some kids and their families the costs associated with sport, such as gear, uniforms and membership fees, are a real barrier to participating and competing.

“To help with this, I partnered with the iSport Foundation to distribute the $44,000 Sport and Recreation Discretionary Fund to Kiwi kids who need a hand to reach their sporting goals.”

Almost half of the fund went towards providing grants of up to $100 for 175 deserving kids across New Zealand aged between 12-18 years of age to help pay for their gear and fees.

Twenty-nine of the $100 grants have gone to Ruapehu College, a decile 2 school at the foot of Mt Ruapehu in Ohakune.

“In Ruapehu College’s two rugby teams a number of players have been playing in borrowed boots. These grants mean that this winter players will be on the field in well-fitting boots,” said Dr Coleman.

A further $4,400 was shared between four high schools:

- Waitakere College received $4,000 worth of sporting equipment and $1,000 towards sports uniforms.
- Papakura High received $2,900 for sporting equipment.
- Dannevirke High School received $2,400 to help the rugby, football, netball, basketball teams travel to games away from school.
- Dargaville High School received $1,500 towards rugby fees and uniforms for the 1st XV and $1,500 towards entry fees and transport for their basketball teams.

The fund also went towards supporting a small number of promising youth athletes.

The iSport Foundation, founded by former All Black greats Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Ali Williams, has been supporting 12-18 year olds achieve their sporting goals since 2009. They do this by providing grants and a crowdfunding platform, sports gear, leadership and inspiration
