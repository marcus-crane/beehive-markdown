The Ministry of Youth Development’s Small Communities Youth Grant Fund will receive $30,000 each year for the next three years, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“Today’s announcement represents an increase of $10,000 per year on the previous fund, as well as a commitment to support the fund until at least 2019,” says Ms Kaye.

The Small Communities Youth Grant Fund aims to support young people residing in New Zealand’s small island communities to develop skills, knowledge and experience, to participate confidently, and contribute positively in their communities.

This fund provides one-off partial funding of $2,000-$5,000 targeted at youth-led initiatives and activities, organised for and by young people aged 12 to 24 years.

“There are around 1,300 young people aged 12 to 24 years living in offshore communities such as the Chatham Islands, Great Barrier Island and Stewart Island,” says Ms Kaye.

“It can sometimes be difficult for young people living in these communities to access the same opportunities as their peers on the mainland, and increasing the fund will facilitate further initiatives in areas such as leadership, mentoring and volunteering.

“Under the new direction for youth development in New Zealand which I announced last November, the Government will increase the number of youth development opportunities from 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with the overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.

“The extension of the Small Communities Youth Grant fund fits with this goal, and helps ensure we create opportunities for all young people to realise their potential.”
