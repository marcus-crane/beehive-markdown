Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced that entries are invited for the 2016 Prime Minister’s Science Prizes.

“These prizes are New Zealand’s most valuable science awards and they were introduced to raise the profile and prestige of science,” Mr Joyce says. “They celebrate transformative science and innovation and scientific achievement, and aim to attract more young people into science careers.”

2016 is the eighth year the five prizes will be awarded:

- Prime Minister’s Science Prize: $500,000
- Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize: $200,000
- Prime Minister’s Science Teacher Prize: $150,000
- Prime Minister’s Science Communication Prize: $100,000
- Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Prize: $50,000

“Science plays a vital role in creating opportunities and solving problems faced across New Zealand. These prizes underline the importance of science and innovation for New Zealand’s future, which is also reflected in the budget investment this year of an additional $410.5 million in science and innovation,” Mr Joyce says.

The 2015 Prime Minister’s Science Prize winner was the Bone and Joint Research Group from the University of Auckland. The team has had a substantial impact on clinical practice in New Zealand and internationally through first-line treatments for the prevention of osteoporosis, and internationally, the team’s research is estimated to be saving billions of dollars in reduced prescription costs.

“This is an important opportunity to fund and recognise science that makes a real difference here and around the world,” Mr Joyce says. “I look forward to this year’s entries and to the continuing encouragement that these prizes provide.”

Entries are open from 4 July until 16 September 2016. The Future Scientist Prize will close on 3 October 2016. All prizes will be awarded in February 2017. For more information go to [www.pmscienceprizes.org.nz](http://www.pmscienceprizes.org.nz/).
