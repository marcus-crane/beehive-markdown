One year on from the announcement of the government statement on Building Financial Capability in New Zealand, good progress is being made says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“Increasing levels of financial capability will allow people to better shape their lives, avoid hardship and achieve their goals,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Commission for Financial Capability (CFFC) and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) lead the cross-agency work which, in its first year, has delivered research and a range of programmes.

“Over the past year there has been a considerable increase in levels of collaboration among Government agencies,” says Mr Goldsmith. This collaboration has been invaluable in the delivery of projects including:

- The review of the Financial Advisers Act, which aims to ensure that New Zealanders can access quality financial advice that will help them plan and prepare for their savings and investment goals.
- Redesign of face-to-face budgeting services, to help build the levels of financial capability among the thousands of New Zealanders who engage with government budgeting services.
- The development and delivery of programmes tailored for Māori and Pasifika communities including those through the Tāmaki Regeneration Company.
- Rollout of the New Zealand Defence Force and NZ Police staff programmes led by CFFC dedicated to improving the financial capability of many of our key public servants.
- Completion of FMA and CFFC research into issues around attitudes and preparedness for retirement within the 50+ demographic. This research crystallised the fiscal, policy and practical challenges of a growing proportion of the population being unprepared to fund their own retirement. It also raised awareness about attitudes to investment and risk to help New Zealanders make better decisions.

“Last week I announced the allocation of $900,000 for the upscaling of the Māori financial capability pilot programmes. This is a great example of cross-agency work, where programmes are trialled, evaluated and expanded if they make a difference,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“The government is committed to supporting New Zealanders increase their levels of financial capability and I am looking forward to seeing continued progress over the next 12 months.”
