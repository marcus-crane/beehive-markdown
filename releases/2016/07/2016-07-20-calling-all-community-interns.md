Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Jo Goodhew, has today announced the opening of the latest funding round for the Community Internship Programme.

“I strongly encourage community organisations to take this opportunity to gain new skills and knowledge, strengthening not only their organisation, but their ability to work effectively with other sectors and organisations for the benefit of their communities.

“The programme provides the chance for community groups to employ skilled professionals to help them develop the organisation and themselves.”

“The fund covers the salary of these skilled professionals, who take time out from their regular job for a set period to work for a community group and help them develop in an area where they feel they need assistance” says Mrs Goodhew.

“All three parties benefit; the community organisation, the intern and the home organisation, and it really helps strengthen the relationships which continue after the internship finishes.”

In the last round, ten internships were awarded in total covering a variety of organisations, most notably including;

- The YMCA of South and Mid Canterbury employed Angus Dyer, an accountant from KPMG, to implement a new reporting and accounting system, and provide training on using this system.  This will allow the YMCA to analyse their operations to provide future strategic direction.
- Lester Bridson, a Partnership Ranger from the Department of Conservation is working with Te Runanga o Te Rarawa to develop a plan for pest control in the Warawara Forest. In addition to the environmental benefits, the project will also help strengthen the treaty settlement relationship between the two organisations.

Applications for the Community Internship Programme open on 20 July 2016 and close on 31 August 2016, and successful internships can begin in early 2017. More information can be found at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
