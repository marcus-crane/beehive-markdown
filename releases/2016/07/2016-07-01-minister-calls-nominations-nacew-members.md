Minister for Women Hon Louise Upston is calling for nominations the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW).

NACEW’s purpose is to provide high quality advice and inform government policy development. It is directly responsible to the Minister for Women.

Ms Upston acknowledges the significant role NACEW has played in advocating for women in employment since its establishment in 1967 and appreciates the contribution of current and former members over the years.

Following advice from NACEW members and wider stakeholders, the terms of reference have been reviewed to refocus its role. “These changes will enhance the group’s ability to work directly with me to advocate on issues affecting women in employment and influence government policy,” she said.

“One of my key priorities is to improve employment outcomes for New Zealand women,” said Ms Upston.

“I am now seeking nominations for members who have a wide range of knowledge and experiences of matters relating to women’s employment. 

“I am particularly keen to appoint members who will bring a specific perspective on technology and science, as these will be important for the future of work, and on employment issues for Māori and Pacific women.”

NACEW will have a maximum of nine members, who will be appointed for up to three years. The current contributing partner organisations, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand, will have one member each appointed to the Council.
