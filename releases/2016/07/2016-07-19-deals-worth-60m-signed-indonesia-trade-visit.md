Trade Minister Todd McClay says the Prime Minister’s high-level New Zealand business delegation to Indonesia have signed deals worth more than NZ$60 million on the official two-day visit.

“This signals the increasing importance of business between the two countries, where two-way trade sits at $1.6 billion and is rapidly climbing,” says Mr McClay.

The six deals were signed between companies in the aviation, energy and e-commerce sectors.

New Zealand’s Ardmore Flying School signed two deals for pilot training and New Zealand energy company ETEL announced an investment in a Jakarta-based company that produces smart-grid transformers.

New Zealand renewable energy company PowerTechnology announced plans with Nusantara Pearl Group to convert their farms in Raja Ampat to solar hybrid power, and e-commerce company, and Matahari Mall announced plans to work with New Zealand company Fishpond to open up more than one million new products for sale to Indonesian consumers by the end of 2017.

“This relationship is thriving as New Zealand companies step forward with products and technology that supports Indonesia’s growth,” says Mr McClay.

“New Zealand companies are innovative and held in high regard around the world.

“I can only see further exciting opportunities for New Zealand companies in this market,” says Mr McClay.
