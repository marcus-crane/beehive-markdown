Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew today acknowledged the 20th Anniversary of the Food Treaty between Australia and New Zealand at a conference in Wellington hosted by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).

“The Food Treaty, implemented in 1996, was an important step towards enhancing trade between Australia and New Zealand, as part of Closer Economic Relations,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

“The Treaty has simplified two-way trade, and exporters on both sides now view each other’s markets as extensions of their domestic markets.

“The Treaty also committed Australia and New Zealand to developing the joint food standards code, through FSANZ, which underpins New Zealand’s food safety system,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Australia is a very important trading partner for New Zealand and our largest market for high-value product.  In 2015, two-way trade of food and beverage between the two countries totalled NZ$4.27 billion.

“The conference today hosted by FSANZ, celebrates the Food Treaty and brings together those involved in, and committed to, creating safe food.

“The Treaty exemplifies the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand.  It’s a success story for both Australia and New Zealand and is widely recognised as delivering extremely high standards of food safety while reducing unnecessary barriers to trade between our countries," Mrs Goodhew says.
