Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves Washington today to visit Honolulu, where he will meet with Admiral Harry Harris, Commander United States Pacific Command.

As part of his visit Mr Brownlee will be spending time with New Zealand Defence personnel, as well as visiting New Zealand ships and aircraft participating in the international maritime exercise, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC).

“RIMPAC is the world’s largest maritime exercise and it provides a valuable opportunity for New Zealand Defence Force personnel to exercise with other international partners,” Mr Brownlee says.

New Zealand’s contribution to this exercise includes the Royal New Zealand Navy frigate Te Kaha, the Littoral Warfare Unit, Air Surveillance and Reconnaissance Force and the New Zealand Army Light Rifle Platoon.

In addition, the RIMPAC amphibious task force is being led by Royal New Zealand Navy Commodore Jim Gilmour.

“This is a very important role and the fact that a Royal New Zealand Navy officer is in such a position speaks highly of the Navy’s professionalism and ability,” Mr Brownlee says.

While in Honolulu the Defence Minister will visit the Marine Corps Base Hawaii and visit the USS America.
