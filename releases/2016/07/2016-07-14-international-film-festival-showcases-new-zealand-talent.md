The 2016 New Zealand International Film Festival will showcase our thriving film industry and distinctive identity, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“Eight New Zealand feature films have their world premieres at the festival, with *Poi E: The Story of Our Song* by Tearepa Kahi a sold out opening night feature in both Auckland and Wellington,” Ms Barry says.

Launching in Auckland tonight, this year’s line-up brings more than 160 features and documentaries to the big screen in 13 towns and cities.

“The festival is a valuable opportunity for filmmakers to launch their work in New Zealand and take a share of the box office revenue,” Ms Barry says.

Alongside *Poi E*, other Kiwi-made premieres include *Le Ride*, the story of New Zealand cyclist Harry Watson’s 1928 Tour de France, and the Wellington-set love story *Chronesthesia*.

“The best of New Zealand’s 2016 short films and Ngā Whanaunga Māori Pasifika shorts will also be shown,” Ms Barry says. “Enabling developing filmmakers to participate helps support the future of the Kiwi film industry.”

The NZIFF is run by a charitable trust and supported with funding from the New Zealand Film Commission.

“New Zealanders enjoy the experience of going to the movies – we have one of the highest rates of film festival attendance in the world – and the Festival is both a true celebration of our culture and an opportunity to see some intriguing, exciting and moving films from around the world.”
