Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the release of an action plan which aims to get young people to get active and stay active.

“Participation in sport leads to a more active, healthier population and ultimately better social outcomes,” says Dr Coleman.

“While Kiwi kids have traditionally been active and sporty, around the world participation rates are falling and New Zealand is not immune.

“In 2014/15 11 per cent of all children aged 2-14 years were obese. Tackling obesity is a key priority for the Government. We are one of a few OECD countries with a comprehensive plan and an obesity target to support it.”

The Childhood Obesity Plan is being supported by Sport NZ’s launch of the Young People Plan 2015-20. This plan has been developed as part of Sport NZ’s Community Sport Strategy.

“The Young People Plan provides a vision for improving the quality of sport, physical activity and physical education experienced by young people,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Plan is about taking a fresh look at what we provide for young people to ensure they participate and develop a lifelong love of sport. That includes looking at why they stop playing, and how we change that.”

One of the core beliefs of the Plan is that community sport should be fun. Sport NZ have also released a companion document, *Let’s get fun*.

The Plan was today launched at the Physical Education NZ conference in Palmerston North. Further information about the Young People Plan 2015-20 is available on Sport NZ’s website, [www.sportnz.org.nz/youngpeople](http://www.sportnz.org.nz/youngpeople)
