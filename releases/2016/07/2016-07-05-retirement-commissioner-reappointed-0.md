Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today announced Diane Maxwell will be reappointed as the Retirement Commissioner for a further three-year term.

“I am pleased to reappoint Diane Maxwell as the Retirement Commissioner to continue her excellent work as head of the Commission for Financial Capability,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“During her first term as Commissioner, Ms Maxwell has overseen a strategic change at the Commission building towards financial capability for all generations of New Zealanders.

“She has led a number of initiatives, including the rebranding of the Sorted website, development of new online tools and developing resources tailored to the needs of different communities.

“Ms Maxwell will continue to build on the Commission’s work to enable New Zealanders from all walks of life to have the money skills to get ahead.

“Improved financial capability helps people make better financial decisions during their working lives, which leads to better income planning and security in their retirement,” says Mr Goldsmith.
