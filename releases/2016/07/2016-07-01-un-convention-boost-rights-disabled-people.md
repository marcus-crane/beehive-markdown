Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes the tabling of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) which was submitted to Parliament for consideration yesterday.

“The Protocol will provide New Zealand with a useful, independent, international source of expert feedback on areas of New Zealand’s disability policy and provides added protection to the rights of disabled people under the CRPD,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Protocol enables individuals or groups who claim to have had their rights breached under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to make a communication to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

“Accession also further signals New Zealand’s commitment to disability and wider human rights. Like-minded countries such as Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom have acceded to the Protocol.”

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation for promoting equal opportunity rights for disabled people. Accession to the Protocol build on that reputation,” Ms Wagner says.
