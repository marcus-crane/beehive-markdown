Prime Minister John Key had a positive meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Jakarta today.

“New Zealand and Indonesia have a strong and growing relationship,” says Mr Key.  “Indonesia is our 13th largest trading partner. It has a population of over 250 million people and has significant human and natural resources so we see great opportunities to work together more closely in a number of areas.

“That’s why last year our Governments agreed to the target of increasing two-way trade to $4 billion by 2024 - from around $2 billion currently.”

Mr Key and President Widodo discussed a wide range of issues, including the regional economy, the South China Sea, counter-terrorism efforts, people-smuggling, the situation in Papua and broader human rights issues.

“We made good progress with regard to trade access for New Zealand beef products and believe this will be resolved in the coming months.”

Mr Key also launched two new education initiatives and signed a renewable energy agreement with Indonesia.

“New Zealand helped build Indonesia’s first geothermal power plant in the 1980s. Today we signed a renewable energy and energy conservation agreement which will see New Zealand assist Indonesia in its ambition to increase renewable energy to 25 per cent of its total energy supply by 2025. 

“The New Zealand Government will contribute up to $30 million over the next five years for geothermal training and technical assistance, and support to help Indonesia access renewable energy in Maluku, Eastern Indonesia.”

Mr Key and President Widodo also agreed to work together more closely in tourism, and to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and promote sustainable fisheries governance.

“It is clear there are a range of opportunities for New Zealand and Indonesia to work together,” says Mr Key. “So I am pleased that today the President and I have asked officials to explore the possibility of developing a Comprehensive Partnership between our two countries.”

The two new education initiatives announced today are:

- $2.3 million a year for increased training support, including new short-term training scholarships, English language training awards, and increased post-graduate scholarships. This takes New Zealand’s total investment in training to $6.3 million a year.
