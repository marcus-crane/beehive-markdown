Prime Minister John Key had a successful meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Rome today where they discussed a wide range of issues including the regional economy, trade and counter terrorism.

“This is my first visit to Rome as Prime Minister and I am encouraged by the warmth and wide ranging cooperation that characterise our relationship with Italy,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand and Italy share similar views on many political, environmental and international security challenges, and there’s enthusiasm on both sides to strengthen the relationship further.

“Italy is in the world’s top ten largest economies and today’s meeting was a good opportunity to discuss further trade and economic opportunities, including through a New Zealand-EU Free Trade Agreement.

“Prime Minister Renzi expressed strong support for a New Zealand -EU Free Trade Agreement and the opportunities it would provide.

“We agreed to stay in close contact as we continue to move towards the launch of formal negotiations.”

Mr Key congratulated Prime Minister Renzi on Italy securing a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for 2017.

“Italy is an important partner for New Zealand, and we work closely together on key global challenges, such as counter-terrorism and the fight against ISIL.

“New Zealand has learned a great deal from its time on the Council.  I made it clear to Prime Minister Renzi that New Zealand stands ready to provide Italy with whatever assistance it can as it prepares for its coming Council term.”
