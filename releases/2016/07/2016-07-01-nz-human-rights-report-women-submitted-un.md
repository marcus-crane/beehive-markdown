Minister for Women Louise Upston has submitted the Government’s latest report to the United Nations on New Zealand’s efforts to eliminate discrimination against women.

New Zealand is required to periodically report on the country’s performance under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This is the eighth report New Zealand has provided since ratifying the Convention in 1985.

Ms Upston says the Government has made steady progress in improving outcomes for women and building on the fundamental guarantees provided by CEDAW.

“The report responds to specific issues raised by the Committee, and outlines significant developments in recent years related to women’s civil, political and economic rights,” says Ms Upston.

“New Zealand women do well on a number of economic indicators, with high participation and completion rates in tertiary education, and high workforce participation and employment rates,” says Ms Upston.

“Government agencies have taken concerted action to reduce violence against women.”

Ms Upston said the report had been extensively consulted on with the wider New Zealand public and the feedback received had been considered as part of the final report.

“As an active player in the United Nations, we are committed to meeting our obligations under the human rights treaties that we are signed up to.

“New Zealand has a strong human rights track record, but we welcome opportunities to identify and address areas where there is room for improvement,” says Ms Upston.

New Zealand will be asked to appear before the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to be examined on the report in 2017. Following this examination the Committee issue concluding observations outlining any concerns and recommendations.

The report is available on the Ministry for Women’s website: [http://women.govt.nz/documents/cedaw-eighth-periodic-report-government-new-zealand-2016](http://women.govt.nz/documents/cedaw-eighth-periodic-report-government-new-zealand-2016).
