Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced two appointments to the new combined Waiariki Bay of Plenty Polytechnic council. Michael Chapman has been appointed as Deputy Chair, while Ian Macrae has been appointed as a member.

“I welcome the valuable knowledge and experience that these people will bring into their new roles. Both have extensive knowledge of The Bay and a deep connection to the region. I’m confident that they will contribute to the successful leadership of the polytechnic,” says Mr Joyce. 

“I also wish to thank Ian Turner, outgoing council member and former Deputy Chair, for the significant contribution he has made to tertiary education in the Bay of Plenty region. Mr Turner was appointed as Deputy Chair of the newly merged Waiariki Bay of Plenty Polytechnic earlier this year, having previously served as the Chair of the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic*.* I want to recognise the stability and continuity Ian has been able to contribute to the successful transition of the new entity.”

Waiariki Bay of Plenty Polytechnic continues to consult their community about their intended name and branding. A final decision is likely to be made later this year.
