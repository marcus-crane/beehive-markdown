Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging more people to put their names forward for this year’s local authority elections.

“Local government is a critical building block for national growth and prosperity. Councils manage more than $96 billion in fixed assets and contribute more than $8 billion to New Zealand’s GDP each year,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Effective Leadership means working hard and being a good listener, communicator, and collective decision-maker. There are many people in our communities with these qualities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

“As Minister for Pacific Peoples and Ethnic Communities I also want to encourage more diversity among candidates. There are more than 200 ethnicities in New Zealand and almost 345,000 Pacific people. Local democracy works more effectively when more people's voices are heard.”  

Nominations open tomorrow for district, city and regional councils, local and community boards, licensing trusts and district health boards.

Electoral officers are accepting nominations until 12pm on Friday 12 August.
