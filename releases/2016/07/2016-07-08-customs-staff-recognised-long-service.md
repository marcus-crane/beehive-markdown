Customs Minister Nicky Wagner congratulates 134 Customs officers nation-wide for their service to New Zealand and attended a medal and long service ceremony in Christchurch this morning.

“Collectively, the 139 receiving awards have served more than 3250 years’ to New Zealand. This vast experience and knowledge is crucial to ensuring that our borders remain well protected and safe,” Ms Wagner says.

“The role of Customs has evolved over time and continues to do so with the ever increasing travel and trade volumes. A record 11 million people crossed the border in the first 11 months this financial year and that number is expected to increase to around 12.7 million travellers per year from 2019 – 20% more than 2015.

“These Customs officers have seen a great deal of change during their time protecting the border and have used their skills and experience to adapt to a dynamic, fast growing environment.

“The New Zealand Customs’ Service Medal recognises 14 years of service, professional conduct, and contribution as a frontline Customs officer. Clasps to the medal are awarded for each subsequent seven years of frontline service.

“The ceremonies provide a great opportunity to honour Customs’ hard-working employees, and I congratulate all of those being recognised,”

“It’s a credit to New Zealand Customs to retain such long-serving officers. You can see why Customs came third in Randstad’s 2016 ‘Most Attractive Employer’ awards,” Ms Wagner says.

In this year’s ceremonies Customs staff receive a total of 31 New Zealand Customs Service Medals, 38 Clasps to the medal and 70 long service awards.
