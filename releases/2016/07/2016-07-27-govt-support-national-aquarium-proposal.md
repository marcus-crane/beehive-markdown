Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced Government support for a proposal to expand the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier to include marine research and create high-skilled, science-based employment.

“The Government is committing $50,000 toward scoping the feasibility of the proposal,” Mr Joyce says. ”It’s a very big project that would require central and local government plus the private sector to all get in behind it. However it could be a significant boost for tourism in the region and for New Zealand’s overall science infrastructure.”

The initiative is part of Matariki – Hawke’s Bay Regional Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan 2016, which aims to accelerate job growth and build innovation in the region.

“What is envisaged is a world-class aquarium that is both a visitor attraction and a conservation-focused research hub,” Mr Joyce says.

“The proposed expansion includes creating the largest and deepest research display tanks in New Zealand, with a submersible lift that will take visitors under water. Full scale living laboratories will enable scientists to study marine and fresh water ecosystems where environmental variables can be controlled.

“The aquarium has the potential to boost jobs and economic growth through tourism, while enabling research that contributes to better, sustainable management of local fisheries.”

The proposed development includes new or expanded:

- display areas to improve the visitor experience
- breeding facilities and recovery programmes
- research laboratories and work spaces
- teaching and outreach facilities.

The project is being led by Napier City Council, in partnership with Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and Waikato University, along with several other public and research organisations.

Matariki – Hawke’s Bay Regional Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan 2016 has been developed by the region with central government support. It forms part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme.
