Smoke alarms installed in rental properties in Whanganui and Westport have already saved lives, proving the worth of new legislation requiring them in all rentals, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act were about saving lives, and already we’ve heard of two instances of smoke alarms installed in the past few weeks preventing tragedies.

“The legislation required all rental properties to have working smoke alarms by 1 July. A Whanganui property manager, prompted by publicity around the changes, had 27 long-life smoke alarms installed in properties in her portfolio on June 24 and just a day later one kicked into action.

“A tenant left his unit with food cooking on the stove and it filled with smoke, activating an alarm. Those in neighbouring units, including a family with three young children, raised the alarm and this early warning meant no damage was done – to property or lives,” Dr Smith says.

“Smoke alarms also proved their worth in Westport when a blaze broke out in a home rented to a family with five children. Everyone was asleep when the alarms, which had been checked by the owner before the family moved in a fortnight earlier, activated in the middle of the night.

“The home was gutted but the fact the family – and their dog – all escaped uninjured is testament to the worth of this new law, which also covers insulation, enforcement of standards and property abandonment.

“These are significant changes to our tenancy laws to ensure warmer, drier and safer homes for the one million New Zealanders who live in rental properties. These new requirements on smoke alarms and insulation will save 1000 lives in the next decade – and these stories of lucky escapes show they’re having an immediate impact.”
