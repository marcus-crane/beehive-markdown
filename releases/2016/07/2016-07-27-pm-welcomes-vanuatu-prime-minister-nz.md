Prime Minister John Key has today announced Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai will visit New Zealand in the second week of August.  

Prime Minister Salwai and his delegation will attend a series of events in Auckland, Wellington and Tauranga, including an official welcome at the Auckland War Memorial Museum on 11 August, followed by a wreath laying and bilateral talks.

“This will be Prime Minister Salwai’s first official visit to New Zealand as Prime Minister,” Mr Key says.

“New Zealand and Vanuatu have a warm relationship and Prime Minister Salwai’s visit provides a useful opportunity to discuss bilateral and regional issues of shared interest, including the upcoming Pacific Islands Forum.”

During his visit Mr Salwai will meet with other Cabinet ministers and members of the business community.  He will also visit ni-Vanuatu workers in Tauranga who are part of the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme.

Prime Minister Salwai will visit from 9 August to 13 August.
