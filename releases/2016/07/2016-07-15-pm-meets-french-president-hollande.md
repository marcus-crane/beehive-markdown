Prime Minister John Key has met with French President François Hollande and French Prime Minister Manuel Valls in Paris, and attended Bastille Day commemorations.

“France and New Zealand have a strong and a longstanding relationship,” says Mr Key. “The meetings with the President and Prime Minister were a good opportunity to discuss a number of areas of mutual interest.

“We discussed the global economy and the potential effects following the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.

“The EU is a key trade partner for New Zealand with two-way trade totalling more than $20.6 billion.

“I reiterated to the President the importance we attach to a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. He was very positive so we come away from this visit very optimistic we are on a good path.

“We also had a good discussion about Helen Clark’s bid for the United Nations Secretary-General position. The President was very positive about Helen Clark, her abilities and the role she could play.”

President Hollande invited New Zealand and Australia to attend this year’s Bastille Day commemorations to acknowledge the significant contribution they made during World War One.

This year’s Bastille Day commemorations coincide with the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. Around 15,000 New Zealand troops were involved in the battle. Over 2,000 were killed and another 6,000 injured.

“It was an honour to attend this year’s Bastille Day commemorations and reflect on the sacrifice our soldiers made,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key will visit the New Zealand Memorial in Longueval this weekend to pay his respects to the New Zealand soldiers who fought at the Somme. He will also visit the Arras tunnels.
