Trade Minister Todd McClay is traveling to Indonesia today to join the Prime Minister and a high-level business delegation for a two-day official visit.

“Indonesia is an important trade partner for New Zealand, and as our 11th largest export market offers significant trading opportunities. 

“Our two-way trade currently sits at $1.6 billion, and we're keen to explore ways to meet the target set by the two countries last year to boost trade to $4 billion by 2024,” says Mr McClay.

“We will be looking to further broaden our trade connections, including through the Prime Minister’s meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo and my own meeting with Indonesian Trade Minister Thomas Lembong.”   

Mr McClay spoke with Minster Lembong at last weekend’s G20 meeting in Shanghai and both ministers committed to further develop their government-to-government and business-to-business links.  

"With a population of 255 million, Indonesia offers significant opportunity to New Zealand exporters and we will be looking to capitalise on the Prime Minister's visit to open doors for New Zealand companies," says Mr McClay. 

While in Indonesia, Mr McClay will take part in business forums in Jakarta and Surabaya.  The Jakarta business forum will focus on the benefits of regional economic integration, including between ASEAN and New Zealand. The Surabaya business forum will aim to promote New Zealand’s economic relationship with East Java, Indonesia’s second most populous province.

“I look forward to working alongside the New Zealand business delegation to showcase New Zealand’s commercial expertise in areas of priority for Indonesia, including renewable energy, food and beverage, aviation, education and tourism,” says Mr McClay.
