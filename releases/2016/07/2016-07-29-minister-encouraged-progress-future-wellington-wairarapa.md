Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraged by progress made by local councils and communities in the wider Wellington region working with the Local Government Commission on the future of their local government structures.

The Local Government Commission has reported that there has been an extensive public engagement programme in the Wairarapa including public meetings, drop-in centres, a questionnaire and telephone survey. The Commission has been working closely with the four affected councils in the Wairarapa (Masterton, Carterton and South Wairarapa District Councils and the Greater Wellington Regional Council).

“I am particularly encouraged by the collaborative approach taken by the Commission in the region as it looks into the cost-effective provision of essential services and infrastructure such as transport and water. It is important that councils and communities have a say in how local government is arranged in their region. I am pleased to see the Commission is helping to make that happen” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

“The Better Local Services reforms will support this approach by providing a more flexible framework for the Commission, in consultation with councils and communities, to find local solutions to local challenges and opportunities. This collaborative approach is how I see the Commission continuing to work under the proposed legislation.”

“I encourage anyone with an interest in their local communities and how they are governed to participate in the process and I commend those who have done so. This is the best opportunity for local communities to participate in shaping the options for their future local government.”

“The Commission has made it clear that it will put any proposal out for further public consultation before any decisions are made.”
