Prime Minister John Key today announced Tonga Prime Minister Samuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva will visit New Zealand later this week.  

“I am very pleased to welcome Mr Pohiva to New Zealand on his first official visit as Prime Minister,” Mr Key says.

“New Zealand and Tonga have a strong relationship, built around our long history of cooperation and the significant Tongan population in New Zealand.

“As one of our closest neighbours, working together to advance Tonga’s development objectives with support from our aid programme is a key priority,” Mr Key says.   

Mr Pohiva will visit New Zealand between 27 – 30 July and will be formally welcomed in a ceremony at Government House in Auckland on 28 July. 

During his visit Mr Pohiva will take part in a wreath laying ceremony at Auckland War Memorial Museum and visit Tongan workers in Nelson who are part of the Recognised Seasonal Employers scheme.
