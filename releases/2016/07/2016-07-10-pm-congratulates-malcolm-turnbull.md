Prime Minister John Key has tonight congratulated Malcolm Turnbull on forming an Australian Government.

"I have been in regular contact with Prime Minister Turnbull since the election and have now congratulated him on retaining office,” says Mr Key

“Australia is our closest neighbour and biggest trading partner and like Prime Minister Turnbull I believe our countries should work even more closely together.

“Mr Turnbull and I have a strong and established working relationship which has seen both our countries benefit.

“I look forward to continuing to work with him on a range of issues including creating more trans-Tasman economic opportunities, supporting New Zealanders living in Australia and international security issues, such as our training mission in Iraq."
