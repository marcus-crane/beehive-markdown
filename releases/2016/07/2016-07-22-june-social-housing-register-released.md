The latest social housing register shows that the Government is working with vulnerable people to support their housing needs, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

Nationwide, applications on the housing register increased by 328 to 3,877 from the March to June 2016 quarter. The transfer register, or people already housed but wishing to move, increased by 99 to 1,135. Over the same period, the Auckland register increased by 24 applications.  

“The register constantly fluctuates as people are housed or their eligibility changes. Our frontline teams are working incredibly hard to get people into the right housing for their circumstances, as evidenced by 645 families that were housed in June,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Government has consistently said that agencies are ready to support people who are homeless or struggling with housing, so I am glad people who need help are talking to the Ministry of Social Development.

“I’m also thrilled that over 100 social housing tenants have now purchased their own homes as a result of tenancy reviews, leading more independent lives.

“My unwavering focus remains getting more people off the register and into housing, which is why this Government has a huge programme to boost the supply of social and affordable housing.”

The Government’s comprehensive plan to increase the supply of social housing and address housing issues for vulnerable people includes:

- Including the new places funded, and the homes Housing New Zealand and community housing providers are building, buying or leasing, there will be 3000 extra social houses in Auckland;
- Investing $41.1 million in emergency accommodation and a non-recoverable special needs grant to support those with the most urgent need for housing
- Giving people more options about where in New Zealand they can live by offering a relocation grant to people who struggle to afford the costs of moving
- Growing the community housing sector by making providers eligible to receive ongoing funding through the Income Related Rent Subsidy, and considering transferring some HNZ properties to them for ongoing use as social housing
- Freeing up properties for those in most pressing need through tenancy reviews, which has seen 609 people move into private accommodation and 103 purchase their own home
- Supporting people transition into greater independence in private accommodation by paying things like bond and letting fees
- Launched a dedicated housing service for young people who are homeless which also aims to help them gain the life skills needed to live independently.
