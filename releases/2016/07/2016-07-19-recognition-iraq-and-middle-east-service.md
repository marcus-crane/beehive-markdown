Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says two New Zealand General Service Medals have been instituted to recognise service in Iraq and the greater Middle East since 2014.

The New Zealand General Service Medal 2002 (Iraq 2015) recognises service in building the capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces.  The medal will be awarded to NZDF personnel who deploy on this training mission.

Around 100 NZDF personnel and some 300 Australian Defence Force troops have formed a joint training mission at Camp Taji, Iraq.

“This training is focused on individual skills, weapons handling, first aid, live-fire and close quarters marksmanship, obstacle breaching techniques, counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) tactics, and techniques for squad through to company-level operations, map reading, and team leadership,” Mr Brownlee says.

“These New Zealand men and women have delivered great results with their training in what has proved to be a tough environment.

“It is a testament to their commitment that they have delivered very tangible improvements in skills and attitudes in the Iraqi personnel they have trained.

“All New Zealanders can be proud of their efforts.”

The New Zealand General Service Medal 2002 (Greater Middle East) recognises service of 30 days or more on general regional security operations in the greater Middle East since 7 December 2014.

This medal will be awarded to NZDF personnel who deploy on general regional security operations in the Middle East.  It can also be awarded to those involved in supporting the training mission in Iraq from other locations in the Middle East.

Crews of the P-3K2 Orion maritime patrol aircraft and HMNZS Te Kaha,  serving as part of the Combined Task Force 150, which successfully identified and intercepted drug smugglers trafficking almost 260 kg of heroin in 2015, are eligible to be awarded the New Zealand General Service Medal 2002 (Greater Middle East).

Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General Tim Keating, said: “These NZDF personnel are representing New Zealand well in a wide range of roles across the Middle East.

“Often working as a small part of a Coalition Headquarters or formation, they are regarded highly by our allies and the general comments I hear are that they are punching well above their weight.”

Mr Brownlee says 640 personnel will be awarded these medals in the coming months.  Another 100 personnel currently deployed to Camp Taji, and the 40 personnel supporting operations from other locations in the Middle East, will receive their medals when they return to New Zealand later this year.
