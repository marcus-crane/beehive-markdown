Associate Minister of Conservation Nicky Wagner welcomes the Awaroa beach property becoming part of the Abel Tasman National Park today after its purchase through a Givealittle campaign.

Ms Wagner, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and West Coast based MP Maureen Pugh are today at the Awaroa beach for a celebration of it being gifted to the nation.

“Today is a special day for New Zealand as we come together to celebrate the purchase this stunning beach. It’s a victory for positive people power and for preserving our environment. All those who contributed have given a wonderful gift to our nation. It is now protected forever with public access guaranteed,” Ms Wagner says.

“This beach land is now in the Abel Tasman National Park thanks to Duane Major and Adam Gard’ner and the more than 39,200 people and organisations who generously donated more than $2.2 million through the Givealittle campaign. Thanks also goes to the Joyce Fisher Charitable Trust for its $250,000 donation.

“A Government contribution of $350,000 from the Nature Heritage Fund helped secure the property’s purchase.

“Abel Tasman National Park is New Zealand’s smallest national park which attracts the greatest number of visitors. The purchase of the beach property is an outstanding addition to the park that all visitors will now be able to enjoy.

“I congratulate Duane and Adam for their successful crowd funding campaign to buy the land. They inspired New Zealanders to give and together fulfil the dream of taking the property out of private hands and into public ownership.

“The Department of Conservation, as the manager of the national park, has discussed with Duane and Adam, manawhenua iwi and others how this newest part of the park will be managed. It is intended to be a place people enjoy for its natural beauty and peaceful setting on day visits. DOC will liaise closely with Duane and Adam in implementing the plans for the site. 

“It is planned to restore its sand dune ecology and improve the habitat it provides for coastal birds such as oystercatchers, dotterel and godwits. This will include clearing weeds and replanting appropriate native species in the dunes and kanuka forest.

“New Zealander’s can be proud that they rallied together to raise the funds to buy this beach for all to enjoy as public land,” Ms Wagner says.
