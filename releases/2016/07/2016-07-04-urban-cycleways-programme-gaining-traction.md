Nine of the Government’s Urban Cycleways are complete one year on since the programme was launched, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Through the Urban Cycleways Programme, central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.

In total 54 projects are being funded under the programme nationwide. Of these, 13 are under construction, eight are in the design phase and 24 are under investigation.

“This investment by Government has meant that many cycling projects were able to get underway much quicker than had originally been planned,” Mr Bridges says.

“A year ago I opened the Longburn Shared Pathway in Palmerston North, the first cycleway funded under the programme. Since then, nine projects have been completed in Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch, with many more either under construction or significantly advanced.

“The Longburn Shared Pathway, like others supported by the Urban Cycleways Programme around the country, has built on and expanded the existing cycling network.”

Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a priority.

“Cycling is an important part of an effective integrated transport network, it creates more vibrant and connected communities, it’s good for tourism and it’s a fun, healthy way to get around. We are committed to continuing to support cycling by building on the momentum of the Urban Cycleways Programme.”
