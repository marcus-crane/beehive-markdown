Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today launched EmployAbility, an employment programme to assist people with health conditions and disabilities into work to take place in the Bay of Plenty.

“Work and Income will match clients with a health condition or disability to jobs that suit their particular skills. Once a person gets a job, we’ll offer ongoing support to them and their employer, to help ensure it’s successful for everyone,” Ms Wagner says.

“EmployAbility is an extension of the successful Christchurch-based employment programme, Project 300, which saw 584 people get into work.

“What we learnt from Project 300 is that engaging with and supporting both employers and employees helps to form a mutually beneficial relationship. It’s about matching the right person to the right job.

“People with health conditions and disabilities tell me that they want the same opportunity to work that other people have and that having a job is important to them.

“Having a job is more than just earning a living. Working gives people confidence and independence. It helps them build a better future for them and their family. It connects them with the community.

“EmployAbility helps employers build successful businesses, great teams and stronger communities. We want to hear from employers about the support they need to help them employ people with health conditions and disabilities, and what they need to become a disability confident employer,” Ms Wagner says.
