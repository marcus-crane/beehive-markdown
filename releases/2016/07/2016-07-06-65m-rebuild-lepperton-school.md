Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that Lepperton School in North Taranaki will be entirely rebuilt in a different location on the existing school grounds.

“This represents a significant upscaling of the redevelopment project for the school which I announced last July,” says Ms Kaye.

“It was originally planned to replace a number of existing classrooms and remediate other buildings.

“However, following master planning it was determined that additional teaching space is required to help the school cater to population growth in the local community.

“This has changed the scale of the project and means it is now more cost-effective to replace all the current buildings, a number of which are affected by weathertightness issues.

“The revised project will see an additional $2.74 million investment, on top of the $3.76 million approved for the redevelopment announced last year.

“A new multipurpose facility will be built under one roof, encompassing eight learning spaces as well as administration and library areas. The design will be flexible to enable further roll growth to be accommodated in the future if necessary.

“As well as the new building, new drop-off areas will also be created to help ensure the safety of students.

“Because the new school will be located on a different part of the existing school site, teaching and learning will be able to continue uninterrupted in the current buildings throughout the duration of the rebuild.

“This is an exciting project which shows the Government is committed to responding to and meeting roll growth, and upgrading school facilities to provide innovative and inspiring learning environments.”

Today’s announcement follows a $2.2 million investment announced in June that will see six new classrooms built at Mangorei School and Te Pi’ipi’inga Kakano Mai Rangiatea, also in Taranaki.

Construction at Lepperton School is expected to start in mid 2017 and take around 14 months to complete.

**Notes**

**About Lepperton School**

Lepperton School, which dates back to 1870, is a co-educational primary school.

The rebuild will enable the school to accommodate 180 students.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
