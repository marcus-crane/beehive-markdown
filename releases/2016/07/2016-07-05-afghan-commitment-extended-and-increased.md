The New Zealand Defence Force’s (NZDF) commitment of trainers to the Afghan National Army Officer Academy has been extended to June 2018, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“Since late 2013 the NZDF has contributed eight personnel to the academy to assist in building the capacity of the Afghan National Army.

“In addition to the extension, Cabinet has agreed to a request for the number of personnel deployed to be increased to 10.

“New Zealand Defence Force personnel are doing a good job helping develop the junior leaders of the Afghan National Army.

“These young leaders are necessary for the development of an enduring, professional army.

“To date 1651 troops have graduated from the academy since October 2013,” Mr Brownlee says.

The academy, led by the United Kingdom and situated just outside Kabul, forms part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces and institutions.

“NATO Ministers have made a decision to sustain the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan beyond 2016,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This decision will allow New Zealand to stand alongside our partners in supporting stability in Afghanistan and countering the threat of international terrorism.”
