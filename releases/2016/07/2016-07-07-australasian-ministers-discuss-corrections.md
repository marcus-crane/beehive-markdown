Corrections Minister Judith Collins will discuss issues of common interest with her Australian counterparts in Wellington this week.

Ms Collins will attend the Corrective Services Ministers' Conference, which is being hosted by New Zealand on 7-8 July.

The Conference brings together all Australian state, territory, and New Zealand ministers responsible for correctional services.

"These meetings will be a valuable opportunity to focus on corrections issues faced by governments on both sides of the Tasman and discuss developments in the management of offenders," said Ms Collins.

“As Ministers, we represent some of the world’s leading corrections systems. Each of us is committed to maintaining public safety and holding offenders to account, while providing opportunities for offenders to turn their lives around. In these objectives we face common challenges, and share common opportunities.”

An issue of particular importance to New Zealand is the management of offenders returning from Australia.  At last year’s conference, a memorandum of cooperation was signed by ministers to support effective information sharing, and jurisdictions continue to work closely together to manage and support these offenders.
