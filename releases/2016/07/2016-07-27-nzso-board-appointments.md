Corporate lawyer Daniel Wong has been appointed to the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Board, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced.

“Mr Wong has an extensive background in the corporate legal sector in New Zealand and the UK, and is the director and co-founder of the Auckland based specialist corporate law firm, Flacks and Wong Limited,” Ms Barry says.

“Also an accomplished violinist who took up the instrument aged four and played with the Wellington Youth Orchestra for six years, he will bring significant experience in governance and law to the NZSO.”

Current board member Paul McArthur has also been reappointed to the Board.

“This is an exciting time for the NZSO, which received a $1.2 million annual funding boost in Budget 2016. Its work is globally well-regarded and important to the ongoing health of our arts and cultural sector.”

Mr Wong replaces Peter Diessl, a board member for the last nine years.

“I’d like to thank Mr Diessl for the outstanding contribution he has made during his time on the board. His commercial expertise and knowledge of the music sector has been invaluable to the NZSO throughout his tenure.”
