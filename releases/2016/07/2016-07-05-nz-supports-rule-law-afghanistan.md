Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand will provide a further $2.8 million in funding for the Afghan National Police and the Central Prison Department.

“Afghanistan continues to face a number of serious challenges particularly around security and the maintenance of law and order,” Mr McCully says.

“The Afghan police force is currently transitioning from being focused on counter-insurgency activities to taking on the role of a traditional civilian police force. We are joining with the international community to support this shift by providing additional funding for the Afghan National Police and the Central Prison Department.

“New Zealand has made a long-term commitment to Afghanistan’s development and stability. Our continued support for the Afghan National Security Forces reflects Cabinet’s decision to extend and increase the New Zealand deployment to the Afghan National Army Officer Academy until June 2018,” Mr McCully says.

This latest round of funding will be delivered through the United Nations Development Programme and takes New Zealand’s total commitment to supporting the Afghan National Security Forces to $11.3 million.
