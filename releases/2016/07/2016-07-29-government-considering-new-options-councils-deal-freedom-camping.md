The Government is considering ways to improve the management of freedom camping which could include widening councils’ infringement powers, says local government Minister Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

Minister Lotu-Iiga is responding to reports that Christchurch City Council is consulting on a blanket ban on freedom camping in vehicles without self-contained toilet facilities.

“Freedom camping is growing and is an important part of our tourism industry but councils are understandably concerned that it is appropriately managed. The Freedom Camping Act was a good first step but has not solved all the issues.”

“I have heard council feedback that greater powers are needed and I have asked officials to look at options as part of the current review of council regulatory tools.”

The review will consider widening the infringement powers available to councils and also look at the different approaches councils are taking to freedom camping.

However, Minister Lotu-Iiga did not agree an outright ban on freedom camping in vehicles without self-contained toilet facilities was a realistic option. Mr Lotu-Iiga says “New Zealanders have a tradition of heading out into the great outdoors to enjoy this beautiful country of ours. This shouldn’t be reserved for just those who can afford to hire self-contained vehicles”.

The Department of Internal Affairs is leading the review in collaboration with councils, Local Government New Zealand, the Society of Local Government Managers, and relevant central government agencies.

Officials are expected to report back in September with options before the summer camping season.
