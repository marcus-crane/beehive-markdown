Kei te mihi nui te Minita Whakawhanaketanga Māori a Te Ururoa Flavell ki Te Wiki o te Reo Māori, ā, e akiaki ana ia i te marea, kia kaha rātou ki te kōrero Māori.

“He kaupapa pārekareka Te Wiki o te Reo Māori ki ngā iwi katoa o Aotearoa, nō reira, karawhiua! Ko te reo te mauri o tō tātou whenua,” tā Flavell.

“Mā te aha i te kōrero iti noa ia rā, pērā i te tuku mihi. He tīmatanga pai tērā.

Ko te kaupapa o te wiki i tēnei tau ko Ākina te Reo – he whakatenatena, he whakaaweawe hoki i te tangata ki te kōrero i te reo.

I hīkoi tahi a Flavell ki ērā atu o ngā māngai reo Māori i te whaitua nui o Te Whanganui a Tara i te ata nei.

"He koanga ngākau, tokomaha ngā tamariki me ō rātou whānau i tūhono mai ki te hīkoi. Me te aha, ka nui te tautoko a te hapori pakihi i te kaupapa,” tana kī.

Neke atu i te 4000 ngā kaihīkoi. Ko Stacey Morrison rātou ko Nehe Milner-Skudder, ko Jenny-May Clarkson, ko Julian Dennison ētahi.

E ai ki a Flavell, kua kaha ake te aro mai a te iwi whānui ki te reo.

“Tata ki te 17 tau ki muri, i hamahamahia ai a Hinewehi Mohi mō te waiata i te waiata o te motu ki te reo Māori i te tākaro whutupōro i waenganui i Ngā Ō Pango me Ingarangi. I ēnei rā, ka waiatatia taua waiata ki ngā reo e rua. Engari, kia kaha tonu tātou.

I te rā nei ka whakaterea e Flavell te pūtea e kīa nei, ko Matika – he wehenga pūtea i te kaupapa a Moving the Māori Nation.

He mea tautoko te pūtea nei i te kawenga o Whānau Ora, ā, he taunaki i te tangata, te whānau, te hapori rānei ki te whakapiki ake i te oranga o te iwi. Tērā hoki pea ētahi kaupapa e whakahaeretia ana i te wā nei, ka whakatūria ki wāhi kē, mō te whānau te painga.

E rua ngā puna pūtea. Ko te puna mā ngā kaupapa iti, hapori iti rānei – ko te $10,000 te utu nui rawa. Ko te puna mā ngā kaupapa nui, hapori whānui, ā motu rānei – neke atu i te $10,000 te utu.

### **Te reo Māori is for all New Zealanders — Minister**

Minister for Māori Development Te Ururoa Flavell welcomes the start of Māori Language Week today and invites all New Zealanders to give speaking te reo Māori a go.

“Te Wiki o te Reo Māori is something all New Zealanders can get behind and enjoy, and I encourage everyone to give it a go. Having our own language is what makes our country special,” Mr Flavell says.

“By speaking a little Māori every day, New Zealanders can help create the change we need. I think that starts with a simple greeting and building on from that.”

The theme for this year’s Te Wiki o te Reo Māori is Ākina te Reo – behind you all the way – which is about using te reo Māori to support people, to inspire them, and to cheer them on.

Mr Flavell joined other Māori language ambassadors at this morning's Te Wiki o te Reo Māori Parade through central Wellington.

"It was awesome to see so many tamariki and whānau of all backgrounds taking part. And it's also good to see such strong support from the business community," he says.

The popular parade was attended by around 4000 people and included te reo ambassadors Stacey Morrison, Nehe Milner-Skudder, Jenny-May Clarkson and Julian Dennison. 

Mr Flavell says Aotearoa-New Zealand has moved a long way as a country.

“About 17 years ago, Hinewehi Mohi was criticised because she sang the national anthem in Māori at an All Blacks vs England Rugby World Cup game. Today at games, everybody sings the anthem in both Māori and English. But we must keep building on that.”

Mr Flavell is also today announcing the launch of Matika – Moving the Māori Nation Fund.

The fund takes a Whānau Ora approach to supporting individuals, whānau and community organisations delivering healthy lifestyles at a ‘grassroots’ level’. It also supports successful community healthy lifestyle programmes that can be replicated in other communities and regions across the motu to benefit whānau.

There are two pools of funding up to $10,000 for small or local initiatives; and over $10,000 for projects that have a broad community or national reach.
