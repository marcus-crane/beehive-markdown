The Government is to provide $975,000 to assist the Council and Environment Canterbury to clean up 90,000 litres of toxic substances at the Concours Electroplaters site in Timaru’s North Street, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Toxic materials such as those on the Concours site potentially threaten the health of the local community, cause long-term damage to the wider environment and are a blight on New Zealand’s international reputation for being clean and beautiful. It is critical that we act decisively, responsibly dispose of the chemicals and make the site safe.”

The $975,000 Government funding for the clean up is from the Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund and will go to Environment Canterbury, which will coordinate the clean up. It involves removing about 90,000 litres of hazardous substances, an assessment of whether the building’s structure has become contaminated and a detailed investigation to determine the extent of any potential site contamination.

“The site is potentially contaminated by heavy metals, including chromium, nickel, cyanide and asbestos, and acids and alkalis that have been improperly stored. The removal of theses hazardous substances will address the immediate risk to human and environmental health,” Dr Smith says.

“Government agencies, including the Ministry for the Environment, WorkSafe and the Environmental Protection Agency, are collaborating with local councils to ensure this work is successful.”

The Timaru District Council is taking ownership of the site, and any future use of it will depend on the results of the detailed site investigation. Further work may be needed if it is contaminated.

The clean up is expected to be completed by the end of October.
