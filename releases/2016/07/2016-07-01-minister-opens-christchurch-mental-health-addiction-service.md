Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened Tūhauora Christchurch Central Service which provides a one-stop-shop for clients to access a range of mental health and addiction services.

“Providing timely access to mental health and addiction services for Cantabrians is a key priority,” says Dr Coleman.

“In March this year the Government announced an extra $20 million to increase mental health and wellbeing support for Cantabrians. Two extra positions at Tūhauora are being funded as a result.

“Today’s opening highlights the innovative work being done in Canterbury by the DHB and NGOs to ensure people get access to the mental health and addiction services when and where they need them.

“Tūhauora is a great example of how the sector has worked together to provide a one-stop-shop for clients, while also improving continuity of care and streamlining access.

“We know that many clients experience mental illness and addiction issues at the same time, and are engaged with multiple services. It’s important to take a holistic approach, rather than treating issues in isolation.”

Tūhauora is run by Odyssey House Trust with funding from Canterbury DHB. The service expects to help over 50 clients per week.

The $20 million package announced by the Government, in liaison with the DHB and frontline providers, includes an extra 27 FTE primary care and community based mental health workers, as well as funding for current programmes such as telehealth and workforce wellbeing support.

The Government has increased mental health and addiction services funding from $1.1 billion in 2008/09 to over $1.4 billion for 2015/16.
