Prime Minister John Key says the United States has accepted an invitation to send a ship to attend the Royal New Zealand Navy’s 75th anniversary later this year.

“Vice-President Joe Biden confirmed in our discussions today that the US has accepted the invitation and intends to have a ship represent the US Navy at this event,” Mr Key says.

“We are naturally pleased the US is taking up the invitation. It is a further demonstration of the strength of our close relationship, our friendship and our shared values.

“There is a long-standing process for considering ship visits under our nuclear free legislation. I will receive advice in due course to assist me in making a decision.

“There is no specific time frame for this process but it is likely to be a number of weeks before the advice is prepared and the Government is in a position to make any further announcement.”
