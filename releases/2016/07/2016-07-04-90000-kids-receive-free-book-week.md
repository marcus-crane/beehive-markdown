Around 90,000 New Zealand children will receive a free book as part of Government Book Week which begins today, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

Government Book Week is run by the Duffy Books in Homes programme. Each student at the 500 schools in the programme receives five free books of their choice every year, which they can take home and keep. The Ministry of Education funds one of these books during Government Book Week.

“Reading is an essential skill for success in every aspect of life. This initiative is a great way to inspire a love of books in children and improve literacy skills,” says Ms Parata.

“More than 11 million books have been given to Kiwi kids since the Duffy Books in Homes programme started in 1995. Thousands more will be given out this week, just in time for the school holidays.”

During Government Book Week many schools invite their local Member of Parliament to read to students and present them with books.

Government Book Week runs from 4 – 8 July.
