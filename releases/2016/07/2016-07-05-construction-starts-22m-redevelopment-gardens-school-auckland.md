Construction work has begun on the $22 million redevelopment of The Gardens School in Manurewa, Auckland, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This is an exciting project which will essentially see a new school constructed on the same site as the old school, which was demolished earlier this year,” says Ms Kaye.

“Many of the old teaching spaces were affected by structural and weather-tightness issues, so this is about creating a safer, modern and inspiring learning environment for students.

“The redevelopment will also help accommodate expected roll growth at the school.

“Like many Auckland schools, The Gardens School serves a growing local population. The current school roll is just over 530, but the new facilities will cater for 700 students. There is also flexibility in the design to enable further roll growth to be met if necessary.

“To help accommodate its growing roll, the new school will be three-storeys high. This will also help preserve outdoor recreational space.

“During the construction phase, students will learn in temporary modular classrooms that have been placed on the school’s fields. These temporary facilities will be removed once the new school is up and running.

“I’d like to acknowledge the school and community for their patience as the Ministry of Education worked on solutions for the complex property issues faced by the school.

“The sight of construction of the new facilities getting underway will be a welcome one for students, teachers and parents and whanau alike.

“Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2017, making the new facilities available for learning from Term 1 2018.

“As with all major school redevelopments, the focus will be on creating innovative learning environments that support evolving teaching practices and inspire students to achieve to the very best of their potential.”

**Notes**

**About The Gardens School**

The Gardens School is a state, full primary school (years 1 – 8) in Manurewa, Auckland.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
