Four new appointments and two reappointments to the Arts Council have been announced by Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry.

“Philanthropist Dame Jenny Gibbs, experienced arts sector leader Roger King and highly regarded Māori arts leaders Karl Johnstone and Professor Taiarahia Black are the new appointments to the council,” Ms Barry says.

“All four have specific skills sets which will add to the depth and breadth of experience on the Arts Council, and provide the cultural leadership we need from our national arts development agency.”

Current members Wayne Marriott and Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban have been reappointed.

“In addition, current council member Michael Moynahan will step into the role of Deputy Chair until November 2017. He brings extensive experience in the literary sector and strong governance and commercial credentials to the role.”

Ms Barry thanked outgoing board members Darrin Haimona, Felicity Price, Karyn Fenton-Ellis and Peter-Lucas Kaaka Jones for their contribution.

“I particularly wish to acknowledge the decade-long service of Mr Haimona as chair of the Te Waka Toi Māori Arts Board and as a member of the Arts Council.”
