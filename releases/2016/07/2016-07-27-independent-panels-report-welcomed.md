The Government has today welcomed the release of the Independent Hearings Panel’s recommendations on the Unitary Plan, saying the new plan is crucial to Auckland’s future, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Auckland’s current planning rules date back to the 1990s, seven different councils and 400,000 fewer people. The Independent Hearings Panel has done a good job of addressing the complex issues and balancing the competing interests.

“The new plan is by its nature a complex document as it affects the development rules on more than 550,000 property titles, as well as the issues of water management, air quality and the marine environment. I am encouraged by the high-level briefing on the plan’s content received from officials today. The new plan appears to meet many of the housing objectives for Auckland. It will take time for both ministers and government agencies to comprehend the full detail.

“We acknowledge the reported back Unitary Plan poses a major challenge for the council. Auckland previously could not resolve the tension between the old regional council wanting a tight metropolitan urban limit and the district and city councils wanting more growth outwards. This confusion resulted in too little provision for growth and the current housing challenges. The strength of a single Auckland Council is that this issue will be resolved.

“The Government has confidence that Mayor Len Brown and the council understand how important the new plan is to Auckland’s future. We will be giving the council clear air to make a considered decision. We also have officials working to ensure a smooth transition from the SHAs to the new Unitary Plan, to maintain the momentum we have achieved in new home construction.”
