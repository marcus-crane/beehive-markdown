Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed 150 students from rural Korea who will study in New Zealand for the next eight weeks.

The school visits’ programme is a joint initiative between the New Zealand and Korean Governments. It stems from the New Zealand Korea Free Trade Agreement which came into force in December last year.

The students will be split into three groups and will be based in the Waikato, Nelson/Marlborough and Canterbury. The school programme provides a good opportunity to showcase New Zealand schools in regional locations to a large group of international students.  

“Through the Free Trade Agreement with Korea, we made a commitment to widen education opportunities for young Koreans. The school visits’ programme is part of that, and we are planning for it to run for each of the next three years,” says Mr Joyce.

“This is a wonderful opportunity for the Korean students to be part of our world-class education system, to improve their English language skills and, at the same time, to experience the Kiwi lifestyle in our regions.

“It is also a chance for Kiwi students to gain an appreciation of another culture first-hand. It is definitely a win-win for both countries.”

The Korean students were chosen after a nationwide application process, with all coming from rural regions of South Korea.

Around 10 schools in each of the three New Zealand regions will host up to five students each, with local families providing homestay accommodation.

While at school, the students will join in scheduled classes and also attend English language classes during the school day.

- In 2015 approximately 7,500 Korean students chose to study in New Zealand. The majority study in private tertiary establishments or secondary schools.
- Korean students comprise 8 per cent of the total number of international students enrolled in secondary schools.
- Korean students come to New Zealand predominantly for English language study, or primary and secondary schooling.
