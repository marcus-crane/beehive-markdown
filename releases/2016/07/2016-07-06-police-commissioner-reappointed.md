Mr Mike Bush has been reappointed as the Commissioner of Police, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“Mike Bush is a highly respected leader who has achieved a lot during his term as Police Commissioner and I am very pleased that he will continue leading the men and women who work to keep our communities safe.

“His focus will be on modernising the police workforce, and building a more open and inclusive culture to deliver a world class police force that better reflects the communities they serve,” Ms Collins said.

Mr Bush has been a police officer since 1978. He has previously been the Deputy Commissioner Operations and the District Commander for Counties Manukau.  

From 2003 to 2007, Mr Bush was the New Zealand Police South East Asia Liaison Officer, based in Bangkok, where he was the first New Zealand official to reach devastated Phuket after the 2004 Asian tsunami. He was awarded the MNZM for his achievements in this operation. 

Mr Bush was initially appointed for three years on 3 April 2014. He has been re-appointed for a further three years from the end of his current term. Mr Bush’s appointment as Police Commissioner now expires on 2 April 2020.

The Police Commissioner is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under the Policing Act 2008. The reappointment process has been run by the State Services Commission with oversight from the Minister of Police.
