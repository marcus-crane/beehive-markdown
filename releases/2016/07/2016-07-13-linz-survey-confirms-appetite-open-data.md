Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is improving access to property information following a survey ranking it among the most in-demand types of government data, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

The findings were included in the results of a LINZ survey published today, which asked New Zealanders about the top 10 datasets they would most like to be able to access.

“With more than 400 survey responses, this high participation confirms the importance of LINZ’s work in encouraging government agencies to release their data,” says Ms Upston.

“The results of the survey have been released to all government agencies to help them to think about the types of data they might release and the best way to go about it.”

Undertaken by the Open Government Data and Information Programme at LINZ, the survey was done to inform understanding of what types of data New Zealanders had an interest in and was promoted through a variety of digital channels including Twitter, social forums and email.

“This new, more direct, way of gathering feedback represents a shift towards encouraging more participation from the public in shaping our public services and what they deliver.”

“Releasing public data to Kiwis will ultimately lead to more efficiency, transparency and accountability,” says Ms Upston.

LINZ makes data it holds available through the LINZ Data Service. This includes property boundaries and title information.
