Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $20,000 of funding to help develop resources to support LGBTI young people who are leaving school and entering employment, education or training.

“This is a time of change and often uncertainty for all young people, but LGBTI young people can face additional challenges when making this transition,” says Ms Kaye.

“The funding will go towards tools that support LGBTI young people to develop the resilience needed to safely navigate the new and sometimes difficult circumstances they find themselves in.

“This support is important, because LGBTI young people are five times more likely than other young people to attempt suicide or deliberately self-harm. They’re also more likely to be bullied, physically harmed or afraid that someone may hurt them.”

Creative communications agency Curative has been chosen to work with LGBTI young people to develop the support tools, which may include video-based resources for mentors, leadership workshops and hui.

“Curative has strong relationships with the LGBTI community, and a proven track record working collaboratively with young people to support positive mental health and wellbeing.

“This week I was privileged to attend the thirtieth anniversary of homosexual law reform at Parliament, and tonight I’m attending an event celebrating 30 years of reform at the Auckland Town Hall.

“I’d like to acknowledge the inspiring work that continues to happen to support the LGBTI community. We are now more open and accepting as New Zealanders, and it’s important we keep working towards an even more inclusive society.

“The Government has invested around $500,000 in the last few years to provide services and support for LGBTI young people, from advocacy and education services to mentoring and leadership opportunities.

“Last year, I also released the cross-agency response document *Supporting LGBTI Young People in New Zealand*, highlighting work happening across Government to support LGBTI young people. The funding announced today supports a number of objectives highlighted in the response, including that the LGBTI youth sector is strengthened and supported, and participates confidently in their communities and whanau.

“The Government continues to support LGBTI young people and I’m committed to ensuring that they thrive, achieve and feel a sense of belonging.”
