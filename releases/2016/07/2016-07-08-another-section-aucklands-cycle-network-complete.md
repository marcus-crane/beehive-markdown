Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened Auckland’s $2.18 million Quay Street Cycleway, completing another part of the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme.

The 1km, two-lane cycleway runs along the harbour side of Quay Street between Lower Hobson Street and Plumer Street. Planter boxes and concrete kerbs separate cyclists from the vehicles that use the busy link to the port and city centre.

“Quay Street is a central part of Auckland’s growing cycle network. It’s been designed to link in to other cycleways across the city and provides Aucklanders with a safer, more reliable walking and cycling route. We’re building cycleways to a standard that delivers real incentives for commuters to make a change and choose cycling as their mode of transport,” Mr Bridges says.

Over the next three years the Government will invest $76 million through its Urban Cycleways Programme on projects in Auckland.

Alongside Quay Street, the Nelson Street, Don Buck and Central Park Drive cycleways have been completed to date, with another six to be built over the next few years.

“Making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice is a priority. Through our Urban Cycleways Programme, we’re accelerating key projects and helping to establish cycling as an integral part of Auckland’s transport network.

“Over the next three years central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”
