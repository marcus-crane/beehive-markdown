Statistics NZ is taking another step toward being ‘digital by default’ by moving three more business surveys online, Statistics Minister Craig Foss says.

The three surveys — Quarterly Economic Survey of Manufacturing, Quarterly Wholesale Trade Survey and Quarterly Business Survey — are now available online for the June 2016 quarter.

“This is great news for many business owners and operators who can now spend less time on administration and more time looking after their customers.  It’s also great news for Statistics NZ — a leading agency in the drive to digitise and modernise government services,” Mr Foss says.    

“Delivering better online services is a key focus of the Government’s Better for Business programme.

“Filling out these surveys online should be fast and easy, saving businesses time while also providing important information on quarterly financial performance.

“About 30,000 farmers are already enjoying the benefits of online surveys after the Agricultural Production Survey went digital last year.  Statistics NZ is committed to getting all its business surveys online in the next couple of years.”

Paper forms for all surveys are still available.
