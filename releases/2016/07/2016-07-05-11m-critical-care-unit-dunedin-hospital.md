Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today announced funding has been approved for a new $11 million Critical Care Unit at Dunedin Hospital.

“Delivering quality health services for the people of Otago and Southland remains a priority for this Government,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Critical Care Unit project is part of Southern DHB’s programme of urgent interim works at the Dunedin and Wakari Hospitals to ensure clinical services can continue while the longer-term redevelopment is carried out.

“Establishing the Critical Care Unit involves refurbishing the Intensive Care Unit and co-locating it with two High Dependency Units.

“The Unit will house eight intensive care beds and 10 high dependency beds, with the potential for a further four beds to be added over the next 10 years.

“The new unit will result in safer and more efficient services. Work will start in August and is expected to be complete by early 2018.”

The Government has approved an additional $9.4 million for the project, with $1.6 million previously approved for design and planning. The total project cost has been capped at $11 million.

“The vital redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build modern and sustainable healthcare services and facilities to meet the needs of the Southern community,” says Dr Coleman.

“Good progress is being made on the redevelopment and an Indicative Business Case is due by mid-2017.”

This work is being supported by the extra $32 million Southern DHB received this year, taking the DHB’s total funding to $884 million for 2016/17. That’s an extra $194 million in funding over the last eight years.
