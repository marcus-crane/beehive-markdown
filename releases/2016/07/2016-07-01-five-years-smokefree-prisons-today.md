Corrections Minister Judith Collins says prisons are safer and healthier since smoking was banned five years ago today.

On 1 July 2011, tobacco products, matches and lighters became unauthorised items in New Zealand prisons.

“I was Minister of Corrections at the time and I asked Corrections to ban smoking in prisons because I was deeply concerned about both the health risks of second-hand smoke and the safety risks of lighters and matches.

“Prior to the ban around two-thirds of the prison population, or 5700 prisoners were smokers – triple the rate of smoking in the community at the time.

“I visited prisons when smoking was permitted in cells and the environment was awful for prison staff. Today, while prison is never pleasant, it is a much improved place to work.

“Prisoners would use matches and lighters to set fire to balls of toilet paper and throw them at staff, or cause significant damage to prison property by burning bedding and other items.

“I saw CCTV footage of fires lit by prisoners that spread quickly and caused considerable danger. Staff tell me that since the ban they are now much safer at work,” Ms Collins says.

Since matches and lighters were banned, fires and arson incidents have significantly decreased, from 76 in 2010/11 to four in 2014/15.

Smokefree prisons were preceded by an extensive 12 month campaign by Corrections, supported by the Ministry of Health and the Quit Group.

Prisoners were encouraged to give up smoking before the ban came into effect, and offered nicotine replacement therapy including patches and lozenges.

“Giving up smoking has led to a positive improvement in prisoners’ lives, with better health being experienced. Prisoners’ families and friends also no longer have to provide significant sums of money for prisoners to buy cigarettes.

“Looking back, it is hard to believe that there was a time that smoking was ever permitted in prisons.

“Banning smoking was the right thing to do, and I am incredibly proud of the way that Corrections implemented this policy,” Ms Collins says.
