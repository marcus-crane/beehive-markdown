Construction work is set to begin on the $19.2 million redevelopment of Auckland’s Freemans Bay School, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“Yesterday, local kaumatua buried a mauri stone and blessed the construction site, so construction workers can now pick up their tools and get cracking,” says Ms Kaye.

“This is a big milestone for the school, which needs a significant rebuild to accommodate roll growth and remediate leaky buildings.

“Last December, I announced that the redevelopment originally planned for the school would be upscaled. This takes into account long-term population growth in Auckland’s CBD and the Western Bays communities that the school serves.

“The rebuild will allow for a roll of 600, and will include a new learning block, as well as a new multi-purpose hall, library, administration building and Rumaki Whanau Ata, the school’s Maori Immersion Unit.

“The Government is investing $18 million in this project, with the school’s Board of Trustees contributing $1.2 million towards the new hall.

“Preconstruction work was carried out during the most recent summer holidays, and it’s great to see construction work commencing this month as scheduled.

“The redevelopment is due to be completed by the end of 2017. This will enable the new facilities to be used from the start of Term 1 in 2018.

“As with all major school redevelopments, the new learning block will provide an innovative learning environment which supports evolving teaching practices, now and into the future.

“Freemans Bay School is one of the oldest schools in New Zealand, having been established back in 1888.

“I’d like to acknowledge the hard work of the Board and Principal over the last few years. A lot of planning has gone into this project, and the redevelopment will set the school up to serve its communities for many more years to come.”

**Notes**

**About Freemans Bay School**

Freemans Bay School is a coeducational primary school for years 1 – 6 students in central Auckland.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
