Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board, Hon Peter Dunne today announced that approximately $189 million of Lottery profits is being made available in 2016/17 to help build stronger, more cohesive communities.

Through the Lottery Distribution Committees over $108 million will flow into the community, supporting work and projects across a wide range of sectors. In addition, over $80 million will be granted to three key statutory bodies supported by the Grants Board.

“This funding helps provide a wide range of services for individuals and families and also helps bring people together for community celebrations like sports events, multi-cultural events and family fun days.

“It is also crucial to communities being able to build or maintain facilities such as local community houses, which provide space for people to access multiple services, or larger venues that are used for sport, cultural and leisure activities.

“Importantly lottery funding also helps support environmental projects aimed at preserving and protecting our natural heritage, the development and conservation of marae, and keeping people safe in the outdoors”, Mr Dunne said.

This year the Board has been able to fund a $12 million allocation for Lottery Significant Projects which will assist large and important community projects.

Past Lottery Significant Projects grants have helped the refurbishment of the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch, and the construction of the Museum of Waitangi in the Treaty Grounds at Waitangi.

The Board will continue to support arts, culture and sporting initiatives through funding of over $80 million to the three statutory bodies supported by the Board: the New Zealand Film Commission (including Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision), Creative New Zealand and Sport New Zealand.

“Details of the Lottery Significant Projects funding criteria and priorities, and timescales for the 2016/17 round, will be made available publically over the next few months”, Mr Dunne said
