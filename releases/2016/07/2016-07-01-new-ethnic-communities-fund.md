Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today announced the new Ethnic Communities Development Fund (ECDF).

“It is important that all ethnic people have a sense of belonging and participation in New Zealand and that we foster communities that are inclusive and value diversity,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The ECDF replaces the Settling In fund and is designed to better support the ongoing and often long-term settlement process for people and communities.”

There are 3 new fund catergories and they include leadership development, social cohesion and cultural events.

“The first funding round will open on 15 August and close near the end of September.  $520,000 is available for the 2016 funding round for projects to be implemented in 2017,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Ethnic communities now have six weeks to find out more detail about the fund before they put in applications.”

The ECDF supports the goal of two key ethnic strategies – the New Zealand Migrant Settlement and Integration strategy and the Refugee Resettlement Strategy.
