Communications Minister Amy Adams says that a Bill enabling easier connections to Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) has passed its first reading in Parliament last night with unanimous support.

The Telecommunications (Property Access and Other Matters) Amendment Bill creates a new consenting process that telecommunications companies must follow when installing networks such as UFB.

“This Bill will make it simpler for those living in apartments or with shared property access to connect to faster broadband at home, by addressing delays such as neighbour disputes and unanswered queries,” says Ms Adams.

It includes:

- A tiered consenting regime to allow a staged approach to consent requirements dependent on the impact the installation is considered to have on shared property
- A dedicated bodies corporate approval process
- A disputes resolution process will be created to ensure any issues that may arise are dealt with fairly and efficiently.

“Demand for faster, and more reliable broadband continues to grow in New Zealand, on the back of the Government’s rollout of UFB,” says Ms Adams.

“This Bill will help give New Zealanders access to open up a wide range of business, educational, and community opportunities. It will simplify consent requirements while still respecting the rights of property owners.”
