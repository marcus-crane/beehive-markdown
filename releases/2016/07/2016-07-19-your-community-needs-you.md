Associate Local Government Minister and Minister for Women Louise Upston is calling for women to put their names forward for this year’s local authority elections.

“Local government and local democracy can only work when everyone’s voice can be heard. Diversity in governance is strongly linked to better performance,” Ms Upston says.

“At the last council elections 30 per cent of all candidates were women and around 30 per cent of those elected were women. I’d like to encourage more women to stand this year.

“If not you, then who? You can do more for your family and community by being at the table where the decisions are being made.”

Nominations opened last week for district, city and regional councils, local and community boards, licensing trusts, and district health boards.

Electoral officers are accepting candidate nominations now until 12pm on Friday 12 August.
