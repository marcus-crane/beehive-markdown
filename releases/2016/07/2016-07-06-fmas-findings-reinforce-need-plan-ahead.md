Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has welcomed a survey from the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which provides a snapshot of the number of people who are engaging with their KiwiSaver annual statements.

“Taking the time to understand and engage with KiwiSaver statements is a key part of planning ahead and understanding what you need to do in order to live comfortably in retirement.

“The survey shows that only 21 per cent of New Zealanders read their statement thoroughly and 58 per cent look at it briefly.

“Fewer than a quarter of New Zealanders take the time to check their KiwiSaver is on track.

“The government has a goal to improve the financial capability of New Zealanders to better shape their lives, avoid hardship and achieve their goals. Increasing the engagement in KiwiSaver is a key component in achieving this.

“The report will guide a joint project with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, FMA and Commission for Financial Capability (CFFC), which is working to improve the information and format of KiwiSaver annual statements.

“This is an important task and I look forward to receiving the recommendations later in the year,” says Mr Goldsmith.
