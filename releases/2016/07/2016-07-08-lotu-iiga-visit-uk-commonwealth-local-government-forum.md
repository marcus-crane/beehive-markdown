Local Government Minister, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, leaves for London today to strengthen Commonwealth ties and share plans on local government reform.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will attend the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) Board meeting and the associated Commonwealth Sustainable Cities Network meeting.

“This is an opportunity for New Zealand to strengthen relationships with our Commonwealth counterparts and to encourage best practice in local government across the Commonwealth,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The CLGF co-ordinates a Pacific programme designed to promote local democracy and local government capacity in the Pacific. It also promotes democratic local values and good governance across the 53 countries of the Commonwealth.

“New Zealand has an important role in promoting these values with our strong, cohesive and stable local government environment,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Commonwealth Sustainable Cities Network is developing criteria and goals to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

“We are increasingly moving to more intensive, urban dwelling. We need to plan for the future of our cities to ensure they have proper infrastructure and services to support healthy, vibrant, well-connected communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I will be sharing the approach New Zealand is taking with my Better Local Services reforms. The reforms will enable more innovation and collaboration across local government to deliver better local services and infrastructure and to deliver better value for ratepayers.”
