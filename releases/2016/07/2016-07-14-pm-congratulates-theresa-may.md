Prime Minister John Key has today congratulated Theresa May on becoming Britain’s new Prime Minister.

“I have written to Theresa May to congratulate her and I hope to be able to talk to her personally in the coming days.

“The United Kingdom and New Zealand have a long standing and close relationship. The trade and economic links between our two countries are already strong and we have shared interests in a number of areas, including global defence and security.

“I met Theresa May in London last year and I am confident we will be able to work together to strengthen the links between our two countries.”

Mr Key also acknowledged the tenure of David Cameron as Prime Minister

“I have enjoyed working with David Cameron during his time as Prime Minister. He has become a very good friend and I wish him all the best for the future.”
