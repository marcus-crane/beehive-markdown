Prime Minister John Key has conveyed his condolences to the President and Prime Minister of France following the tragic attack at a Bastille Day celebration in Nice.

“The fact this attack was directed at innocent people celebrating their national day makes it particularly horrific.  No one should have to worry about such violence when going about their daily lives.

“I know the thoughts of all New Zealanders will be with the victims and their families at this sad time.

“In my earlier discussions with the President and Prime Minister we affirmed our joint commitment to the international campaign against terrorism.

“Today I reiterated New Zealand stands shoulder to shoulder with France in combating violent extremism.”

“Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade are working to determine if any New Zealanders have been caught up and we encourage New Zealanders in France to make contact with loved ones directly to confirm their well-being,” says Mr Key.
