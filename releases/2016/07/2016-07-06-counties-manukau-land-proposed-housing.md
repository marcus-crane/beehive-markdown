Ten hectares of Counties Manukau Health land is being considered for the Government's Crown land housing programme, with consultation starting today, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

"I have been in discussions with Counties Manukau Health about its large, vacant land holdings in South Auckland. I welcome their decision to publicly consult on releasing the north-western corner of this site, on Kerrs Road. There is a strong link between health wellbeing and housing, and it makes no sense for this land to be vacant when the area has such high housing need.

"If Counties Manukau Health recommends releasing this land after the consultation process, the Government will look to buy it at fair market price for the Crown land programme. This will provide capital for the district health board to invest in other health services, while also adding land on which the Government can facilitate the building of new homes,” Dr Smith says.

"This 10ha site would have the capacity for about 250 homes, and any housing development would need to contribute to the Government’s objective of increasing the supply of social and affordable housing. The specific requirements around the proportion of these will be determined after a decision is made. We are also exploring the possibility of developing the land for housing in conjunction with local iwi.”

The consultation by Counties Manukau Health starts today, and submissions close on 5 August. The final decision on whether to release the land rests with the Minister of Health, and a decision on acquiring it for the Crown land programme will follow.

“Four Auckland sites, with the capacity for 940 homes, have been bought with the $52.2 million allocated to the programme in Budget 2015. A further $100 million was announced in Budget 2016 to buy more land; if this Counties Manukau purchase proceeds funding will come from this.

“The Manukau community is well aware of the high housing need locally and I hope they will support this pragmatic proposal to facilitate more houses being built, close to Manukau city, transport links, schools and community facilities.”
