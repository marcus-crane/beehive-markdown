Regions are continuing to benefit from the tourism sector’s focus on attracting more visitors outside peak periods, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The latest Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates released today show most regions showed growth in tourism expenditure over the year to May 2016.

The fastest growing region was Otago, which increased ten per cent over the year to $3.2 billion, followed by Nelson (up nine per cent to $295 million) and Auckland (up eight per cent to $6.7 billion).

“I’m pleased to see strong increases in some of the areas we’re particularly supporting to diversify their local economies through the Regional Growth Programme,” Mrs Bennett says.

Northland is up six per cent on 2015 to $932 million, Manawatu-Wanganui increased seven per cent to $868 million, and Bay of Plenty grew by six per cent to $1.6 billion.

“Regional breakdowns of the monthly expenditure are being made available by MBIE to help the sector to plan and invest strategically. This is part of a wide range of government initiatives supporting the sector,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Government has committed an additional $45 million over four years, on top of the $130 million already invested, to assist the sector to provide that unique New Zealand experience and attract high-value visitors outside the peak seasons.

“As part of this, Budget 2016 allocated $12 million over four years to help smaller communities fund some of the mid-sized infrastructure needs that result from increased tourist numbers.

“Since 2008, we’ve invested an unprecedented $700 million in tourism and tourism promotion, and these May results show the Government’s unwavering commitment to the sector is paying off.”
