A Working Group is considering options for the reinstatement of the Christ Church Cathedral and will, once a consensus has been reached, recommend the best way forward, Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee says.

“On 14 June I, in conjunction with Bishop Victoria Matthews, appointed a Working Group to consider options for the reinstatement of the Christ Church Cathedral,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Together with the Church Property Trust (CPT) we established a Christ Church Cathedral Working Group with the skills and experience to thoroughly consider reinstatement options, how it could be done and what the different options will cost.

“The group met for the first time last month, and is already compiling a range of technical information and hearing from experts such as those working on projects of a similar nature.

“A report by Miriam Dean QC last year confirmed reinstatement of the Cathedral could be achieved through a combination of repair, restoration, reconstruction and seismic strengthening, but with a caveat around costs.

“There is strong public interest in what is happening to this iconic building, and I know people want to see the CPT able to reach a decision so that the city can move forward.

“The Working Group will be reporting back on a way forward by 28 November 2016 and it will provide a final report to the Crown and CPT by 7 December 2016.

“We have given the group this time to allow for a thorough consideration of the options,” Mr Brownlee says.

The CPT appointments to the Christ Church Cathedral Working Group are Steve Wakefield and Roger Bridge.  Minister Brownlee has appointed Geoff Dangerfield (chair), Sue McKenzie, and after discussions with the Greater Christchurch Buildings Trust Alasdair Cassels.  The Crown will meet the costs of the group and provide support services, which will be determined as its work progresses. 

“I’m confident from their initial work, that the group has the appropriate mix of skills and experience to deliver an appropriate outcome,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I would encourage interested parties to allow the Working Group to get on with their work and support them when required.”
