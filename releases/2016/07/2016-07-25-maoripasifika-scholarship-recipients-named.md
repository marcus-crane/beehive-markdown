Education Minister Hekia Parata has today congratulated 30 highly-accomplished Māori and Pasifika student teachers who have been awarded Kupe Scholarships.

The prestigious scholarship aims to attract Māori and Pasifika high achievers to the teaching profession and support them to become inspiring teachers and role models in early childhood, primary and secondary education.

“I’m delighted by the outstanding calibre of scholars that the Kupe Scholarship continues to encourage into a teaching career,” says Ms Parata.

“The scholars that we’re celebrating today come from across the country and include a science graduate of Longwood University in Virginia, a former Māori All Black and a Pacific Music Award winner.

“They have already demonstrated high academic achievement, leadership, and close links with their communities, and this scholarship provides them the opportunity to make a real difference for kids in the classroom.”

The Kupe Scholarships fund course fees and study allowances, and offer mentoring and recruitment support after graduation.

Each recipient also receives taonga keepsakes in the form of a stylised paddle ‘hoe’ or waka / vaka / va’a as a permanent recognition of their achievements.

More than 90 applications were received for the 30 available scholarships.
