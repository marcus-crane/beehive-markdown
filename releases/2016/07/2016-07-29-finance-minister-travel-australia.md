Finance Minister Bill English has arrived in Australia today to attend a range of speaking engagements and bi-lateral meetings.

Mr English will meet with Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison and New South Wales Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian, as well as a range of businesses, to assess the progress of the Australian economy.

“These meetings are an opportunity to discuss trans-Tasman trade and the close economic ties enjoyed by our two nations. It will also be a good opportunity to gather some insights from the newly-formed Turnbull government and its economic agenda,” Mr English says.

Mr English will also address a public sector conference and meet with senior public servants who are interested in New Zealand’s Budget management and social investment policies.

“Australian Social Services Minister Christian Porter is interested in embarking on a programme of social welfare reform using a social investment model similar to what we are developing. I welcome the opportunity to share some of our ideas and insights with him and others who are interested in changing lives by reducing misery, rather than servicing it.”

Mr English will return to New Zealand on Wednesday 3 August.
