Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Mongolia this week to attend the 11th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit.

“The ASEM Summit brings together representatives from 53 European and Asian nations to foster closer relations between the two regions,” Mr McCully says.

“The membership includes some of New Zealand most important trading partners and represents nearly 60 per cent of the world’s GDP and population.

“Discussions at this year’s meeting will focus on connectivity, economic cooperation, and counter-terrorism,” Mr McCully says.
