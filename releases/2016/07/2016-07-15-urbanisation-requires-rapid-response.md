Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga challenged leaders at the Commonwealth Sustainable Cities Network (CSCN) meeting in London to urgently work with central governments on the challenges of global urbanisation.

The CSCN heard from agencies working across the globe that the increasing demands from more concentrated populations are outstripping the abilities of local governments to provide adequate infrastructure and services.

By 2050, more than 70 per cent of the world's population will be living in cities.

"While local authorities have an important role in addressing the needs of their local communities, they must work in partnership with governments to achieve scale economies and make speedy decisions to deal with growing demands," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The preceding Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) meeting acknowledged the important role of the Commonwealth in supporting local democracy and decision making.

Representatives from African, Caribbean and Pacific nations joined with other Commonwealth members to discuss both practical examples and appropriate policy responses to local government challenges.

"Whether we are talking about mega cities or smaller towns, our everyday lives are impacted by the communities we live in. It is essential that our local governments urgently deliver resilient, safe and sustainable communities where we can live, work and play," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
