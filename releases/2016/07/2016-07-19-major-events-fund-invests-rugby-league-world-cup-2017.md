Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced up to $1.35 million will be invested, through the Major Events Development Fund (MEDF), to help New Zealand co-host the Rugby League World Cup 2017 with Australia.

“The Rugby League World Cup 2017 is expected to deliver strong economic benefits for New Zealand, particularly as New Zealand will host a home semi-final game,” Mr Joyce says.

“As one of the host nations, New Zealand will welcome visitors from around the world to cheer on favourite teams and star players.”

Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Rugby League World Cup 2017 will act as a catalyst to support the growth of the sport at all levels.

“Co-hosting the Rugby League World Cup in 2017 is an opportunity to grow the game of rugby league in New Zealand. Having a world-class event of this calibre on our doorstep will boost participation in the sport. It will also amplify excitement and engagement with the sport for our up-and-coming players and fans,” Dr Coleman says.

“New Zealand will be hosting seven games, which are to be played in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. Papua New Guinea will also be a hosting partner of the tournament, with three pool games taking place in that country.”

The Government invests, through the Major Events Development Fund, in major events that generate significant immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand.
