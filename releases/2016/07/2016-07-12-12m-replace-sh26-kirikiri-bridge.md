Transport Minister Simon Bridges has announced a $12 million Government investment to replace the Kirikiri Bridge in the Coromandel to help alleviate frequent flooding in the area.

Localised flooding in the Kirikiri area, near Thames has caused frequent damage at times, amplified by the 75-year-old Kirikiri Stream Bridge on State Highway 26.

The bridge is low and narrow and has a central pier which collects flood debris, causing water to back up during storm events.

“The Government has approved funding for a $12 million project that involves replacing the bridge and realigning the state highway around the structure.

“A few months ago I visited the bridge to get a sense of the issues it was causing the community. It’s clear that this $12 million investment will make a tremendous difference to the local community and to those travelling to the Coromandel,” Mr Bridges says.

“The current bridge was built back in 1941 and only provides protection for a one in five year rainfall event. The new bridge will be able to cope with a 100 year storm.”

The new Kirikiri Stream Bridge will be built slightly upstream from the current one. It will be three metres higher than the current one and the design prevents debris accumulating underneath.

As part of the project, SH26 will be raised and realigned to connect with the new bridge, and a roundabout will be built to replace the SH26 and State Highway 25A intersection, significantly improving safety on the popular holiday route.

Work on the bridge is expected to start in late 2017.
