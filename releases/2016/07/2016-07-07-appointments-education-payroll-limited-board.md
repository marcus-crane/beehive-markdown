Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce has today announced the appointment of Sandi Beatie and Marcel van den Assum as new members of the board of Education Payroll Limited, and the reappointment and elevation to Chair of Murray Jack.

Mr Jack has been a director on the Board of Education Payroll since the company was established in 2014 to operate the schools payroll.  He is currently the Chair of the Financial Markets Authority and is the former Chair of Deloitte New Zealand.  He will be replacing Dame Patsy Reddy in the Chair position as she will take up her new role as Governor-General in September 2016.

“Mr Jack has been a valuable member of the Board and a great support to the outgoing Chair. He will bring his leadership experience and deep knowledge of the company to his new position as Chair of the Education Payroll Ltd Board,” says Mr Joyce.

Sandi Beatie will join the Board from 1 July 2016 for a term of three years. Ms Beatie recently retired following a long career in the public service.  She served four years as Deputy State Services Commissioner and prior to that as Deputy Chief Executive at both the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Corrections.  Through this time she navigated numerous large scale complex projects, including IT projects.

“Ms Beatie’s extensive experience with IT projects will add real value to the Board,” Mr Joyce says.

Marcel van den Assum will also join the Board from 1 July 2016 for a term of three years. Mr van den Assum is an independent advisor to Inland Revenue and he is working as a director and contractor across a number of IT related start-up businesses.  He previously worked at Unisys in a services role and was CIO of Fonterra. 

“Mr van den Assum’s knowledge of emerging technologies and IT architecture will enable him to make a significant contribution to the Board”, Mr Joyce says.

“The two new appointments will bring valuable knowledge and experience, especially in the IT sector. Together with the new Chair, Mr Jack, and current director Cathy Magiannis the company now has a strong group of directors to provide a sustainable and stable payroll service that will continue to improve and develop.  I welcome Ms Beatie and Mr van den Assum to the Board and look forward to working closely with them”, Mr Joyce says.

Mr Joyce thanked the outgoing Chair Dame Patsy Reddy for her service and wished her all the best for her new role as Governor-General.
