Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed the take up of a new performance standards system by more than a quarter of New Zealand’s councils.

“New Zealanders expect and deserve quality information on council performance and this is a welcome step in the right direction.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

21 out of 78 (27%) councils have signed up to be foundation members of Local Government New Zealand’s Excellence Programme.

“The councils represented are from all parts of New Zealand.  However they do not include major cities, such as Auckland or Christchurch,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Transparency and accountability are essential in our democracy. Ratepayers need authoritative, independent performance information covering as many councils as possible.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Excellence Programme will help improve local government decision making and performance.

“I look forward to the assessments becoming available in mid 2017 and ultimately for all councils to take part in the programme.”
