Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes two new innovative pilot programmes which aim to help patients with both diabetes and mental health issues.

“The Diabetes Plan aims to prevent people developing type 2 diabetes and improve the quality of life and health services for those living with diabetes,” says Dr Coleman.

“Health professionals often see patients with poorly controlled diabetes who also suffer from mental health issues. These patients are at risk of developing further diabetes-related complications, adding more pressure on their mental health.

“Two new pilot programmes in Tairawhiti and Northland will take a holistic approach and focus on treating the patient’s mental health issues in conjunction with their diabetes.

“While Tairawhiti and Northland DHBs will take different approaches targeted to their local communities, both initiatives will be primary-care based.

“The pilots will get underway shortly and will run for a year. They aim to increase access to mental health services, provide additional support for those with diabetes, as well as improve workforce development to upskill health professionals.”

The Ministry of Health has appointed an evaluator to assess the programmes and the results will be shared with other DHBs to assist them to improve their services and the long-term outcomes for people with diabetes.

The pilots will also be linked to other recent initiatives under the Diabetes Plan. These include revised self-management advice for people with diabetes and long term conditions, updated pre-diabetes advice, and the updated Virtual Diabetes Register.
