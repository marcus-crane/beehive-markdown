In celebration of Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori (Māori Language Week) 2016, Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the release of three new resources to support te reo Māori in the classroom.

The new resources include a trilingual digital book designed by Kiwa Digital and Core Education for deaf Māori students but is accessible to all deaf students.

“The Story of Rūaumoko is the first-ever digital book for deaf Māori students. It tells the story of Rūaumoko, the god of earthquakes and volcanoes, narrated by students from Kelston Deaf Education Centre in te reo Māori, New Zealand Sign Language and English,” says Ms Parata.

Also being released are Paekupu, a website that will house all Māori medium dictionaries, created by He Kupenga Hao i te Reo; and Hou Mai, a video series featuring whānau talking about their journey learning te reo Māori and committing to their children participating in Māori medium education, created by Blue Bach Productions.

“These new resources will support and encourage more students, teachers and parents to ‘Give te reo Māori a go’, which is the theme of this year’s Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori,” says Ms Parata.

“Māori language and culture are becoming more and more visible in classrooms and homes across the country. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of children and young people learning te reo at school grew from around 133,000 to almost 155,000.

“I encourage all Kiwis to take part in Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori and use the language every day in their homes, schools, workplaces and communities.”

Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori runs from 4 – 10 July 2016.
