Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell have congratulated the Ministry of Justice on winning the IPANZ Excellence Award for Crown-Māori Relationships for the innovative Rangatahi Courts initiative.

"This award is a superb endorsement of the partnership between the Ministry of Justice and the judiciary to deliver a process that better engages Maori young offenders, drawing on the strength of whānau and iwi,” says Ms Adams.

“The award, presented by the Institute for Public Administration at an awards ceremony in Wellington last night, recognises the effectiveness of Ngā Kooti Rangatahi – marae-based youth courts – across the country.”

“Rangatahi Courts are about providing an environment where our rangatahi (young people) can take ownership of their offending in a supportive environment. The positive collaboration between the courts, judiciary, iwi and communities and the tautoko given by whānau, kuia and kaumātua can, and is, helping young Māori turn their lives around,” says Mr Flavell.

Early results show reoffending rates of young people who attend Rangatahi courts committed 14 per cent fewer offences and 11 per cent less likely to commit a new serious offence in the following year than comparable youth.

There are 14 Rangatahi Courts operating on 15 marae throughout the country and there is wide interest from iwi to expand Rangatahi Courts into their rohe (tribal area).

Ngā Kooti Rangatahi recently received the 2015 Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration Award for Excellence in Judicial Administration.

“I acknowledge the leadership and support from the judiciary, who jointly accepted the award with the Ministry of Justice. The judiciary has shown exemplary leadership and I’m proud of the way judges and officials have worked together to deliver better public services,” says Ms Adams.

The annual IPANZ Public Sector Awards recognise and reward outstanding performances and achievements in the public sector. This year's awards attracted more than 90 entries from a range of organisations across the country.
