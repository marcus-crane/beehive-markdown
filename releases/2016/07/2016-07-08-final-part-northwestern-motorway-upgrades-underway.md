Work is now underway on the final project which will complete the upgrades of Auckland’s Northwestern Motorway, Transport Minister Simon Bridges has announced.

Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the sod on the $100 million Lincoln to Westgate project.

The upgrade will widen State Highway 16 from two to three lanes in each direction, creating extra capacity on Auckland’s motorway network to service the needs of the growing population in the west of the city.

“The extra capacity will cater to the increased traffic which will use the Western Ring Route and the Waterview Tunnels when they open early next year,” Mr Bridges says.

“This section is the last piece in the puzzle that will see the Northwestern Motorway widened to at least three lanes all the way from St Lukes near the city to Westgate, when it’s opened to motorists in early 2019.”

Walking and cycling improvements will also form a key part of the improvements project.

“We want to make it easier for people to move around the city via a range of transport modes. The project will build dedicated bus lanes in each direction and extend the Northwestern Cycleway.

“This will ensure transport infrastructure is able to support growth in Auckland’s western suburbs and will provide customers with an efficient additional route to State Highway 1. By building resilience and choice into our transport network, we can provide customers with more predictable travel times.

Mr Bridges says the project is part of the Government’s strong focus on meeting Auckland’s transport needs.

“Reducing congestion in Auckland is a Government priority. That’s why we’re investing more than $1 billion each year in Auckland’s transport, delivering new and improved roading motorways, strengthening public transport services and accelerating the urban cycling network.”
