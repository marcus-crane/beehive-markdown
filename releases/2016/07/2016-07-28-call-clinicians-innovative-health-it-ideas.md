Health Minister Jonathan Coleman is calling on clinicians to submit innovative ideas on healthcare.                                                                    

“Clinicians have an insider’s view of where innovation can be applied to improve healthcare services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Each year the Clinicians’ Challenge encourages health professionals to find ways technology can solve problems they face in their day to day practice, as well as making a difference to the health of New Zealanders.

“Effective use of information and technology solutions can also enable patients to be more involved in their own healthcare, and can ensure clinicians have access to a fuller range of information, helping to improve patient care.”

Last year’s winner in the active project category, the oDocs Eye Care initiative, was a world-first innovation that can be used on a smartphone to diagnose people with sight-threatening conditions. It has now been successfully released commercially and makes basic ophthalmology services accessible and affordable to people living in remote areas.

This year’s Clinicians’ Challenge has two categories – for a new idea yet to be developed, and an innovative system or solution already in place that’s having a positive impact on patient care.

The winner in each category will receive a grant of $8,000. The results will be announced at the 2016 Health Informatics New Zealand (HiNZ) conference in November.

The Clinicians’ Challenge is a joint initiative by the Ministry of Health and HiNZ. Entries can be submitted at www.hinz.org.nz until 12 September 2016.
