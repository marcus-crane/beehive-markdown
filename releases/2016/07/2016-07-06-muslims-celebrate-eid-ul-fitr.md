Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says Muslim New Zealanders today celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, the end of Ramadan.

As New Zealand’s diversity increases, it is important we recognise and acknowledge the many cultures and religions within New Zealand.  They all contribute to a strong, inclusive and prosperous nation,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says

“Eid ul-Fitr gives all New Zealanders the opportunity to recognise the valuable contribution the Muslim community makes to our nation’s religious, cultural and ethnic landscape,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says interfaith knowledge and religious tolerance are critical to maintaining a socially cohesive society.

“The Iftar, or breaking the fast dinners, provide an opportunity for us to build relationships between communities and promote understanding and awareness of the Islamic culture,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand’s first Muslim family arrived in the 1850’s and there are now over 45,000 New Zealanders who identify themselves as Muslim.

“Celebrating traditions are necessary so all New Zealanders gain a better understanding of the different communities around them.”
