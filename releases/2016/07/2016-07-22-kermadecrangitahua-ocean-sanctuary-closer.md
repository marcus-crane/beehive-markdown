The Government is welcoming a parliamentary committee recommendation that the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary Bill be passed with amendments, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“The Kermadec/Rangitāhua Ocean Sanctuary covers one of the most pristine and unique marine environments on earth. New Zealand needs to take this opportunity to fully protect it. It will be one of the largest marine protected areas (MPA) in the world, stretching from the islands to the boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). At 620,000 square kilometres, it is nearly the size of France and more than double New Zealand’s land mass. This is an environmental commitment all New Zealanders should embrace.

“I welcome the improvements made to the Bill by Parliament’s Local Government and Environment Select Committee. It is appropriate that the sanctuary and new conservation board include the dual Kermadec/Rangitāhua name, a request made by recognised iwi Ngāti Kuri and Te Aupōuri and other Māori submitters.

“The Bill also includes a 25-year review, an appropriate provision which enables legislation for the performance of the sanctuary to be reconsidered after a significant timespan. The amendments also make plain that there is to be no compensation arising from the creation of the sanctuary.

“A key provision of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a requirement for coastal nations gaining the benefits of EEZs to provide for marine protection. New Zealand has been one of the major beneficiaries of the EEZ and it is right for us to show some leadership on marine protection.

“The Government is keen to resolve outstanding iwi concerns through discussion. We acknowledge the strong support for the sanctuary by Ngāti Kuri and Te Aupōuri but would prefer to have broader support from Māori for this globally significant initiative.

“New Zealand has a proud history of environmental leadership. The Kermadec/Rangitāhua ocean sanctuary is a world class, unspoiled marine environment that New Zealanders should be proud to protect for future generations.”
