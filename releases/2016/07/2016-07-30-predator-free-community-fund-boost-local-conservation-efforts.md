Conservation Minister Maggie Barry has today welcomed the efforts of a young Taranaki conservationist which will contribute to making New Zealand predator free by 2050.

Ms Barry met with 8 year-old Monte Woodward while visiting New Plymouth on Saturday.

“Monte is to be congratulated. He has worked hard to raise money by running sausage sizzles and washing cars to purchase two traps which will help protect some of our most vulnerable native wildlife from rats, stoats and possums.” Ms Barry says.

Ms Barry presented Monte with a further six self-resetting traps and helped him set one in native bush near his home. Department of Conservation staff including the Threatened Species Ambassador will work with Monte and his classmates on a local trapping project.

“Supporting the work of local community and volunteer groups will be an important part of achieving our ambitious goal of making New Zealand predator free by 2050,” Ms Barry says.

“A special fund is being set up now to support community-led predator control projects. Funding will also go to improving groups’ access to toxins and traps, and identifying high-value areas suitable for local groups.”

On Monday the Government announced the adoption of the Predator Free New Zealand 2050 target and plans to set up a new Crown-owned company within the next six months to help fund predator eradication programmes.

“The level of enthusiasm at the community level has been a major social phenomenon in the last few years. Community groups are springing up across the country aspiring to the local version of the predator free New Zealand goal.” Ms Barry says.

The Department of Conservation will be releasing detailed information in the next few months about how community groups can apply for funding.
