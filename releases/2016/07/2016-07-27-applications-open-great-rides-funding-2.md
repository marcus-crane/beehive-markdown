Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key today announced applications are open for further funding to maintain and enhance the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

This is the fifth round of funding through the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund.

“This funding is part of the Government’s $8 million investment over four years to ensure the Great Rides are maintained to their current world-class standards,” Mr Key says.

“Already $3.2 million has been approved for 37 projects across 18 Great Rides. The projects include surface enhancements, safety barriers, an underpass installation, track re-routing and storm damage repairs.

“The New Zealand Cycle Trail showcased our diverse landscapes to an estimated one million people last year and that number is expected to be even higher this year,” Mr Key says.

“The trails have become a significant asset to our growing tourism industry. It’s vital that each trail is maintained to the highest possible standard so that riders continue to have a safe and enjoyable experience.”

Budget 2016 included additional funding of $25 million over four years, bringing the total invested in the New Zealand Cycle Trail to $75 million.

Applications for this round of funding will close on 31 August 2016.
