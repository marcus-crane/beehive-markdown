Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced the Prime Minister’s Scholarship programme for international study with be extended to Latin America, as well as Asia.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Latin America will complement the successful Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia initiative.  Under that programme 751 scholarships for Kiwi students to study in Asia have been awarded since it was implemented in 2013. 

“The Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia have seen New Zealand students gain valuable study and business experience offshore, learn about some of New Zealand’s most important trade partners, and bring back valuable skills to New Zealand.

The Latin American scholarships will give kiwi students much greater exposure to another part of the Asia-Pacific region that will become increasingly important to New Zealand in the years ahead.

“The scholarships will mean more young Kiwis are exposed to Latin American countries and cultures, and this will strengthen New Zealand’s ability to engage with key Latin American trading partners in the future,” Mr Joyce says.

“The expanded scholarships programme will strengthen international linkages with an area of the world which is becoming increasingly important for New Zealand trade and business. Latin American and Asian destinations are all just one direct flight away, making them easier to work with than ever.” 

“The Scholarships are part of our $761.4 million ‘Innovative New Zealand’ budget package, $43.5 million of that is to develop stronger international connections for tertiary students. This includes the introduction of the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Latin America, the expansion of the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia and the introduction of three Centres of Asia Pacific Excellence at universities.” 

The International Connections Package also includes changes to student support settings (student loan and student allowance) and tuition funding subsidies to encourage more study overseas.

Nominations for the first round of Latin American scholarships will open in September 2016 and they will be awarded in November.
