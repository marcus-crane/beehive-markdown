Associate Minister of Justice, Simon Bridges, announced today that he has reappointed Mr Aaron Bhatnagar and appointed Ms Karin Thomas as members of the Real Estate Agents Authority.

Mr Bhatnagar is reappointed for a second term.  Ms Thomas replaces Mr David Russell who has served on the Authority since its inception in 2009. Both appointments will commence on 1 July 2016 for a term of three years.

“I am pleased the Authority will retain the experience of Mr Bhatnagar and gain someone with the experience and expertise of Ms Thomas,” Mr Bridges says.   

“I would also like to acknowledge the out-going member, Mr Russell, who has brought a wealth of knowledge of consumer rights issues to the Authority and has played a significant part in the Authority’s successful establishment.”

Since the Authority was established in 2009, it has brought about considerable change to how the real estate industry is overseen.

“The Authority is a Crown agent responsible for promoting high service standards and professionalism in the real estate industry. It plays a vital role helping protect participants in the property market.

“It provides information to buyers and sellers, provides guidance to agents, and deals with complaints about agents’ behaviour,” says Mr Bridges.
