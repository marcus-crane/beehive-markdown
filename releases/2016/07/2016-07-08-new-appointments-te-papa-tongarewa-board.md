Two new appointments to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Board have been announced by Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry.

Auckland businessman Sir Rob Fenwick and experienced director Abby Foote of Christchurch will take up their positions on August 1.

Board Chair Evan Williams will continue in the role he has held since 2013, with existing members Dayle Mace and Paul Majurey also reappointed.

“Sir Rob and Ms Foote will add to the depth of experience on the board and make valuable contributions to the ongoing success of our national museum,” Ms Barry says.

“Mr Williams is an outstanding Chair who has steered Te Papa through challenging times. Last year saw the opening of *Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War* ­– now the most-visited exhibition in Te Papa’s history – and the museum has ambitious plans ahead for the redevelopment of its permanent exhibits.”

Sir Rob, a businessman, environmentalist and finalist for New Zealander of the Year has held a variety of governance roles for public, private and not for profit organisations, including as former Chair of the Antarctic Heritage Trust, Television New Zealand and Landcare Research Ltd.

Abby Foote has extensive audit experience working in a range of corporate, treasury and legal roles during the last 20 years. Currently, she is on the board of the New Zealand Local Government Fund Agency.

“I would like to sincerely thank outgoing members Wendy Lai and Philip Carter for the expertise and hard work they have committed to Te Papa during their time on the board.”
