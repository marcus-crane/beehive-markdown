Corrections Minister Judith Collins has congratulated the 22 graduates who today started their new roles as Corrections Officers.

“Corrections is undergoing a major recruitment drive and it is heartening to see so many high quality recruits joining the Department of Corrections’ frontline.

“Corrections is drawing people from many different walks of life who want to use their life experience and skills to make a difference. This, along with the new skills they learn such as tactical training, de-escalation techniques and motivational tools, is helping Corrections build a well-rounded workforce,” Ms Collins says.

This latest cohort will be based at Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison, Rimutaka Prison and Christchurch Men’s Prison.

The Minister’s Excellence Award went to recruit Brian Clark from Spring Hill Corrections Facility in recognition of his leadership, professionalism, outstanding assessment results and a genuine passion for his new role.

“After considerable experience in the Services already, Brian is an outstanding example of someone bringing their life skills to a Corrections role.

“With a rising prisoner population, Corrections is actively recruiting for frontline positions. Many jobs have transferable skills that are valuable for frontline staff. This group of graduates come from a diverse range of background but share a core belief that they can change lives and shape futures,” Ms Collins said.
