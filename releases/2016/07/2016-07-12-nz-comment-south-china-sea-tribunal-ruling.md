Foreign Minister Murray McCully has called on all parties to respect the Arbitral Tribunal ruling on maritime rights in the South China Sea.

“While New Zealand does not take a position on the various territorial claims in the South China Sea we have consistently stated that the differing interests in the region should be managed peacefully and in accordance with international law,” Mr McCully says.

“Maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea is vital to the ongoing prosperity of the wider Asia-Pacific region. It is in all parties’ interests to ensure the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is respected.

“We hope that the Tribunal’s ruling can provide a platform for resolving the longstanding and complex issues in the South China Sea and we urge all parties to work towards this end,” Mr McCully says.
