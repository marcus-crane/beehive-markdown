A target of around 3000 emergency housing places funded per year has been exceeded and Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett is seeking even more places to help house vulnerable New Zealanders.

The second round of funding for a share of $33 million announced in Budget 2016, directly targeted at emergency housing, has so far resulted in 51 proposals from 30 providers across the country providing 3032 new and existing emergency places per year.

“These places will make a huge difference to people in extreme housing need, and the targeted funding – the first of its kind by any government – means providers can focus on their core work rather than worry about funding,” Mrs Bennett says.

“It’s good to see groups put their hands up to use the funding for establishing new emergency housing in their regions,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Taking care of vulnerable people is a community effort. While the Government can provide financial support and other resources, organisations working in the community know their communities best, and we welcome their input.

“This funding and the new non-recoverable grant for people who require temporary help through motel accommodation are helping more people with immediate housing needs.

“The more than 3000 places per year is a great start. Nearly 350 places are new and we need to keep the momentum going. I still want to see more new emergency housing places throughout New Zealand and we have a work programme underway to achieve this.”

“Our focus is on delivering safe, warm, permanent housing for those eligible, but there will always be a temporary, emergency need for people who find themselves in unexpected, difficult circumstances,” Mrs Bennett says.

Increasing emergency housing is part of the Government’s comprehensive plan to ensure people in extreme housing need have somewhere safe to stay, help them transition into more permanent accommodation when they are ready and increase the supply of social housing.
