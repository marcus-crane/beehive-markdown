Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has participated in the New Zealand delegation to the 2016 Social Enterprise World Forum in Hong Kong, and is welcoming the opportunity for New Zealand to play host to next year’s Forum.

“The Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) provided a global platform to share, learn and celebrate the successes of social enterprises around the world,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I was able to meet with world leaders for social enterprise as well as showcasing ideas and success stories from New Zealand.

“New Zealand’s social enterprise sector is as innovative and fast growing as other countries, and is starting to bring real benefit to communities throughout the country,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The next Social Enterprise World Forum will be held in Christchurch from 27-29 September 2017. 

The theme for the 2017 World Forum is “Ka koroki te manu – creating our tomorrow”.  The phrase, derived from a Māori prayer, translates as the first birdcall of the morning chorus, and a welcome to the challenges and glories of a new day.
