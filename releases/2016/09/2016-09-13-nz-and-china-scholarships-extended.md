Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has announced a two year extension for a scholarship programme that is deepening engagement between New Zealand and China, while boosting mutual understanding of each other’s food safety systems.

The scholarship programme was developed in partnership between New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). It was the first initiative under the Food Safety Cooperation Agreement signed between New Zealand and China in November 2013.

“To date, 13 officials from CFDA have participated in the programme. Given its success, we see value in extending this scholarship programme for a further two years.”

The scholarship covers best practice regulation, risk management, food processing and design, and the development and implementation of food standards. It has an academic component led by Massey University, which is supported by applied learning through study tours and internships.

“This scholarship not only increases the understanding of our respective food safety systems, it also helps to strengthen the relationships between the two countries and help to align food safety practices,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“China is a very important trading partner for New Zealand and we’ve established a relationship based on trust, respect and New Zealand’s well-earned reputation as a producer of high quality and safe food.

“The two year extension of this scholarship programme will further enhance the close cooperation between our countries, resulting in a stronger bilateral relationship in the areas of food safety and consumer confidence,” Mrs Goodhew says.
