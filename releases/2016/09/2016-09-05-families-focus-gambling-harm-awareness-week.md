Families are the focus of the first-ever Gambling Harm Awareness Week, Associate Minister of Health Hon Peter Dunne said today.

The week aims to draw attention to the harmful effects that gambling can have and how people can get help.

“The theme of the week is Family Time – Time Together can beat gambling harm.

“It encourages New Zealanders to spend time with their family this week instead of gambling.

“While gambling is a popular form of entertainment, it can have unwanted consequences that affect people’s health, relationships, finances, employment and that of their families, whānau and community.

“New Zealand’s gambling harm services, including face-to-face counselling services and the Gambling Helpline are available to help people in need free of charge. But friends, families and whānau also have a role to play. Whether it’s going for a walk, sharing kai, playing sport or taking part in cultural activities, we can all make a huge difference,” says Mr Dunne.
