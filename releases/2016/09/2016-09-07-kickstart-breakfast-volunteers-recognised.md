Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says that seven and a half million breakfasts have been served in schools around the country since the Government expanded the KickStart Breakfast programme in 2013.

“With more than 125,862 breakfasts served every week in 870 decile 1-10 schools, we can be sure these students are getting the best start to their school day,” Mrs Tolley says.

“The KickStart programme is a true partnership between government, Fonterra, Sanitarium and the volunteers who run the breakfast clubs, and we’re seeing it working well. One example of this success is Hastings Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Wānanga Whare Tapere o Takitimu.

“Today, we acknowledge the contribution of volunteers Martha Greening, Kathleen Hawaikirangi, Te Kerehi Thompson, Whetu Marama Paenga and Waimaria Paenga who have been recognised with the national KickStart Breakfast Unsung Hero Award. In rain, hail or shine, these amazing helpers make sure breakfast is happening each school day for 95 students attending this Te Kura Kaupapa.”

“This award recognises the wonderful generosity of these volunteers who give up their time to support the school.

“So many of our communities, like Hastings, are stepping up to ensure our children and young people have everything they need to learn and thrive. We want all New Zealand children to succeed at school and making sure they have access to a healthy breakfast is something we can all do to help.

“Schools in the programme also report improvements in students’ general health and wellbeing, concentration and behaviour,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This is another fantastic example of the Government, communities and the private sector working together to ensure children have the best possible start we can give them.”
