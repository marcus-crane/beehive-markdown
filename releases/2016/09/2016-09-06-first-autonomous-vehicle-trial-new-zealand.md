Transport Minister Simon Bridges says an announcement by Volvo and the New Zealand Traffic Institute (Trafinz) of an autonomous vehicle trial will be a first for New Zealand.

Volvo and Trafinz aim to demonstrate the technology in Tauranga in November as part of the national Trafinz transport conference.

“This is will be the first trial of its kind in New Zealand and reflects our world-leading regulation around autonomous vehicles, which encourages new technology while protecting public safety ,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Government is ensuring New Zealand stays at the forefront of transport innovation, with recent reviews of the rules relating to autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Small Passenger Service operators, respectively.

“Autonomous vehicles will be a big part of the future of transport and offer potential safety, efficiency and environmental benefits. It is exciting to see international recognition that New Zealand is at the forefront of enabling this technology.

“Testing in New Zealand also enables an understanding of how the technology responds to the New Zealand environment and allows our transport sector to gain skills in deploying and managing new technology.” 

The New Zealand Transport Agency and Ministry of Transport are working with Volvo and Trafinz to ensure the trial will operate within the law, including appropriately managing any safety risks.
