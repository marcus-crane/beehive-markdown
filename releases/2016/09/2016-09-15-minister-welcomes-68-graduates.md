Corrections Minister Judith Collins has congratulated 68 Corrections Officers and Offender Employment Instructors who graduated today.

“We have people of all ages, stages of life, nationalities and cultures in this group. Whether you are just starting your working life, or bringing valuable life skills and cultural awareness to your new profession, each of these recruits will play an essential role in changing lives and shaping the futures of prisoners.

This is one of the largest group of recruits ever and comes as the Department embarks on a major recruitment campaign. 

“Corrections wants to recruit another 500 officers from throughout New Zealand and 100 from overseas by September next year and if all the candidates are of this calibre then I’m confident that it will be in good hands.”

Today’s new recruits will be based at Northland Region Corrections Facility, Auckland Prison, Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Whanganui Prison, Manawatu Prison, Arohata Prison, Rimutaka Prison, Christchurch Men’s Prison and Otago Corrections Facility.

As this was a combined course, two Minister’s Excellence Awards were presented. This award was established by Ms Collins in 2009.

The first recipient, Steven Bell, is a former UK police officer who brings not only his past service skills to Corrections but also the desire to be a positive influence in people’s lives.

Steven moved to New Zealand from Britain 12 years ago to be with his wife who comes from the Bay of Plenty area, and joins Spring Hill Corrections Facility,

The second, Aucklander Graeme Tu’inukuafe, joins Corrections after 20 years in the workforce, and, according to his instructors, will be a wonderful role model to both Pacifika and Maori prisoners. He heads to Christchurch Men’s Prison.

“We are very fortunate that these admirable individuals have chosen to join Corrections and are using both their prior and newly-acquired  life skills and knowledge to help reduce reoffending and make our communities safer, ” says Ms Collins.
