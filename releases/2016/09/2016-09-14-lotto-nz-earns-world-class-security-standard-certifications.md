Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today congratulated Lotto New Zealand on obtaining two sought-after international security certifications.

“Lotto players can trust that Lotto NZ’s systems and processes are designed to protect the integrity of its games and the personal information of its players,” said Mr Dunne.

Lotto NZ has been officially informed that it has obtained the International Organisation for Standardisation’s Information Security Management System Standard (ISO 27001:2013) and the World Lottery Association’s Security Control Standard (WLA SCS: 2012).

“Lotto NZ’s success has been built on the integrity of its games and the transparency of its systems.

“New Zealand can be proud that its national lottery has security management practices in place that demonstrate international best practice.

“Lotto NZ is one of just four organisations in New Zealand to obtain the ISO Information Security Management System Standard, which outlines a set of policies, processes, and systems to manage security risk”, said Mr Dunne.

In order to obtain certification, Lotto NZ adhered to a robust year-long process that included two separate independent audits ensuring that Lotto NZ satisfied 114 separate ISO security control requirements and 111 lottery-specific WLA controls.

Lotto NZ exists to provide safe gaming that allows New Zealanders to play and win while contributing money back to New Zealand communities.

In the most recent financial year, Lotto players generated over $200 million in community funding to support over 3,000 groups promoting sport, art, culture, heritage, recreation and health research across New Zealand.

Attaining the security standards supports Lotto NZ’s vision to be a world leading lottery for the maximum benefit of New Zealand communities, which was also bolstered earlier this year by attaining the highest level of responsible gaming certification by the WLA.
