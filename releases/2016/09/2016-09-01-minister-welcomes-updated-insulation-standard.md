New guidelines on how to effectively install insulation are being welcomed by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith.

A revised standard, *Energy efficiency – Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings,* has been published by Standards New Zealand and provides extended guidelines for insulation installers and building owners on how to do the job effectively.

“Changes to the Residential Tenancies Act to make rental homes warmer, drier and safer came into effect on 1 July 2016.  The changes require all rental properties to have ceiling and underfloor insulation by 1 July 2019, and all social housing properties were required to be insulated by 1 July 2016,” Dr Smith says.

“Homes with properly installed insulation provide a warm, dry and safe place for New Zealanders to live. This means fewer hospital admissions, fewer school days lost and a better standard of living overall. 

“Having a standard that details how to safely and correctly install that insulation in residential buildings makes it even easier for landlords and property managers to comply with the changes.”

Standards NZ has made the standard publically available on the [www.tenancy.govt.nz](http://www.tenancy.govt.nz/)  website. Changes to the Residential Tenancies Regulations to reflect the revised standard come into force on 1 October 2016.
