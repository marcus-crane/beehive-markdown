Education Minister Hekia Parata is urging New Zealand teachers to put their names forward for the Special Education study awards for 2017.

“The Special Education study awards are an excellent professional opportunity for teachers to develop their skills in working with students with additional learning needs,” says Ms Parata.

“For 2017 there are more than 150 new Special Education study awards available to New Zealand teachers so that they can train in specialist areas.”

Many past study award recipients have gone on to become highly sought after specialist resource teachers and advisors.

The study award package can include paid tuition fees, study leave and contributions towards travel and accommodation for any compulsory block courses.

“I encourage teachers and educators throughout the country to consider applying for these study awards.”

The Special Education study awards are just one way that New Zealand teachers can access funding and support for professional learning and development.

The Government has increased funding into special education by 29 per cent and it is critical that in addition we grow the skills of those working with our young people.

Applications close on 30 September. Read more [here](http://www.education.govt.nz/school/working-in-a-school/scholarships-for-people-working-in-schools/special-education-study-awards-and-scholarships/).
