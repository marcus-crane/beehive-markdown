Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today released a detailed report on the economy of the West Coast that outlines significant potential to attract new investment and diversify the economy of the West Coast region.

As part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme, the Tai Poutini West Coast Regional Growth Study identifies and explores opportunities to achieve growth in investment, incomes and employment in the region.

“After a strong economic run, the West Coast has been affected by global economic headwinds that have dropped international prices for minerals and milk powders and undermined key sectors of its economy in recent years,” Mr Joyce says.

“This Study is a unique opportunity for the local community and business leaders to work alongside central government and commit to an action plan to grow the region through new investment and new industries. Regional Economic Development Ministers are committed to doing their part to help the region grow.

“Key to encouraging growth on the West Coast will be building resilience and certainty around infrastructure, so that when markets for the main local industries improve, the region is in a better position to take advantage of favourable conditions. Ensuring high quality road and telecommunications networks will help the region to reduce the disadvantages it faces due to its distance from markets. 

“At the same time, the region can look to diversify its economy, not only by building on new and emerging opportunities, but by extracting more value from key industries.”

Tourism is one area where the West Coast is thriving, mainly driven by international visitor spending in Westland, and this sector provides the major immediate opportunity in the region.

“With the West Coast’s stunning natural setting and cultural history, there is a great deal of potential to attract more domestic visitors, commercialise more experiences and develop a stronger set of iconic attractions and products that encourages visitors to travel across the region and stay longer.

Mr Guy says key industries like dairy are likely to remain the mainstay of the West Coast economy, but the region can build on a range of niche sectors that, although small-scale, collectively offer many possibilities for job growth.

“There are several horticulture and food and beverage entrepreneurs exporting products like meat products, cranberries, blueberries, honey and vegetables. Aquaculture is another primary industry that could be developed should feasibility of salmon farming in the region be established,” Mr Guy says.

“The indigenous wood processing industry has also shown it can create value and jobs through the careful extraction of windblown timber.”

“There is potential to grow international education services in outdoor recreation and environmental management. In fact, demand for experiential leadership courses in these areas currently exceeds supply. EPIC Westport is also proving that the region can attract and grow ICT enterprises,” Mr Joyce says.

The Regional Growth Programme has been commissioned jointly by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry for Primary Industries, working in partnership with other agencies and regional stakeholders. As part of the programme, an economic action plan for the West Coast, informed by the Tai Poutini West Coast Regional Growth Study, will be released in early 2017.
