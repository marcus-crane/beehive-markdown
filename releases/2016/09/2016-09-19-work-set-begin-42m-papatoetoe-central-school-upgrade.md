Contractors will be on site this week, ready to begin the $4.2 million upgrade at Papatoetoe Central School in Auckland, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“The start of work on a new, two-storey classroom block makes this an exciting time for the school,” says Ms Parata.

The new block will have eight learning spaces, to replace six older classrooms at the school. The two additional learning spaces are to accommodate expected roll growth.

“This project is just one of many underway across Auckland to modernise facilities and add capacity to the school network,” says Ms Parata.

“Since June 26, work has started on five other school redevelopments worth around $130 million, at Takapuna Primary School, Bayswater School, Western Springs College, Freemans Bay School and The Gardens School.

“Another $32 million has been announced for redevelopments at Te Atatu Intermediate, Northcote Primary School, Newmarket School and Clayton Park School.

“On 1 June, Minister Kaye and I announced that $153 million would be invested in Auckland, as part of the $882.5 million set aside for school infrastructure under Budget 2016.

“This is a huge investment which shows the Government is committed to meeting the needs of students in our fastest growing city, now and into the future.”

Construction at Papatoetoe Central School is expected to be complete by July 2017.
