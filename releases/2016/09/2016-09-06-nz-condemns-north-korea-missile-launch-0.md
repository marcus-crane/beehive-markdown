Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that New Zealand condemns yesterday’s multiple missile launches by North Korea.

“The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly demanded that North Korea not launch ballistic missiles,” Mr McCully says

“Yesterday’s launches and the other tests conducted this year by North Korea are a serious challenge to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. 

“New Zealand again urges North Korea to adhere to previous Security Council resolutions and to refrain from further tests. 

“As the current Chair of the UN Security Council we will work with other Council members and our regional partners to ensure North Korea understands such tests are unacceptable to the international community,” Mr McCully says.
