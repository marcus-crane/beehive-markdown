Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman and Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner say the country is extremely proud of what our Paralympians achieved in Rio. 

“Our 31 Kiwi Paralympians achieved 21 medals in total - nine gold, five silver, and seven bronze – that’s three medals over their target,” says Dr Coleman.

“On a medals per capita basis, New Zealand topped the table, maintaining the top position it achieved in London 2012.

“It was fantastic that swimmers Sophie Pascoe, Mary Fisher and Cameron Leslie defended their 2012 Paralympic titles, and again won gold.

“Congratulations also to gold medallists’ swimmer Nikita Howarth, and Liam Malone and Anna Grimaldi for their performances on the track and field.”

“Our Paralympian team built on previous successes and demonstrated the extraordinary things disabled people can accomplish through hard work and determination,” says Ms Wagner.

“New Zealand achieved our 200th Paralympic medal in Rio when Sophie Pascoe claimed silver in her 50m freestyle final.

“It was great that Kiwis across the country were able to support the team by watching the action on TVNZ and Attitude Live thanks to an arrangement secured with the support of ACC.”

Kiwi Paralympians competed in para-sports, para-athletics, para-cycling, para-sailing, para-canoeing, para-shooting and para-swimming.

The Paralympics featured 528 medal events across 23 sports, and around 4,350 competitors from more than 170 countries.

Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner attended the Paralympics from 6 to 10 September.

High Performance Sport NZ invested $12 million over the four year Paralympic cycle.
