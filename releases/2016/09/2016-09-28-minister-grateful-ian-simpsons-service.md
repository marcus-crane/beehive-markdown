The Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission Gerry Brownlee says outgoing chief executive Ian Simpson should be commended for his leadership during unprecedented times in the nation’s history.

Ian Simpson is leaving EQC at the end of the year to take up the role of chief executive with GNS Science.

“I first spoke to Ian on September 5 2010 following the September 4 2010 earthquake.

“Since that time, he has superintended one of the biggest insurance company responses to any natural disaster anywhere in the world.

“I am grateful to him for the dedication and commitment he has shown over the past six years, despite considerable, but equally undue, criticism.

“From my perspective, Ian should be very proud of, and congratulated for, his leadership through extraordinary – and I hope never-to-be-repeated – times in New Zealand.

“It is encouraging that Ian has accepted the position of chief executive of GNS Science.

“GNS is not only New Zealand’s primary organisation for risk assessment but it’s internationally respected for the work it does.

“Combining the expertise of having managed disaster response with the forward-looking science of natural disaster risk assessment should see GNS further enhance its world-class reputation.

“I offer my thanks to Ian for the work he has done and wish him all the best for the future.”
