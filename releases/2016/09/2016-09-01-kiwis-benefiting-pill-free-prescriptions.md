Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says adults and their families are benefiting from pill-free prescriptions with a new survey showing they are fitter and happier as a result.

“The Government is committed to supporting New Zealanders to live healthier more active lives away from hospitals,” says Dr Coleman.

“One of the ways we are doing this is through Green Prescriptions, which contain advice on nutrition and physical activity. Local initiatives range from cooking classes to motivational texts, and a range of opportunities to be active.

“There are a variety of reasons someone might receive a Green Prescription from their GP or practice nurse. Patients may have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, weight issues, have high blood pressure or cholesterol, at risk of stroke, or have arthritis.

“Almost 50,000 adults received a Green Prescription in the past year. A recent survey of over 2,800 recipients found the prescriptions not only benefit the individual but also have a positive impact on the whole family.”

Summary of key findings:

- 73 per cent reported positive changes in their health
- 65 per cent said they are also encouraging others to be more active
- 64 per cent are still active 6 to 8 months after receiving their prescription
- 71 per cent have made changes to their diet
- 81 per cent are now motivated to get and/or stay physically active

The full results from the Green Prescription patient survey are available on the Ministry of Health website: [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz)
