Trade Minister Todd McClay says more discussions are now needed between officials on the Pacer Plus trade agreement.

"After seven years of negotiation, final agreement is close however a Fiji Government statement last week has said they have issues with some of the outcomes agreed by all Pacific Island countries at the recent Trade Ministers meeting in Christchurch,” says Mr McClay.

“I do not believe Fiji's statement is a fair reflection of the agreement as it stands. Pacer Plus will be a high quality agreement which provides opportunities for all Pacific nations and one that recognises the individual developing nature of their economies.

“Having carefully considered their recent statement, I will not be traveling to Fiji this week for bilateral trade discussions but look forward to visiting when issues have been resolved,” says Mr McClay.
