Small Business Minister Craig Foss today announced a new appointment to the Small Business Development Group (SBDG).

Jerry He has been appointed to the SBDG for a 33 month term, expiring 30 June 2019.

“As Sales Director at Auckland food technology company New Zealand Green Wave Limited, Mr He has skills in business and entrepreneurship, as well as sound knowledge of exporting, particularly to China,” Mr Foss says.

“Mr He has strong cultural connections with Asian communities in Auckland, and his mix of local community and international business experience will be a welcome addition to the group.”

Mr He is also the Chairman of the New Zealand Green Industry Association and a Director at Feel Good Corporation.

“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all group members for their time and ongoing commitment to helping small New Zealand businesses grow and thrive,” Mr Foss says.

The SBDG, which has 12 members, advises the government on issues affecting the growth and development of small businesses.
