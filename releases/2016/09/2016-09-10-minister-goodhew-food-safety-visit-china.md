Food Safety and Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew will travel to China today for bi-lateral meetings and to open a new Fonterra dairy facility in the Shanxi Province.

“The relationship between New Zealand and China has never been stronger, and it is crucial for our economy that we maintain that strong relationship in food safety,” says Mrs Goodhew.

While in Beijing, Mrs Goodhew will meet with Vice Minister Teng Jiacai of the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for the third Joint Food Safety Commission meeting, to build upon the shared goal for increased communication and cooperation between the two countries.

Mrs Goodhew will also be meeting with Vice Minister Mei Kebao of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), and with Minister Zhang Jianlong of the State Forestry Administration.

“As one of our largest trading partners, it is important that we work with China to maintain and improve access for New Zealand goods and services, and I look forward to making good progress during my visit,” Mrs Goodhew says.

In Shanxi Province, Mrs Goodhew will attend the official opening of the Fonterra Ying County Breeding Hub. The facility, which has up to 30,000 cows, 16,000 of which are milking cows, employs 90 percent local people and sources 85 percent of its feed from the local area.

“The new Breeding Hub in Shanxi Province is a significant investment by a New Zealand company, and is a big opportunity to boost the local economy with some Kiwi know-how,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew will return to New Zealand on Friday 16 September.
