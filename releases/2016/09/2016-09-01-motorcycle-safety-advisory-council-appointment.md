ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that Joanne (Jo) Buckner has been appointed to the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC).

The council represents the motorcycling community and advises ACC on safety initiatives that will make motorcycling safer on New Zealand roads

“Jo brings a strong background of leadership and advisory experience to the Council, along with a passion for motorcyclists’ safety,” says Ms Kaye.

“As well as being a keen motorcyclist herself, Jo has in-depth involvement with the motorcycling community.

“She is a former Captain of the New Zealand Division of the Women’s International Motorcycling Association and a Life Member of the BMW Owners Register.”

Based on Ministry of Transport crash facts, motorcyclists are 21 times more likely to be killed or injured than car drivers over the same distance travelled.

“The MSAC plays a key role influencing the work of ACC and others aimed at reducing motorcycle crashes and the impact they have on riders, their families and the community.

“Jo’s experience, skills and passions will be an important asset to the Council and the work it’s doing.

“Last year, I consulted on and reduced the motorcycle safety levy, which pays for road safety initiatives specifically benefitting motorcyclists, from $30 to $25 per year from 1 July 2016.

“This strikes a balance between investing in safety initiatives that can reduce motorcyclists’ injuries, and not collecting too much in levies.

“The Council is currently working with ACC exploring a range of new initiatives involving rider skills, road user behaviour, road and roadside improvements and motorcycle safety technology.

“I’m also advised that the MSAC and ACC are preparing to launch their joint Motorcycle Safety Strategy, as their commitment to the Safer Journeys Action Plan 2016 – 2020.

“This strategy will aim to help people be better informed about the causes of motorcycle crashes, and seek to direct conversation and focus to the areas of greatest benefit in terms of reducing fatal and serious injuries.”

**About the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC)**

The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC) is made up of motorcyclists who are committed to making riding safer for motorcyclists.

It was set up in 2011 to oversee investment of the motorcycle safety levy (MSL) fund.

The MSL is a now-$25 levy per motorcycle registration that’s earmarked for improving motorcyclists’ safety on New Zealand roads.

The MSAC provides advice and recommendations to ACC on investing MSL money on initiatives that will make motorcycling safer. These include research, awareness campaigns and the introduction of safer road design to reduce motorcycle crashes.

MSAC members are passionate about motorcycling and improving rider safety.

**More about the Council’s work so far**

Work to date by the Council has delivered an NZ-specific evidence base that has helped inform ACC’s input to the government’s Safer Journeys Action Plan 2016-2020, as well as a shared strategy between ACC and the Council.

The Council has helped enhance motorcyclists’ safety by:

- advocating for specific safety interventions benefitting motorcyclists on the Southern Coromandel loop road and Rimutaka Hill road, with work ahead on developing a process to prioritise other high-risk routes for safety interventions
- recommending that ACC and NZTA improve the *Making Roads Motorcycle Friendly* guide, and supporting seminars to introduce the guide to road safety engineers
- establishing relationships with key sector groups able to influence motorcycle safety.
