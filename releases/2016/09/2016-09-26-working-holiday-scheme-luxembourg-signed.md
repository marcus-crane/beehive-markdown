Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today signed a Working Holiday Scheme with Luxembourg during a meeting with the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg Jean Asselborn in Wellington.

“This is Luxembourg’s first Working Holiday Scheme and will allow up to 50 young people from New Zealand and Luxembourg to live and work in each other’s countries,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“We are pleased to be the first country to sign a Working Holiday Scheme with Luxembourg. This reflects our positive relationship, which has been developed and strengthened through our wider interactions with the European Union.

“Working Holiday Schemes provide young New Zealanders with opportunities to live and work in Europe, while working holiday makers from countries like Luxembourg contribute positively to New Zealand through tourism, cultural, and interpersonal links.”

The Working Holiday Scheme will be open to 18-30 year olds and is expected to start in April 2017.
