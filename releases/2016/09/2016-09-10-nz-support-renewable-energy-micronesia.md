Prime Minister John Key has announced a new package of support for renewable energy projects in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and Palau.

“New Zealand is committed to boosting the supply of renewable energy across the Pacific in order to help Pacific nations build resilience, and reduce both emissions and dependence on imported diesel,” Mr Key says.

“So I’m pleased to announce today that we will be investing $5 million in renewable energy projects in Micronesia.

“The funding will allow the development of up to 400kW of solar generated power in each of the three countries – that’s the renewable equivalent of about half a million litres of fuel per annum.

“This is the first time we have undertaken this type of initiative in Micronesia and we’ll be looking to work with development partners and the three Micronesian governments to deliver both funding and technical assistance.”

Mr Key says the package is part of the $100 million in support announced by New Zealand at the Pacific Energy Conference earlier this year. The Conference resulted in commitments of over $1 billion from international donors for renewable energy across the region.

“New Zealand now has significant renewable energy projects underway in 11 Pacific countries. We’re proud to be working with the region to demonstrate leadership on the transition to renewable energy and low carbon development,” Mr Key says.

The Prime Minister is currently attending the Pacific Islands Forum in Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia.
