Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell announces the nation-wide proposed Māori Land Services wānanga starting Monday 19 September 2016.

“This is an exciting part of the journey as we look at further strengthening the protection of Māori land, retaining ownership of whenua Māori for future generations and making it easier for land owners to make decisions about their land,” says Minister Flavell.

“Over the last year we have heard views on how we could improve arrangements for Māori land owners and their whenua.  At the wānanga there will be kōrero with land owners regarding what a successful proposed Māori Land Service would look like.

“The 25 wānanga which begin on 19 September 2016 in Dunedin are an opportunity for Māori land owners to tell us what they think the proposed Māori Land Service should provide and how it should deliver these services.

“The experience, insight and mātauranga of Māori land owners will ensure the Māori Land Service is built upon the right foundations,” Minister Flavell said today.

The wānanga will be held between Monday 19 September and Friday 14 October 2016.
