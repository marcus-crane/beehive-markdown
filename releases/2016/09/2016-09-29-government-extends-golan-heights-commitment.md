Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced Cabinet’s decision to extend New Zealand’s contribution to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation through to September 2018.

“The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation is the United Nations’ oldest peacekeeping operation, and is an important and visible mission to help preserve peace between Israel and its neighbours.

“The New Zealand Defence Force has been a longstanding and respected contributor since 1954 through the monitoring role played by our military observers.

“Renewing this commitment will see eight personnel continue to support conflict prevention through the mission. It is our largest current contribution to a United Nations-led peacekeeping operation.

“Our personnel are serving under the experienced leadership of New Zealand’s former Chief of Army Major General Dave Gawn, who is the current Head of the Mission through to August 2018,” Mr Brownlee says.

*About the mission:*

- The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation emerged from the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 through United Nations Security Council Resolution 50, to supervise the truce in Palestine.
- The subsequent 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours – Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria – required a continued United Nations presence, which has remained to today.
- The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation mission currently comprises 151 unarmed military observers provided by 25 troop contributing countries including New Zealand. These military observers monitor the situation along the borders of Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
- New Zealand’s former Chief of Army Major General Dave Gawn was appointed directly by the United Nations as Head of Mission and Chief of Staff from 1 August 2015 for a three-year term.
