The government’s new first-stop-shop product recall website has been embraced by consumers says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“Since the site went live in March, 125 products have been recalled and over 28,000 people have used the site to search, subscribe and keep safe by knowing which products may pose a safety risk.

“Recalling unsafe products is an essential part of our product safety system but informing consumers of these recalls has posed quite a challenge in the past.

“As consumer engagement with the website continues to grow, businesses will be able to reach more consumers, making the recall process easier,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Baby products top the list of recalls viewed, with users making the most of the site’s social media capability to share information with their social network.

Previously product safety recall information was distributed by a variety of different government agencies. The site also links to food recall information on MPI’s website.
