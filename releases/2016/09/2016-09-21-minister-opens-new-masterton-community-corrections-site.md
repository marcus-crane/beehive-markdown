Corrections Minister Judith Collins today officially opened the upgraded Masterton Community Corrections site in Albert Street, Masterton.

The upgrade of the Masterton site is part of a five-year nation-wide renewal programme to make Community Corrections’ more secure for both staff and offenders.

The enhancements to the Masterton site include improved security features such as, closed circuit TV monitoring, a main door which locks remotely, glazed interview rooms, duress alarms and swipe card access to staff-only areas.

The upgrades to the facility mean that work and living skills programmes are now able to be delivered at the site in addition to literacy & numeracy assessments, rehabilitation, motivation and maintenance programmes. 

The 21 staff employed at Masterton Community Corrections manage 263 offenders and 336 community-based sentences and orders, including home detention and community work.

There are over 30,000 offenders serving community-based sentences at any given time. Community Corrections support these people to motivate them to make changes in their lives and find positive ways to give back to their communities.

“Public safety is a priority for Corrections and the upgrades to Masterton Community Corrections means a safer working environment for staff and better support for offenders,” said Ms Collins.
