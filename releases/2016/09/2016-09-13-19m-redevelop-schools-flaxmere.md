Around $19 million will be invested to redevelop Flaxmere College and Kimi Ora Community School in Flaxmere, Hastings, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

Ms Parata made the announcement during a visit to Flaxmere this morning.

“Around $14 million will be spent on Flaxmere College, to replace the existing classrooms with 22 new, flexible learning spaces. The school’s hall and gym will also be repaired,” says Ms Parata.

“About another $5 million will be spent on Kimi Ora Community School, where the existing classrooms will be replaced with six new, flexible learning spaces. The school’s hall will also be refurbished.

“This is a big investment which I know will be welcomed by the local community, because both schools are currently in poor condition and have weathertightness issues.

“These projects will see the creation of innovative learning environments, which support teachers and students to work together in different ways to enhance the learning experience.

“We want all children to have the opportunity to excel at school, and providing the right physical environment is a big part of this.

“Today’s announcement demonstrates the Government’s continued commitment to modernising schools in communities throughout New Zealand.”

Design and planning works will be completed throughout 2017, with construction expected to start in 2018.
