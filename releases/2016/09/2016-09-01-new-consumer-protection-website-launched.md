Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith officially launched the redeveloped Consumer Protection website today at a forum in Wellington.

“The new website makes things easier for consumers,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“All New Zealanders can use this website to access straight-forward content about what needs to be done before, during and after purchasing a product or service.”

In the past financial year the Commerce Commission received 4,283 complaints under the Fair Trading Act.

“It is important for consumers to know what their rights are when buying products or services. This new resource will assist everyone to become more familiar with those rights,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The website launch was part of the September meeting of the Consumer Protection Forum, which brings together managers from government agencies, non-government organisations and the private sector as part of a collaborative approach to protecting consumers.
