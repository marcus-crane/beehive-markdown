New Zealand is set to join an international agreement addressing carbon emissions from air travel, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

“International aviation is not included in the recent Paris Agreement, which is why New Zealand will join the voluntary global measure being developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),” Mr Bridges says.

ICAO is responsible for the regulation of international aviation, including measures for the reduction of emissions in the sector.

“New Zealand will support the ICAO Global Measure Resolution and participate from Phase I, which commences in 2021, provided other developed countries and the majority of major aviation states also agree to do so.

“A single, robust global market-based measure is likely to achieve a significantly better environmental outcome at a lower cost than a patchwork of national and regional measures.”

Mr Bridges says the ICAO measure reflects the importance of a robust environmental outcome while being voluntary recognizes the need to respect different countries’ capabilities.

“New Zealand’s participation shows our strong commitment to playing our part in the global response to climate change. Supporting this international agreement is the latest in a series of steps Government is taking to encourage a shift to a low-carbon economy, domestically and globally.

“It would join our support for the Paris Agreement which we plan to ratify this year, new transport technologies and measures to increase electric vehicles, along with the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme – which was the world’s first major ETS to affect airlines.”
