The 2016 Commerce Commission Consumer Issues Report released today shows the impact of continued growth in online retail says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“The global market place is increasing competition and forcing retailers to be more innovative and creative in how they market their products to consumers,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The report notes that online sales now make up over 6% of retail spending.

“However online mediums are now responsible for 34 per cent of fair trading complaints to Commission.”

“It is important to remember that even though there may not be a physical shop for a consumer to return to, New Zealand online retailers are still subject to the Fair Trading Act and Consumer Guarantees Act,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Law changes in 2014 require that online sellers who are acting in trade disclose this so consumers know that these protections apply.

The report, produced by the Commerce Commission annually, also highlights a range of other issues that are affecting consumers, such as contract terms and conditions and invoicing.
