Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is travelling to the USA and Peru today to attend agricultural and APEC conferences.

He travels to Omaha, Nebraska today to attend and speak at the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) and then onto Piura in Peru to attend the APEC Food Security Ministerial Meeting. 

“The NASDA conference is a great opportunity to meet State Secretaries of Agriculture, US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and senior industry leaders,” says Mr Guy.

As part of the conference Mr Guy has been invited to address the Global Leaders Forum on Agriculture and Trade.

“A key topic will be the importance of the TPP to agricultural producers around the world. It has the potential to create jobs, raise standards of living and open up huge opportunities.”

In Peru next week Mr Guy is attending the APEC Food Security Ministerial Meeting which has a focus on advancing regional economic integration, enhancing the regional food market and developing human capital.

“This is also an important opportunity to meet with ministerial counterparts from some of the biggest economies in our region.”

Mr Guy returns to New Zealand on Friday 30 September.
