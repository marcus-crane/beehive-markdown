Trade Minister Todd McClay has announced two further public sessions on the Trade in Services Agreement, to be held in Christchurch and Dunedin in early October.

“South Island businesses make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s services export performance. TiSA represents a significant opportunity for all services firms looking to expand their export activity,” says Mr McClay.

The sessions follow on from similar events held in Wellington and Auckland in June.

“The Auckland and Wellington events were a good opportunity for our negotiators to hear a wide range of views on the negotiation, including from businesses encountering non-tariff barriers in TiSA markets. It’s important we continue to canvas these views across the country.”

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) will host the public discussions in Christchurch on 4 October and Dunedin on 5 October.

Anyone interested in attending these meetings should register with MFAT by emailing [serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz](mailto:serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz).  Further details are available on the Ministry’s website: [www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa).

For those who are unable to attend the sessions, questions are welcomed by email. Formal submissions on the TiSA negotiation continue to be welcomed by email**.**
