Immigration New Zealand (INZ) will partner with the Edmund Hillary Fellowship to bring innovation-based ventures to New Zealand, announced Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“In April, the Government agreed to pilot a new Global Impact Visa (GIVs) in partnership with the private sector, to enable high-impact entrepreneurs, investors and start-up teams to launch global ventures from New Zealand,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Today, I am pleased to announce that The Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) has been selected as the private sector provider to deliver the attraction, selection and integration programme for GIVs.

“EHF will identify potential applicants and build a regional network which will support participants across the country, while INZ will be responsible for processing and making decisions on visas.”

The EHF is a collaboration between the Hillary Institute for International Leadership, a not-for-profit organisation that identifies and celebrates mid-career leaders from around the world and Kiwi Connect, an organisation promoting and connecting high impact entrepreneurship in New Zealand.

“These partners have an exceptional combined record of recognising, rewarding and nurturing emerging entrepreneurs and leaders.

“By drawing on private sector strengths and knowledge in this space, the government is better positioned to accelerate innovation and continue to grow the contribution migrants make to the economy.”

The visa will run as a four-year pilot, and be limited to 400 visas over the duration of the pilot.  In addition, up to 80 New Zealand entrepreneurs and investors will be accepted into EHF over the four years, providing the opportunity for collaboration between GIVs migrants and New Zealand entrepreneurs and investors.

The Programme opens for applications in early 2017 with the first GIVs migrants to arrive later in the year.
