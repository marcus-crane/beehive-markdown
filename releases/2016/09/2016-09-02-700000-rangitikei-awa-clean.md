The Rangitīkei Awa is the latest waterway to get a funding boost from the Government to improve its water quality, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Māori Party Co-leaders Te Ururoa Flavell and Marama Fox announced today.

“This $700,000 grant will go towards an $800,000 project which includes restoration of the Rangitīkei Awa and catchment by improving water quality, fish habitat and riparian health at sites which are important to the Ngā Pae o Rangitīkei collective,” Dr Smith says.

“It will ensure a long-term and co-ordinated approach to the management of the river and its catchment is developed and agreed to by all stakeholders, so they can continue to work together beyond the two-year funding period.

Mr Flavell says he is pleased to see the collaborative efforts between iwi, local and central government in making the funding possible.

“This funding will help tāngata whenua realise their aspirations of a healthy environment and enable better utilisation of their awa for all our people. The fund will also help local hapū and iwi to safeguard a beautiful resources for generations to come,” Mr Flavell says.

Ms Fox says the Ngā Puna Rau Rangitīkei project also works towards strengthening iwi, hapū and community connections with the river and its catchment.

“I welcome this opportunity for the local hapū and iwi to be able to continue to support the improvement of the Rangitīkei Awa and catchment,” she says. 

“The basis of Te Mana o Te Wai is that healthy waterways support healthy environments, which in turn supports healthy whānau. This kaupapa ultimately ensures better quality water management and the importance of keeping our awa clean.”

The application for funding was made by Ngā Pae o Rangitīkei through the Te Maru o Ruahine Trust. Further funding will come from the Horizons Regional Council ($74,000) and the Rangitīkei District Council ($4000).

Te Mana o Te Wai Fund was announced as part of Budget 2014 in partnership with the Māori Party. It provides $5 million over two years to support iwi and hapū-led initiatives to improve the quality of local freshwater systems.
