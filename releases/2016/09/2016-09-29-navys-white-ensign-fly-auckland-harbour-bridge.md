Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee and Transport Minister Simon Bridges have announced the New Zealand White Ensign will fly on the Auckland Harbour Bridge to mark the founding of the Royal New Zealand Navy.

Starting on Saturday, the flag will be flown annually on 1 October. It will also fly during the International Naval Review from 17 to 22 November this year.

“Flying the Ensign during the International Naval Review will provide a clear and visible symbol of our support for the event, when up to 12 visiting ships will join our Navy in Auckland Harbour,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This year marks the Royal New Zealand Navy’s 75th anniversary. Flying the Ensign on this occasion will recognise the important contribution the Navy makes to New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.

The New Zealand Transport Agency will now make the necessary preparations to fly the White Ensign these occasions.

At present only three flags, alongside the New Zealand flag, are permitted to fly on the Harbour Bridge (the New Zealand flag flies every day, weather permitting). These are:

·         the Tino Rangatiratanga flag on Waitangi Day

·         the Australian flag on ANZAC Day

·         the Merchant Navy flag on Merchant Navy Day.
