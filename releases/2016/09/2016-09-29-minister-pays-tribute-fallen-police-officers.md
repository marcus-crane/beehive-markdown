Police Minister Judith Collins has paid tribute to Police who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

Police Remembrance Day will be held  today at the Royal New Zealand Police College with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Dame Patsy Reddy, Governor-General of New Zealand, and Police Commissioner Mike Bush in attendance.

“Each year, Police staff gather around the country to pay tribute to those officers who have died as a result of criminal acts while on duty, as well as those current and former staff who have died in the last year,” says Ms Collins.

“It will be an honour for Police, and a great tribute to those who have fallen, for Her Excellency to be joining Police in her first official engagement as Governor-General.

“While I am unable to attend the service this year, my thoughts are with the family and friends of those who will be remembered today on what will be an emotional day.

“This year, three former officers have also been added to the Memorial Wall, after their deaths were identified as having occurred as a result of a criminal act through Police’s Recognition Project – Constable James Butler, Constable Louis Hekenui Bidois and Detective Constable Ronald Hill.”

The Recognition Project began three years ago to ensure Police appropriately acknowledged those officers who gave their lives in the course of their work.

Since the project started, 40 officers have been identified who are now officially remembered every year as having died while on duty. This is in addition to the three officers above who have been placed next to the 29 names already on the Memorial Wall as having died as a direct result of a criminal act.

*As part of the ceremony, a wreath laying ceremony will take place. In remembrance of those who have gone before, a wreath will be laid on behalf of the Minister by a member of the Police Executive.*
