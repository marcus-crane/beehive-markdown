The Rangitāne Tū Mai Rā (Wairarapa Tamaki nui-ā-Rua) Claims Settlement Bill passed its first reading today, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson has announced. The Bill has been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.

“Today is a significant milestone for Rangitāne and I acknowledge all those who have worked on this settlement over many years,” Mr Finlayson said.

When enacted, this Bill will give effect to the Deed of Settlement signed on 6 August 2016 between the Crown and Rangitāne o Wairarapa and Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-ā-Rua.

The settlement provides commercial and financial redress of $32.5 million and the opportunity to purchase Crown properties and part of the Ngāumu Crown Forest Licensed land.

A number of sites of cultural significance will be returned to Rangitāne, including the Pukaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre Reserve and Scenic Reserve which will then be gifted back to the Crown and the people of New Zealand.

“This government is committed to resolving historical Treaty claims with willing and able groups,” Mr Finlayson said. “Treaty settlements improve the future prospects of iwi, the regions and New Zealand as a whole.”

Second readings were also held during extended sitting hours today for the Rangitāne o Manawatu Claims Settlement Bill, Te Atiawa Claims Settlements Bill, Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bill and the Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bill.
