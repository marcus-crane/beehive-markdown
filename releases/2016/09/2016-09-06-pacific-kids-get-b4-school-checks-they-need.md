Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga say a new report shows more Pacific children are getting the B4 School Checks and referrals they need.

“The free B4 School Check is vital to ensure that children get the best start at school by identifying and addressing any health or developmental problems at an early stage,” says Dr Coleman.

“Results to Quarter Three 2015/16 show the ‘Ala Mo’ui target has been met again with 90 per cent of Pacific children in the eight Pacific priority DHB regions getting B4 School Checks.

“It’s great to see the progress made in 2014/15 is being maintained. This compares to the 70 per cent of Pacific children that received a B4 School Check in 2013/14.

“We’ve also seen steady progress in the percentage of very overweight Pacific children being referred to GPs or specialist services – an increase of 76 per cent in 2013/14 to currently 96 per cent.

“With the new Raising Healthy Kids health target which came into effect in July, we will be able build on the progress made through ‘Ala Mo’ui to ensure overweight children are offered the referrals to the services that they need.”

“Through ‘Ala Mo’ui and the work being done by the health sector we are seeing more improvements to the health outcomes for Pacific families,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Health practitioners work with families to help them make healthier food choices and encourage a more active lifestyle. That benefits the children, their families and the whole community.

“To ensure the referrals are being acted on and that children and their families are getting follow up support, the new health target will record referral rates and confirm the doctor’s appointment has taken place.”

The Raising Healthy Kids target aims to have 95 per cent of children who are identified as obese in the B4 School Check offered a referral for assessment and family based nutrition activity and lifestyle interventions by December 2017.

Ala Mo’ui: Pathways to Pacific Health and Wellbeing 2014-2018 is the Government’s overarching strategy for improving Pacific health outcomes.
