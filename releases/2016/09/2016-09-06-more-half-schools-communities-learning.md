More than half of New Zealand’s schools are now working together in Communities of Learning, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“An additional 31 Communities of Learning have now been approved, taking the total number of Communities of Learning to 148, and including more than half of the schools throughout the country,” says Ms Parata.

“This is fantastic news – these communities will bring together local schools and early learning services to help boost student achievement.”

More than 1260 schools and 18 early childhood services have now formed Communities of Learning, supporting more than 410,000 kids.

Of the Communities of Learning that have already been established, 26 have had their achievement challenges endorsed and 30 COL leaders have now been appointed. In addition, over 60 Across School and almost 320 Within School teachers have been appointed to new roles within the Communities of Learning.

The 31 additional communities approved are in Tai Tokerau (2), Auckland (11), Waikato (3), Bay of Plenty-Waiariki (1), Taranaki-Whanganui-Manawatu (1), Hawkes Bay-Tairāwhiti (2), Wellington (5), Nelson-Marlborough-West Coast (1), Canterbury (1) and Otago-Southland (4). They cover 240 schools and over 87,000 students including more than 16,500 Māori and 9,500 Pasifika students and two early childhood services.

“I want to acknowledge all the schools and early childhood services that have decided to work together to lift student achievement and I know that many more are looking to join soon,” says Ms Parata.

The communities, resourced through the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative, receive additional resources to enable teachers and principals to share teaching and leadership expertise to raise student achievement.
