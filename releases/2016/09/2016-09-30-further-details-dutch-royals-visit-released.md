Prime Minister John Key today released further details of the visit to New Zealand on 7-9 November by Their Majesties King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands.

“The visit by Their Majesties is a reflection of the strong ties, shared values and interests between our two countries,” Mr Key says.

Their Majesties will be welcomed with a formal ceremony by the Governor-General at Government House in Wellington on Monday 7 November, before laying a wreath at Pukeahu National War Memorial and paying a visit to the Great War Exhibition.

That evening, the Governor-General will host a state dinner in honour of Their Majesties at Government House.

On Tuesday, Their Majesties will travel to Christchurch where they will meet with Ngai Tahu, visit a wildlife sanctuary and inspect the rebuild of Christchurch’s CBD.

Their Majesties will head to Auckland on Wednesday to see the Abel Tasman etchings and the Lindauer collection at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki before visiting a “Future of Food” event, and then meeting with a joint New Zealand and Dutch trade delegation.

During their visit Their Majesties will meet with members of the local Dutch community in Auckland and Christchurch.

“I look forward to welcoming King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima to New Zealand.  I am sure they will have a wonderful time and New Zealanders will make them feel very welcome,” Mr Key says.
