Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for France to attend New Zealand commemorations of the 100th anniversary of this country’s involvement in the Battle of the Somme.

More than 15,000 New Zealanders served in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, says Mr Brownlee.

“More than 2000 soldiers were killed, and thousands more wounded. More than half of the soldiers killed during the battle have no known grave.”

Amongst the commemorative events Mr Brownlee will attend include the Dawn Service, Sunset Ceremony and Wreath-laying ceremony at Longueval, and the New Zealand National Service commemorating the Battle of the Somme at Caterpillar Valley.

“It is an honour to represent New Zealand at these commemorative events as the Government’s senior representative,” he said. 

Mr Brownlee will also meet with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris, as well as President of the French Senate Select Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Armed Forces, Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
