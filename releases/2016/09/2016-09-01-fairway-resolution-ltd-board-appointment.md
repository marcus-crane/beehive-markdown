ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the appointment of Rachel Farrant to the board of Crown company Fairway Resolution Ltd, effective from 1 September 2016.

“Ms Farrant is a Wellington-based chartered accountant and a partner at accounting and business advisory network BDO, where she holds the role of HR Director,” says Ms Kaye.

“She has specific experience in audit and business advisory services, working with a wide range of clients in the retail, professional services, not-for-profit and government sectors.

“Ms Farrant also has strong governance experience, and is currently a Director of Kordia Group Limited and Fulton Hogan Limited, as well as a member of the Wellington Museums Trust.

“With her strong background, she will be a welcome addition to the Fairway board.”

Ms Farrant will replace outgoing Director Tupara Morrison.

“I’d like to acknowledge Mr Morrison, who has served on the Fairway Board since its inception five years ago, and has contributed to sound governance over that time.”
