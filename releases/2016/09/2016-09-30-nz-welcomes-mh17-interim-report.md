Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed his appreciation for the thorough work of the independent investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July 2014, saying it is an important step towards accountability. 

“The downing of the flight cost 298 lives, including a New Zealand citizen and a New Zealand resident. We remain committed to ensuring there is accountability for this tragic incident,” Mr McCully says.

“This report, which is based on a painstaking, impartial and careful investigation, raises some very serious questions.

“The Joint Investigation Team’s release of its preliminary findings is an important step towards accountability. New Zealand continues to urge all countries to fully cooperate with this investigation, as required under Security Council resolution 2166.

“The victims of this tragedy and their families deserve this much.”

The Joint Investigation Team, which comprises investigative authorities from The Netherlands, Ukraine, Malaysia, Australia and Belgium, released its interim report into the MH17 disaster on 28 September in The Hague. 

The report found that the plane was brought down by a surface to air missile brought into Ukraine from Russia and fired from an area under the control of pro-Russian separatists at the time.  An investigation into criminal accountability continues.
