Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today launched the trial of a new approach to social service delivery in the Gisborne and Wairoa regions.

Manaaki Tairawhiti is the second Placed-Based Initiative to be announced, and brings together local social sector leaders into a single governance group to better co-ordinate services for at-risk families.

“Manaaki Tairawhiti gives us a great opportunity to bring together and develop good local leadership, so that we can improve the delivery of social services to families,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This addresses local frustrations around the well-intentioned but confusing and complex patchwork of social services and governance arrangements in the area.

“Increased collaboration will allow providers to better target tailored responses to local needs, improve practice and use a social investment approach to identify and support the most vulnerable and hard to reach families.

“They will also be clear about the specific outcomes that the new model will achieve, and how this will be measured.

“MSD will support Manaaki Tairawhiti to implement this locally-led model, and funding of $376,000 will help provide project management and administrative backing for the project.

“I want to thank the local leaders who have helped develop this plan and who I know are determined to make it work.”
