Minister for Women Louise Upston has welcomed funding for Women’s Refuge to help it continue to support women by giving them somewhere to go when they need emergency accommodation.

Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett announced that Budget 2016 funding, directly targeted at emergency housing, has so far resulted in 30 organisations providing 3032 new and existing emergency places.

That includes $200,000 per year for Women’s Refuge to fund more than 800 existing places around the country each year.

“I am very pleased at this recognition of the fantastic work that Women’s Refuge do for New Zealand women. This country has a poor track record when it comes to family and sexual violence, and Women’s Refuge has been a big part of the effort to keep New Zealand women safe.” Ms Upston says.

“Women’s Refuge has long provided a safe haven for women and children who find themselves needing somewhere to stay urgently. This funding will give Women’s Refuge certainty of funding so that it can continue its core work, helping women when they are vulnerable and unsafe. I am very proud that this Government continues to support this fine work.”
