Prime Minister John Key today announced that Dame Patsy Reddy will be sworn in as Governor-General on Parliament's forecourt at 11.45am on Wednesday 28 September.

“I am delighted to welcome Dame Patsy Reddy to the position of Governor-General,” says Mr Key.  “Dame Patsy will become New Zealand’s 21st Governor-General, and the third woman to hold the position.” 

“Dame Patsy has a strong business background, and has made a significant contribution in both the public and private sector.  She is also an avid supporter of the arts.

“I am sure New Zealanders will be proud to have her as our Governor-General.”

There will be a pōwhiri to welcome Dame Patsy and Sir David Gascoigne to Parliament, before the official party proceeds to the dais on the steps of Parliament for the swearing-in ceremony.

During the ceremony, the Governor-General will take the Royal Salute and inspect the guard, and there will be a 21-gun salute from Pt Jerningham. Mr Key and the Governor-General will then speak before the official party moves inside to the Banquet Hall for a reception. 

The ceremony will feature the band of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the New Zealand Opera Chorus, and the Tri-Service Royal Guard of Honour drawn from the Royal New Zealand Navy, New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force.  The Navy and Air Force will parade their respective Queen’s Colour and the Army will parade The Colonel-in-Chief’s Banner of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment (Duke of York’s Own).
