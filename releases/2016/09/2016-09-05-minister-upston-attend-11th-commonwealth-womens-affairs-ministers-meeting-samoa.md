Minister for Women Hon Louise Upston tomorrow travels to Apia to attend the eleventh Commonwealth Women’s Affairs Ministers’ Meeting (11WAMM). While in Apia, Ms Upston will also meet with Samoan women leaders.

Ms Upston then travels to Australia to attend discussions with leaders on women’s leadership and economic independence.

“New Zealand has a strong tradition of gender equality. This is an important opportunity to share our work across the region and to learn from others,” Ms Upston said.

The theme for 11WAMM is ‘Gender Equality through Sustainable Development in an inclusive Commonwealth’.

The 11WAMM is a valuable forum in which to discuss Commonwealth initiatives on gender equality and the empowerment of women.

Specific topics for discussion in Samoa and Australia will include supporting more women and girls in education and training, utilising women’s skills and growing the economy, encouraging and developing women leaders and ensuring women and girls are free from violence.

Ms Upston will look to gain insights from Australia’s efforts to increase the number of women on private sector boards.

“I am looking forward to representing New Zealand and exchanging ideas on how we can improve the lives of women and girls.”
