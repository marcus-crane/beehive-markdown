Prime Minister John Key has announced he will travel to New York this month during New Zealand’s second term as President of the United Nations Security Council, which starts today and runs until the end of September.

“Chairing the Council will give New Zealand a role in ensuring it addresses key international security issues and we are committed to ensuring it focuses on those that are most pressing,” Mr Key says.

“This month the focus will be on a range of conflicts in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Libya, South Sudan and Syria - the gravest crisis of our time.”

New Zealand’s Presidency coincides with the annual UN Leaders’ Week, when the leaders of all the Council members will be in New York and meet to address these issues directly.

“I will travel to New York to attend the opening of the 71st General Assembly, deliver New Zealand’s statement in the General Debate and chair a Leader-level meetingof the Security Council aimed at focusing international attention on the conflict in Syria.”

While in New York Mr Key will also hold a series of meetings with world leaders including Helen Clark, and deliver a speech to the Council for Foreign Relations.

He will also travel to Houston to attend events promoting New Zealand business and tourism links.

The Prime Minister will depart New Zealand on Saturday 17 September and return on Sunday 25 September.
