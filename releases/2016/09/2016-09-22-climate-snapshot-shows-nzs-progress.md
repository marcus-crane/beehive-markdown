A report released today shows New Zealand is making good progress in tackling climate change and is focused on the next steps, Climate Change Issues Minister Paula Bennett says.

‘New Zealand’s Action on Climate Change’, produced by the Ministry for the Environment, brings together information about the science, global momentum and domestic work to transition to a lower emissions future.

“Climate change is an incredibly important issue, but too many people find it complex or get put off by the politics,” Mrs Bennett says.

“This snapshot of the things we’ve done, are doing, and still need to do will help New Zealanders better understand how we can leave the planet a better place for future generations.

“From the central and local government’s investment and support, through to research, businesses, iwi and households, there is some really impressive work underway that can give New Zealanders confidence we are on a path to grow with fewer emissions.”

Released today to coincide with a United Nations event to encourage early ratification of the Paris climate change agreement, the snapshot will be updated regularly as New Zealand’s work programme progresses.

“I’d encourage all New Zealanders to take a look, think about what they’re already doing to preserve our stunning environment we’re all so proud of, and what else their family and workplace can do to reduce emissions,” Mrs Bennett says.
