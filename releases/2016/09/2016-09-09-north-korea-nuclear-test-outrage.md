Foreign Minister Murray McCully says North Korea’s nuclear test is a dangerous affront to the international community and a serious threat to regional security.

“This latest nuclear test is highly provocative and deeply concerning, especially as it comes on the back of a series of ballistic missile launches by North Korea recently” Mr McCully says.

“This is the fifth nuclear test conducted by North Korea, and it directly defies the UN Security Council which has demanded that North Korea stop nuclear testing.

“New Zealand absolutely rejects the testing of nuclear weapons and is strongly committed to global disarmament and non-proliferation.

“As President of the Security Council we expect to convene a meeting in response to the test shortly,” Mr McCully says.
