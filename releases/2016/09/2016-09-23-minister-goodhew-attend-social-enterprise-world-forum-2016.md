Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew will travel to Hong Kong tonight to attend the Social Enterprise World Forum 2016 and meet with thought leaders in the growing social enterprise sector.

The Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) theme is “New Frontiers New Markets” and will provide a global platform to share, learn and celebrate the successes of social enterprises around the world.

“Social enterprises trade to support their social and environmental mission, and are a tool to build healthy communities and vibrant local economies,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“While in Hong Kong I will address the conference on how we see the role and mission of Government in a social enterprise ecosystem.

“I will also meet with a range of leaders in social enterprise and prominent New Zealand business people who are based in Hong Kong.

“The Hong Kong Government is a strong advocate of social enterprise and has overseen significant growth in the sector which now numbers around 520 organisations, so it is a great opportunity to see how other countries are responding to social enterprise.

“The New Zealand Government has encouraged the growth and development of the social enterprise sector in New Zealand and recognises its potential to support community strength and resilience,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew will return to New Zealand on Wednesday 28 September.
