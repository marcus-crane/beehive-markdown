Overseas partner agencies have stopped illicit drugs with a harm cost of over $204 million from reaching New Zealand in the last financial year says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“Drug smuggling is a global problem and Customs works closely with offshore partners to detect smuggling activity and intervene with drug supply chains early,” Ms Wagner says.

“The offshore seizures were mainly of methamphetamine, at $190 million potential harm.  However, the meth precursor ephedrine, cocaine, date rape drug GBL, and ‘angel dust’ or PCP were also intercepted. Over $204 million of potential social and economic harm to New Zealand was prevented from reaching New Zealand.

“Working with customs and law enforcement agencies around the world to identify drug smuggling activity and trends early to disrupt the supply chain in an intelligent way to protect New Zealand.

“These seizures show international partnerships to disrupt and dismantle overseas syndicates involved in the export of meth and precursors, or any other drugs, are making a difference in tackling the flow of illicit drugs.

“Information gathered from offshore seizures is used to update Customs’ information, so it can better target illicit drug smuggling at the New Zealand border,” Ms Wagner says.

In the 2015/16 financial year, over $875 million in potential harm was avoided by interceptions of illicit drugs at the border.  Combined with over $204 million in potential harm prevented by seizures of drugs destined for New Zealand by offshore partners, over $1 billion in potential social and economic harm has been avoided.
