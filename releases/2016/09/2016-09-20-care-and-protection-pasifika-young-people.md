Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has told a Pacific Leaders Fono that the new Ministry for Vulnerable Children, Oranga Tamariki will respond to the needs of Pacific children and young people in care or at risk of going into care.

Mrs Tolley told the Fono in Porirua that the new operating model will be culturally responsive and will better support Pacific children and young people.

“We know that Pasifika children and young people make up 11 per cent of all care and protection reports of concern, and 13 per cent of all Youth Justice Family Group Conferences, so it’s vital the new Ministry effectively responds to their needs,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Instead of simply responding to a crisis as the current model does, the Ministry for Vulnerable Children, Oranga Tamariki will focus on five core services – prevention, intensive intervention, care support, transition support and a youth justice system focused on reducing offending and reoffending.

“The detailed design of the new operating model includes a dedicated Pacific work programme to ensure the model is culturally competent and responsive, and to build and strengthen relationships with Pacific organisations.

“There is a wealth of expertise and experience in Pacific organisations that could be hugely beneficial if we can incorporate it into the new operating model.

“As part of the transformation programme, officials have been holding workshops across the country and working with specialists, NGOs and other government agencies to ensure the new system meets the needs of all children and young people, including those with Pacific heritage.

“The new Youth Advisory Panel also includes two care experienced Pasifika young people who will provide me, and the team leading the transformation, with valuable insights and advice as we carry out detailed design work.

“The voices of children and young people must be an integral part of new operating model right from the start and we must make sure that the new model reflects and responds to New Zealand’s diverse communities,” Mrs Tolley says.
