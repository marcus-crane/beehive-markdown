Corrections Minister Judith Collins says offenders throughout the country can take satisfaction from the part they’ve played in conserving New Zealand’s natural beauty and helping their community.

This week is Conservation Week (September 10-18) and is a chance to reflect on the good work created by a partnership between Corrections and the Department of Conservation, signed in November last year.  

“The *Good to Grow* collaboration has been an outstanding success for both departments,” says Ms Collins.

“Not only has it seen the maintenance and preservation of some important natural, historic and cultural sites, it has also given offenders purpose. They have the chance to make reparations to the community, and learn new skills, which will equip them for future employment.”

Each year, Corrections has more than 30,000 people on community work, which is completed through providing labour to local projects throughout New Zealand. By collaborating with the Department of Conservation, it has created opportunities to deliver more community work hours on significant conservation projects.

Since April this year 6,580 hours of community work labour has been completed in public conservation areas.

A notable example is the Kakapo chick rearing facility in Invercargill, upgraded by community workers and helping to play a vital role in the species’ recovery.

“To help reduce offending it is crucial that people stay busy and find employment. By increasing their skills through programmes like this, it not only benefits the individual but also the local community where they are involved,” said Ms Collins.

Corrections also delivers ‘Growsafe’ NCEA Level 3 across 11 prison sites and offers the National Certificate in Horticulture at Levels 1 to 4 across 14 prison sites.
