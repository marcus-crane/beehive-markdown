Customs is contributing to large drug seizures overseas through intelligence sharing and collaboration, says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“Customs is part of a global enforcement network focussed on identifying and targeting drug smuggling and syndicates worldwide. Information shared with international partners has resulted in approximately 115kgs of cocaine being seized in Australia in the past year,” Ms Wagner says.

“Last week, Australian authorities boarded a cruise ship on arrival in Sydney from Auckland, resulting in the seizure and arrest of three Canadians on board.

“Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police, New Zealand Customs, US Department of Homeland Security Investigations, and the Canada Border Services Agency were involved in the operation.

“Customs work closely with international partners to help drug detection overseas and these partners provide New Zealand Customs with valuable support that helps to prevent drugs getting across our border.

“Ultimately, by helping to protect other borders, we protect our own border too. Prevention through collaboration is the key to disrupting illicit drugs from entering New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.
