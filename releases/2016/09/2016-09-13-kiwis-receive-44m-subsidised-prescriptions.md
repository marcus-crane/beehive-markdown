Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new data shows Pharmac is delivering more subsidised medicines, benefiting millions of Kiwis.

“Pharmac’s model for increasing New Zealander’s access to subsidised medicines and treatments is world class,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealanders received 44 million subsidised prescription items in 2015/16. That’s one million more subsidised prescriptions than the previous year, and over 10 million more compared to eight years ago.

“3.5 million New Zealanders received a subsidised medicine in the last year - that’s three out of four Kiwis.

“More than 51,000 Kiwis benefited from 21 new and widened access to medicines in 2015/16.

“Over the last eight years, nearly 170 new medicines have been subsidised and access has been widened to 245 medicines. As a result, over 800,000 New Zealanders have benefited.”

Budget 2016 invests an extra $124 million over four years to enable Pharmac to provide increased access to new medicines.

Pharmac’s budget for 2016/17 is a record $850 million. The Government has increased Pharmac’s budget by $200 million since 2008.

This year Pharmac has announced two new funding packages which include widened access to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox) vaccinations, funding for two new hepatitis C medicines, treatment for advanced melanoma, and patches for menopausal women.
