The best way to recognise the significance of the suffragists’ achievement 123 years ago is to engage and participate in the democratic process today, Minister for Women Louise Upston says.

“Women’s right to vote was a massive step towards gender equality and should never be considered lightly.”

On September 19, 1893, New Zealand became the first nation in the world to grant women the right to vote.

“The upcoming local elections are a perfect time to remind women to exercise their democratic right and, in so doing, honour the suffragists who battled long and hard to give us a political voice,” Ms Upston said. 

Local elections are conducted by post. You need to complete and return your papers in the freepost envelope provided no later than noon on 8 October 2016.

Ms Upston said New Zealand could be proud of the fact that there were many indicators that showed we’re making progress towards gender equality. 

More women are working, gaining tertiary qualifications, and studying or working in high growth sectors than ever before.

“We can also be proud of our reputation as a nation that empowers women to lead independent and self-determining lives,” Ms Upston said.

“However, our legacy of gender equality relies on our ability to improve the lives of all New Zealand women, now and into the future.”
