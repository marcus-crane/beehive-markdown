Prime Minister John Key has acknowledged the passing of businessman and philanthropist Sir Graeme Douglas.

“I first met Sir Graeme when I became the candidate for Helensville and came to know him well as a polite, generous and insightful man.

“He was an incredibly successful businessman and generous philanthropist and many New Zealanders benefited from his vision and generosity,” Mr Key says.

In 1988 he was appointed as a Member of The New Zealand Order of Merit, for his services to the New Zealand pharmaceuticals industry and he was appointed as a Knight Companion in 2010 for services to philanthropy and athletics.

“Sir Graeme supported a number of important charities. He provided funding for a research fellow for the Neurological Foundation, and purchased lifesaving equipment and an MRI scanner for the Starship Hospital. Through his generosity and kindness he touched a great many lives. 

“On behalf of New Zealand I thank Sir Graeme for his wide reaching and significant contribution to New Zealand.

“My thoughts are with his wife Ngaire, his children, and his wider family at this time.”
