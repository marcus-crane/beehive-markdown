Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Communications Minister Amy Adams have today officially opened a technology hub to support new and emerging businesses in Westport.

Enterprise Precinct Innovation Campus (EPIC) Westport, a branch of EPIC Christchurch, provides co-working spaces for local companies looking to be innovative and develop local capacity in digital technology.

“Co-working spaces foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing, start-up businesses are typically the generators of new ideas, products and services,” Mr Joyce says.

“EPIC Westport will help the region’s fledgling firms to grow, connecting local entrepreneurs with national and international businesses, business advisors and funders.  This facility is proof that in the new interconnected world we live in, towns as small as Westport can host hi-tech businesses and marry opportunity with a great lifestyle.”

Expanding EPIC Westport has been defined as an opportunity for regional economic development in the Tai Poutini West Coast Regional Growth Study to be released tomorrow.

“A strong creative and ICT sector underpins growth in other sectors in the economy, and leads to innovation and productivity improvements. This is currently a small sector in the region, contributing around $17 million in GDP and just over 300 jobs, but it is growing,” says Ms Adams.

“By establishing EPIC Westport, the region is showing it can attract ICT firms where there is a clear value proposition. Entrepreneurs will be attracted to the West Coast lifestyle, its affordability and natural amenities.”

“Once the Tai Poutini West Coast Growth Study is released, central government will continue working with the region to determine how it might support this, and other opportunities to strengthen and diversify the West Coast economy,” Mr Joyce says.

EPIC Westport has so far attracted five new businesses to the region and generated 12 new jobs this year.

The Tai Poutini West Coast Growth Study is part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme, which aims to increase jobs, income and investment in regional New Zealand. An economic action plan for the West Coast, informed by the study and developed in conjunction with the region, will be released in early 2017.
