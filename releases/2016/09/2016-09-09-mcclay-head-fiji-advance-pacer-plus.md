Trade Minister Todd McClay is traveling to Fiji next week to attend the Fiji-New Zealand, Fiji-Australia Joint Business Council Conference and to progress the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus free trade agreement.

“Good progress was made by the 16 participating countries in Christchurch recently when the negotiating texts were agreed, however the momentum needs to be maintained in order to ensure the benefits of PACER Plus are available to all Pacific Island countries and their citizens,” says Mr McClay.

The landmark trade and development agreement aims to create jobs, raise standards of living and encourage sustainable economic development in the Pacific region.

“I look forward to talking again with my counterpart, Fijian Minister for Industry & Trade and Tourism, Faiyaz Koya, and advancing the fruitful talks we had in Christchurch last month,” says Mr McClay.

While in Fiji Mr McClay will also meet with the Minister for Labour, Semi Koroilavesau on labour mobility and undertake business visits.
