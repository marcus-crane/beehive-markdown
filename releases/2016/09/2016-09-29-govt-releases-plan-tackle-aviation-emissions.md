Transport and Associate Climate Change Issues Minister Simon Bridges has released New Zealand’s plan to address emissions from air travel.

The New Zealand Aviation Emissions Reduction Action Plan has been lodged with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at its annual summit today.

The plan outlines current and planned measures to address aviation emissions and covers four key parties - government, air traffic control, airports and airlines.

“Transport accounts for around 17 percent of New Zealand’s emissions and the Government is doing a number of things to reduce this, including tackling aviation emissions,” Mr Bridges says.

“Our key response to climate change is the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, which was the world’s first major ETS to affect airlines.

“We’re also addressing the environmental impacts of aviation through economy-wide emissions targets, by promoting biofuels and renewable electricity, and with research on passenger and freight trends that helps inform public and private sector planning.

“A wide range of other initiatives, such as voluntary carbon offsetting and the introduction of efficient new aircraft also play valuable roles in addressing aviation emissions.”

New Zealand is also set to join an international agreement addressing emissions from air travel.

“While international aviation is not included in the recent Paris Agreement, the Government has flagged its intention to voluntarily join a global measure under development by the ICAO.

“New Zealand will support the ICAO Global Measure Resolution and participate from Phase I, which commences in 2021, provided other developed countries and the majority of major aviation states also agree to do so.

“These measures show the Government is working with the aviation sector in New Zealand and internationally, addressing the climate change impact of passengers and freight travelling by air,” Mr Bridges says.
