Transport Minister Simon Bridges has launched the Government’s electric vehicles information campaign to mark the start of International Drive Electric Week.

The international event has started and runs until 18 September. 

“International Drive Electric Week will be the biggest ever celebration of electric vehicles in New Zealand, increasing from just a few events in 2015 to more than 50 events around the country this year. Our EV community is hosting the most events outside of the United States,” Mr Bridges says.

During the week, volunteers are supported by business, local government and member organisations to help spread the word and encourage New Zealanders to attend an event, test drive an EV and talk to an EV owner.

“Hearing from EV owners about the fun, smooth and quiet EV driving experience, and the practicalities of things like charging and range, are often what sparks interest in purchasing one,” Mr Bridges says.

To kick off the week, and the information campaign, the Government has launched a website that will connect New Zealanders to everything they need to know about EVs.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) is working with a broad range of stakeholders including businesses, member organisations, local government and EV owners who are supporting the electric vehicles information campaign. 

“Ultimately the information campaign is about encouraging New Zealanders to decide that their next car will be an EV,” Mr Bridges says.

The information campaign is one of the 14 initiatives the Government announced in May to help achieve its goal to double the number of EVs on New Zealand roads each year to reach 64,000 by 2021.

The $1 million per year, five year campaign is aimed at engaging and exciting New Zealanders about electric vehicles and overcoming knowledge barriers. It will include a community and events programme, a website, TV advertising and printed material about charging and buying EVs.

“It’s clear that EVs are the future. They’re cheaper to run than petrol or diesel vehicles, they’re powered by our abundant renewable electricity supply, and they’ll reduce the amount of emissions that come from the country’s vehicle fleet,” Mr Bridges says.
