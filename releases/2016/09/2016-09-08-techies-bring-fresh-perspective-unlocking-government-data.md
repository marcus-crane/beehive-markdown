Four private sector techies have joined Wellington City Council and Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) as part of a new Open Data Fellowship – providing a fresh perspective on how to make open government data even more useful, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

“The Fellowships mark the beginning of a new way of working between government and private enterprise that’ll see more innovation using government data to solve local issues,” says Ms Upston. 

The fellows, who have a range of different skills including software and web design, will help give LINZ and the Council new insights into how their data can benefit New Zealand communities.

“More than 50 people applied, all with great ideas about how they can help government be more responsive using digital technology.

“The Fellowships are being used around the world and are a product of Code for All, an international network that promotes digital innovation with government data to boost public participation in government and find solutions to local issues.   

“This approach has really made a difference in the local communities of the countries who have trialled it and I’m looking forward to seeing similar results here.”
