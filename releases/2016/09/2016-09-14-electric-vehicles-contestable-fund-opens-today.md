Transport and Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today opened the Government’s Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund.

The fund is one of 14 initiatives in the Government’s electric vehicles programme, which has a target of doubling the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on New Zealand roads each year to reach 64,000 by 2021.

Up to $4 million is available in 2016/17 with up to $6 million available in future years.

“It’s fitting to open this fund during International Drive Electric Week.  The momentum is clearly building around EVs in New Zealand and this fund will help kick start some innovative projects that will further accelerate uptake,” Mr Bridges says.

The fund will offer up to 50 per cent funding towards projects that will demonstrate and showcase low emission vehicle technologies in high-profile, visible ways that will help to popularise these technologies, and to fund projects that can be implemented relatively quickly.

“We want to encourage New Zealanders to go electric because the benefits are clear. They’re cheaper to run than petrol or diesel vehicles and, because they’re powered by our abundant renewable electricity supply, they’ll reduce the amount of emissions that come from the country’s vehicle fleet,” Mr Bridges says.

Applicants have one month to submit their proposals to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority with the first funding round closing on 17 October.

Funding decisions are expected to be announced in mid-December.
