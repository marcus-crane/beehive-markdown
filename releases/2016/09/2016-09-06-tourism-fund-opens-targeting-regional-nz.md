Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key today announced the opening of the fifth funding round of the Tourism Growth Partnership.

“Through the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government is making $8 million a year available to boost innovation and productivity, and the lift the value of international tourism,” Mr Key says.

“Half of this funding will now be tagged for projects that grow tourism in the regions and create tourism-related jobs, through the new Regional Stream.

“The remaining $4 million will continue to be invested in innovative projects that enhance productivity, or extend the visitor season.”

The Tourism Growth Partnership has awarded $20.7 million to 28 projects and attracted co-funding of $60.5 million since it was established in 2013.

“Applicants can now also apply for co-investment of up to $25,000 towards a feasibility study enabling them to assess the costs, potential market and risks of their business proposition.

“Tourism is growing exponentially in New Zealand. Visitor arrivals are expected to reach 4.5 million in 2022, up from 3.1 million in 2015. Part of the Government’s tourism strategy is to ensure all parts of New Zealand benefit from this growth which is why half this funding is specifically targeted at the regions,” Mr Key says.
