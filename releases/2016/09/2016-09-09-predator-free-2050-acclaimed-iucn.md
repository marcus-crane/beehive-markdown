New Zealand’s commitment to be predator free by 2050 has received global acclaim at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s World Congress in Hawaii, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

As part of the Congress, the IUCN’s Species Survival Commission launched the Honolulu Challenge, urging nations to do more to combat the threat of invasive species to protect biodiversity and enhance human wellbeing.

“The New Zealand delegation was pleased to lend its support to the Honolulu Challenge. At the launch, SSC chairman Piero Genovesi acknowledged Predator Free 2050 as a world leader in this field,” Ms Barry says.

“One of the challenge targets is to expand the number of commitments to eradication programmes worldwide. Our Predator Free vision is by far the largest such project ever attempted and has drawn a significant amount of interest and praise during the congress, attended by representatives from 120 countries.”

Through Predator Free 2050 the Government has set a target of completely eradicating rats, possums and stoats from New Zealand and making the country safe again for the native species these introduced predators threaten to wipe out.

The Government has committed an additional $28m over 4 years on top of more than $70 million already spent annually on predator control by government, regional councils, OSPRI, businesses, iwi, communities and others.

“Invasive species are a global problem. As a Government we’re backing New Zealanders to be at the forefront of a global solution. We are already seen as world leaders in eradication technology and through Predator Free 2050 that reputation will only become stronger.”
