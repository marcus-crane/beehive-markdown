Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith welcomes the beginning of Money Week 2016 as it kicks off today.

“The theme of Money Week this year is *Show Me The Money*, with the aim of focusing New Zealanders on planning for their futures and achieving financial goals.

“Following its launch in 2012, Money Week has become an important part of the financial capability landscape. It provides an opportunity for people to think about how they manage their money and help to shine a light on the state of personal finances.

“Since the government statement on Building Financial Capability in New Zealand was launched last year, there has been a considerable increase in collaboration between government agencies, private sector and community groups.

“We have seen the delivery of key projects such as the scale up of financial capability programmes tailored to Māori, the redesign of face-to-face budgeting services, and the announcement of a proposed suite of changes as part of a comprehensive review of the Financial Advisers regime.

“The government remains committed to its goal of improving the financial capability of all New Zealanders,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Money Week events run nationwide. Further information about Money Week including where find an event can be found at: [www.moneyweek.org.nz](http://www.moneyweek.org.nz/).
