Finance Minister Bill English and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce have today acknowledged the release of the Productivity Commission’s draft report *New and Emerging Models of Tertiary Education.*

“The report was commissioned to investigate how trends in technology, tuition costs, skill demand, demographics and internationalisation may drive new and changed business models and delivery models in the tertiary sector,” Mr English says. 

“The draft report has some interesting ideas, however I think the Commission has more work to do in its analysis of the evidence base and the conclusions they seek to draw from it,” Mr Joyce says.

“There are some proposals that could help to simplify aspects of the tertiary system and to encourage new and innovative models of delivery. We look forward to seeing those further developed.  I am also interested in developing the discussion on improving the flexibility and effectiveness of EFTS funding.

“However the government has ruled out placing interest back on student loans and I don’t see anything new in this report which would change that view.  We also would be unlikely to consider the introduction of ‘Student education accounts’ which look like it would involve changing one complex system for a new one with its own complexities.

“On the whole, the New Zealand tertiary sector currently performs well, especially when compared with our international peers, so there is a high bar for major changes.

“The Productivity Commission is now taking submissions before the final report will be released next year. Government agencies will be making submissions. Anybody with an interest in tertiary education should also contribute to the discussion,” Mr English says.
