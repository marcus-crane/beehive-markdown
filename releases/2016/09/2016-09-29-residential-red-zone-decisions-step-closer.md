The Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the first step towards deciding the future use of Christchurch’s residential red zones.

Regenerate Christchurch has announced the first Outline for a Regeneration Plan it will develop, which will be for the section of the Otakaro/Avon River corridor from Barbadoes St to Stanmore Rd.

“I’m looking forward to receiving the first of several Outlines for Regeneration Plans put forward by Regenerate Christchurch.

“I’m confident the locally-led regeneration organisations will put forward plans that take a number of considerations into account, including social, environmental, commercial and financial factors,” Mr Brownlee says.

“There will be chances for public input during the development of Regeneration Plans.

“The opportunities presented by the city’s residential red zones are unique and, if embraced, have the potential to create a long-lasting legacy for Christchurch and the wider Canterbury region.”

“The Crown has spent about $1.5 billion buying land in the red zones in order to help people move on with their lives.

“Just over 8000 properties were red zoned following the earthquakes and decisions about the future of this land will be hugely significant.

Regenerate Christchurch is a joint Christchurch City Council and Crown-owned organisation, which will oversee the development of regeneration plans for the Residential Red Zones, Central City and New Brighton.

The organisation also has the mandate to develop plans for other parts of the city, providing there is necessary reason to do so.

“Crown company Otakaro Limited will represent the Crown’s interests in the residential red zones and ensure some opportunities for financial return are considered, alongside other future uses.

“Regenerate Christchurch has previously stated it intends to work with recovery stakeholders and entities to ensure Regeneration Plans are widely supported before being submitted for approval,” Mr Brownlee says.
