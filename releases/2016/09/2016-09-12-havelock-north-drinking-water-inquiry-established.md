Retired Court of Appeal judge, the Honourable Lyn Stevens QC, will chair an independent inquiry into the Havelock North water supply contamination incident, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Justice Stevens will be joined on the panel by NZQA CEO and former Director-General of Health, Dr Karen Poutasi CNZM, and local government and engineering expert, Anthony Wilson.

“The members of the inquiry panel have the extensive legal, public health, local government and water management expertise required to conduct an inquiry of this nature,” said Mr Finlayson.

The Inquiry will commence this week and report back by 31 March 2017. Under the final terms of reference, the Inquiry will focus on:

- how the Havelock North water supply system became contaminated;
- how this was subsequently addressed;
- how local and central government agencies responded to the public health outbreak that occurred as a result of the contamination; and
- how to reduce the risk of outbreaks of this nature recurring.

It will also consider any necessary changes to prevent or minimise similar incidents in the future.

The Inquiry will conduct an initial sitting in the Hawke’s Bay in the coming weeks.
