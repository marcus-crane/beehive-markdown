Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced a new appointment to the board of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

Dale Karauria, currently chair of Careers New Zealand, an organisation whose functions are soon to be transferred to the TEC, will help oversee that transfer in her new role as member of the TEC’s board. 

“Ms Karauria will bring a fresh perspective to the TEC’s work, particularly as the Commission continues to grow its focus on providing quality careers information and data to young people to help them make better study choices that work for them,” Mr Joyce says.

It was also announced that Phil O’Reilly, former chief executive of Business New Zealand and Vanessa Stoddart, who also has wide-ranging business experience, are both being re-appointed to the TEC board. 

The TEC is responsible for funding tertiary education in New Zealand, assisting people to reach their full potential and maximising the contribution of tertiary education to the social and economic well-being of the country.
