Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government has approved the first of three stages of the redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital.  

“The redevelopment is a great opportunity to build modern facilities based on sustainable healthcare services to meet the needs of Dunedin and the wider Southern community,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government has now approved the Strategic Assessment which sets out the case for change and the very clear need to invest in infrastructure at Dunedin Hospital.

“We’re as keen as the people of Southern to build the new hospital as quickly as possible. However, hospital redevelopments take time, and considerable work is needed in the early stages to ensure we get the right configuration of services in the hospital that will deliver sustainable healthcare to the region.

“The Ministry of Health, Southern DHB and Southern Partnership Group overseeing the redevelopment are working to an ambitious timeframe.”

The Strategic Assessment completes the first of three phases of Treasury’s Better Business Case model that large publicly funded capital projects are required to follow. Treasury’s best practice model is designed to deliver smarter investment decisions.

Early work has begun on the second stage, the development of the Indicative Business Case which will set out shortlisted options for the redevelopment by June 2017. The preferred option will be developed into the final Detailed Business Case for approval by mid-2018.

A $300 million cost has been provisionally signalled for the project, however costs will not be known until the size and scale of the redevelopment is decided.
