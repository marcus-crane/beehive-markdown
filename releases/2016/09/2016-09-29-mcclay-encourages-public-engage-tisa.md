Trade Minister Todd McClay is calling for the public and businesses to actively engage in the trade agreements being negotiated by New Zealand, and to play a direct role in the way they are shaped.   

Next week, there is an opportunity to learn more about the negotiations on the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), which will make it easier for New Zealand services exporters to do business in international markets. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) will host the public discussions in Christchurch on 4 October and Dunedin on 5 October. The sessions follow on from similar events held in Wellington and Auckland in June.

“TiSA is an important agreement. The 23 participants account for 70 per cent of global services trade and are the destination for almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s services exports.

“The sessions are open to all New Zealanders who would like to learn more about the agreement. I want to give all members of the public the opportunity to engage directly with negotiators and have their say,” says Mr McClay.

Those interested in attending these meetings should register with MFAT by emailing serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz.  Further details are available on the MFAT WEBSITE

For those who are unable to attend the sessions, questions are welcomed by email. Formal submissions on the TiSA negotiation will continue to be welcomed by email
