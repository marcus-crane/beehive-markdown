Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging young people who smoke to ‘kick butt together’ next month during Stoptober.

“This Stoptober is the third year this successful stop-smoking social movement will be run in New Zealand. This year we are encouraging smokers to ask their loved ones to join them in their challenge to stop smoking. They can kick butt together!” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

“It is proven that people who smoke are 4 times more likely to stop smoking if they have the right support teams. These include friends, family and colleagues.”

“Stoptober is a 30 day programme with tools and a support network in place to help smokers pick a date to stop during the month of October.”   

Stoptober is a campaign focused on reducing smoking among young people and the high risk groups of Māori, Pacific and pregnant women.

“Anyone interested in taking part in Stoptober can sign up on the website www.stoptober.nz. They are supported throughout the month with emails, social media and activities run by local stop-smoking organisations,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
