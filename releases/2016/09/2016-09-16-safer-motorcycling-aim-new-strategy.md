A new strategy aimed at reducing motorcycle crashes and improving rider safety has been welcomed by Acting ACC Minister Nathan Guy.

“ACC sees first-hand the impact of motorcycle crashes, so this is about stepping up work to prevent crashes from happening in the first place,” says Mr Guy.

The strategy is a joint initiative between ACC and the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC). The Council represents the motorcycling community and advises ACC on initiatives that will make motorcycling safer on New Zealand roads.

“There are five areas of focus under the new strategy, which is based on extensive research and input from the Council, who are passionate about motorcycling and motorcyclists’ safety,” says Mr Guy.

The five focus areas are:

- enhancing rider skills, through ACC’s Ride Forever programme of subsidised rider coaching
- addressing driver and rider attitudes and behaviours that contribute to crashes
- encouraging the use of better safety technologies, such as anti-lock brakes
- increasing the uptake of safer personal protective equipment
- working with relevant authorities to make roads and roadsides more motorcycle-friendly.

“I look forward to ACC extending existing work and introducing new injury prevention initiatives as part of the strategy.

“Last year, 53 riders died and over 3,800 made ACC claims for motorcycle-related injuries, so this is an important area of work for ACC.”

The new strategy complements measures targeting motorcycle safety in the Safer Journeys Action Plan 2016 – 2020, which shows a commitment across government to make motorcycling safer.
