Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that communities across New Zealand are now able to take part in the government's innovative new approach to investing in communities.

“The Community-Led Development Programme will help build strong and resilient communities over the long term,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Up to five years of intensive support, underpinned by community-led development principles, and access to holistic flexible funding will be available to the communities selected to partner with the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA).

"The Government wants to partner with communities to achieve their aspirations, build on their strengths, encourage wide community engagement, enhance local leadership and establish sustainable, measurable action plans. These are key principles of the Community-Led Development Programme,” Mrs Goodhew says.

DIA is inviting communities of place, interest or attribute, and hapū and iwi, to indicate interest in participating. Six to ten communities will be identified through a contestable process which opens today, and closes in mid-February 2017.

Funding for the CLDP starts at $1 million in 2016-17, rising to $3.56 million in 2019-20.

More information, including details on how to apply, is available on [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz), or from any of DIA’s regional offices.
