Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee and Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson say appalling behaviour by New Zealand First will unfortunately delay the passing of five Treaty of Waitangi settlement bills this week.

“We are deeply disappointed for iwi members from Taranaki, Manawatu and the Far North,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Thanks to the constructive work and initial unanimous support of the Business Committee, and after much planning, Friday was to be an historic day of Treaty settlements.

“As proposed by Labour Senior Whip Chris Hipkins, Parliament was to sit under Extended Hours into Friday to pass the Ngāruahine, Te Ātiawa, Taranaki Iwi, Rangitāne o Manawatū and Ngatikahu Ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bills.

“However, New Zealand First today pulled its previously pledged support for the Taranaki Iwi and Te Ātiawa bills.

“This overturns a Business Committee agreement that the scheduled bills would pass on a voice vote, with no opposition, which would have allowed all parties to have significant numbers of their caucuses away from Parliament to carry out constituent or other business on Friday.

“New Zealand First was previously very clear it supported these Treaty bills, and was therefore happy for them to be passed on a voice vote.

“By reneging on their previously stated positions these bills will unfortunately need to be read a third time and passed into law at a later date.

“With few sitting weeks remaining this year, it may not be possible to pass all these settlements this year,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Finlayson says New Zealand First has not only let down iwi, but also the regions it so often claims to campaign for.

“Friday was poised to be a significant day for the five iwi whose Treaty settlements were likely to pass into law.

“Over 400 iwi members had made travel and accommodation arrangements to come to Wellington and be at Parliament for this historic occasion.

“Not only does this postpone the final settlement of long standing historical grievances which have been negotiated over many years, but delays tens of millions of dollars of commercial and financial redress from entering the regions.

“This bizarre u-turn delays the benefits settlements bring to iwi, communities, regional New Zealand and the country as a whole.

“Treaty settlements provide iwi with an economic base to build on, contribute to regional development, stronger social services and innovative business investment.

“New Zealand First has let down these iwi and the Taranaki, Manawatu and Far North regions,” Mr Finlayson says.
