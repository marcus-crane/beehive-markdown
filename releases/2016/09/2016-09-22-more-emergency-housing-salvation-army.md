The Salvation Army is to receive more than $1.5 million to fund 884 emergency housing places across the country each year.

Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett announced on Tuesday that Budget 2016 funding, directly targeted at emergency housing, has so far resulted in 30 organisations providing 3032 new and existing emergency places.

“I am delighted that the Salvation Army has certainty of funding for its existing emergency housing and is also creating 84 new places each year in areas where there are few emergency housing options for people in critical need.”

“As I have previously said, helping vulnerable people into accommodation is a community effort and it is organisations such as the Salvation Army who know their communities best,” Mrs Bennett says.

Lieutenant Colonel Lynette Hutson, the Salvation Army’s national director of supportive accommodation, says care for those in acute housing need is core business for the Army.

“This funding will allow us to strengthen our provision of supportive accommodation and provide more places and greater social support for those who are homeless. It’s good to see the Government recognising the need and delivering resources to make a difference.”

The funding will be directed towards increasing capacity at the Salvation Army’s large-scale accommodation centres in Auckland and Christchurch, along with emergency housing provision through its Community Ministries.

It also allows the Army to extend its emergency housing in Napier, Wellington, Marlborough and Invercargill.
