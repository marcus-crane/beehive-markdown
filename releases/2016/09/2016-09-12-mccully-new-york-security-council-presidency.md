Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York this evening to support New Zealand’s Presidency of the United Nations Security Council.

“September is an important month for New Zealand as President of the Council, with meetings over the next two weeks on the Middle East Peace Process, Colombia, Afghanistan, Libya, South Sudan and aviation security,” Mr McCully says.

“In addition to these meetings, New Zealand will be co-hosting an event in support of small island developing states, with a focus on renewable energy.  

“As previously announced the Prime Minister will be travelling to New York for Leader’s Week to deliver New Zealand’s statement to the opening of the 71st General Assembly, and chair a Leader-level meeting of the Security Council aimed at focusing international attention on the conflict in Syria.

“While in New York I will also meet with a number of Ministers and Permanent Representatives to discuss common priorities on the Council and put forward our strong view that Helen Clark is the best candidate in the running to be the next UN Secretary General,” Mr McCully says.
