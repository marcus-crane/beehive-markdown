Primary Industries Ministers Nathan Guy and Jo Goodhew have welcomed $3.1 million in new funding for 13 climate change research projects in the agriculture and forestry sectors.

The grants were announced today by the Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) research programme.

“This funding plays an important part in helping our primary industries prepare for the future challenges of climate change,” says Mr Guy.

“$935,000 is being invested in three projects to analyse soil carbon on hill country farms and under irrigation systems.

“These projects and others like greenhouse gas mitigation research will help build our knowledge around the impacts of climate change on the sector and how we can adapt and mitigate these effects.”

Associate Minister for Primary Industries Jo Goodhew has welcomed a $250,000 grant for a review of climate change research in New Zealand focusing on forests by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute Ltd.

“Forestry is one of New Zealand’s largest and cheapest forms of carbon storage and will play an important role in adapting to climate change. We need to keep building our knowledge in this area if we are to ensure our forests continue to thrive in a changing climate,” says Mrs Goodhew.
