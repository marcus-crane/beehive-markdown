A sod turning ceremony at Western Springs College this morning marked the start of a redevelopment that represents the largest-ever investment in a New Zealand school, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“I was thrilled to be at the College today to be part of the ceremony, which means construction is now officially underway,” says Ms Parata.

The Government will invest around $75 million redeveloping Western Springs College, and around $4 million upgrading TAPAC, the Auckland Performing Arts Centre on the school grounds.

“At least 80 per cent of the existing teaching spaces at the College will be replaced entirely, and other facilities will be upgraded,” says Ms Parata.

“The College is built on a former landfill and quarry, which means there are considerable geotechnical challenges associated with the site.

“However, the site is ideally positioned to serve surrounding communities, so this is an important investment in the local school network.

“Western Springs College is one of our highest-performing schools, and I’m confident that students, parents and staff alike can’t wait to see the new facilities take shape.”

The redevelopment is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
