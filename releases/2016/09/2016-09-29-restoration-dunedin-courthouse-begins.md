South Island company Amalgamated Builders has won the contract to upgrade and refurbish Dunedin’s historic Stuart Street courthouse, Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams announced today.

Work will start in early October and is expected to finish in December 2017.

“Dunedin’s courthouse is not only one of the most notable historic buildings in New Zealand but a centrepiece of the city’s rich cultural heritage. Despite the project’s complexity, the Government has committed a significant investment to restoring this historic courthouse to its former glory,” says Ms Adams.

“We have set aside up to $20 million as part of Budget 2016 to strengthen the building to 60-70 per cent of the New Building Standard and to put in place new technology and audio-visual capabilities, enhance security and CCTV coverage, and make the registry area more customer friendly.

“The decision to restore the courthouse acknowledges its historic importance to the people of Dunedin and its significance to Dunedin’s legal fraternity.

“It’s great to see a local contractor taking on this work, which will generate jobs in the community and benefit the local economy.”

Court services will continue to be delivered from the current locations at 184 High Street and John Wickliffe House until the historic courthouse reopens.

“I’m sure the people of Dunedin, and particularly the local legal community, will continue to passionately support this project as we look forward to services returning to the courthouse in early 2018,” says Ms Adams.
