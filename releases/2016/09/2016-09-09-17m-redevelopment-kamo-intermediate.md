Education Minister Hekia Parata visited Kamo Intermediate School in Whangarei today to announce a new $1.7 million classroom block.

“Kamo Intermediate School has a steadily increasing roll so the new block, made up of four modern learning spaces, will accommodate this growth,” says Ms Parata.

“This school is working hard to raise student achievement and with these additional learning spaces the Kamo Intermediate School community will be able to continue to support Northland’s young people to achieve at school.”

In 2013 the school had a roll of 500 students and by March 2016 that had increased to 670. The extra classrooms will increase its capacity to 700 students.

During construction four modular classrooms will be placed on site to accommodate the growing roll.

The investment in Kamo Intermediate School is part of the Government’s $50 million investment to upgrade schools and add capacity in Northland, on top of the money normally provided to schools to maintain their property. Redevelopments either announced or underway in Northland include:

- $6.9 million for the redevelopment of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Taumarere
- $19 million to provide a new site and buildings for TKKM o Te Tonga o Hokianga and a total of 16 new classrooms at Whangarei Girls High School, Parua Bay School and Bay of Islands International Academy
- $14 million for the redevelopment of Northland College
- $6 million to increase capacity at Hora Hora School.

Construction at Kamo Intermediate School is expected to be completed by June 2017.
