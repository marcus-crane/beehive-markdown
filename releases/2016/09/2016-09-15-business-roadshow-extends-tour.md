Small Business Minister Craig Foss says five more locations are being added to the hugely popular Taking Care of Business roadshow.

“More than 1200 business owners and operators have so far attended a dozen events around the country, from Invercargill to Hamilton,” Mr Foss says.

“Five new events will be held in Porirua, Masterton, Rotorua, Christchurch and Blenheim, in addition to those in Whangarei and Auckland already scheduled to take place in the coming weeks.

“Every stop on the roadshow gets bigger and better, with overwhelmingly positive feedback. 

“This roadshow is all about helping business owners engage with government agencies more effectively and efficiently by taking the experts to the businesses, not the other way around.

“Attendees hear from a wide variety of speakers on issues such as health and safety legislation, tax, ACC and minimum employment standards.  There’s also an opportunity to speak to officials one-on-one and network with others in the local business community.

“The government is committed to helping small businesses grow and thrive.  I look forward to getting back on the road and speaking to as many hard-working business owners as possible.”
