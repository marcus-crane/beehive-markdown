Tourism spending in the regions continued to rise in the year to August 2016 on the back of record visitor numbers, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

According to the Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates released today by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, tourism expenditure grew in most regions over the year to August 2016.

The fastest-growing region was Nelson, which increased 11.7 per cent over the year to $304 million, followed by Otago, up 9.6 per cent to $3.2 billion, and Auckland, up 6.9 per cent to $6.7 billion.

“Tourism spending continues to rise across the country, reflecting the Government’s commitment to supporting tourism growth in the regions,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Applications are open now for the Tourism Growth Partnership’s new regional stream, which will see $4 million in funding for tourism projects in the regions.

“This is a core part of our wider tourism strategy to support the regions to benefit from increasing visitor numbers,” says Mrs Bennett.

Applications to the Tourism Growth Partnership close on 12 October.
