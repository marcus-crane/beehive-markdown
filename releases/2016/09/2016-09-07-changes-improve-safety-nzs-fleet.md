Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says more stringent requirements for water damaged vehicles will provide additional safety assurances for vehicle owners and all road users.

From today, all electronic and pyrotechnic safety components, including airbags, sensors, pre-tensioner seatbelts and wiring, must be fully replaced on imported and domestic water damaged vehicles.  Previously, only those items below the water line were required to be replaced.

“The NZ Transport Agency has investigated cases where the level or extent of flooding has been deliberately masked, exposing the driver, their passengers and other road users to unacceptable risk,” Mr Foss says.

“This new requirement removes any questions about the level of water damage a car, and its important safety components, has suffered. 

“Properly repaired water damaged vehicles are safe. However, more stringent requirements will further increase vehicle and road safety.”

Importers bringing water damaged vehicles into New Zealand have one month to get vehicles border checked under the previous requirements, provided they can show the vehicle was purchased on or before 7 September.
