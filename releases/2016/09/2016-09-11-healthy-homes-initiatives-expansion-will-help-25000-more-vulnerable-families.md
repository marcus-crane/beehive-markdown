Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says thousands more vulnerable families living in unhealthy homes will get the help they need from next month’s expansion of the Healthy Homes Initiatives.

“$18 million is being invested as part of Vote Health in Budget 2016 to expand Healthy Homes Initiatives to reduce preventable illnesses among at risk low income families with newborns to five year olds,” says Dr Coleman.

“Around 25,000 low income vulnerable families who live in unhealthy, damp, cold conditions are expected to benefit from the expanded Healthy Homes Initiatives over the next four years.

“Helping families to live in warm, dry homes will reduce their exposure to preventable illness and contribute to improved health.

“This is important for the whole family, but particularly for children, who are susceptible to illness. If you’re not sick, you’re better placed to make the most of education and employment opportunities too.”

To date, around 3,900 eligible families with children at risk of rheumatic fever in high risk North Island regions have been referred to Healthy Homes Initiatives.

These families have benefited from a range of interventions to improve their home environment and reduce crowding which has helped to minimise the spread of strep throat germs that can cause rheumatic fever.

In December 2013, the first Healthy Homes Initiatives began working with families in Auckland.

This was expanded to seven other high risk DHB areas in March 2015 - Northland, Waikato, Wellington, Lakes, Bay of Plenty, Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti.

As a result, 3,900 families have received over 3,600 interventions - including help with insulation, curtains, beds, bedding, minor repairs, floor coverings, ventilation, heating sources, full and correct entitlement assessments through Work and Income, support with power bills, private or community relocation and social housing relocations.
