Education Minister Hekia Parata will represent New Zealand at the state funeral of former President Shimon Peres in Israel on Friday.

“President Peres carved out a special place in world politics," Ms Parata says. “Our thoughts are with the Peres family and the nation of Israel as they celebrate his remarkable life, and mark his passing.”

“The loss of such an influential and inspirational leader in his 93rd year is a day for respect and reflection, not only for Israelis, but the world.”

Former President Peres won the Nobel Peace Prize alongside then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for their roles in negotiating the Oslo Peace Accords.

The funeral will be held at the Mount Herzel Cemetery in Jerusalem.

Ms Parata was already in Israel for the Global Education Industry Summit.
