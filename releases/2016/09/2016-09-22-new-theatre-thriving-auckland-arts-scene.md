Auckland’s thriving arts scene will be well served by the state-of-the-art new ASB Waterfront Theatre opened today, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“The ASB Waterfront Theatre is an exciting new home for the Auckland Theatre Company, and a superb example of what can be achieved when arts organisations and funders work together,” Ms Barry says.

“It is an outstanding facility where we will celebrate, promote and nurture the arts, and provide a platform for Auckland’s voices to be heard.

“I’d like to recognise the hard work and dedication of Auckland Central MP Nikki Kaye in advocating for this project – without her, it would not have happened.”

Funding for the theatre included a $4.2 million contribution from Creative New Zealand, the Government’s arts funding body, and support from ASB Bank, Foundation North, the Auckland University of Technology and many others.

Located in the Wynyard Quarter, the theatre is expected to create 75 jobs, contributing to continued development of the area and the wider Auckland economy.

“Wynyard is a particularly fitting location – as Auckland’s hub of science and innovation, it shows the other side of the creative coin.”
