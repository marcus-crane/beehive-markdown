Minister of Trade Todd McClay today welcomed the rapidly widening commercial engagement between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates and said the two governments were committed to growing the trade relationship further.

Mr McClay is leading a New Zealand business delegation to Dubai and Sharjah in the UAE and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.

The UAE is the gateway for many New Zealand businesses into the Middle East and North Africa, and our eleventh largest trading partner with two-way goods trade of around $1.3 billion

"Today I met with the Chairman of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and we have agreed to establish a New Zealand-Dubai Business Council by the end of this year.

"This is a significant opportunity for New Zealand companies. The Dubai Chamber of Commerce has more than 170,000 members, and has agreed to give a renewed priority to our relationship," says Mr McClay.

"I have also asked officials to work on two opportunities for New Zealand. The first is a New Zealand trade day to pitch Kiwi business to Dubai Chamber members. The second is for the Dubai Chamber of Commerce to organise a business mission to New Zealand to explore new trade and investment opportunities.”

In Sharjah, areas for cooperation were identified in education, healthcare and environmental planning and protection. Speaking at a New Zealand-Sharjah Chamber of Commerce business event Mr McClay confirmed that New Zealand companies were ready to do business in the third largest Emirate.

Mr McClay also received an update on the Dubai 2020 World Expo from the UAE Minister of Cabinet and Future Affairs, HE Mohammed Al Gergawi and the Minister of Economy, HE Sultan Al Mansouri.

"Dubai 2020 is shaping up to be a world class event promoting business and culture to tens of millions of people,” says Mr McClay.

Ministers confirmed they remained committed to enhance bilateral trade and investment between the UAE and New Zealand.
