Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman and Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner wish New Zealand’s Paralympians the best of luck as the Paralympics get underway this week.

“Our 31 Kiwi Paralympians will carry the support of all New Zealanders over the next 12 days as they strive for gold in Rio,” says Dr Coleman. 

“Our athletes will compete in events across six sports - para-sports, para-athletics, para-cycling, para-sailing, para-canoeing, para-shooting and para-swimming.

“The team is targeting 12 gold medals, double the number achieved at the last Paralympics. London was our most successful Paralympics ever - New Zealand placed first in the world on a per capita basis with 17 medals.”

Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner will be attending the Paralympics in Rio from 6 to 10 September.

“The Paralympics are a chance for us to get behind our athletes and to show the extraordinary things disabled people can accomplish through their hard work and determination,” says Ms Wagner.

“I’m really looking forward to cheering on our Kiwi Paralympians, especially as we expect to achieve our 200th Paralympic medal in Rio. Fans across New Zealand can support the team by watching the action on TVNZ and Attitude Live thanks to an arrangement secured with the support of ACC.”

High Performance Sport NZ has invested $12 million over the four year Paralympic cycle.

The Paralympics are being held from 7 to 18 September in Rio, and feature 528 medal events across 23 sports. Around 4,350 competitors from more than 170 countries are expected to attend.

Paralympics New Zealand is running its annual Spirit of Gold mufti day to coincide with the opening ceremony. Kiwis are encouraged to support our athletes by wearing gold and posting messages on social media using #spiritofgold.
