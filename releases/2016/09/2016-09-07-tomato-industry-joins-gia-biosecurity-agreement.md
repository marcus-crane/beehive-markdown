The tomato industry has become the ninth industry partner to join the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) biosecurity partnership, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.  

“It’s very pleasing to have Tomatoes New Zealand Incorporated on-board, working with the Ministry for Primary Industries and other industry partners,” says Mr Guy.

“It means we can work together on managing and responding to the most important biosecurity risks.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and as the recent *Biosecurity 2025* document points out, it is a shared responsibility requiring everyone’s input and expertise.” 

TomatoesNZ represents the commercial fresh tomato sector which produces fruit worth approximately $100 million annually, including an estimated $8-9 million in exports.  

TomatoesNZ joins Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand, New Zealand Pork, New Zealand Equine Health Association, Onions New Zealand, the Forestry Owners Association, The New Zealand Avocado Growers’ Association, New Zealand Citrus Growers Incorporated and the Ministry for Primary Industries under GIA.
