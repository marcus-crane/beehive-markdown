Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a new $4.5 million roundabout will improve safety and support economic growth in Hamilton.

The roundabout, at the intersection of State Highway 3 (Ohaupo Road) and State Highway 21 (Airport Road) south of Hamilton, is part of the development of the city’s airport business zone.

“The new roundabout will help enable economic growth in Hamilton by improving access to current and future industrial development in the airport area, the Mystery Creek Events Centre and Fieldays,” Mr Bridges says.

“Safety was also a major driver behind this project with the roundabout replacing a T-intersection that has been the scene of 24 crashes in the past five years.”

Mr Bridges says building roundabouts at high speed intersections was a part of the Government’s focus on reducing New Zealand’s road toll.

“Data shows that changing a T-intersection or a crossroad to a roundabout reduces death and serious injury crashes by 90 per cent while the total number of crashes reduces by as much as 80 per cent.’’

Mr Bridges says the roundabout has also been future-proofed so that it can be upgraded in line with future industrial growth.

“Waikato plays an important role in the transportation of goods nationallydue to its central location and key connections to other regions. We’re committed to ensuring the right infrastructure is in place to continue to help drive economic growth in this central region,” Mr Bridges says.
