Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has arrived in Singapore to explore ways to strengthen the bilateral science and innovation relationship between the two countries and meet with high-net worth investors to promote New Zealand as an investment destination.

“There is huge potential to grow the economic links between New Zealand and Singapore,” says Steven Joyce. “Singapore is one of our most valued partners in the Asia-Pacific region. Whether it is in terms of tourism, two-way trade or foreign direct investment, Singapore consistently ranks in our top ten countries.

“Singapore has become a major source of foreign direct investment. Year-on-year foreign direct Investment from Singapore has increased from $4.3 billion in 2014 to $5.6 billion in 2015 – growth of more than 30 per cent.

“These investors are choosing New Zealand because they see opportunity. They see our growing economy, booming tourism, strong migration and a large pipeline of construction projects which will continue to stimulate growth.

“The Government wants to attract more high-value foreign direct investment (FDI) in our most competitive sectors, with a target of facilitating investments with a potential direct economic impact of $5 billion over three years,” says Mr Joyce. “That investment would mean many more high-value jobs for Kiws.”

“FDI creates jobs and businesses and provides funding to get infrastructure projects off the ground. High-quality international investment can also help New Zealand firms to grow by forging international connections, and enhancing access to export markets and complex global supply chains.”

Mr Joyce was earlier in Viet Nam for activities celebrating Air New Zealand’s inaugural direct return flight from New Zealand to Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam’s business capital.
