Police Minister Judith Collins and Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today congratulated the local community, Northland Police and Customs for the record-breaking methamphetamine seizure in Kaitaia yesterday.

“The seizure of 448 kilos of methamphetamine yesterday was the result of locals witnessing suspicious behaviour, reporting it to Police and Police acting on it.

“This was the largest seizure in New Zealand’s history and demonstrates outstanding investigative work by all involved. It will have an impact on the supply of methamphetamine resulting in less crime and fewer victims.

‘What we saw in the far North was the community working in partnership with Police to thwart criminal behaviour. I also pay credit to the excellent Police work in tracking down these criminals.

“Police are deadly serious about cutting the supply of methamphetamine and bringing those who peddle this drug to account,” says Ms Collins.

Customs Minister Nicky Wagner also praised the work of New Zealand Customs in this operation.

“This was yet another example of great work and co-operation between Police and Customs in the fight to destroy methamphetamine supply chains,” Ms Wagner said.

“I hope this seizure stands as an inspiration for those who have information about suspicious activities in our communities to report it to Police, and play a role in making all of our communities safer,” Ms Collins said.
