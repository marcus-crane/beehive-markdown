Finance Minister Bill English says the latest release of the Major Projects Performance Report has been brought forward to more accurately reflect the portfolio’s real-time performance.

The November 2015-February 2016 report is the third of its kind and provides a comprehensive update of the Government’s 43 biggest projects and advises on how well they are delivering on expectations.

The projects, which span 22 agencies, are assessed using a five-point scale ranging from Red through to Amber and then Green.

Previous reports have been released four months after being considered by the Cabinet to allow time for commercial sensitivities to pass, but Mr English says it’s important for the public to see the real-time progress of the $20.8 billion worth of projects.

“The 43 major projects comprise 32 per cent of the Government’s $52.99 billion investment portfolio so it’s important to provide transparency on how the biggest and riskiest tax-payer funded projects are progressing.

“The performance of the major projects portfolio remains strong with 84 per cent rated as Amber or better, and projects rated as Red or Amber/Red in the June report are continuing to improve.

“The Christchurch Central Delivery Programme, for example, has previously been rated as Red and has now improved to Amber/Red. The programme consists of 17 projects and many of those – including the Bus Interchange, Earthquake Memorial and Metro Sports Facility – are tracking as Green.”

Two new projects – the National Bowel Cancer Screening programme and the Our Place in Antarctica programme – entered into monitoring during this period.
