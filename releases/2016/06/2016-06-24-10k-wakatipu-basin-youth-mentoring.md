The Wakatipu Youth Trust (WYT) will receive funding of $10,000 to develop mentoring opportunities for young people in 2016/2017, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This funding will support around 20 young people to access mentoring opportunities,” says Ms Kaye.

WYT was established in April 2011 following the merger of Queenstown Life Trust and Wakatipu District Youth Trust. Throughout the year, WYT access young people via a youth centre, mentoring, events, work in schools and one-on-one interactions.

“The Wakatipu Youth Trust mentoring programme provides a youth-centred approach which enables young people to develop a relationship with a safe, go-to adult,” says Ms Kaye.  

“This helps to foster confidence and resilience, alongside social and vocational skills.

“The Trust believes that helping young people develop strengths, positive attitudes and strong relationships in turn fosters an environment that enables them to contribute positively in their communities.

“Currently, WYT’s mentoring programme operates with referrals it receives from a number of different avenues, with staff members undertaking the mentoring roles.

“This new funding will allow WYT to expand its service provision to include local leaders and professionals, utilising their skills and experience as mentors to benefit young people.

“The WYT funding fits well with the new focus for youth development in New Zealand. This is aimed at increasing the number of youth development opportunities, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as advancing stronger connections between the Government, business and philanthropic sectors to create these opportunities.

“In the last few months under the new Ministry of Youth Development structure I have announced more than 1200 youth development opportunities. We are well on the way to increasing the number of opportunities for youth from 50,000 to 60,000 by next June,” Ms Kaye says.
