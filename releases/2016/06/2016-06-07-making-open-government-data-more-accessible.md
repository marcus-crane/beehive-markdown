Minister for Internal Affairs Hon Peter Dunne and Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga are welcoming new initiatives that make open government data more accessible than ever before.

“It is important we continue to improve online access to government data so anyone can use it to develop new products and share with others. Data has little value if it is not used,” Minister Dunne says.

“An example of our data being reused is a recent Department of Internal Affairs’ collaboration with Figure.NZ to identify data that can be made more accessible to the general public, including data about local councils, New Zealand citizenship, gambling and baby names,” he says.

Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says there is a great deal of value in unlocking open data.

“Presenting open data in ways that the public can quickly access and easily interpret is important. Once they have the information, people will be empowered to discuss future service-levels for their communities.  They will be able to participate more easily in their local authority’s decision-making processes,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Perhaps the greatest opportunities in realising the benefits of making data open and transparent are the resulting programmes, services and policies that benefit all New Zealanders.”

Figure.NZ takes large quantities of raw data and collates, standardises and presents it in easy-to-understand graphical formats.

“The Department of Internal Affairs, Statistics NZ and Land Information New Zealand are at the forefront of this drive by the government for greater transparency with data, and this collaboration is a great example of an agency partnering with a third party to achieve this,” says Minister Dunne.

“In addition, the Department of Internal Affairs is launching a ‘beta’ version of the open data website, data.govt.nz this week, to gather feedback on how to shape the service. The ‘beta’ site will demonstrate how government can make it even easier for anyone to discover, assess, and reuse a growing number of government datasets.

“Making open government data more accessible is but one step that this Government is taking in working towards the aims and objectives of all-around Better Public Services,” says Minister Dunne.

“I am excited for the future of open data and the steps government is taking to make data more accessible to all New Zealanders,” Minister Lotu-Iiga says.

These initiatives coincide with New Zealand’s hosting of The D5 Officials Summit, with government officials convening at Te Papa in Wellington today to identify how to improve government digital services, best practice, collaborate on common projects and share expertise.
