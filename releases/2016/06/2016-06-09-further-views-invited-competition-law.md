Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith calls for further submissions on the misuse of market power as part of the government’s targeted review of competition law.

“In November the government released an issues paper seeking feedback on whether aspects of the current law protecting consumers from anti-competitive behaviour by businesses are working well,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“We received 39 submissions on three areas of the Commerce Act: the misuse of market power, the cease and desist regime and whether the Commerce Commission should have a power to undertake market studies.

“I was pleased with the strong level of interest and the range of views expressed in the submissions. I am now seeking further information from stakeholders and in particular on the misuse of market power provision that is contained in Section 36 of the Commerce Act.

“Section 36 is widely recognised as one of the most complex areas in competition law and I want to ensure that we fully consider all the relevant aspects of the law before we make any decisions on the next steps.

“I encourage all submitters and other interested parties to give us their feedback on the 39 submissions received as well as further information provided to me by the Commerce Commission. The consultation will close on 21 July.

“This section of law protects consumers from anti-competitive behaviour by dominant businesses and prevents them from abusing market power.

“This review forms part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to make the New Zealand economy more competitive and productive while protecting consumers and encouraging innovation,” says Mr Goldsmith.
