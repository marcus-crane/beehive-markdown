Customs Minister Nicky Wagner is encouraging exporters to use Customs’ business outreach programme to help them make the most of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) New Zealand has.

“The programme reaches out to manufacturers and exporters at the grassroots level, mainly small to medium companies, to support and advise them on how to maximise the competitiveness of their goods offshore,” Ms Wagner says.

“Customs found that many New Zealand exporters are not maximising the benefits that are available when exporting to free trade markets. Understanding the rules around FTAs and how to claim tariff preference can often seem too complex.

“Specific areas of focus include helping companies understand how to meet the requirements, particularly around the rules of origin, and discussing any barriers that exporters are facing into New Zealand’s key export markets.

“Customs has made 40 business visits and I’m pleased to hear industry feedback is very positive. Many companies are now in a better position to promote the competitiveness of their goods – maximising on the benefits and minimising the risk of border delays,” Ms Wagner says.

If you are a manufacturer or exporter and would like to meet or speak with the Customs outreach team, call 0800 4 CUSTOMS or email [feedback@customs.govt.nz](mailto:feedback@customs.govt.nz)
