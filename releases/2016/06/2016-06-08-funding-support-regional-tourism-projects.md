Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has today announced the Government is investing in a further three projects to help boost tourism in the regions.

“Tourism is vitally important to our economy, with over 160,000 people employed in the sector,” says Mr Key. “Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government is investing $8 million per year to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities in tourism throughout New Zealand.”

Funding to three tourism projects worth over $4 million was announced last month, with a further three announced today:

- $250,000 to Wildwire Wanaka for the extension of a climbing route equipped with fixed ladders that will soar to the top of a 700m twin waterfall based in Wanaka.
- Just over $320,000 for the establishment of night-time light show, suspended amongst trees in Rotorua’s iconic Redwood Forest.
- $150,000 for Queenstown Resort College to expand its Ambassador Programme to a further 10 regions beyond Queenstown and Wanaka. The Ambassador Programme involves a short course that provides participants with increased knowledge and understanding of their region.

“A total of $60 million has been invested in 25 projects in the tourism industry with $15.3 million in government funding in addition to contributions by applicants totalling $45 million.

“We want to attract more visitors to New Zealand to continue to grow tourism and boost economies in our regions, and projects such as these will help us do that.”
