The next stage of planning for $700 million worth of improvements to the Northern Motorway are now underway, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Preliminary designs and preparations for consenting have begun with construction scheduled to start in 2018.

“The Northern Motorway is one of the Government’s Accelerated Auckland Roading projects and the northern-most link in the Western Ring Route, one of our Roads of National Significance,” Mr Bridges says.

“It will provide a direct motorway to motorway connection between State Highway 1 and 18 and an alternative travel route between Northland and Auckland’s North Shore.”

Mr Bridges says it will also improve public transport and walking and cycling options.

“Once complete it will improve travel choices by extending the Northern Busway from the Constellation Bus Station to Albany Bus Station. The New Zealand Transport Agency is also working with Auckland Transport on plans for an additional bus station.

“New walking and cycle paths similar to those being built on the Northwestern Motorway (SH16) are planned. There will also be several local road improvements, including changes that will relieve pressure on the Upper Harbour Highway.”

Mr Bridges says the project is part of the Government’s strong focus on meeting Auckland’s transport needs.

“Reducing congestion in Auckland is a Government priority. That’s why we’re investing more than $1 billion each year in Auckland’s transport, delivering new and improved roading motorways, strengthening public transport services and accelerating the urban cycling network.”
