The economy continues to perform solidly, with Statistics New Zealand today reporting 0.7 per cent growth for the first three months of 2016, taking annual growth to 2.8 per cent, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“This broad-based growth demonstrates the increasingly diversified nature of the New Zealand economy,” Mr English says.

“Despite the dairy sector continuing to be under pressure, other sectors are performing well and contributing to an overall solid rate of economic growth.”

The construction sector grew 3.9 per cent over the year to March – in line with other indicators suggesting strong residential building activity. Business services and retail trade and accommodation also increased solidly.

Spending by overseas tourists was up 16.8 per cent in the year to March, contributing to stronger exports which were up 5.0 per cent over the year.

New Zealand’s annual growth rate of 2.8 per cent was in the top 10 of the OECD. It compares to 2.0 per cent in the United Kingdom and United States, 3.1 per cent in Australia, 1.1 per cent in Canada and 1.8 per cent across the OECD.

“The outlook remains positive. Treasury’s Budget forecasts see the economy continuing to grow at 2.8 per cent on average through to 2020,” Mr English says.

“The growing economy is delivering benefits for New Zealand families. 200,000 additional jobs have been created in the last three years, with another 170,000 expected by 2020, and the average annual wage is now $11,000 higher than when National came into office.”
