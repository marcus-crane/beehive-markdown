Internal Affairs Minister, Hon Peter Dunne, has congratulated the seven members of the New Zealand Fire Service community who all received the Queen’s Service Medal in the Queen’s 90th Birthday Honours List.

“Their citations reveal decades of service not just to their local fire brigades but also their wider communities. The much deserved recognition by Her Majesty

is a very fitting way to acknowledge their years of dedicated service.”  

“We owe them and the 12,000 volunteer fire service men and women throughout New Zealand, a huge debt of gratitude for their dedication and the work they do in our communities”, said Mr Dunne.
