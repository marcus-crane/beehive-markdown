A total of $384,149 will be invested in 20 projects to improve safety and development at racecourses, Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

The funding comes from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety and development across two funding rounds.

“This year’s second funding round has supported a wide range of projects including track redevelopment, new safety fencing, lift installation and greyhound running rails,” says Mr Guy.

“The fund plays an important role in supporting the safety of the racing industry for animals, staff and the wider public. In many parts of the country these facilities are widely used by the community, and not just on race days.”

The next funding round is for the 2016/17 racing year and opens for applications on 17 August 2016 and closes on 30 September 2016.
