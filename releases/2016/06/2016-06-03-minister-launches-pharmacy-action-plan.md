Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today launched the Pharmacy Action Plan at the All Seasons Pharmacy in Auckland.

“Pharmacists make a significant contribution and many New Zealanders benefit from the advice and care of their pharmacist,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new Pharmacy Action Plan will help to make better use of the knowledge and skills of our pharmacy workforce, and ensure they are better utilised as part of a more integrated health system.

“We have a young, highly qualified, growing workforce of 3,500 practising pharmacists. There is good evidence that making better use of pharmacists’ skills will improve health outcomes for patients and make medicines safer.”

The Pharmacy Action Plan, which is aligned to the New Zealand Health Strategy, has four key focus areas - population and personal health, medicines management services, minor ailments and referral to other health professionals, and dispensing and supply services.

The Plan sets out actions to develop cohesive leadership, provide information systems and technology for pharmacists to seamlessly work with other health professionals, to fully utilise and further develop pharmacists’ skills, and ensure regulations enable safe and effective services.

“Pharmacists have the ability to provide more care to people closer to home,” says Dr Coleman. 

“Pharmacists can have a greater role in helping people to manage their wellbeing and improve their health literacy. They could do more to help screen for and reduce diabetes and obesity, as well as medicine management services and treatment of minor ailments and illnesses.

“There are a number of initiatives underway throughout the country which utilise pharmacists’ skills and ensure people use medicines effectively.

“For example, Bay of Plenty has a mobile service where pharmacists visit people in their own home, following referral by a GP, nurse or pharmacist.

“In MidCentral, a pilot scheme has pharmacists working with general practice teams to identify at-risk asthma patients who are then provided education, assessment, and management plans.”
