A number of government polices come into effect tomorrow that will help support families including our most vulnerable, Prime Minister John Key says.

“We’re committed to making changes that improve people’s lives,” says Mr Key.

“A strong economy allows us to invest more in priority public services such as increased access to medicines and vital social services, ensuring all New Zealanders benefit from our country’s success.”

From tomorrow, thousands of New Zealanders will benefit from the extra $124 million over four years invested into Pharmac in Budget 2016.

“New Zealanders suffering from advanced melanoma will have access to the lifesaving drug Opdivo, while thousands of people living with Hepatitis C will have access to two new drugs which have a 90 per cent cure rate,” Mr Key says.

The average ACC motor vehicle levy will also reduce again from around $195 in 2015/16 to around $130. This is a $200 reduction since 2014/15.  

Other changes taking effect tomorrow include:

- The Raising Healthy Kids target gets underway which aims to get 95 per cent of children who are identified as obese in the B4 School Check referred to an appropriate health professional by 2017.
- The maximum weekly rate of Paid Parental Leave for eligible employees and self-employed parents will increase from $516.85 to $527.72 gross per week. Earlier this year the length of payments was increased from 16 to 18 weeks.
- Smoke alarms must be installed in all rental homes, and landlords have three years to insulate their properties.
- Income limits for second chance home buyers are being removed so more people can access their KiwiSaver to buy a home.
- Non-recoverable special needs grants for emergency housing will become available.
- Better support for vulnerable children, including young people leaving care and caregivers, as well as increased safety checking requirements.

“Because of the National-led Government’s careful handling of its finances, we now have choices and options that we didn’t have eight years ago,” Mr Key says.
