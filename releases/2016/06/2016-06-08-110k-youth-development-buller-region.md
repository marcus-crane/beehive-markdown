The Buller Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) will receive funding of $110,000 in 2016/17 to support local young people to achieve the Duke of Edinburgh’s Hillary Award, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This funding will support a minimum of 100 local young people in the Buller region, from Karamea to Westport, Reefton and Punakaiki, to achieve their award,” says Ms Kaye.

“The Hillary Award is about young people setting personally challenging targets and then striving to reach those targets.

“Individuals are encouraged to pursue a breadth of activities that reflect their own interests, and which may include physical activity, mental challenge, individual perseverance, teamwork and interaction with other people.

“The award encourages young people to show imagination and look beyond barriers, and to set goals, not limits.

“Buller REAP, a not-for-profit organisation established in 1981, is well positioned to deliver the award and add to its current suite of education and social services programmes.

“The organisation’s vision is to promote learning journeys for the whanau of Kawatiri/Buller, and it’s well regarded in the communities it serves for building young people’s capability and resilience to become achieving and participating adults.

“As part of the funding announced today, there will be a focus on ensuring that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are encouraged and supported to pursue the Hillary Award.

“Positive opportunities such as this can have a tremendous impact on the lives of young people, and it’s important that everyone has access to these opportunities.

“The funding for Buller REAP is consistent with the new direction for youth development in New Zealand, which is aimed at increasing the number of youth development opportunities, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and developing greater cohesion between the Government and business and philanthropic sectors to create these opportunities.

“As a result of this new direction, I expect the number of opportunities to increase from around 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.”
