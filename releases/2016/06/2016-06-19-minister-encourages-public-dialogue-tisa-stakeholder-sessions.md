Trade Minister Todd McClay is encouraging members of the business community and civil society representatives to have their say on the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and says there will be plenty of time available for a frank conversation. 

Mr McClay says there is still time to register for public sessions on the negotiations, which he announced at the beginning of June.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) will host the public discussion in Wellington on 22 June and Auckland on 28 June.

“TiSA is an important agreement. The 23 participants account for 70 per cent of global services trade and are the destination for almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s services exports.

“The government is committed to open lines of communication on trade negotiations and I'm determined to give members of the public the opportunity to engage directly with us and have their say.

“It’s important to be there so that you tell us what you think. Negotiators are interested to hear from all stakeholders, including business that are encountering non-tariff barriers in TiSA markets.”

MFAT has already reached out to a range of business leaders, sector groups, unions and other stakeholders which have expressed an interest in the negotiations, but the sessions are open to all New Zealanders who would like to learn more about the agreement.

Mr McClay says there will be plenty of time for people to have their say.  

"These meetings are organised to encourage discussion and debate. I have asked that there be ample time available for broad engagement and dialogue."  

MFAT has extended the registration date to 21 June for Wellington and 27 June for Auckland. Anyone interested in attending these meetings should register with MFAT by emailing [serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz](mailto:serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz).  Further details are available on the Ministry’s website: [www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa).

For those who are unable to attend the sessions, questions are welcomed by email. The New Zealand negotiating team will answer a selection of these at the sessions.

Material, including presentations and other additional background on the negotiation, will be published on the Ministry’s website. Formal submissions on the TiSA negotiation continue to be welcomed by email.
