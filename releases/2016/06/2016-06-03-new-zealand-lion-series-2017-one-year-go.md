Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says rugby fans have plenty to look forward to a year out from the New Zealand Lions Series 2017.

“The NZ Lions Series is an iconic event, attracting over 20,000 international visitors as well as passionate support from Kiwi fans,” says Dr Coleman.

“The economic benefits to New Zealand when the British & Irish Lions toured here in 2005 were considerable. Ticket sales totalled 355,000 and there were over 431,000 international visitor bed nights. There was also an estimated local television audience of over 3.5 million for the three tests.

“Preparations are well underway for next year’s series which will be the 12th Lions tour to New Zealand. It’s shaping up to be the biggest sporting event since we hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2011.

“On the back of last year’s successful ICC Cricket World Cup and FIFA Under 20 World Cup, the Lions Series is another great opportunity for New Zealand to show that we’re an excellent host of major international sporting events.”

The 10 match series, which starts on 3 June 2017, will see the Lions play the five Super Rugby sides, the NZ Provincial Barbarians, the Māori All Blacks and three tests against the All Blacks. Matches will be played in Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“The Government will be supporting New Zealand Rugby to ensure we’re well prepared and well positioned for this event. Host regions can look forward to showcasing their local attractions to visitors as well as the economic boost the matches will provide,” says Dr Coleman.

The one year to go milestone is being celebrated at a New Zealand Rugby hosted function at Eden Park in Auckland today.

The British & Irish Lions is a rugby union team selected from players eligible for any of the national sides of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
