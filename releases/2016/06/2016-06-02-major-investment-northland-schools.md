A $19 million investment under Budget 2016 will provide Northland schools with 16 new classrooms and a new site and buildings for Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Tonga o Hokianga, say Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

Minister Kaye made the announcement at Whangarei Girls’ High School this afternoon.

“The Government is committed to investing in the potential of Northland’s young people and this investment will provide safe and innovative environments for students to learn and thrive in,” says Ms Parata.

Around $12 million will go towards the new wharekura, and around $7 million towards the sixteen additional classrooms which will comprise:

- 10 new classrooms at Whangarei Girls' High School
- four new classrooms at Parua Bay School
- two new classrooms at Bay of Islands International Academy.

“This comes after last year’s announcement of a $14 million redevelopment of Northland College, and around $6 million to increase capacity at Hora Hora School,” says Ms Parata.

In total, over $50 million has been committed to upgrade schools and add capacity in Northland between 2008 and 2015, on top of the money normally provided to schools to maintain their property.

Ms Kaye will visit Northland College later today, where she will turn the soil to mark the start of the college’s redevelopment.

“The students at the college have been learning in challenging conditions as a result of leaky buildings, and it’s great to see work getting underway on what will be a fantastic new asset for the local community,” says Ms Kaye.

The new wharekura for Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Tonga o Hokianga, which is currently near Whirinaki in Northland, will be located at nearby Koutu Point.

“As well as room for up to 150 students to learn in a Māori medium school, the new wharekura will also provide a community hub which can support the surrounding area,” says Ms Kaye.

“This is a multifaceted facility which will have wider social as well as educational benefits.

“The combination of the investment in new classrooms and a new wharekura, along with the redevelopment of Northland College, provide a major boost for Northland’s school communities, and show the Government is committed to the region’s young people.”
