Prime Minister John Key has acknowledged the passing of Maori leader Sir Graham Latimer.

Sir Graham was President of the New Zealand Maori Council during the 1980s and was influential in shaping the modern state of the Crown-Maori relationship.

During his time at the Council, Sir Graham helped elevate the status of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand Case Law, which has since had a significant impact for Maori in New Zealand.

Sir Graham was also a long-time supporter and adviser to the National Party and served as the Party’s Maori Vice-President for over a decade.

"Today we mourn the passing of a great New Zealander,” says Mr Key. “Sir Graham made a real contribution through advocating for Maori rights and interests and worked hard to see progress for his people and all New Zealanders.

“Sir Graham's influence has been profound and we see his legacy today in such institutions as Maori Television, Te Ohu Kaimoana and Crown Forest Rental Trust and the Waitangi Tribunal.”

“I am saddened to learn of Sir Graham’s passing. My thoughts are with his iwi, hapu and whanau at this time.”
