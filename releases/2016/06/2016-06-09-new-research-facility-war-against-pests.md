A facility to research new methods of pest control opened at Lincoln University today will make a major contribution to the ongoing war against introduced predators, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

The facility, built by the DOC-backed initiative Zero Invasive Predators as part of an ongoing collaboration with Lincoln University, is an opportunity to research new ways to control possums, rats and stoats.

“Introduced predators are the single biggest threat to our native wildlife. They kill birds and chicks, eat eggs, strip forests and spread diseases such as TB,” Ms Barry says.

“They are a serious drain on the economy, and cost the primary sector an estimated $3.3 billion a year, so it’s in all of our interests to work collaboratively together and develop new ways to tackle this complex problem.”

Founded in 2015, ZIP has received $20 million in backing from DOC, the NEXT and Morgan Foundations and Jasmine Social Investments, among other funders.

It aims to develop tools and techniques to completely eradicate rats, stoats, and possums from large areas of mainland New Zealand in order to protect native biodiversity.

The first trials will test the attractiveness of different kinds of lures, the ability of deterrents such as lights and sounds to keep away predators and the lowest possible fence height to effectively exclude them.

“ZIP and its research and innovation will be crucial in the coming years as we continue to scale up our efforts to rid New Zealand of the scourge of the introduced predators that threaten the existence of our native wildlife and plants.”
