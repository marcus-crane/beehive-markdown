Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is urging drivers to buckle up, motorcyclists to wear a helmet and all road users to take extra care in wintry conditions this Queen’s Birthday weekend.

“The road toll is far too high. It’s so easy to help keep yourself and your family safe on the roads and yet some people still refuse to buckle up — it defies logic,” Mr Foss says.

A Ministry of Transport safety belt survey released this week shows the overall rate for wearing a seatbelt is 96.5 per cent, a slight drop from 97.1 per cent in 2014.

“A 2014 study also shows that 30 per cent of fatalities could have been avoided if the person had been wearing a safety belt or helmet — that’s about 72 needless, avoidable deaths,” Mr Foss says. 

“Wintry weather can make driving more hazardous, so I urge all motorists to buckle up, slow down, and don’t drive impaired or fatigued. These simple actions can, quite literally, be lifesaving.

“We want a Queen’s Birthday weekend where all New Zealanders get to where they’re going safely.”

The results of the safety belt survey are available on the Ministry of Transport’s website: [http://www.transport.govt.nz/safetybeltwearing](http://www.transport.govt.nz/safetybeltwearing)
