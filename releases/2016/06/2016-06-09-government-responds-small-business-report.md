Small Business Minister Craig Foss today released the Government response to the latest Small Business Development Group report. The response outlines how the Government is creating an environment that makes it easier for small businesses to succeed.

“I welcome the report from the Small Business Development Group and thank the members for their work and expert advice,” Mr Foss says.

The 2015 Small Business Development Group report recommends:

- Improving how government communicates with business owners
- Helping businesses better understand changes in legislation
- Simplifying the tax system for small businesses
- Ensuring small businesses have the infrastructure and tools to keep pace with technology.

“The Government has a range of initiatives underway that align with these recommendations. For example, changes being made to the tax system as part of Budget 2016 will remove a significant source of stress for small enterprises,” Mr Foss says.

“This Government continuously works to improve the economic and regulatory environment so that small businesses can grow and thrive.” 

The Small Business Development Group is a ministerial-appointed panel of small business owners who advise government about how policies affect small business.
