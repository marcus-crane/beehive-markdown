Small Business Minister Craig Foss is today launching a small business roadshow series to help business owners engage with government agencies more effectively and efficiently.

*Taking Care of Business: Government Supporting Your Business* is a series of 16 events to be held around the country from June to October this year.

“Whether it’s compliance, tax, surveys or trade and innovation, businesses spend a significant amount of time working with government agencies. Our aim is to make that interaction easier and more efficient so business owners can focus on the business of being in business,” Mr Foss says.

“*Taking Care of Business* will cover recent changes to health and safety legislation, tax, ACC and minimum employment standards, and experts from 14 agencies will be on hand to answer questions.

“Business owners will also be shown useful tools available through the Business.govt.nz website, including the Employment Agreement Builder, the Digital Journey and the Business Toolbox for market research.

“Dealing with government can be difficult and time consuming, so these events are about taking information and advice directly to the people who need it, whether they’re plumbers, farmers, contractors, retailers, exporters, importers or self-employed.

“I’m looking forward to attending as many of these events as possible and meeting more small business owners face-to-face.”
