Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says latest results from the Kiwis Count survey show New Zealanders continue to experience high levels of patient satisfaction with the health sector.

“Kiwis Count is an independent assessment of how thousands of New Zealanders rate their experiences with public services,” says Dr Coleman.

“The quarterly results from March 2016 show that hospital outpatient satisfaction has moved from a 72 point rating in 2012, to 75 in March 2016, while public hospital stays remain steady on 74 points. 

“Users of the 0800 health information line gave it an 81 point satisfaction in March 2016, a big increase from 70 in 2012.

“This data shows that a positive one-on-one experience makes a real difference to how people feel about their healthcare, whether it's in hospital, as an outpatient, or increasingly in telehealth.”

The Kiwis Count survey measures New Zealanders’ satisfaction with 42 government services in the past 12 months.

“The new Health Strategy highlights the move towards a more patient-centred, innovative and integrated approach,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Kiwis Count results show our dedicated health workforce continues to make a big difference to patients and their families.”

Around 500 people take part every quarter in the Kiwis Count survey, and more than 2,000 people take part in the survey every year. For more information go to: www.ssc.govt.nz/kiwis-count
