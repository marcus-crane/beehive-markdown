World Hydrography Day, an annual celebration of the science of mapping the sea and oceans, is timely as Land Information New Zealand begins work for improving its critical navigation information, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

“The theme of this year’s World Hydrography Day 2016 is Hydrography’s contribution to well-managed seas and waterways. LINZ already produces charts and critical safety information, but is taking steps to increase its contribution to the safe and efficient use of our waters,” says Ms Upston.

“It will be taking a partnership approach where possible, working with other organisations that need information about our waters to save time and cost. This is best seen in the work about to get underway to map the seabed of the Marlborough Sounds.

“This work will gather important data for navigation so LINZ can update its charts to meet the needs of larger ships and the cruise industry. It also will help the council to manage the area’s marine habitats which are crucial for biodiversity.”

Another important step is in its world leading risk assessment approach to prioritising charts and navigation information for areas where the risks are highest. This year LINZ will complete a nationwide assessment, combining information on vessel traffic, natural hazards and cultural sites to identify the areas where chart updates are most needed.

“LINZ is leading the world with this approach, and it’s also using its expertise to help others. It’s working with Tokelau, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Samoa and Niue to help provide more accurate charts and navigation information.

“There are better maps of the Moon, Mars and Venus than a lot of the world’s maritime areas. The South Pacific is one area in particular where charts are desperately needed. LINZ’s work is part of a five year project to improve this, and also involves MFaT and the Secretariat for the Pacific.”
