The licensing of a record 30,000th building practitioner is a positive sign of a nationwide construction boom and the increased emphasis on skilled tradespeople, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“The construction industry is at an all-time high, with $18 billion of work under way in the past year. The quality of this work depends on skilled tradespeople, such as builders. It is a sign of confidence in the industry and in the registration system that we are today celebrating the 30,000th licence being issued to Peter Watson.”

Mr Watson was working on a sheep and cattle farm when he decided he wanted to contribute to the Christchurch rebuild following the earthquakes, and began a carpentry apprenticeship. He is now a fully qualified builder working for local company H&R Garlick Builders, and Dr Smith today presented him with a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) certificate.

The LBP scheme came into effect in 2007. It took four years for the first 10,000 licenses but the growth in numbers has been much stronger since it became compulsory for residential building work in 2012. The growth is expected to continue with the $14.4 million apprenticeship training boost in Budget 2016, which will provide 5500 extra places by 2020.

“New Zealand lost its way a generation ago by under-investing in trades and not recognising the importance of skilled people in the construction industry. Today’s milestone shows we are well on the road to rebuilding the trades and skills needed for more homes, commercial buildings and infrastructure.

“The challenge New Zealand faces is getting thousands more good-quality homes built. The best way this can be achieved is by having thousands more well-trained and qualified builders such as Mr Watson,” Dr Smith says.
