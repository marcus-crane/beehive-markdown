Education Minister Hekia Parata has paid tribute to a generous bequest and a special partnership between Shirley School, Ngāi Tahu, Massey University and the Ministry of Education.

Ms Parata says the partnership is behind the implementation of ­Hangaia Te Urupounamu Pāngarau Mō Tātou­, a new culturally responsive maths programme for Shirley School.

“The teaching approach, which is based on the ‘Bobbie Maths’ programme devised by Professor Roberta (Bobbie) Hunter of Massey University, is culturally responsive and supports students to work together to solve maths problems, accelerating achievement for the students involved.

“A similar approach implemented in three decile 1 schools last year in Porirua East is already showing positive results in mathematics achievement, a reduction in bullying and an improvement in learner well-being and identity,” Ms Parata says. “And while it is early days for Hangaia Te Urupounamu Pāngarau Mō Tātou, I am expecting similar outcomes for students at Shirley School.”

Ms Parata today attended a celebration of Hangaia Te Urupounamu Pāngarau Mō Tātou at Te Whare o Te Waipounamu in Christchurch.

She says the implementation of this programme at Shirley School has been made possible by a generous donation by Ngāi Tahu Kaumatua Laurie Loper. 

“Mr Loper advanced $182,000 of the James Stewart Loper Bequest and I thank Ngāi Tahu for their generosity and support of the children who will benefit from this programme.”
