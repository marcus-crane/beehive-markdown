Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says more than $1.9 million has been paid to support 1725 children and young people in care through the Extraordinary Care Fund.

The fund, which was set up as part of the Children’s Action Plan, provides financial assistance when children and young people in care are experiencing difficulties that are impacting on their development, or when they are showing promise in a chosen field.

“Five funding rounds have been held since the Extraordinary Care Fund was established in 2014 with more than 70 per cent of successful applications supporting children who face challenges,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Grants could cover additional tutoring costs, or courses to improve their ability to learn, as well as orthodontic work or counselling not covered by other agencies.

“Those showing promise were funded to attend national and regional sports tournaments or received grants for private music or dance lessons where they were assessed as progressing above their peers.”

Children can receive one grant per financial year up to $2,000. Applications are assessed by a panel comprising of representatives from Fostering Kids NZ, Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, X Factor Education and MSD staff.

“These grants can make a significant difference for children and young people growing up in care. They deserve every opportunity to heal, grow and succeed and this is one way we can support them and their caregiver families to do that,” Mrs Tolley says.

Applications for the next funding round are open until 24 June 2016. More information can be found at [http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/extraordinary-care-fund.html](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/extraordinary-care-fund.html).
