Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated all Pacific businesses, entrepreneurs and stakeholders taking part in the Pasefika Expo in Auckland this weekend.

“The Ministry for Pacific Peoples has delivered an exciting programme to launch this new initiative for Pacific businesses. A Dragon’s Den event at the Expo has attracted interest, with prizes of cash and business support worth over $9,000,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

More than 40 stalls promoting everything from Pacific financial, business support and real estate services to Pacific produce, fashion, healthcare and trades will be on display at the Expo.

“It is particularly rewarding to see two successful Young Enterprise Scheme participants now running start-up businesses, *Marcific* and *Matai Nonu* will have stalls showcasing their ideas”, says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

A Business Networking Event tonight precedes the inaugural Pasefika Business Expo.

“The Pasefika Business networking evening provides an opportunity for Pacific peoples to connect and grow their business ideas. It is important for Pacific people to support Pacific business initiatives,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Government is focused on creating an environment for businesses to start and thrive. I am pleased to see that people will be making connections and creating opportunities that will help unlock the business potential within Pacific people.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
