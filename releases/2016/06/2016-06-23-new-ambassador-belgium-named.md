Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Greg Andrews as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Belgium. He will also be accredited to Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Romania.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Belgium is important, as a large proportion of New Zealand's exports to the European Union enter through the Belgian ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge,” says Mr McCully.  

“We also have strong historical links with Belgium through the First World War battles of Messines and Passchendaele, which will be commemorated in 2017.

“Building closer relations with all four countries will also be important as we move towards and then commence Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the EU.”

Mr Andrews has previously been posted to Moscow and London. He will take up his position later this year.
