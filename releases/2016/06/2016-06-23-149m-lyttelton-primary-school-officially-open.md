The new $14.9 million Lyttelton Primary School was officially opened by Education Minister Hekia Parata today.

The school, which opened its doors at the beginning of this term, is the result of the merging of Lyttelton Main and Lyttelton West schools. It is built on Lyttelton Main School’s former site and will accommodate up to 300 students.

“Lyttelton Primary School’s new teaching spaces will support a wider range of effective teaching practices and a lift in achievement for kids,” says Ms Parata.

“Today is a celebration of everyone’s hard work and commitment to this modern new school, which is a welcome addition to the Christchurch schooling network.”

The school is sharing their brand new theatre with the Loons Theatre Trust in a unique partnership arrangement.

The internationally-known theatre company was left without a home following the Canterbury earthquakes.

The Trust contributed additional funds to the school’s new performance space to bring it to the level of a professional theatre, and they are continuing to provide performance education at the school.

“This is a great outcome for the community. The students have access to a professional-level performance space, and the Loons are able to continue their artistic contribution to the community,” Ms Parata says.

The 10-year Christchurch Schools Rebuild programme is in its third year and Lyttelton Primary is the seventh new school to be completed.
