A strengthened code of conduct for engineers requiring serious deficiencies in buildings or structures to be notified to regulatory authorities was tabled in Parliament today by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith.

“Engineers have an obligation to public health and safety which goes beyond their client. This strengthened code of conduct requires engineers who know of a potential ‘adverse consequence’ that is not being appropriately dealt with to notify regulators. This is a significant change recommended by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Canterbury Earthquakes,” Dr Smith says.

“The tragedy of the CTV building, which claimed the lives of 115 people when it collapsed, is that engineers had identified flaws in its design. This was many years earlier during a pre-purchase check but this information was not passed on to regulatory authorities. The code will make plain that this obligation overrides any commercial contract or confidentiality agreement with a client. This change is an important step in improving New Zealand’s engineering systems and safety in managing complex risks, such as earthquakes.

“I also welcome the requirement for engineers to take action if they suspect another engineer has violated this code. An explicit obligation for engineers to keep their knowledge and skills current is another positive change.

“This strengthened code, developed by the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand, is an important step in ensuring we learn every possible lesson from the tragic loss of life in the Christchurch earthquakes. It follows changes to the Building Act for earthquake-prone older buildings and to the Resource Management Act for managing natural hazards.”

The changes come into effect this week, on 1 July.
