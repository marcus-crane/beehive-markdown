Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has today opened a new Kiwi technology centre at Quang Trung Software City, in Ho Chi Minh.

The concept centre ‘Kiwi Connection’ is a hub for New Zealand technology companies investing in and doing business in Viet Nam, as well as across the ASEAN region.

The development is headed by New Zealand software services business Augen Software Group, who was the first New Zealand company to win a prestigious Viet Nam IT Excellence award last year.

Also utilising the centre will be health-related technology companies Orion Health and HealthTech, and apparel manufacturing optimisation company ShapeShifter.

“It’s all about helping Kiwi tech businesses accelerate in-market presence and local engagement with customers, with a high degree of scalability,” says Mr Joyce.

Technology plays an increasingly important role in both New Zealand and Viet Nam’s trade growth stories with Viet Nam’s IT market expected to be a regional outperformer over 2016-2019 due to strong growth dynamics and reputation as an outsourcing destination, while New Zealand’s technology sector grew to more than $6.5 billion dollars last year.

“New Zealand has a world-class reputation when it comes to innovation and the flexible technology market. Our companies lead the world in a number of market sectors as diverse as wireless infrastructure, health IT, transport and logistics technologies, digital content, geospatial, and telecommunications,” says Mr Joyce.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealand technology companies and I look forward to more of them utilising the Kiwi Connection hub and meeting with businesses from around the region who want to work with New Zealand companies and use technology services from within ASEAN.”

The opening of the centre was part of a programme of events celebrating business and tourism links between New Zealand and Viet Nam, with the Minister travelling on the first direct Air New Zealand flight between Auckland and Ho Chi Minh City.

Viet Nam is New Zealand’s fastest growing trade market in Southeast Asia, with merchandise exports doubling since 2007.
