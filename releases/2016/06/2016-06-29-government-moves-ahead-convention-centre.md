Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee says months of design and planning work has the Government on course to open Christchurch’s new Convention Centre in late 2019.

“Today the Government has released an indicative design for the Convention Centre Precinct, to give people an idea of what to expect from this important new facility for Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.  

“The Government has successfully completed the early design and master planning stages for the Precinct with Plenary Conventions New Zealand (PCNZ), however other contractors will now be sought as we move into the phase of finalising the design and then construction of the facility. 

“The decision not to proceed with PCNZ was mutually agreed, and I thank the consortium for its input into this project.

“Work on the Convention Centre Precinct site will begin immediately, first with rerouting of telecommunications and other early enabling works, and within the next two weeks preparations will begin for the Colombo Street to Oxford Terrace section of Gloucester Street to close by the end of July.

“Engagement with potential early works contractors will begin immediately, to allow substantial earthworks to begin in October.

“Having certainty around this project is important for the city’s forward planning, and I thank everyone for their patience as we took the necessary time to make this decision on the path ahead.

“The government remains absolutely committed to a Precinct that is world-class, and offers quality accommodation, hospitality and retail to support the convention facilities.

“Market engagement for a main contractor for the Convention Centre’s final design and build will begin in early August.

“We have committed funding for the project but we won’t be disclosing those figures as we seek the best possible deal with contractors,” Mr Brownlee says.      

Ōtākaro Limited, the Crown-owned company set up to deliver central city anchor projects on the Government’s behalf, will lead the process to identify and appoint contractors to confirm the final design and builders for the Convention Centre.

Ōtākaro Limited will also work with parties interested in opportunities to develop the wider Precinct, which has considerable space for accommodation, car parking and other potential uses.
