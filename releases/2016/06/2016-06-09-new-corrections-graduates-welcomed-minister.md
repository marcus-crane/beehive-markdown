Corrections Minister Judith Collins today welcomed 17 new recruits to the Department of Corrections’ frontline.

“If we are to achieve our goal of reducing reoffending, we need dedicated and passionate staff who are exemplary role models,” says Ms Collins.

“Over their 12 months of training the new recruits have certainly shown this, as they learn tactical training, de-escalation techniques and motivational tools, to ensure that they are well equipped to join the Corrections team.”

The latest cohort will be based at Auckland Region Women’s, Spring Hill, Hawkes Bay, Rimutaka and Christchurch Men’s prisons.

The Minister’s Excellence Award went to recruit Henry Rangitaawa in recognition of his leadership, professionalism and positive and proactive approach towards his fellow colleagues. Henry was also awarded the Minister Excellence award in 2009 when he previously worked for the Department. He will work at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.

“It is pleasing that he has made the decision to return to Corrections and use his positive attitude and skills to improve public safety, make a difference and contribute to reducing re-offending.

“Corrections officers play a key role in encouraging offenders to break the cycle of offending and make positive changes in their lives. Being a Corrections Officer might not always be the most glamorous job, but it offers a great challenge and satisfaction knowing that they make a real difference on a daily basis,” Ms Collins says.
