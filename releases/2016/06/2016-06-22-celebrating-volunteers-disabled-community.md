Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today thanks all volunteers for their hard work supporting disabled people in their community.

“This week we celebrate National Volunteer Week. I acknowledge and thank all those who spend hours of their time, energy and skills volunteering, including the valuable volunteer work done by disabled people,” Ms Wagner says.

“34 per cent of disabled adults undertake volunteer work and many small organisations rely on help from volunteers to continue the great work that they do. Volunteer work doesn’t just help the community – it can give disabled people stronger personal relationships, a sense of belonging and valuable experience that can lead to employment.

“Rolling up your sleeves and helping where you can is the Kiwi way of life and I especially want to thank those with disabilities themselves that go the extra mile to give back. Your contributions are greatly appreciated across New Zealand.

“Other volunteers working with disabled people engage in a range of activities, such as supporting members with impairments, teaching new skills and running community programmes. Their work keeps our communities thriving and connects disabled people to their local community.

“This week is an excellent opportunity for new volunteers to get involved and learn new skills, find new passions and make a difference in the lives of others. I encourage New Zealanders of all ability to give volunteering a go,” Ms Wagner says.
