Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has congratulated the Sing Your Lungs Out Choir as the winner of the 2016 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards. 

“The health volunteer awards celebrate and recognise the thousands of dedicated health sector volunteers who give many hours of their time to help other New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“This year there were nearly double the number of applicants which made the judging quite difficult.

“Well done to all the volunteers who were nominated and congratulations to those recognised as outstanding achievers.

“The overall winners, Sing Your Lungs Out Choir volunteers are a great example of doctors, nurses and others combining their skills and experience to deliver an innovative approach to improving people’s quality of life.”

The Sing Your Lungs Out choir is for people with severe respiratory disease. Choir members have seen significant benefits from singing, with enhanced physical and mental wellbeing.

Dr Coleman today presented the Minister of Health Volunteer Awards in Parliament, ahead of National Volunteer Week 19 - 25 June.

Outstanding achievers were recognised across five categories – healthcare service provider, community or NGO, youth health, Māori and Pacific health, and long service.
