Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says the newly named Queen Elizabeth II Pukeahu Education Centre will be an excellent home for education programmes at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington.

“The War Memorial Park is a place where New Zealanders can learn about our nation’s involvement in war, honour those who fell and remember the impact of conflict throughout our history,” Ms Barry says.

“I cannot think of a more fitting gift to Her Majesty The Queen on her 90th birthday than to have the new education centre named after her.”

Housed in the former Home of Compassion crèche, the centre is staffed by two educators who run the programme for visiting students. More than 12,000 have participated since the park opened in April 2015, and feedback has been very positive.

“The interior of the building has been converted into a classroom teaching space, which can also be used by community groups when not being used for education,” Ms Barry says.

“The educators work closely with the Great War Exhibition, housed in the nearby former Dominion Museum building, to ensure schools and their pupils get the best possible experience from their visit.”

The centre will also include a small display honouring Mother Aubert and the Sisters of Compassion, and encouraging anyone interested in knowing more about their work to visit the Home of Compassion site in Island Bay.
