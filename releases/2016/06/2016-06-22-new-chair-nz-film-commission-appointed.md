Former Wellington mayor Kerry Prendergast has been appointed Chair of the New Zealand Film Commission, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced.

“Mayor of the capital from 2001-2010 and now chair of both the Environmental Protection Authority and Tourism New Zealand boards, Ms Prendergast brings extensive experience in governance to the role,” Ms Barry says.

She replaces outgoing chair Dame Patsy Reddy, who will be New Zealand’s next Governor-General.

“Ms Prendergast is soon to complete her term as executive chair of the NZ Festival of the Arts and will take up this new appointment on 1 July, effective until 30 June 2019,” Ms Barry says.

“My thanks go to Dame Patsy for her significant contribution to the Film Commission, where she championed the new incentives regime and helped to marshal the resources needed to make New Zealand a more attractive place to make movies.

“Dame Patsy oversaw the establishment of the Screen Advisory Board, which is making the New Zealand film industry more competitive internationally. I wish her well for her new role as Governor-General.”
