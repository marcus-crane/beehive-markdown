Over $3 million has been allocated in Budget 2016 to help accelerate the development of commercial procurement skills across government through the Procurement Functional Leadership Programme, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

“The government’s procurement programme has a proven track record of creating significant value for taxpayers,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Programme manages 18 All-of-Government contracts that successfully combine cross-government spending to save money and improve efficiency.  More than 890 agencies currently participate in one or more of these contracts, including over 500 schools. The programme is on track to deliver savings of $740 million. That’s money we are investing straight back into providing better public services.

The additional funding in Budget 2016 will help roll out improvements in procurement skills across the state sector with a particular emphasis on improving social sector procurement, and ensuring agencies effectively use the new Government Rules of Sourcing.

“The Government is the biggest purchaser in New Zealand, spending some $39 billion with private sector suppliers annually” Mr Joyce says. “While we have made great progress in achieving smarter, more cost-effective procurement across government, there is still plenty of opportunity to do more in individual agencies to increase value for government and its suppliers.

“This funding will be used by MBIE to help agencies use the latest tools and techniques to work with the business sector and develop more innovative government services for New Zealanders at the best whole-of life cost.”

The Procurement Functional Leadership Programme is the result of the 2011 Better Public Services Advisory Group report that identified the need for significant change to improve the performance of the State sector. As part of this change, the Chief Executive of MBIE was appointed procurement functional leader.
