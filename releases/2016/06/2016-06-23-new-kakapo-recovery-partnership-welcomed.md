Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says the new kakapo recovery partnership between DOC and Meridian Energy is great news for efforts to save one of New Zealand’s most beloved birds.

“I’m delighted to welcome Meridian as the new partner for the Kākāpō Recovery Programme,” Ms Barry says.

“Following the biggest breeding season in living memory, Meridian’s investment will enable DOC and our Treaty partner Ngāi Tahu to expand work with the birds even further.”

Meridian’s commitment will build on the success achieved through the partnership between DOC, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters and Forest & Bird which ended a few months ago after 25 years.

Kākāpō numbers have increased from just 50 birds in the 1990s to 158 after this year’s record breeding season.

The new partnership, signed initially for three years, will support the next phase of the recovery effort.

“It will help fund research into new conservation techniques focused on kākāpō fertility success, genetics, nutrition and disease management,” Ms Barry says.

DOC will also identify potential homes for new generations of kākāpō, an important step in safeguarding the species’ future.

It will continue to work closely with Forest & Bird on kākāpō recovery.

Meridian joins nine other national commercial conservation partners and many local business and community groups working with DOC.

“DOC is always looking to build partnerships with business, community groups and philanthropists. They are a great benefit to conservation and help to safeguard our natural heritage.”
