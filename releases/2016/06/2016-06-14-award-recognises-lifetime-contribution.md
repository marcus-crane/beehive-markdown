Forty-five years of service to education were recognised in Auckland last night when Dame Karen Sewell was awarded a lifetime education achievement award, Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

“Throughout her career Dame Karen has focused on lifting achievement for all students,” Ms Parata says. “She once said ‘for me, it has been immensely satisfying to have served young New Zealanders all my adult life, and I have also considered it a great privilege to be a public servant’.

“That sums up a lifetime of service. New Zealand is a better place for her efforts.”

Dame Karen, who earlier this month was made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to education, is the only person to have headed the Education Ministry, the Education Review Office and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

She is currently the chair of Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu Correspondence Board, led the implementation of National Standards, a new national curriculum, and Youth Guarantee, and has served on numerous other bodies.

Dame Karen’s award was accepted on her behalf by Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu chief executive Mike Hollings because Dame Karen is overseas.
