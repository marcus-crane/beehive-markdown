Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams has today met with Rotorua court staff and heard about their community initiatives, as part of a local visit.

“The Rotorua court team are doing some incredible work, which includes running the ninth busiest criminal court in the country,” says Ms Adams.

Ms Adams visited the Rotorua court, where a court has operated on the Tutanekai Street site since 1884.

“The Rotorua court is a hub in the Central North Island community, supporting the Tokoroa, Taupo and Taumarunui district courts. It’s also home to several other justice services – the Māori Land Court, Coroners Court, National Transcription Service and a Legal Aid Office.”

The Rotorua Court also helps run the Rangatahi Courts (marae-based youth courts) in Rotorua and Taupo, which have been very successful in changing the attitude and behaviour of young people.

Ms Adams heard about Beyond the Bars, an after-school voluntary programme which teaches students about the justice system, including what it’s like to work as a judge, prosecutor, court security guard, and defence lawyer. Students also take part in a mock trial, with court staff volunteering their time.

“Our future leaders are currently in the school system and many want to make a difference in their communities.”

Minister Adams also heard about the success of the Working Together Governance Group, where the Ministry of Justice co-leads a group of senior local representatives from four other government agencies (Ministries of Education, Health, Social Development and the New Zealand Police), NGOs, trusts and the Mayor of Rotorua’s office, to focus on how to best deliver outcomes for the youth and communities of the region.

“This is an example of how people in the Justice sector are working collaboratively with different agencies to deliver the best possible outcomes for our communities, especially our young people.”
