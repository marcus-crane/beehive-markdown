The Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) has had budget confirmed of $13.0 million operating funding over the next four years, and $3.4 million capital funding to continue developing its information and data portfolio.

The work DIA do is central to making it easier for New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses to access trusted government information and data clearly and simply, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne says.

“The funds will allow DIA to further increase digital capability among government agencies and deliver quality digital services to the public”, says Mr. Dunne.

“It is important that this work continues so the government can further build on delivering Better Public Services to New Zealanders and business by ensuring people can find the information they need to access government services, when they need it”, he adds.

One of the services covered by the budget is the open data directory website data.govt.nz which is devoted to making open government data easier to access, and reuse. An improved ‘test’ version of the website was launched earlier this week by the Government Information Services group (GIS) within DIA. The website helps visitors easily locate and use the growing number of datasets agencies make available through the website.

“Making open data freely available is one of the ways government can become more transparent and ties in closely with the work New Zealand is involved in as a member of the D5 network”, says Mr Dunne.

The Digital 5 or D5 network comprises Estonia, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United Kingdom and officials from D5 met earlier this week in Wellington ahead of D5 Summit to be held in South Korea later in the year. D5 nations are regarded as being global leaders in the digital government space.

Other information services the funds will support include the Govt.nz website which helps New Zealanders find and use government information. GIS also provides guidance and advice to help agencies comply with web standards, build skills and expertise and lift their digital engagement with the public. 

“There are a lot of interesting information and data initiatives taking place within DIA as they continue to fulfil a key ‘All of Government’ leadership role within the state sector.

“Being at the forefront of digital government initiatives worldwide, the funding will enable New Zealanders to be among the first to experience many digital innovations which as a nation of early adopters, is a role we are used to and comfortable with”, said Mr Dunne.
