Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will visit Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland this afternoon to officially open the school’s new 12-classroom mathematics faculty and refurbished student services centre.

“Mount Albert Grammar School has a proud tradition of stellar student achievement and it will be great to open these new facilities, which I’m sure will support continued high performance,” says Ms Kaye.

The school’s student achievement rates are above the national average, particularly for Maori and Pasifika students.

“These new facilities are the first stage of projects to provide 24 additional classrooms to cater for the school’s rapidly growing roll. Over $5 million has been invested so far in the new maths faculty and refurbished student services centre.

“Two days ago, along with Minister Parata, I announced a $153 million investment in Auckland school property as part of Budget 2016.

“These investments are testament to the Government’s commitment to get ahead of demand, and upgrade facilities and grow school capacity in our largest city.”

The new classroom block at Mount Albert Grammar has been named in honour of the school’s fourth principal, Mr Maurice Hall, who had a strong interest in mathematics. Mr Hall will attend today’s opening.

“Construction of the new classroom block began in 2014, so it’s great to be here in 2016 to see it fully up and running.

“The new block is two storeys high, which enables the school to retain valuable recreational space such as sports fields, while still catering to the rapidly growing roll.

“The next phase of the project at the school, approved this week under Budget 2016, will see the construction of 12 new teaching spaces for science, dance and drama.

“This phase will see a further investment of around $6 million and will be another important step towards futureproofing the school for growth.”

Mount Albert Grammar is one of the largest secondary schools in New Zealand, with a current roll of over 2,700 students, and could grow by over 200 students by 2021.
