Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed 53 new Police Officers in the Dr Helen Anderson QSO recruit Wing 297.

Ms Collins congratulated the Constables and wished them the best while they celebrate with family and friends today at the attestation parade of Wing 297 at the Royal New Zealand Police College, Porirua.

“The passing out or ‘attestation’ marks the beginning of a challenging and rewarding career for the new officers. 

“One officer, *Top in Wing*, Constable Joseph Konlechner will definitely be celebrating with family today, as his sister, Constable Esther Konlechner was also top of her wing when she graduated with Wing 280.

The majority of the Wing 297 including Constable Konlechner will be stationed in Wellington district.

“It takes a special person to be a Police officer. There are very few jobs that ask people to put themselves in the path of danger so that the public may be safe.  To find two from one family who have excelled like this, is very unusual and I wish Constable Konlechner the best,” Ms Collins said.

The Wing 297 attestation parade marks the completion of the second phase of the Police Officers’ training which involves an intensive 18-week course at The Royal New Zealand Police College.
