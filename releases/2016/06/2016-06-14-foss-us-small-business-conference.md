Small Business Minister Craig Foss is visiting the United States this week for the annual International Council for Small Business (ICSB) conference.

The conference, held in New Jersey, brings together the world’s foremost policy-makers, non-government organisations, scholars and social entrepreneurs to discuss issues facing small businesses.

“Small businesses are the backbone of the New Zealand economy.  This government is focused on creating an environment that ensures they have all the tools, resources and support necessary to grow and thrive,” Mr Foss says.

“New Zealand has a range of measures underway to support small businesses.  Just last week I announced *Taking Care of Business,* a series of 16 events around the country designed to help small businesses engage with government more effectively and efficiently.

“There’s always more to be done so I look forward to hearing the ideas and initiatives of small business advocates from around the globe.”

Mr Foss will also visit Washington D.C for a variety of meetings in his Small Business, Statistics and Veterans’ Affairs portfolios.
