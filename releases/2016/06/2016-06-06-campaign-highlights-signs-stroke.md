Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes a new national campaign which highlights the signs of a stroke and the need to act quickly.

“Each year in New Zealand about 9,000 people have a stroke. Early identification and treatment is crucial to reduce the likelihood of brain damage and lasting harm,” says Dr Coleman.

“The FAST campaign focuses on the key signs of a stroke and emphasises the swift action needed if you’re concerned.

“FAST stands for Face, Arm, Speech and Time. This is because sudden changes to a person’s face such as drooping, dramatic loss of arm strength or slurred speech could all be warnings that they’re suffering from a stroke.

“The campaign follows a survey by the Stroke Foundation which found around one-third of New Zealanders were unable to recognise any signs of stroke.”

Hospitals are getting better at identifying stroke patients and moving them to specialist units quicker. DHBs are making steady improvements towards the 80 per cent target.

The number of patients managed in a stroke unit or a stroke service increased to 74 per cent for the three months ending December 2015, compared to 66 per cent for the same period in 2014.

While the number of patients who received stroke thrombylosis, a clot busting therapy suitable for a small number of patients, increased to nine per cent for the three months ending December 2015 - up from six per cent for the same period in 2014.

"All DHBs now offer clot busting medicines or stroke thrombylosis, but it is currently only a 24/7 service in the larger centres,” says Dr Coleman.

“To help address this a telestroke pilot gets underway this weekend. Specialists at Wellington Regional Hospital will be available after hours to provide advice for time sensitive cases via video link to four regional hospitals.

“The pilot will run for six months and includes Hawke’s Bay, Nelson, Wairau, and Palmerston North.”

The FAST campaign will run across a range of media until early August. It follows a successful pilot in Waikato. The campaign has been developed by the Ministry of Health, Health Promotion Agency and Stroke Foundation.
