Claims by the Green Party on contaminated sites expenditure expose how poorly they understand economics, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Their claim the Government has underspent on contaminated sites clean-up by $32.6 million involves basic accounting errors that raise serious questions about their economic competence.

“It is a nonsense for the Greens to claim that the transfer of $11.3 million for the Tui mine clean-up from the annual appropriations to a multi-year one is a cut. The funding is identical but a multi-year appropriation recognises a particular project may be spread over a number of financial years. The project was completed on time, to budget and has achieved both the environmental and safety improvements sought.

“There have been delays in progressing the Kopeopeo Canal due to appeals before the Environment Court. No funding has been lost and it has simply been transferred forward to the next year. The Greens have erroneously counted the delay as a cut and doubled it for the two years it has been moved forward. The irony is that the Greens criticised delays in clean-ups caused by the Resource Management Act but refuse to support reforms that would enable projects to proceed more quickly.

“The delays in the Prohibition and Alexander mine clean-ups have arisen because the contamination was found to be significantly worse. The Government has chosen to do a thorough job rather than a quick job – something we would expect the Greens to welcome.

“Funding has been maintained but has not fallen into smooth financial years. This year’s Budget provides for $8.4 million due to the Kopeopeo Canal, Nelson Haven and Prohibition and Alexander mines clean-ups occurring in one year.

“The Government is committed to a careful and systematic clean-up of contaminated sites. These projects are notoriously challenging and we do not want to repeat the environmental fiasco that occurred under the Labour and Green parties at Mapua.”
