The Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill (No 2) has passed its first reading this evening and has been referred to the Local Government and Environment Select committee.

Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says “the Bill will enable more innovation and collaboration across local government to deliver better local services and infrastructure”.

“The Bill’s proposed changes are essential for planning and supporting jobs, regional growth and community development. They will enable councils and communities to develop local solutions for local challenges,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The costs of local services are rising faster than council revenues, so councils need new ways to manage finances, improve efficiencies and create better value for ratepayers.”

Current local government structures limit the ability of the country’s 78 councils and 66 water authorities to work together to manage critical infrastructure and deliver shared services across regions.

“The Bill will enable two or more councils to create council-controlled organisations (CCOs).  Multiply-owned CCOs can have greater size, scale and capacity than can be achieved by individual councils,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

For the first time, councils will be able to lead reorganisation proposals in consultation with their communities and neighbouring councils.

“The Bill also provides for the Local Government Commission to have enhanced powers to work with councils and government to support reorganisation proposals.”

“I expect the legislation to be passed by the end of the year so that the new councils elected later this year will be able to use the reform options early in their new terms,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
