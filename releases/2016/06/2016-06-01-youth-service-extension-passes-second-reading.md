Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the Social Security (Extension of Young Persons Services and Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill has passed its second reading.

The bill extends the Youth Service to all 19-year-old parents and 18 and 19-year-olds at significant risk of long term welfare dependence by supporting them into education and training and ensuring they complete budgeting and parenting courses.

“By wrapping support around at-risk youth and helping them to find a sustainable path to independence we can make a long term, positive difference in their lives and their children’s lives,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Young people would also be paired up with a Youth Coach, who helps them set goals, focus on their education and meet their obligations.

“At the end of March 2016 there were 10,212 18 and 19 year olds on a benefit, and we know that on average they are expected to spend a further 16 years on welfare.

“Budget 2016 includes $61.2 million to support this expansion so that we can provide an effective intervention for some of our most at-risk young people.

“The Youth Service is showing positive results with more than half of those who exit the programme remaining independent from benefits three months later.

“We’ve heard from providers that it’s frustrating they have to stop working with young people when they turn 18. This bill will allow them to continue to assist their clients for longer to gain the skills they need to succeed.

“This is about investing in our young people and their families early so that they don’t continue the cycle of welfare dependence,” Mrs Tolley says.
