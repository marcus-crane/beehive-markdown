Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams today announced two reappointments to the Board of Radio New Zealand (RNZ). 

Nelson-based former journalist Richard Griffin has been reappointed as Chair of Radio New Zealand and Jane Taylor, a barrister and professional director from Queenstown, has been reappointed and takes on the role of Deputy Chair.

“Mr Griffin has extensive experience in news agencies, radio and television, and has contributed significant broadcasting experience to the RNZ Board since appointed as a Governor in 2010. He has overseen a significant change programme at RNZ and has provided clear leadership to the organisation and Board,” says Ms Adams.

“Ms Taylor provides strong experience in governance across a number of sectors and has made a valuable contribution to the Board.”

Ms Taylor is currently Chair of Landcare Research New Zealand and a director of Silver Fern Farms, Hirepool Group, and OTPP New Zealand Forest Investments.

Mr Griffin took up his appointment on 1 May 2016 for a two year term, while Ms Taylor commenced in her role as Deputy Chair on 1 June 2016 and will serve almost three more years - until 30 April 2019.
