Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell welcomes efforts from Māori Women’s Development Inc to further wāhine Māori in the areas of business development and entrepreneurship.

At an event at Parliament this morning Mr Flavell and the charity are celebrating the achievements of 13 wāhine who are participating in the International Coaching Federation’s programme to become certified life coaches.

“This event serves to highlight wāhine Māori potential and their significant contributions in business and entrepreneurship,” Mr Flavell says.

The charity, which is primarily funded by Te Puni Kōkiri, is also today launching its Hinepreneur Brand which includes the new Hineboss three-day business programme, and the Hinepreneur Timebank – an innovative platform to exchange services and support for time. 

The Timebank system gives wāhine with little capital the ability to access and share skills and support.

“It is my fervent hope that initiatives like Hinepreneur will help grow and develop a new cohort of Māori women who can, in the words of Ani Mikaere, ‘rediscover and reassert tikanga Māori within our own whānau’,” says Mr Flavell. 

Māori Women’s Development Inc is a 28-year-old financial institution dedicated to supporting wāhine Māori and their whānau in business.
