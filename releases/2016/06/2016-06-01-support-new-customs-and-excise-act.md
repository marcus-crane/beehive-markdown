Budget 2016 will support the implementation of a new Customs and Excise Act to ensure that systems and processes are in place to maximise the benefits says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The Government is investing $8.2 million to ensure the effective delivery of a modernised Customs and Excise Act and supporting regulations by developing systems, processes and services to accommodate the changes,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Act will be simpler, increase transparency for businesses who import and export, and will remove unnecessary costs to traders and Customs.

“The changes to the Act will help importers and exporters maximise their trade potential and facilitate New Zealand’s growing economy. We have worked with the sector and carried out many of the changes they have advocated for.

“One example is implementing some of the key changes in the alcohol excise, which give alcohol manufacturers more flexibility by expanding off-site storage to cover all products and removes the requirement for manufacturers to apply for excise remissions for damage or loss for goods not released to market.

“Customs will continue to work closely with industry to ensure a smooth introduction of the proposed changes, and make certain everyone understands their obligations and how to meet them through guidance material and training for customers,” Ms Wagner says.
