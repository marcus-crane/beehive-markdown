Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced a new competitive funding process to allocate up to $35 million in annual tuition subsidies for levels 3 and 4 tertiary education study in agriculture, horticulture and viticulture qualifications. 

“This competitive funding pilot will allow the TEC to direct investment at sub-degree level learning towards higher quality delivery, improved value for money, and increase responsiveness to industry needs,” Mr Joyce says.

The funding will come from existing Student Achievement Component (SAC) and will be administered by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

“Recent changes within primary sector education provision have created an opportunity to strengthen the quality and delivery of this type of study, focusing on the key skills and expertise that are required by employers in the primary sector.”

“It’s also about ensuring we are providing strong pathways for learners to develop the necessary skills to gain employment in the primary sector or go on to further study at a higher level.”

“The primary industries sector is an area of national importance and with identified skill shortages in areas of agriculture, horticulture and viticulture; we need to make sure that we continue to strengthen provision all at levels.”
