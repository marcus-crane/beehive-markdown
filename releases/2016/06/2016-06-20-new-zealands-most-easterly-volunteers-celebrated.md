Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne is going the distance to acknowledge some of New Zealand’s most far-flung volunteers.

The Minister will visit the Chatham Islands this week and will celebrate National Volunteer Week with the local volunteer fire brigade.

“In a small island community like the Chathams, volunteers are crucial,” Mr Dunne said.

The Minister will also talk with the local volunteers about the merger next year of New Zealand’s urban and rural fire services into a new organisation, Fire and Emergency New Zealand.

Funding has been announced for the new organisation to address gaps in rural fire services, and provide better support for New Zealand’s 12,000 fire volunteers.

“We need a flexible, modern and efficient fire service that works well, is well-funded and where our workforce and volunteers feel valued and supported.”

Mr Dunne said strong local leadership is also important for volunteer brigades. 

“The new organisation will keep the local identity of volunteer brigades, and keep local leadership roles.

“Firefighters are a perfect example of the importance of volunteers in New Zealand. They are dedicated, hardworking and are the cornerstone of almost every community.

“They also have a key role in supporting the resilience of the communities they represent.”
