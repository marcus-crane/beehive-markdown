Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says new literacy and numeracy results for Pacific adults are great news.

“The fact that Pacific literacy and numeracy scores are increasing at a faster rate than the rest of the New Zealand adult population shows Pacific communities are rising to the challenge of better education,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Since 2006, Pacific literacy scores have risen by 4 percent compared to a 1 per cent increase for the total population. Pacific people’s numeracy scores have also risen by 2 per cent.

“While Pacific and Maori adult literacy and numeracy scores are lower than the New Zealand average, the gap is decreasing with more focus on these priority groups,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“More Pacific kids and their families are achieving better results from early childhood education through to tertiary education. We are now also seeing improvements in literacy and numeracy skills for pacific adult learners,”  Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Providing adults with access to education and training such as the Youth Guarantee scheme and the Maori and Pasifika Trades Training programme, help adults into work and delivers better living standards for Pacific people.”

The international ‘Survey of Adult Skills’ released overnight shows Japan first in adult literacy followed by Finland, the Netherlands and New Zealand in fourth place.
