Trade Minister Todd McClay has announced public sessions on the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) in June, following attending a TiSA Ministerial meeting in the margins of the OECD Ministerial Conference in Paris.

Services are an important part of New Zealand’s economy, accounting for two-thirds of economic activity and 70 per cent of employment. New Zealand’s service sector exports were worth NZ$20 billion in 2015, almost 30 per cent of our total exports of goods and services.

“At the TiSA Ministerial meeting Ministers welcomed the progress being made in negotiations. I expressed New Zealand’s commitment to work to conclude negotiations by the end of 2016. I am focused on getting the best outcomes for New Zealand, which include private education, IT, transport services, environmental and professional services sectors,” says Mr McClay.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) will hold public discussion sessions in Wellington on 22 June and Auckland on 28 June.

“The public sessions on TiSA will be open to anyone who would like to learn more about this important agreement, whose 23 participants account for 70 per cent of global services trade,” says Mr McClay. 

“New Zealand negotiators will outline progress in the negotiations to date. Negotiators will explain how they are working to tackle barriers to New Zealand services trade and protect important areas of New Zealand policy and regulation, including the provision of public services.”

Anyone interested in attending these meetings should register with MFAT by emailing [serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz](mailto:serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz) by 20 June.

“For those who are unable to attend the sessions, questions on the negotiations are welcomed by email to [serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz](mailto:serviceexports@mfat.govt.nz). The New Zealand negotiating team will answer a selection of these at the sessions.”

In addition, negotiators continue to engage with business leaders, sector groups, unions and other stakeholders on the issues under negotiation. Formal submissions on the TiSA negotiation continue to be welcomed by email.

Material, including presentations and other additional background on the negotiation, will be published on the Ministry’s website: [www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tisa).
