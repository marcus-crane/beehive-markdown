Three youth sector organisations and four Councils will receive a total of $65,000 to help them provide youth development opportunities that will benefit up to 200 young people, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This funding is about supporting more leadership, volunteering and mentoring opportunities for young people across New Zealand,” says Ms Kaye.

The youth sector organisations that will receive funding are:

- YES Disability Resource Centre, Albany, Auckland, who receive $20,000 towards their Carabiner Youth Mentoring programme which targets young people living with disabilities
- Sources of Unconditional Love Charitable Trust, Auckland and Wellington, who receive $16,000 to support the delivery of their SOULcircle programme, which provides leadership, volunteering and mentoring opportunities for young women
- Connecting for Youth Employment Trust, Central Hawke’s Bay, who receive over $9000 to deliver leadership development opportunities designed to connect young people to their communities.

“All of these organisations are working to inspire young people, and supporting them to gain new skills and confidence to help put them on a path to a successful future.”

The Councils, which will each receive small grants funding of around $5000, are:

- Hurunui District Council
- Invercargill City Council
- Ruapehu District Council
- Selwyn District Council.

“Councils are at the forefront of ensuring that young people have an active voice in local decision-making, and many support local youth councils to develop and implement local initiatives for their peers.

“The youth councils from Hurunui, Invercargill, Ruapehu and Selwyn all stood out through their nomination for the 2016 Youth Awards, and this small grants funding will help their parent Councils engage youth council members in leadership, volunteering and mentoring opportunities.

“We now have a new direction for youth development in New Zealand which is about increasing the number of youth development opportunities, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as developing greater cohesion between the Government and business and philanthropic sectors to create these opportunities.

“I expect the new direction to increase the number of youth development opportunities from around 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.

“Our young people have unlimited potential, and it’s important we support them to realise this potential and that we recognise the contribution they make to society.”
