Corrections Minister Judith Collins has acknowledged around 1800 volunteers who donate hours of their time in prisons and community corrections sites to help offenders turn their lives around.

“National Volunteer Week is a time to recognise these selfless people who give up their time to help offenders learn skills and reconnect with their communities,” says Ms Collins.

The theme of Volunteer Week 2016 is “Thanks for making time”. It runs from 19 to 25 June.

“Corrections volunteers come from all walks of life and teach many skills from reading and writing to quilting and art.

“One excellent example is the New Zealand Howard League for Penal Reform which started a literacy programme at Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison in early 2012.

“Due to its success, it is now running at many other prisons. The Howard League recruits mainly retired teachers as volunteers who come into the prisons and work with prisoners with limited reading ability.

“Volunteers provide a critical link to the community and are essential to the work Corrections does with offenders in prisons and the community,” Ms Collins says.

“To help offenders move towards a crime-free future requires the support of many people.

“National Volunteer Week is a great time to say a big thank you to all these volunteers and encourage others who may wish to work with offenders.”
