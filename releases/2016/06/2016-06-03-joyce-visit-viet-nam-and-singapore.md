Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce will travel to Viet Nam and Singapore tomorrow to reinforce New Zealand’s relationships in business, investment and education, and underpin the Government’s commitment to lifting engagement with both countries. 

Mr Joyce will travel to Viet Nam on Air New Zealand’s inaugural direct flight between Auckland and Ho Chi Minh City. The new air link will fly three times a week, operating from June to October, and will bolster tourist and business links between Viet Nam and New Zealand.

“Cooperation and contact between New Zealand and Viet Nam has flourished in the past 15 years, boosted by Viet Nam’s rapid economic growth and its maturing confidence as an established ASEAN member and a global citizen. This new air link will further strengthen the connections between our two countries,” Mr Joyce says. 

In Ho Chi Minh City the Minister will open a new technology centre ‘Kiwi Connection’ headed by New Zealand software services business Augen Software.

“Kiwi Connection is a hub for New Zealand technology companies investing in and doing business in Viet Nam, as well as across the region. The centre will benefit both New Zealand and Viet Nam by utilising New Zealand expertise and Vietnamese manufacturing and labour opportunities to take products and services into other ASEAN markets and beyond.”

Also while in Ho Chi Minh City the Minister will unveil the design for a New Zealand-Viet Nam friendship bridge which showcases New Zealand timber as a construction material, and he will be the key note speaker at the New Zealand Viet Nam Culinary Collaboration.

The Culinary Collaboration involves top culinary students from New Zealand and Viet Nam showcasing the best of cuisine, techniques and ingredients from both countries. Their dishes will be put to the taste test at a gala dinner for 150 guests including the New Zealand Ambassador to Viet Nam Haike Manning and top chefs from both countries. 

In Singapore, Mr Joyce will meet with senior Ministers and officials to explore ways to strengthen the bilateral science and innovation relationship between New Zealand Singapore, including supporting collaborative efforts between New Zealand’s Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and A\*STAR, the lead Singaporean agency focused on fostering research to drive a knowledge-based economy.

At functions in Singapore he will address select high-net worth investors to promote New Zealand as an investment destination, and meet with key New Zealand sector representatives and the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce Singapore.
