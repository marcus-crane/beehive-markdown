Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith is welcoming the addition of real-time air quality data to the Land Air Water Aotearoa (LAWA) website.

“Air quality in New Zealand has improved significantly due to tighter regulation of home heating, vehicle fuels, car exhaust systems and industrial discharges. However, we still have areas where particulate pollution exceeds World Health Organisation standards, particularly on still nights in winter.

“Real-time air quality information helps individuals and organisations make better decisions. It will help councils build public support for the regulatory changes to achieve cleaner air, and enable people to choose to use cleaner heating options when they know air pollution is reaching unacceptable levels.

“The open disclosure of environmental data is an important part of the Government’s programme of improving New Zealanders’ quality of life. The Environmental Reporting Act and the LAWA website are about New Zealanders having access to reliable and up-to-date information on key issues such as the quality of air we breathe.”

Dr Smith acknowledged the commitment of regional councils to making this data available. The Ministry for the Environment is also working with councils on their air quality management programmes and progress towards their National Environmental Standards for Air Quality targets.

“The science of air quality is complex and I know this real-time data will be very helpful in helping us better understand the factors that influence the air we breathe,” Dr Smith concluded.
