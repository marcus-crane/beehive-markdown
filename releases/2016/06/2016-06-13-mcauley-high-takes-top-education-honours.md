Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated McAuley High School on winning top honours at the 2016 Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

The Auckland girls school was a finalist in three categories and, in addition to winning the Supreme Award, won the Excellence in Engaging trophy.

“The school has built a cohesive, respectful and supportive environment for all its students with brilliant results,” says Ms Parata. “It has high expectations and strong connections with its parents and the community and tonight’s awards are recognition of its vision and effort.”

The other category winners were:

- Excellence in Leading: Rotorua Boys’ High School
- Excellence in Teaching and Learning: Te Puna Reo o Puhi Kaiti, Gisborne
- Excellence in Governing: Rangitoto College, Auckland
- 2016 Focus Prize: Karanga Mai Young Parent College & Early Learning Centre, Kaiapoi.

“This year we had a record number of entries across all categories,” Ms Parata says. “The winners and all the finalists are a credit to the teaching profession. They showed the difference that great teaching and great leadership backed by strong governance make to kids’ lives.”

The awards, in their third year, recognise and celebrate outstanding achievements in early childhood education, primary and secondary schooling.

They were presented by Prime Minister John Key at a ceremony at the Auckland War Memorial Museum attended by the 14 finalists along with representatives from all parts of the education sector.

The winning entry in each category received $20,000 and a professional development opportunity.

As the winner of the Supreme Award, McAuley High School received an additional $30,000 plus an opportunity to represent New Zealand education.

Finalists also received a financial award to acknowledge their contribution to education.
