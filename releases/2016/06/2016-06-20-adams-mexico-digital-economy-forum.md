New Zealand’s focus on digital infrastructure will be front and centre at an international forum to discuss the growth of the digital economy.

Communications and Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams will travel to Mexico this week to speak at a meeting on the Digital Economy: Innovation, Growth and Social Prosperity.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are bringing together Ministers and stakeholders to discuss a range of policy areas important for growth of the digital economy, including internet openness, digital trust, global connectivity, and jobs and skills.

Minister Adams will be speaking on a panel focusing on improving networks and services through digital convergence.

“The digital economy is an increasingly important part of our lives,” says Ms Adams.

“Access to fast and reliable broadband is driving how we do business, access information and connect with our family and friends. 

“Other countries are interested to learn about New Zealand’s investment in the Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband Initiative programmes. At the digital forum at Cancun I will also be discussing the convergence work programme we are undertaking to ensure our regulatory systems remain fit for purpose. 

“To make the most of our world-class UFB network it’s important New Zealand ensures it has the right laws for our communication networks after 2020.”

The meeting will be held from 22 to 23 June, in Cancun, Mexico.
