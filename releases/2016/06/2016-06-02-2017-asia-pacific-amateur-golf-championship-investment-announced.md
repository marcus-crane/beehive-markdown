Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced that the Major Events Development Fund (MEDF) will invest $900,000 to support the Royal Wellington Golf Club in hosting the Asia-Pacific Amateur Golf Championship in 2017.

“The four-day tournament will be broadcast live to more than 150 countries and attract a number of the world’s golf media to New Zealand. The tournament provides a strong platform to showcase New Zealand as a great tourism and golf-tourism destination,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Asia-Pacific Amateur Golf Championship is one of the leading amateur tournaments in the world and was established to promote the development of amateur golfers in the Asia-Pacific region.”

“This is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealand and a real coup for the Wellington Golf Club,” Dr Coleman says.

“This tournament is likely to be the most significant one-off golf event to be held in New Zealand, and we look forward to welcoming members from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, the Augusta National Golf Club, and the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation to New Zealand.

“This tournament is an exciting occasion for New Zealanders, who will have the opportunity to attend the event free of charge and see many of the world’s up and coming golf stars compete at a world-class event.”

The Royal Wellington Golf Club will host the 72 hole stroke play tournament from 23-30 October 2017, which will see 120 of the best amateur male golfers from 40 Asia-Pacific countries travel to New Zealand for the Tournament.

The tournament was founded in 2009 by the R&A of St Andrews Scotland, the Masters Tournament of Georgia, USA, and the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, and takes place annually within the Asia-Pacific region.

The Government invests, through the MEDF, in major events that seek to generate significant immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand, and lift and maintain New Zealand’s international profile.

“We are committed to working with New Zealand's major events sector to help attract and grow high-quality major events that deliver economic, social and cultural benefits and promote New Zealand to the world," Mr Joyce says.
