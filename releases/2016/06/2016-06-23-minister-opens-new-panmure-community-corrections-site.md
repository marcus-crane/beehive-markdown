Corrections Minister Judith Collins today officially opened the refurbished Panmure Community Corrections site in Jellicoe Road, Auckland. 

The refurbishment of the Panmure site is part of a five-year nation-wide renewal programme to make Community Corrections’ sites more secure, and better equipped to keep staff and visitors safe while supporting offenders.

The Panmure site has a new-look reception area with improved safety features, including closed-circuit camera surveillance, duress alarms, and better lines of sight.

Other improvements include an upgraded waiting area and office layout, safer interview rooms, and more space for programme delivery and training for community-based offenders with the aim of reducing re-offending.

“The fit-for-purpose upgrades at the Panmure site are such that the facility is now a flagship Community Corrections centre,” said Ms Collins.

The Department of Corrections employs 45 staff at Panmure Community Corrections.

The site manages over 600 offenders on 905 community-based sentences and orders, including home detention and community work.

Community Corrections manages offenders to hold them to account to comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of re-offending, help them become productive members of society, and keep local communities safe.
