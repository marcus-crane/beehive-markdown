Trade Minister Todd McClay has announced further details of the stakeholder events being held in Auckland during the next round of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade negotiations.

“I have been clear that I wish to see more engagement with the public around New Zealand’s trade agreements,” Mr McClay says.

“With that in mind the public session which will outline the RCEP negotiations on Tuesday 14 June from 5.30pm in Auckland will be livestreamed on the MFAT website.

“The livestream will be available at [www.mfat.govt.nz/rcep](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/rcep) from 5.30pm on Tuesday 14 June.

“New Zealanders can send in questions ahead of the event, or on the day, using email and Twitter and our negotiating team will be available to provide responses. Or people can attend and ask their questions in person.”

Email questions to [rcep@mfat.govt.nz](mailto:rcep@mfat.govt.nz) or alternatively, tweet MFAT on @MFATinAuckland.

“Anyone interested in attending the discussion with New Zealand negotiators, or the session with negotiators from the range of RCEP countries, should register at [RCEP Information Session](https://secure.tcc.co.nz/ei/getdemo.ei?id=1039&s=_6YW0MKVUA) by 10 June,” says Mr McClay.
