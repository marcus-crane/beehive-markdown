Trade Minister Todd McClay and counterparts from six WTO members today released a statement at the OECD Ministerial Conference in Paris welcoming the progress that has been made towards an Environmental Goods Agreement.

The seven members involved are Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and the United States.

“The elimination of tariffs on environmental goods is a real contribution the global trading community can make to protect the environment,” says Mr McClay. 

“We are committed to a high-standard, ambitious agreement that eliminates tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods, will promote economic growth and create green jobs.

“An ambitious Environmental Goods outcome will enable Kiwi businesses and innovators to benefit from improved access to a wide range of international markets for environmental goods. This includes some markets in which New Zealand does not have a free trade agreement.  

“The environmental goods initiative is just one example of the priority this Government places on reducing barriers to exporting, through the Business Growth Agenda,” says Mr McClay.  

The statement calls for a conclusion to the Environmental Goods Agreement ahead of the G20 Summit in China in September. New Zealand along with 16 other WTO members have been negotiating the Environmental Goods Agreement since 2014.
