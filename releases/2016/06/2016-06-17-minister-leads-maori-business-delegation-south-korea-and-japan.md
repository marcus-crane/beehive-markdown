Māori Development and Associate Economic Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is this weekend leading a Māori business delegation on a six-day culture and trade mission to South Korea and Japan. 

It will be New Zealand’s first trade mission to South Korea since a free trade agreement between the two countries entered into force in December 2015.

Mr Flavell says Aotearoa-New Zealand’s $42 billion-Māori economy has huge potential to boost New Zealand’s prosperity, with trade missions playing a big part in unlocking foreign markets.

“This trade mission will help further grow our productive, innovative and internationally connected Māori economy. We led a similar trip to China last year, which was very successful, so it’s good to be extending the initiative to South Korea and Japan,” Mr Flavell says.

“These countries offer large markets with sophisticated consumers who want the sort of products Māori excel at delivering. This includes high-value seafood, honey and bee products, and tourism opportunities.

“While Māori  businesses already have trading links with these countries, this cultural and trade mission is focused on strengthening those ties and initiating new links that put relationships first, before getting down to business.”

The delegation to South Korea and Japan is part of an ongoing Māori trade strategy led by Te Puni Kōkiri to build and strengthen international relationships. The strategy, the Māori-Crown economic growth partnership He kai kei aku ringa, underpins the Minister’s international trade missions and regional economic development initiatives.

The delegation includes 12 Māori business leaders from tourism, fishing, forestry, food and beverage, and nutraceuticals sectors. The group will connect with government and business leaders in Seoul in South Korea, and Tokyo and Hokkaido in Japan.

The mission will conclude with a cultural exchange between Māori and the indigenous Ainu people in Hokkaido. Business delegates representing Māori tourism will be most strongly represented in Hokkaido, where Ainu leaders are eager to discuss with Māori their approaches to indigenous tourism development.

The trade mission runs June 19-26, with the visit to South Korea taking place June 19-21 and Japan June 22-25.
