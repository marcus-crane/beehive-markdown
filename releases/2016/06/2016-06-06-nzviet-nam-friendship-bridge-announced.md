Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has today announced a project to build a New Zealand-Viet Nam friendship bridge in Ho Chi Minh City to symbolise the relationship between the two countries.

The New Zealand-Viet Nam friendship bridge project arose from the celebrations of 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2015.

“It was agreed by representatives of both New Zealand and Viet Nam that we build a structure that represents the strength of the relationship between our two countries,” Mr Joyce says. “It is appropriate to announce the construction of the friendship bridge this week, as we celebrate the new direct air bridge between our two countries.”  

The friendship bridge will be sited at Dien Bien Phu Street – a major arterial route in the city of 10 million people. It will be constructed of New Zealand Glulam, a wood-based product known for its strength, durability and versatility. Glulam is both lighter and stronger than steel.

“It’s fitting that New Zealand radiata pine wood has been chosen to represent the links between our two nations,” says Mr Joyce. “It’s sustainable, economic and strong.”

Viet Nam is New Zealand’s fastest growing export market in Southeast Asia, with merchandise exports doubling since 2007.

The bridge has received approval from the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transportation with support from the Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee.

The New Zealand and Viet Nam partners involved in the design, engineering, timber supply and treatment, construction and installation of the bridge are – Sequal Lumber, Timbalink, PTL Structural Timber Consultants, Vietnam-New Zealand Ltd and Tran Duc Homes.

The project is due to commence later this year and open mid-next year. The announcement of the project by Mr Joyce was part of a series of activities celebrating the first direct Air New Zealand flight between Viet Nam and Auckland.
