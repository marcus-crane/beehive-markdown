Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Norway this weekend to participate in the Oslo Forum, and will then travel to Finland, Latvia and Lithuania.

“The Oslo Forum is an annual meeting focused on conflict mediation and resolution,” Mr McCully says.

“The Forum provides a further opportunity for New Zealand to push for the resolution of key global conflicts, building on our efforts in the UN Security Council, and to reiterate New Zealand’s calls for a greater global focus on conflict prevention.”

During the two-day event, Minister McCully will meet with a number of Foreign Ministers and other participants. Attendees this year include US Secretary of State John Kerry, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini and a number of high level UN representatives and senior conflict mediators from around the globe.

Following the Oslo Forum, Minister McCully will visit Finland, Latvia and Lithuania where he will meet his counterparts and other senior government representatives to discuss regional and global security challenges, as well as a free trade agreement between New Zealand and the EU.
