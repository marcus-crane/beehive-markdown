Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says Labour’s Meka Whaitiri should understand the Local Government Act before leaping in to the Auckland governance debate.

“Ms Whaitiri should read the Act. If she did she would understand the Local Government Commission has statutory responsibility for reorganisation applications. As the Minister of Local Government, I cannot intervene in this process,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Local Government Commission must follow the process outlined in the Local Government Act 2002. This includes how the affected area for a proposal is determined.  I have confidence in the commission to manage the current applications in line with the current law.”

The Commission will also have increased accountability under the reforms.

“The proposed amendments to the Local Government Act under the Better Local Services reforms will give the Commission more flexibility in the future to deal with such applications,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I would invite Ms Whaitiri to come alongside the Government and support the Better Local Services Reforms when the legislation is introduced in the next few weeks. She is highlighting issues that the new legislation will address.”

The reforms will allow the Commission to focus more closely on local issues under the reforms. They also have a number of additional checks and balances for the Local Government Commission.
