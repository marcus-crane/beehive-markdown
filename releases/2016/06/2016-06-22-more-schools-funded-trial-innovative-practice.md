Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that 46 innovative teaching projects involving 114 schools and 6 early childhood education providers have won funding worth a total of around $3.6 million over the next two years.

Ms Parata says the Teacher-Led Innovation Fund supports teams of teachers to develop innovative teaching practice to raise achievement for kids.

“We want to support teachers’ bright ideas that evidence shows are working and can be scaled across the education system. It’s all part of our focus on how we make excellent practice become common practice,” she says.

The successful applicants come from early childhood education providers, primary, intermediate and secondary schools across the country. The projects will begin on 1 July, and include:

- Enhancing quality mathematics using digital technologies for 3-6 year olds
- Innovative ways to reengage disengaged students
- Developing student voice and democracy in a primary school setting
- Supporting new entrants and Year 1 students
- Enhancing home-based learning opportunities for teen parents.

This is the second round of the fund, which is part of the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative aimed at increasing collaboration among teachers and schools to raise achievement for students.

It was originally allocated $10 million over three years but this was increased earlier this year to $18 million over five years due to the popularity of the fund’s ground-up approach.

“The calibre of this year’s applicants was high so we encourage those schools whose applications were unsuccessful, and have received feedback, to re-apply when the next round opens in November,” says Ms Parata.
