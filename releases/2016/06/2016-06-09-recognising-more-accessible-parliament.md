Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner has congratulated the Parliamentary Service on their outstanding work in making Parliament more accessible for disabled people.

“Over the past year, Parliamentary Service has introduced a significant range of additions to the Parliamentary complex to make it easier for disabled people to use the facilities,” Ms Wagner says.

“More than 15 different types of modifications have been completed. These include additional handrails in corridors, talking lifts, more accessible reception counters, tactile floor indicators for Blind and low vision visitors, and improved signage for visibility throughout the precinct.

“It’s fantastic to see these efforts being awarded with a Gold Rating from BeAccessible. The rating recognises an organisation that has achieved excellent levels of accessibility in a number of areas including hearing, mobility and vision.

“The ability for all New Zealanders and visitors to be able to access Parliament is important as it is the epicentre of our democracy. The improvements made to Parliament will make it easier for a wider range of people to visit.

“The Visitor Centre can also arrange New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) interpreters for tours and visitors when provided with advance notice. I encourage more people with disabilities to utilise these modifications to make their visit to Parliament more enjoyable,” Ms Wagner says.
