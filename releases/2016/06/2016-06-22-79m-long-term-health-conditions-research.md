Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the opening of applications for a new $7.9 million research fund to help improve the management of long-term health conditions.

“The Government supports research that leads to improved health outcomes and more effective delivery of healthcare for New Zealanders,” says Mr Joyce.

“We want to maximise these opportunities, as it can also bring economic gains for New Zealand. Commercial health research is also a great opportunity to grow our high value exports.”

The research fund is a joint partnership initiative between the Health Research Council of New Zealand, Ministry of Health, and the Healthier Lives National Science Challenge.

“The management of long-term conditions like diabetes, depression, asthma, cardiovascular disease and arthritis are a major health challenge for New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s estimated that two out of three New Zealand adults have at least one long-term condition. It is our leading cause of preventable death.

“The aim of the research is to improve understanding of long-term conditions, support people to live well with their conditions, and support changes to the delivery of care for these conditions.

“This fund will support the development of effective research-led approaches that can be implemented across the health system to reduce or prevent the impact of long-term health conditions on New Zealanders.”

The Government's ongoing commitment to health research is demonstrated in the Budget 2016 announcement of an extra $97 million over the next four years for the Health Research Council of New Zealand as part of the Innovative New Zealand package.
