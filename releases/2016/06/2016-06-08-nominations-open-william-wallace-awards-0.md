Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says nominations are now open for the 2016 William Wallace Awards, which recognise outstanding young people in care and their achievements.

“Any young person in the care of the state, iwi or child and family services or who has recently come out of care when they turn 17 is eligible to receive an award and can be nominated,” Mrs Tolley says.

“The awards are valued at up to $4,000 and are a significant opportunity for these young people to further their study, develop their leadership abilities, attend an Outward Bound course or complete vocational training.

“The William Wallace Awards are a chance to recognise that these young people have overcome challenges in their lives and have succeeded in spite of the trauma they have experienced.

“We can be very proud of the things young people in care have achieved, and we must continue to support them to realise their potential as they transition to adulthood.

“Children and young people need adults to stand up for them when they are being harmed, but we must also congratulate them when they achieve and encourage them to keep working towards their goals and aspirations. Nominating a young person for these awards can do just that.

“Nominations close on 8 August 2016 and will be considered by a panel made up of representatives from Child, Youth and Family, Barnardos, Open Home Foundation, Fostering Kids New Zealand, as well as corporate sponsors Vodafone, GFS and a previous winner,” Mrs Tolley says.
