Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today announced the appointment of Dr Andrea Grant to the Accreditation Council for a three-year term.

“I am pleased to announce Dr Grant’s appointment to the Council,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Dr Grant is an internationally experienced executive and director in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors and will bring valuable scientific knowledge to the Council’s work,” Mr Goldsmith says.

The Accreditation Council was previously known as the Testing Laboratory Registration Council until October last year, when the Standards and Accreditation Act was passed.

The Council plays a valuable role providing independent accreditation of laboratories, inspection bodies and radiology practices under the International Accreditation New Zealand brand otherwise known as IANZ.

“Consumers can have confidence in the services and products provided by an organisation with IANZ accreditation,” Mr Goldsmith says.
