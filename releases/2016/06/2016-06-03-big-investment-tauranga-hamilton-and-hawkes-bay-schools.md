Around $53.5 million will be invested in school property in Tauranga, Hamilton and Hawke’s Bay as part of Budget 2016, say Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

Minister Parata made the announcement at Welcome Bay School in Tauranga today.

The investment includes:

- In Tauranga:
  
  - $18 million for a new school in the Pyes Pa area (planned roll of 650)
  - $2.5 million for six roll growth classrooms – two each at Oropi School, Welcome Bay School and Maungatapu School
- In Hamilton:
  
  - Around $25 million for Sylvester Primary School, to be built under a public private partnership (planned roll of 700)
  - $4 million to expand Endeavour Primary School to cater for a roll of 600 (up from 400 currently)
- In Hawke’s Bay:
  
  - $4 million for eight new classrooms. This will include four new classrooms at Havelock North Primary School and two new classrooms each for Te Mata School and Lucknow School.

“This is a significant investment which will ensure local schools can accommodate growth and provide students with learning environments that enable them to achieve to the best of their potential,” says Ms Parata.

“As with other parts of New Zealand, Tauranga, Hamilton and Hawke’s Bay are all experiencing population growth.

“With that population growth comes increases in school rolls, so this investment is about staying ahead of schools’ need for more quality learning spaces.”

Ms Kaye says today’s announcement follows recent school expansions and new schools to address local population growth.

“In Hamilton, we’ve seen the building of new schools such as Endeavour School, Rototuna Junior High School and Rototuna Senior High School.

“In Bay of Plenty, Papamoa College and Golden Sands School have undergone significant expansions to enable them to accommodate more students.

“In Tauranga, we’ve seen Otumoetai School, Bellevue School, Bethlehem School, Te Wharekura o Mauao and Brookfield School all get new classrooms, and schools such as Pillans Point School are also on-track for additional classrooms.

“Today’s announcement reflects a continued commitment to regions right across New Zealand. We know there’s growth happening in places such as Tauranga, and we’re investing to ensure these places have the capacity and facilities needed to deliver a quality education.

“In the last week alone we’ve announced around half a billion dollars of investments in Wellington, Canterbury, Auckland, Northland and now Tauranga, Hamilton and Hawke’s Bay.

“Budget 2016 is about ensuring that towns and cities have good quality school infrastructure, and parents have access to local schools.”

- The cost to build a new school classroom is typically in the range of $300,000 to $400,000
- To ensure we get better value for money, the Government has considered different procurement methods to deliver schools, which is why some schools will be built under a PPP
