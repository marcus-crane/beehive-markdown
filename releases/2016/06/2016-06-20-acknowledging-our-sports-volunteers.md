Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says it is important to recognise the role of sports volunteers as part of celebrating National Volunteer Week (which runs from 19 June to 25 June 2016).

“Sport NZ’s Active NZ Survey recorded that almost one million adults volunteered at least once over the previous year,” says Dr Coleman.

“This is 67.7 million hours of volunteered time over 12 months which makes sure sport and recreation happens in communities all over the country.

“National Volunteer week is a great opportunity to consider how we can contribute to the sport sector through volunteering our time.

“Volunteers – coaches, umpires, referees, the people who wash the uniforms, transport players and clean the clubrooms – are the lifeblood of sport in New Zealand.”

Volunteers also have a key role to play in the success of our major sporting events. New Zealand will be hosting the World Masters Games in April 2017 and this event will attract 25,000 athletes from over 100 countries.

“This is a great opportunity to get involved as a volunteer if you are in the Auckland or Waikato region. The World Masters Games are looking for volunteers in a range of positions to help us host the world’s largest multi-sporting event,” says Dr Coleman.
