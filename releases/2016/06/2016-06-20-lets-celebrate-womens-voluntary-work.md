We must celebrate and cherish the women who devote their time and energy to voluntary work, says Hon Louise Upston, Minister for Women.

“Women are often the first to volunteer in a range of areas, sharing their experience and providing essential services,” she said.

“These women rarely seek the spotlight, yet the work they do has a positive impact on our communities. We need to give them the recognition they deserve.”

Ms Upston made the comments in recognition of National Volunteer Week.

She said National Volunteer Week was the perfect opportunity to highlight the value of voluntary work.

“Volunteering brings many benefits, both to the wider community as a whole and to the individual.

“Working with other volunteers is a good way to share and develop your existing skills, as well as learn new ones.”

Ms Upston said volunteers set a great example to children and young people.

“Volunteering brings together people of all ages and from all walks of life, united by a common purpose. It’s important for the next generation to see that kind of empathy and drive in action.”
