Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes Pharmac’s decision to fund six new treatments which will give New Zealanders access to new medicines. 

“Budget 2016 invests an extra $124 million over four years to enable Pharmac to provide increased access to new medicines,” says Dr Coleman.

“As a result of the Government’s increased funding, Pharmac has announced its approval of the first package of new treatments which will benefit over 40,000 New Zealanders.

“This includes an advanced melanoma treatment, Opdivo, which could benefit around 360 people each year, Temozolomide for brain tumours, Oestradiol patches for menopausal women, and Rituximab for nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder, in children.

“Pharmac is also funding two new hepatitis C treatments, Harvoni and Viekira Pak, which are a major advancement in treatment with cure rates of more than 90 per cent. Around 50,000 New Zealanders are affected by hepatitis C, and many patients progress to liver cancer and liver failure.

“These new treatments will make a considerable difference to the lives of many New Zealanders and their families.

“These funding decisions show Pharmac is continuing to provide New Zealanders with early access to new innovative medicines. Pharmac also continues to work closely with the sector which has played an important role in shaping these decisions.”

Pharmac’s budget for 2016/17 is a record $850 million. On top of the Government’s extra $39 million for 2016/17, $11 million will also be injected from DHBs. The Government has increased Pharmac’s budget by $200 million since 2008.

Last year over 70,000 New Zealanders benefited from 41 new and widened access medicines. Around 3.5 million New Zealanders received a funded medicine in 2014/15 – 100,000 more than the previous year.
