Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says he can confirm reports of an explosion this evening close to Camp Taji in northern Baghdad where 106 NZ Defence Force personnel are currently deployed.

“Open source reporting suggests the blast resulted in a number of casualties, however all New Zealand personnel at Taji are safe,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Reports from Taji are that at 5.58pm New Zealand time a car bomb was detonated close to a checkpoint outside the south-western secure perimeter of the camp.

“It is estimated the blast occurred between two and three kilometres from where New Zealand and Australian troops are accommodated.

“Appropriate security measures are in place at Taji to protect our soldiers from a range of risks, and these are constantly reviewed and updated to reflect the threat environment.

“Our troops know they are in a volatile place, but they are inside a well-secured perimeter at Taji, and they take the steps necessary to ensure they can safely continue to train the Iraqi Security Forces to rid Iraq of D’aesh,” Mr Brownlee says.
