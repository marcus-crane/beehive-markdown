Associate Health Minister, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the government has today taken another step to save lives by reducing the harm caused by tobacco in New Zealand.

The Smoke-free Environments (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Amendment Bill passed its second reading this afternoon.

“Standardised packaging will make a measureable difference to smoking rates in New Zealand, just as it has done in Australia. There is now strong evidence that standardised packs reduce the appeal of tobacco products and discourage people from smoking,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Standardising packs will maximise the impact of health warnings and cut out any false impression that smoking is cool or glamorous, or that some cigarettes are less harmful than others,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Under standardised packaging all cigarettes and other tobacco products will be in brown/green coloured packaging, with enlarged health warnings and tobacco company marketing imagery removed.

“Tobacco products prematurely kill 4,500 to 5,000 New Zealanders every year. We want to stop New Zealanders from smoking and we are going to take every practical step to achieve that,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“ Draft regulations on are now out for consultation and the Government will consider all submissions before making the final decisions on how and when it will be implemented.”
