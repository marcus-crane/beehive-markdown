Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today announced the approval of a number of changes to the financial markets conduct regime following industry feedback.

“These small changes will further improve the regime and provide clarity to industry participants as they transition to the new regime,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“The Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and associated regulations came into effect on 1 December 2014 and industry participants were given a two year transition period to become fully compliant and licensed.

“As industry participants such as banks and fund managers are preparing their businesses for the 1 December 2016 deadline they have identified some technical issues with how the regime works in practice in different circumstances.

“We are responding to this feedback by making a number of small and technical amendments to improve the laws,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The key changes are:

- supporting the professional management of workplace savings schemes whilst maintaining appropriate controls on related-party investments;
- enabling the transition of superannuation schemes that were closed to new members prior to 1997;
- continuing the ‘category 2’ classification of bank notice products, meaning comparatively lower regulatory obligations for these relatively simple bank products.

“Industry input is invaluable and I hope to see this consultative approach continue as we develop a fit-for-purpose system with clear, predictable rules that help investors make confident decisions,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Act aims to improve the quality of disclosure to investors, strengthen the governance of financial products and enable more innovative and flexible methods of raising capital.

“We will continue to monitor these regulatory reforms which are an important part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to build confidence in our financial markets, allowing firms to raise capital efficiently to grow their business and our economy,” says Mr Goldsmith.
