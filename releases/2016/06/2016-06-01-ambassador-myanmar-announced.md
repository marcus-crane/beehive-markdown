Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced Steve Marshall as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Myanmar.

“New Zealand’s engagement with Myanmar has expanded significantly since the country embarked on its political and economic reform process in 2011,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand continues to support Myanmar’s transition to democracy and we upgraded our resident Embassy Office in Myanmar to a full Embassy in 2014.

“Mr Marshall brings a unique mix of skills and experience to the role and in addition to being charged with further developing the relationship between our two countries, he will also be responsible for our growing aid programme in Myanmar, which is focused on agriculture and skills development,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Marshall was previously employed with the International Labour Organisation in Myanmar for eight years, and is a former CEO of the New Zealand Employers’ Federation.
