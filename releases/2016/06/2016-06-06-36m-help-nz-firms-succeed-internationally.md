An extra $3.6 million over four years has been allocated in Budget 2016 for the New Zealand Story – the initiative that builds New Zealand’s profile internationally to benefit our exporters.

The New Zealand Story provides a marketing toolkit used by thousands of companies across all of New Zealand’s export sectors to promote themselves and the New Zealand brand internationally.

“New Zealand is a small economic player, so it’s important that we take every opportunity when we’re overseas to work together and tell people what’s unique about us as a country and what we bring to the world,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“The New Zealand Story helps companies of all types tell a consistent message about New Zealand’s commitment to high quality and fresh thinking that builds our brand in cities as diverse as Singapore, Shanghai and Houston.”

Minister Joyce announced the additional funding while on a visit to Viet Nam and Singapore promoting New Zealand trade, tourism, and international education.

“This visit to Ho Chi Minh City underlines the size of the challenge of growing and maintaining the awareness of New Zealand not just here, but in hundreds of key cities across the Asia-Pacific region and the wider world,” Mr Joyce says.

“We’ve demonstrated on this visit, with the help of the New Zealand Story, that we can successfully combine the promotion of New Zealand food, education, tourism and the hi-tech sector into a single compelling brand story about our country that appeals to Asian consumers. That means more sales, and more jobs for kiwis back home.”

New Zealand Story was launched in 2013 as part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda and will contribute to the goal of increasing export earnings from 30 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent of GDP by 2025.

The additional funding for New Zealand Story will help lead the shift in perception needed in key target markets, and engage targeted international buyers and influencers. It will also enable regional partners to support exporters to tell their own versions of the New Zealand Story.

“We have to work hard to differentiate ourselves against other nations to be visible and competitive. The New Zealand Story helps get more cut through with markets, influencers and buyers of New Zealand goods and services,” Mr Joyce says.
