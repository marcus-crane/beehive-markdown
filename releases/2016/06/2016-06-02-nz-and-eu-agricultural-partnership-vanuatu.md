Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced a new partnership between the European Union, New Zealand and the Government of Vanuatu, aimed supporting sustainable agricultural development.

“New Zealand and the EU have a strong track record of working together with Pacific Governments to deliver development gains,” Mr McCully says.

“The Partnership we have entered into today will see the EU and New Zealand providing support to Vanuatu’s agricultural sector, and it is a model for further cooperation between the EU and New Zealand in the region.

“Our joint agriculture support to Vanuatu aims to boost productivity and returns producers and agribusinesses. Our initial focus will be on the beef industry, where New Zealand has world leading experience to share with local farmers.

“Until now, cooperation between the EU and New Zealand in the Pacific has focused on renewable energy, and while this will continue, the agreement entered into today provides a framework for extending our development work into other sectors,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully and the European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica are currently in Vanuatu as part of the 2016 NZ EU Pacific Partnership Mission.
