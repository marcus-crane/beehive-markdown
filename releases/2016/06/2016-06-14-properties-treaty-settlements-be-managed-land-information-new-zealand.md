Taxpayers will reap the benefits of new arrangements for managing properties earmarked for future Treaty settlements.

The Office of Treaty Settlements (OTS) Landbank is made up of about 950 properties, and these will be managed by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) from 1 July 2016.

Land Information Minister Louise Upston said LINZ are expert in dealing with Crown property, and have the people, systems and processes needed to make sure the Landbank properties continue to be well looked after for iwi.”

“LINZ’s Crown Property Centre of Expertise (CPCoE) has a proven track record in managing large and complex Crown property portfolios, and it has established relationships with property contractors.”

“CPCoE will continue to manage the Landbank according to the interests of iwi and be able to take advantage of economies of scale in dealing with the Landbank to reduce management and maintenance costs for the taxpayer.”

CPCoE currently manages about 15,000 properties, made up of those owned by LINZ and those managed on behalf of other Crown agencies.

Ms Upston said the Landbank transfer was the latest of a series of similar transfers in recent years.

“In December, LINZ took over responsibility for Crown-owned properties in Christchurch’s flat land and Port Hills residential red zones, and the department has made excellent progress clearing and managing those properties over the last few months.

“LINZ also manages a major portfolio of Ministry of Education teacher houses, and looks after the disposal of surplus MoE properties.”
