Justice Minister Amy Adams says a funding boost of almost $300,000 a year will help the Independent Police Conduct Authority to better address complaints as it faces an increased workload.

“The $1.2 million funding over the next four years will ensure the IPCA can successfully deal with the caseload of complaints which have been growing steadily in recent years,” Ms Adams says.

More than 2500 complaints were received in 2014/15 – an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year.

“It’s vital that the public and victims can have trust and confidence in the actions of Police, and the IPCA is critical in building and supporting that public trust,” Ms Adams says.

“The funding will enable the IPCA to undertake more preventive work with Police, in particular by reviewing policies that it finds to be deficient.

“In addition, our injection of $1.2 million will help the IPCA fulfil its statutory obligations as the monitor of places of detention under the Crimes of Torture Act – ensuring Police cells comply with National Standards, conducting random cell audits, and follow-up checks.”

This investment takes the IPCA funding to a total of $4.1 million every year for the next four years.
