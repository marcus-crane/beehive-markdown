The Government welcomes the Green Party’s interest in cleaning up New Zealand’s lakes and rivers and the goal of ensuring all New Zealanders have access to swimmable water, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Our Government has done more than any in our history to improve water quality of our lakes and rivers. We introduced the first National Policy Statement on Fresh Water in 2011 and the standards framework in 2014. We have ramped up investment in river and lake clean-up from the $29 million spent between 2000 and 2008, under the Labour government, to $115 million between 2008 and 2015 and committed a further $100 million in Budget 2016.

“We are currently consulting on new national rules on fencing to keep stock out of rivers and lakes and on tighter new standards, including swimmability.

“The Greens have come late to initiatives to clean up rivers such as the Waikato and the Manawatu. The Waikato clean-up plan from Lake Taupo to Port Waikato, with local iwi, was implemented in 2010 and the Government has committed $250 million to this 35-year plan. The Manawatu clean-up was agreed in 2011 and has received more than $5 million in Government funding, including for recently opened sewage treatment schemes.

“It is ill-informed for the Greens to blame the current Government for New Zealand’s water quality issues when all the science shows these issues go back many decades. The irony is that there was a faster rate of dairy conversions and intensification during the last Labour government, supported by the Greens, than under the current Government.

“Many of our rivers and lakes have nutrient run-off cycles of many decades and it will take a similar period for the limits National has put in the place, and the clean-ups, to deliver the required improvements in river quality. National has also passed the new Environment Reporting Act, which will require transparent, independent nationwide reporting on water quality, with the first report due next autumn.

“The Greens proposal for a blanket, nationwide moratorium on any dairy conversion is a blunt approach that will punish regions where a moratorium is unnecessary. The more sophisticated approach, where limits are set on nutrients, addresses the environmental issue without blocking growth in exports and jobs. Dairy conversions are, under this Government, being declined for the first time in areas such as Southland and Canterbury, where they would exceed the newly established limits on nutrients.

“The Government also disagrees with a ban on new water storage and irrigation schemes. It is scientifically wrong to claim that these schemes will automatically cause a decline in water quality. Well-designed schemes are able to deliver improvements in water quality, as well as increases in exports and jobs.

“We welcome the Greens renewed interest in fresh water quality issues. It is one of the Government’s top environmental priorities. We are continuing to make improvements, and toughen the national standards. The strength of the Government’s approach is that our policies are science based, practical and committed to solutions which will minimise adverse impacts on jobs and economy,” Dr Smith concluded.
