Pacific People’s Minister, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, has welcomed the inaugural fono for Pacific social services workers and church leaders and is urging them to work with the government to tackle the problem of family violence in the Pacific community.

“The Government is making fundamental changes to the way agencies respond to the needs of our most vulnerable people.  But we cannot do it alone.  Community and church leaders need to step up so we can all work together to tackle this,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

As at the end of March this year, Pacific children and young people made up 7.2% of those in Child, Youth and Family care.

“Pacific children are over represented in the statistics for physical, sexual and emotional abuse. The statistics are shocking.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“We should all be working together to ensure that a Pacific child born today is a well-loved, healthy child given the best opportunity to succeed.  All of our young people must be able to share and prosper in this beautiful country we have made our home.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the Government has announced major initiatives to change the way it responds to family violence and provide help for vulnerable children.

“The Government has announced a new operating model for the care and protection of children and young people. It will have a cross-agency, child-centred focus.”

“Specialist services such as counselling, trauma, psychology, education and health support will be available for children when they are needed,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“There have been serious and candid conversations at this fono in Auckland.  I have challenged those attending the conference to take action to address the issues of domestic violence and family abuse.” 

“I will work closely with them to address family violence issues in our Pacific communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
