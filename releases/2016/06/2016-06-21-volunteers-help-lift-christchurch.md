Associate Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner has praised the many volunteers who have helped greater Christchurch make such big strides in its recovery and regeneration.

“National Volunteer Week is a chance to acknowledge the tremendous effort volunteers have put into helping others through difficult times in Canterbury over the last few years, and the time they continue to give selflessly,” Mrs Wagner says.

“From shovelling silt on the streets and peoples’ properties in those early days of the emergency response, to the ongoing events and support today to lift communities hardest hit by the earthquakes, the volunteer spirit is alive and well in Christchurch.

“The Student Volunteer Army has had the biggest profile and it has set a fantastic example in the work it does, but equally there are thousands of individuals who have given their time and effort to helping others in this post-earthquake period without any recognition. To those people, I say thank you.”

“There is still plenty to be done in the new phase of regeneration in Christchurch and everyone can play a part.

“People who do regular volunteer work know are personal rewards from volunteering such as the positive feelings from helping others and the friendships made along the way. It’s an important part of what makes our communities tick,” Ms Wagner says.

*The theme of National Volunteer Week 2016 is “Thanks for making time”. It runs from 19 to 25 June.*
