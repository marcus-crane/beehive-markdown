Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today departs to the United States to support New Zealand’s candidate for election to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, engage with international experts on the employment of disabled people, and discuss emerging international border security trends with Homeland Security.

“I am excited to lead the delegation in support of Robert Martin for his UN election bid. He is an outstanding candidate who has demonstrated a strong commitment to the rights of people with a learning disability worldwide.” Ms Wagner says.

While in New York, Ms Wagner will meet with a range of organisations and institutions promoting and developing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. 

“It is important that we look at international best case practices for innovative ideas that we could use to better help disabled people in New Zealand. Providing work opportunities for disabled people is one of the best ways of empowering them,” says Ms Wagner.

Ms Wagner will also travel to San Francisco to discuss employment initiatives for people with disabilities being delivered by IBM and visit Homeland Security Investigations to discuss emerging international border security trends.

In her capacity as Associate Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration, Ms Wagner will meet the US Federal Emergency Management Agency to discuss their disaster response work and as Associate Conservation Minster, will visit the team at the Golden Gate National Park to be briefed on their new Tunnel Top Parklands project.
