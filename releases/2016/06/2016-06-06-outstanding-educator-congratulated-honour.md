Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated outstanding educator Karen Sewell on being made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List.

“Dame Karen has played a pivotal role in the education of generations of New Zealanders,” Ms Parata says. “The honour is richly deserved.

“She is the only person to have headed the Education Ministry, the Education Review Office and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. She is currently the chair of Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu Correspondence Board, served on numerous other education bodies and led the implementation of National Standards, a new national curriculum, and Youth Guarantee.”

In total, 16 people have been honoured for services to early childhood, primary and secondary education in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours.
