Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new six step process will help guide health professionals confronted with suspected family violence cases.

“Abuse of any kind is not okay. We know that being a victim or witnessing abuse can be linked to serious health problems,” says Dr Coleman.

“Our dedicated health workforce are often on the frontline dealing with family violence. It’s important that there is a standardised approach across hospital settings to ensure families get the support they need when they need it.

“The updated guideline is based on agreed expert opinion, research and clinical experience.”

The six step process includes the identification of actual or suspected abuse, validation and support, health and risk assessment, safety planning, referral and follow up, and documentation.

It builds on the Violence Intervention Programme which is run in DHBs across the country. The programme is a key part of a whole of Government approach to addressing family violence and protecting vulnerable children.

The health sector works closely with social sector agencies. At the end of June 2015 there were over 12,100 notifications of concern from the health sector to Child, Youth and Family.

The new process is outlined in the updated ‘Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guideline – child abuse and intimate partner violence’. A copy is available on the Ministry of Health website, [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz).
