Top culinary students from New Zealand and Viet Nam have taken part in a unique culinary competition in Ho Chi Minh City to boost education ties between the two countries.

The students were brought together for two months to develop a three course menu which showcases the best of New Zealand and Vietnamese cuisine, techniques and ingredients. Their dishes were put to the taste test at a gala dinner for 150 guests including the New Zealand Ambassador to Viet Nam Haike Manning and top chefs from both countries. 

“Collaborative ventures between our two countries provide students with the opportunity to learn a huge amount about each other’s cultures, form lasting bonds, and develop knowledge that can be applied to our growing trade, investment and education links with Viet Nam in future years,” says Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce. 

“The New Zealand/Viet Nam education relationship is of growing importance, with both countries last year signing a strategic plan identifying practical initiatives and partnerships between education institutions to further deepen the level of engagement,” Mr Joyce says.

Viet Nam is the second largest group of international students studying in New Zealand from the ASEAN region. The latest figures show more than 2,000 Vietnamese students are studying in New Zealand each year.

“Education is a top priority for both Viet Nam and New Zealand. With 60 per cent of Viet Nam’s population under 30 years old the Viet Nam government is very focused on improving education standards so that students can play a central role in Viet Nam’s development.

“New Zealand’s high quality education system and expertise in vocational training make us well placed to deliver more joint education initiatives focused on building skills for the Vietnamese workforce and attracting more Vietnamese students to study in New Zealand,” says Mr Joyce.
