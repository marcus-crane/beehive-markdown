Trade Minister Todd McClay has invited the Aotearoa Youth Leadership Institute (AYLI) to regularly meet with him, as part of his commitment for more engagement on trade.

Minister McClay today met with representatives from the AYLI at the OECD annual Meeting of Council at Ministerial level (MCM) and Forum, in Paris.

“I was impressed by the commitment and calibre of the delegation, and have offered AYLI representatives regular meetings to continue discussions on important trade issues”, says Mr McClay.

“We exchanged views on the MCM, as well as the diversification of New Zealand’s economy, Free Trade Agreements, and how we ensure sustainability with trade. 

“I am committed to discussing our trade strategy with stakeholders, including youth. I am eager for everyone to have an opportunity to learn more about trade and the significant benefits for the economy and public through free trade.”

The AYLI participate in global youth delegations, including sending a delegation of nine representatives to the OECD Forum. The delegation comprised of Swan-Lynn Lee, April Kwak, Carolle Varughese, Sam Morton, Sam Yoon, Zabin Farishta, Joanna Ji, Max Beech and Anna Goble. They represent Auckland, Invercargill, Hawkes Bay, Otago and Wellington. More information can be found at: [www.ayli.org.nz](http://www.ayli.org.nz).
