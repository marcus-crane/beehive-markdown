Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata have today announced the launch of ‘FindMyPath’, a new website to help young people explore qualification pathways and figure out what they should study to achieve their career goals.

“New Zealand is quickly developing a more highly-skilled high-tech economy,” Mr Joyce says. “It is now more important than ever for young people to consider carefully their tertiary study, including industry training and full-time study options, with future career options in mind. FindMyPath clearly shows students what they can study and how, and the jobs that study leads to.”

“There are hundreds of study and job choices and deciding which way to go can be very confusing. FindMyPath clearly shows young people what they could do if they are interested in further study or careers in particular areas. This website gives young people a range of ideas and options to explore. It shows there isn’t just one pathway to a career. Students can decide what path to take to meet their goals.”

Ms Parata says the website helps students stay engaged at school because they can see the point of what they’re learning and where it could lead to.

“We already have the Vocational Pathways profile builder, which helps students doing NCEA see what learning to pursue so their school achievement is valued in the world of work. FindMyPath builds on that by highlighting the Level 3 to 7 qualifications that are valued by different industries. It shows young people how to pursue particular pathways and where those pathways can take them,” says Ms Parata.

“More young New Zealanders than ever before are achieving NCEA Level 2 and gaining a foundation for continuing success. It’s important they have a clear direction from this to further study, training and employment where there’s industry demand. FindMyPath will support students to think about their tertiary education and future employment earlier and ensure their study options match their aspirations.”

FindMyPath is one of a range of tools available to school and tertiary students, including Vocational Pathways Profile Builder, Occupation Outlook, and the Careers New Zealand website.

These tools will become part of a consolidated suite of advice following the planned merger of Careers New Zealand with the Tertiary Education Commission.
