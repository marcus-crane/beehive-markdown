Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett has returned from a trip to the Pacific where she saw first-hand how communities are working to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to big weather events and King tides.

Mrs Bennett travelled to Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, and Tuvalu last week. While in those countries she met climate change ministers and officials and reinforced New Zealand’s commitment to providing climate-related support to the region.

Mrs Bennett also visited some New Zealand-backed projects being undertaken to mitigate current and future climate change effects.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under Ministry Murray McCully, has already done a lot. I was very impressed with the many initiatives that we have instigated, including building water tanks, sea walls, toilet and shower blocks, and improved rubbish collection systems,” Mrs Bennett says.

“New Zealand is providing in excess of $200 million over the next four years for climate-related support, most of which will benefit the Pacific. We are focusing our efforts on projects to bring more renewable energy to the region, which is good for the environment and helps isolated communities become more self-sufficient.

“Ultimately, the residents I spoke to said they do not want to leave their homes, which is why New Zealand is committed to working alongside impacted communities to make them more resilient and sustainable.”
