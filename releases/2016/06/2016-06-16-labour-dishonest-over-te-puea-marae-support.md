Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says Labour Party attacks about the Government not doing enough to support Te Puea Marae are unfounded and dishonest.

“Te Puni Kōkiri has been there since the first week, ensuring the marae has what it needs to provide support to homeless whānau.

“Within days of the marae opening its doors, Te Puni Kōkiri was available to provide practical support and assistance,” says Mr Flavell.

“That support ranges from offering $10,000 koha in the first week to providing a marquee this week to use as a food hall. Te Puni Kōkiri will also pay for the additional costs incurred by the Māori Wardens as a result of the integral role they are playing in the daily operations of the marae.

“We also have dedicated Te Puni Kōkiri staff working with other government agencies and Whānau Ora providers to ensure whānau are accessing all the support available to them.”

Mr Flavell is proud of the work and support provided by Te Puni Kōkiri staff.

“They’ve done this work behind the scenes, rather than in front of the media. I have instructed the ministry to focus on the needs of the whānau and providing what practical assistance they can to Te Puea Memorial Marae Manaaki Tangata.

“As the Whānau Ora Minister, I am also pleased to see all whānau at the marae being offered Whānau Ora support. Providers such as Manukau Urban Māori Authority (MUMA) Mahi, a Te Puni Kōkiri funded initiative, have stepped in as well to place whānau members into jobs.

“There is a long-term requirement for more low cost, healthy housing but the immediate focus needs to be on supporting homeless whānau who are otherwise facing a bleak winter. I will do everything I can to support Te Puea Marae and the whānau seeking emergency accommodation.”
