Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced funding totalling $150,000 to support increased involvement of up to 350 young people in civil defence and emergency services in New Zealand.

Minister Kaye made the announcement at the two-day National Emergency Management Conference being held at Te Papa, Wellington.

“I am allocating $50,000 to establish the Youth in Civil Defence Fund. I expect this to fund a diverse range of youth-led initiatives, from volunteering opportunities to public education and public preparedness campaigns,” says Ms Kaye.

“Regional civil defence groups, in collaboration with young people, will be invited to submit applications for funding, based on ideas they come up with on exciting and innovative ways to get young people involved in civil defence and emergency management.

“We need to think differently about how we engage young New Zealanders in this area, because we need young people to be better prepared and more resilient. 

“This is an opportunity to come up with new ways on how we reach young people, and I look forward to seeing the ideas that come forward.”

A panel of young people and representatives of the Ministry of Youth Development (MYD) and Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) will consider applications to the Youth in Civil Defence Fund.

“Alongside this new fund, I am confirming further funding of $100,000 to support the Youth In Emergency Services (YES) programme over the next 12 months.

“This is an exciting programme that opens the door for young people to volunteer for and potentially follow a career path with emergency services, such as fire, ambulance, Coastguard and search and rescue.

“Over the last three years I have funded 25 communities across New Zealand, from Kaikohe to Alexandra, to deliver the YES programme.

“The latest funding will support at least 10 more communities to deliver this programme in partnership with their local emergency services and youth volunteers.

“I have seen first-hand the pride that young people gain by serving their community and acquiring valuable skills through the YES programme. At the same time, it can be a real boost for communities where it can be a struggle to find emergency services volunteers.

“The funding I’ve announced today will help build the knowledge and skills of our young people to contribute to both emergency preparedness and response in New Zealand. This will pay dividends not only for the individuals involved but also our wider society.”

**Notes**

**350 new opportunities**

The 350 opportunities created by today’s announcement will be made up of:

- 150 places in the YES programme (10 programmes with 15 young people on each)
- 200 opportunities via the Youth in Civil Defence Fund

**More about the Youth in Emergency Services (YES) programme**

- The programme runs during evenings and weekends over four to six weeks, usually beginning in late summer
- Everyone taking part has the opportunity to rotate around the different emergency services
- The final weekend involves a coordinated exercise involving all the emergency services, so participants can put all the skills and knowledge they’ve learned to the test in a real-life scenario
- MYD and MCDEM will work together to receive applications from communities interested in being part of the YES programme under the latest funding announced today
