Health Minister Jonathan Coleman attended today’s opening of the new Sky Bridge at North Shore Hospital which will enable Waitemata DHB to perform more elective surgeries.

“The new $5.5 million Sky Bridge at North Shore Hospital links the Elective Surgery Centre with the main hospital building including the High Dependency and Intensive Care Units,” says Dr Coleman.

“This will enable Waitemata DHB to perform more complex surgeries as well as increase the volume of elective surgeries. More importantly, it will provide a better integrated experience for patients as they will be transferred faster.

“In the last financial year around 18,000 Waitemata patients received elective surgery compared to 11,000 in 2007/2008 - a 61 per cent increase.”

The Sky Bridge is one of several projects in Waitemata DHB’s 10-year plan to ensure they meet the needs of the local community in the future:

- He Puna Wāiora – a new 46-bed mental health services inpatient unit.
- Hine Ora – a dedicated 15-bed women’s health ward.
- Expansion of Waitakere Hospital’s ED which will see it almost double in size – due for completion in August 2016.
- Expansion of outpatient services at North Shore Hospital is underway.
- Expansion of North Shore Hospital’s short stay ward and inpatient cardiology procedures expected to begin in 2017.

Waitemata DHB is receiving an extra $51 million in new money this year, taking the DHB’s total funding to $1.5 billion for 2016/17. That’s an extra $409 million in funding over the last eight years.
