Transport Minister Simon Bridges today marked the completion of New Plymouth’s $24 million Vickers to City upgrade project.

Under the project, 2.8km of State Highway 3 to the north of New Plymouth’s CBD was upgraded to include two lanes in each direction and two new bridges at Te Henui and Waiwhakaiho. It also includes safer and more efficient intersections, and better facilities for walking and cycling.

“Previously there were a number of problems with this stretch of road which was near capacity and caused undue delays and frustration for both commuters and freight transporters. With this upgrade, road users now have a safer, more efficient route both in and out of New Plymouth,” Mr Bridges says.

“This is an important development for New Plymouth that will help to support future economic growth and the ongoing land development at Bell Block and Waiwhakaiho.

“Local businesses will benefit as a consequence of easier movement of goods and services around the region.  With Port Taranaki a key local driver of growth and productivity, easier freight movement from and around the Port will be particularly beneficial.”

Mr Bridges says this upgrade is part of the Government ongoing commitment to support economic development in Taranaki.

“The Government has previously announced the $11 million realignment at Normanby which is due for completion late this year, and up to $105 million for upgrades at Mt Messenger and Awakino, including two bypasses and associated safety improvements, which is anticipated to start construction in 2017. 

“These projects are part of the Accelerated Regional Roading Package, a Government initiative to speed up projects important to regions.”
