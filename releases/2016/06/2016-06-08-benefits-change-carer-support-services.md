Around 20,000 disabled people and their family carers living in the community will benefit from two national services formally launched today by Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

Carer Matching and Care Matters are two new national disability support services developed out of the NZ Carers’ Strategy Action Plan.

"The Carer Matching service makes it easier for carers to locate the right person at the right time to fill in for them while they take a break,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Online tools and a free phone service help find relief carers close to disabled people’s homes. Relief carers can be identified using both the carer and the disabled person's needs and preferences.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the use of online matching, provided by Carers NZ’s partner MyCare, gives people greater choice and control over how and when their support is provided.

"This new technology means people needing relief carers can access a pool of people local to them, and at their own pace. In its first five months, the Service helped 502 carers find relief support."

"Carers can access resources such as advice on managing conflict and stress; information on how they can connect with other carers; and find available courses. These tools help them look after themselves, while they are busy looking after others,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
