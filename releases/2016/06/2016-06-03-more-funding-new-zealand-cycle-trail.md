The Government is investing more than $1.2 million in seven new projects for the upkeep and maintenance of the New Zealand Cycle Trail, Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key announced today.

The investment comes from the fourth round of the Maintaining the Quality of the Great Rides Fund and priority has been given to proposals that aim to improve safety and quality of the Great Rides – the premier rides of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“The Great Rides are used by thousands of people every day and have provided a significant boost to New Zealand tourism,” Mr Key says. “This funding will help ensure visitors can continue soaking up New Zealand’s beautiful scenery in a safe and enjoyable way.

“The use of the cycle trails by international and domestic visitors has seen significant growth with the Great Rides attracting more than one million users in 2015. Regional communities are also seeing increased numbers of visitors, with local economies experiencing positive spinoffs such as a growth in jobs.

“In 2014, the Government set aside $8 million over four years to ensure the Great Rides are maintained to their current world-class standards. To date, $3.2 million has been allocated to 37 projects across 18 Great Rides.”

The seven projects to receive funding in this funding round are:

- Whanganui District Council: Mountains to Sea (Manawatu-Wanganui)  $300,000
- Tourism Waitaki: Alps 2 Ocean (Otago) $106,250
- Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust: Old Ghost Road (West Coast) $49,818
- Central Otago Clutha Trails Trust: Roxburgh Gorge and Clutha Gold Trails (Otago) $62,065
- Queenstown Trails Trust: Queenstown Trails (Otago) $300,000
- Tasman District Council: Tasman Great Taste Trail (Tasman) – two grants of $223,481 and $168,210

Funding for these seven projects is in addition to the Budget 2016 announcement of government funding for a further $25 million over four years to extend and link different sections of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.
