A Northland family in need is about to get their own home as the third house built by Northland prisoners was lifted over the wire today, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

“Prisoners built the house in partnership with Habitat for Humanity and today it will be transported to Whangarei so a family in need can move in.

“Building this house provided a great opportunity for prisoners to learn skills for future employment. This includes practical experience such as gibbing walls, using power tools correctly, and complying with health and safety regulations.

“Working on a real project prepares them for a career in construction, while also helping a Northland family in need. Supporting prisoners into stable employment is key to improving the lives not only of offenders, but also of their families and the community,” Ms Collins says.

The construction of the house started in May 2015 and the ten prisoners who built the house all participated in the prison’s carpentry programme. They are working towards completing their level 3 certificate in Building Construction and Allied Trade Skills through Weltec.

The prisoners completed all the construction work, and private contractors will install the plumbing and electrical services.

Habitat for Humanity builds and renovates homes for people in housing need in New Zealand and around the world. This is the forty-first home Habitat has built in Northland.
