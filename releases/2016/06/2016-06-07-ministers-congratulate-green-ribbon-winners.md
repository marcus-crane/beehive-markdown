Te Whangai Trust from Waikato has today been announced as the Supreme Winner of the 2016 Green Ribbon Awards.

Now in their 26th year, the Green Ribbon Awards recognise exceptional environmental achievements by individuals and organisations around New Zealand. 

The Awards were presented at a Parliamentary function today, co-hosted by Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry.

Dr Smith says the Green Ribbon Awards continue to demonstrate the incredible commitment many New Zealanders, as individuals and organisations, have to their environment.

“About 110 nominations were received across the various categories, and they showcased some absolutely amazing work happening around the country. New Zealanders continue to bring the energy, passion and innovation that they’re known for to this area of their lives, and we’re all better off for it,” Dr Smith says.

“It is also appropriate that the announcement of the Green Ribbon Award winners comes a day before World Environment Day. Environmental issues are increasingly global, so making that connection is important.”

“Te Whangai Trust’s community biodiversity project has changed people’s lives and made huge environmental strides in the Waikato,” Ms Barry says. “It’s all about teaching people skills while caring for the natural environment.”

“They’ve provided 500,000 native plants, education, advisory skills and over 156,000 volunteer hours each year. They have restored ecosystems, wildlife corridors and waterways. Participants developed skills and future employment prospects through the project, and a real sense of pride, accomplishment and giving back to their community.”
