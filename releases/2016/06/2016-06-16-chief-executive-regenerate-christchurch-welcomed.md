Minister supporting Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee, and Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel, welcome the appointment by the board of Regenerate Christchurch of Ivan Iafeta as the new chief executive.

Regenerate Christchurch is the agency jointly owned and funded by the Crown and Council, with a focus on development in Christchurch’s central city, residential red zones, New Brighton and potentially other areas. 

“We know from his long-standing involvement with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and previous community roles, that Mr Iafeta has a range of leadership skills and experience that will complement the Board,” Mr Brownlee says.

"I believe the community will welcome Mr Iafeta into the role. He had a lot to do with residents in the Residential Red Zone and the community organisations that supported them,” Mayor Dalziel says.

“He is very committed to the regeneration of the city and I congratulate the board on his appointment.”

Regenerate Christchurch was established through the passing of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act, and will exist until June 2021, after which time it will transition into a solely Council-owned organisation.
