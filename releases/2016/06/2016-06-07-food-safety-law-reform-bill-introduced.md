Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew last week introduced the Food Safety Law Reform Bill to Parliament. The Bill is the final step in implementing the recommendations from the Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) Contamination Inquiry.

“We have made substantial progress implementing the WPC Inquiry recommendations through operational means. The final step is implementing the recommendations which require legislative change.

“The Food Safety Law Reform Bill will address these recommendations and reinforce New Zealand’s reputation as a reliable supplier of safe and suitable food,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Bill will amend the Animal Products Act 1999, Food Act 2014, and Wine Act 2003 so that the dairy-focused WPC Inquiry recommended improvements can be applied across the system.

“Businesses these days are multi-faceted and many work under more than one food safety Act. By better aligning the processes under these three food safety Acts there will be a more consistent approach for businesses across the whole food safety system.

“The Bill includes a range of changes to strengthen our responses to food safety incidents, create a more consistent and fair approach to enforcement for non-compliance, and improve the Government’s accessibility to information from third-party verifying agencies.

“The Bill is a further step in the Government’s ongoing programme to streamline food safety legislation. We need a food system that encourages innovation, drives value-add, and inspires more food businesses to export,” Mrs Goodhew says.
