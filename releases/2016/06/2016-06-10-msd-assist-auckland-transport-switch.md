Seniors Minister Maggie Barry says she is concerned older people in Auckland are worried and confused about the forthcoming changes to how the SuperGold Card travel concession works in the city.

Following an Auckland Transport decision to integrate the SuperGold Card with its HOP smartcard system from July 1, cardholders must have a HOP to continue to use their free travel concession.

“I’ve heard from many older people in Auckland that there is a lot of anxiety and confusion over the July 1 changeover and what it means for SuperGold holders,” Ms Barry says.

“I’ve asked the Ministry for Social Development to work with Auckland Transport and assist it in getting the message out in a clear, simple and understandable way.”

If SuperGold cardholders buy a HOP card for $10 with a $5 credit loaded, they will travel free in Auckland after 9am weekdays on trains, selected bus services and ferries, and all day on weekends and public holidays.

“In collaboration with Auckland Transport, the Ministry of Social Development has prepared information to go out to card holders about the changeover. It will also be available on the SuperSeniors website, [www.superseniors.msd.govt.nz](http://www.superseniors.msd.govt.nz/), and at Work and Income service centres and Community Link sites in Auckland.”
