Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Gerry Brownlee and Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the opening of Kathmandu’s new worldwide head office in the Christchurch Innovation Precinct.

The first anchor tenant to open its doors in the precinct, Kathmandu has brought in over 150 staff, including its product design, systems and online development teams, to the central city location.

“One of New Zealand’s most iconic brands, Kathmandu has innovation and excellence in design at its core,” Mr Brownlee says. “The Christchurch Innovation Precinct is designed to provide a stimulating and dynamic environment that fosters collaboration, and Kathmandu is a great fit.”

“This first anchor tenant opening marks a new phase of growth for the precinct”, Mr Joyce says. “The next few months will see a huge change in the area as other tenants arrive bringing in hundreds of innovative people with them.”

The Kathmandu head office will be located alongside several start-up firms and the precinct’s other anchor tenants Vodafone and Wynyard Group. Other innovation agencies and collaborations, such as Callaghan Innovation, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, and the ICT graduate school, are also looking at establishing a long-term presence in the precinct.

“The precinct has been an important component of the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, and it is already becoming a top address for innovative businesses in the city,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The aim is to attract a critical mass of talented people and businesses, and ensure a thriving, competitive and knowledge-rich local innovation ecosystem,” Mr Joyce says.

“We know that clustering firms and researchers together generates economic benefits through creating scale, providing an attractive environment for skilled workers, and encouraging knowledge sharing.

“I congratulate Kathmandu on their foresight in locating themselves in what will soon become the hub of commercial innovation in Christchurch.”

The Christchurch Innovation Precinct covers an area of approximately 3.6 hectares in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and is located within three city blocks bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph, High, Tuam and Madras Streets.

It began with the release of the Government’s Spatial Framework and Strategy in 2014 and is now managed by the Canterbury Development Corporation and Ōtākaro Limited.
