A public discussion document about the sustainability of community funding from pub and club gaming machines is now available, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said today.

“Earlier this year I announced a review of class 4 gambling and the release of a public discussion document gives the public a chance to have their say.

“The release of the discussion document is the next step in the Government’s review of the class 4 gambling sector, which operates “pokie” machines in non-casino venues”, says Mr Dunne.

The discussion document sets out the key characteristics of the sector, and explores some of the challenges faced by those involved in class 4 gambling. It includes specific questions for the public about the challenges faced by the sector, and how to address those challenges.

The public consultation period will run for seven weeks.

“The aim of the review is to ensure funding to communities from the class 4 sector remains sustainable, without any growth in gambling, and minimising harm from gambling.

“The class 4 sector is a valuable source of community funding, and we will be looking at proposals to future-proof that funding. This discussion document is an opportunity for the community to let the Government know what they think are the challenges faced by the sector, and how to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from class 4 gambling, without growing gambling and minimising harm”, said Mr Dunne.

The deadline for submissions is 12 August 2016. The discussion document and further information is available at http://www.dia.govt.nz/Services-Casino-and-Non-Casino-Gaming-Gambling-Consultation
