Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, Minister for Pacific Peoples and Ethnic Communities, says this morning’s tree planting ceremony on One Tree Hill / Maungakiekie is an historic event.

“One Tree Hill is an iconic New Zealand landmark recognised internationally,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“It is a significant step forward to see these trees restore some of the history and pride back to the city of Auckland.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga accompanied Mayor Len Brown, local elected representatives, iwi and local people at the ceremony.

“A group of trees on One Tree Hill is symbolic of the unity of a diverse supercity in a multi-cultural country”, says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “They are a blessing for all our communities”.

A small grove of nine young tōtara and pōhutukawa were planted on the site where the former Monterey Pine stood. Over several years arborists will select the stronger trees until eventually a single tōtara or pōhutukawa remains on the summit.

The Monterey Pine was first damaged in 1994 and then again in 1999. It was deemed unsafe in 2000 and removed.
