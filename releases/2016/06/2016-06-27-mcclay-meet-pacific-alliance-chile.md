Trade Minister Todd McClay leaves for Latin America today to participate in the Pacific Alliance Summit meetings held this week in Puerto Varas, Chile, on 29-30 June.

 

New Zealand is an Observer of the Pacific Alliance - a Latin American regional integration grouping comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, which accounts for more than a third of GDP in Latin America.

 

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with the Pacific Alliance and shares their objective of open markets and regional integration. 

“I will meet with Pacific Alliance Ministers to discuss how we can facilitate trade between our economies and how New Zealand can enhance its engagement with this key regional grouping”, says Mr McClay.

“New Zealand has a broad and diverse trade strategy. Access to a wide range of markets helps to insulate a small trading nation such as New Zealand during difficult times.  

“While a free trade agreement with the European Union and engagement with a post-Brexit United Kingdom are high on our agenda, we will continue to support our existing trade agreements in Asia and South America and continue to promote engagement with new and emerging markets.

“This is in the very best interests of New Zealand exporters,” says Mr McClay.

 

While in Puerto Varas, Mr McClay will also hold bilateral meetings with counterparts from within the Asia Pacific region to discuss bilateral and regional issues.

 

“I will also meet with New Zealand agribusiness companies in Chile to discuss their investments and to explore the opportunities presented by other markets in the region,” says Mr McClay. 

 

New Zealand has had a free trade agreement with Chile since 2006, which has seen Chile become a key market in Latin America for New Zealand agricultural investors and exporters.
