New electric vehicle signage launched today will help remove barriers to going electric, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The new signage, developed by the Christchurch City Council and approved by the NZ Transport Agency, uses an easily recognisable symbol to identify where electric vehicles can be charged. The signage can now be rolled out for use on State Highways and local roads across the country.

Todays’ launch follows the announcement of the Government’s Electric Vehicles Programme last month.

“It’s clear that electric vehicles are the future and the Government is committed to accelerating uptake in New Zealand.

“We have recognised there are a number of barriers preventing households switching to electric vehicles, such as a lack of awareness of electric vehicles and widespread public charging infrastructure.

“To help people transition from petrol and diesel we need to ensure there is easy access to charging infrastructure and that it is easy to find. The launch of national charging signage is a great first step in helping motorists switch to electric.

“I applaud the Christchurch City Council for taking the lead and developing a symbol that can now be used across the country, with a number of councils already signalling their intention to install it in their regions.”

Mr Bridges says the Government is now working on progressing the Electric Vehicles Programme.

“Following my announcement last month, we’re now in the process of establishing the contestable fund, leadership group, information campaign and we’ll be looking at introducing changes to Road User Charges later this year.”
