Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for Singapore to join counterparts at the 15th annual Shangri-La Dialogue.

“The Shangri-La Dialogue brings together Defence Ministers, military chiefs and senior officials from around the Asia-Pacific to discuss security issues in the region,” Mr Brownlee says.

As well as attending dialogue sessions, the Minister will hold a number of bilateral meetings with counterparts from a range of countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom. 

“New Zealand has a proud history of active defence engagement in the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Shangri-La Dialogue provides a unique opportunity to engage with a range of regional partners to discuss the key security challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region and how best to tackle them.

“As a trade-dependent island nation, our economic prosperity and development is underpinned by a stable and secure Asia-Pacific region.”

Around 30 countries are attending the 15th annual Shangri-La Dialogue.  The Minister will be accompanied by Chief of Defence Force Tim Keating, and Deputy Secretary of Defence Tony Lynch.
