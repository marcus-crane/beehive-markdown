Prime Minister John Key has today announced New Zealand’s gift to the Queen to mark her 90th birthday.

A new Education Centre at the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington has been chosen as the gift from New Zealand to acknowledge this special milestone for the Queen.

“The Queen has agreed to the new centre being named the Queen Elizabeth II Pukeahu Education Centre,” says Mr Key.

“This Education Centre, in the former Home of Compassion crèche, will be a lasting tribute to Her Majesty’s long life of service. It is also a real enhancement for the Park, giving school students and visitors a place to learn more about Pukeahu and New Zealand’s experience of military conflict, peace keeping and commemoration.”

An event to celebrate the opening of the Queen Elizabeth II Pukeahu Education Centre will be held later this year.
