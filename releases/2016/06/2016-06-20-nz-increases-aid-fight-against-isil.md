Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand will make a $1.4 million contribution to help rebuild communities damaged by fighting in Iraq. This latest funding takes New Zealand’s humanitarian assistance to those affected by conflict in Syria and Iraq to $23.9 million over the past five years.

“Restoring core services and infrastructure in Iraq is crucial to ensuring that people displaced by conflict are able to return to the towns and cities retaken from ISIL,” Mr McCully says.

“The funding we have announced today will be provided to the United Nations Development Programme and will be used to deliver a range of projects, including, the restoration of water and electricity networks, the reopening of schools and hospitals, and small cash grants for people to reopen businesses.

“Our contribution complements New Zealand’s security capacity-building efforts and will bring stability, and provide livelihoods, for people who have suffered badly under ISIL.

“We are also currently exploring options with partners for civilian capacity-building programmes in Iraq.

“In addition to helping those forced from their homes by ISIL we are committed to diplomatic efforts to combat the spread of their extremist ideology.

“Our Embassy in Baghdad will remain open to support the enhanced NZDF mission in Iraq and we will continue our extensive efforts at the global and regional level to eliminate the threat posed by terrorism. This includes our contribution to the counter-ISIL coalition working groups on foreign terrorist fighters and counter-terrorism financing,” Mr McCully says.
