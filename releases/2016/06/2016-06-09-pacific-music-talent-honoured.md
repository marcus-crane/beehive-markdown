Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated all the winners at tonight’s 12th annual Vodafone Pacific Music Awards.

“The awards highlight the creativity of our Pacific peoples.  Music has always been an important means of communication and it connects us to our roots and to each other,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Vince Harder won Best Pacific Male Artist, Best Pacific Urban Artist and Best Producer.

“Vince Harder topped the NZ singles chart with the song “Everything”, his collaboration with P-Money. Vince and other Pacific artists are now receiving the mainstream recognition they deserve,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Music and Dance group Te Vaka won Best Pacific song and Pacific music album. Te Vaka has been performing and touring for more than 20 years.

Sol3 Mio’s ‘On Another Note’ won the Best Pacific Group award.

“The awards are an acknowledgement of the influence Pacific people have on the New Zealand music scene. They inspire young Pacific musicians to aim high and dream big,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says .

“This year’s awards have attracted more public support than ever. That support is an indication of the widespread recognition of the talented people in our Pacific communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
