A Bill that introduces a better balanced consumer interests test into the anti-dumping regime has been introduced, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith announced today.

“The consumer test will weigh up the benefits of at-the-border duties on dumped products and subsidised goods, against the costs to users of the product,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Goods are considered dumped if the export price to New Zealand is less than the price they are sold for in their own home market. A duty or a financial penalty is imposed on those unfairly priced products which harm New Zealand manufacturers.

By introducing a public interest test the regime can now consider if consumers are benefiting from lower prices, more choice, availability and quality and whether this outweighs the effect on industry

“The current Act does not take this public interest into consideration,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“I want to ensure that we have a competitive market where consumers get the best value for their money. This Bill will strike a balance between encouraging competition while protecting manufacturers from unfair pricing practices.”
