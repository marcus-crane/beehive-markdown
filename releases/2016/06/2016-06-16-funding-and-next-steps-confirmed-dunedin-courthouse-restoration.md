The necessary funding to restore Dunedin’s historic courthouse has been secured in Budget 2016, Courts Minister Amy Adams has announced.

The announcement paves the way for the release of tender documents, which is the next step in finding a contractor to lead the restoration.

“It’s great to see steady progress being made on an iconic project that means a great deal to the Dunedin community,” Ms Adams says.

“Our commitment of more than $15 million in funding from Budget 2016 should reassure those living in Dunedin that the Government is fully committed to seeing the historic courthouse restored and services returned, and that we’re progressing at pace.

“We’ve had a considerable amount of interest from eleven local and national contractors, who registered their interest in the project in May. With a shortlist of suitable contractors, we’re now moving to the next stage of the project which is issuing the tender documentation to these contractors. My hope is that a contractor is appointed by October 2016, so the local community can see progress being made.

“The Government recognises the courthouse as one of New Zealand’s most historically significant buildings and the gathering momentum in the project will be welcome news for the community.”

The courthouse restoration will include seismic strengthening to between 60 and 70 per cent of the New Building Standard and refurbishments to modernise the courtrooms. The project is expected be completed in early 2018.

Dunedin’s court services have been operating from a temporary facility at the High Street since 2011, when engineers found parts of the building fell well short of the minimum 34 per cent rating required under the historic New Building Standard.

**Note:**

The funding for the historic Dunedin courthouse sits in a tagged contingency fund in Budget 2016, which means it’s total number isn’t disclosed. The reason for this is to protect commercial negotiations and ensure taxpayers get the best price for the restoration work.
