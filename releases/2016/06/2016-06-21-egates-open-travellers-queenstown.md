Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says six new eGates are now open for New Zealand, Australian, US, UK, and Canadian ePassport holders travelling to Queenstown.

“Four new next-generation eGates are available on arrival and two on departure, giving travellers the option of completing Customs checks using the one-step electronic process,” Ms Wagner says.

“The opening of the gates is timely, with fresh snow covering the ranges and Queenstown airport’s international capacity scheduled to increase by 14 per cent compared to last winter.”

“Approximately 60 per cent of the predicted 180,000 international travellers visiting Queenstown between July and September this year are likely use the new eGates.”

“The government’s $6.6 million investment in expanding and modernising automated passport processing will help manage growth in traveller volumes by allowing legitimate passengers to complete Customs checks easily, and enabling Customs officers to focus on high risk travellers.

“Now that Queenstown’s eGates are fully operational Customs will turn its attention to installing the next generation eGates at Wellington and Christchurch airports,” Ms Wagner says.
