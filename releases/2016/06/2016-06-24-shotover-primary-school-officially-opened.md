Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today formally opened Shotover Primary School in Queenstown.  

“The new school provides innovative and inspiring learning environments and is a welcome addition to the Queenstown community,” says Ms Kaye.

“The Government has invested $18.5 million in the school, and after visiting this morning I was pleased to hear that students and teachers are really enjoying the new flexible ways of learning that the school offers.”

Shotover Primary School was built in three stages, with the first students enrolled at the beginning of 2015.  With the assistance of Queenstown Lakes District Council a large, multi-purpose hall was also built which will benefit the wider community as well.

“The school has achieved a 5-star design rating from the New Zealand Green Building Council,” says Ms Kaye.

“This means the school has a number of environmental features, including monitoring of energy levels, water consumption, sunlight and CO2 which children can see and learn from.

“This is an important school in an area with a growing number of families in the heart of Queenstown. The Government is investing tens of millions of dollars to ensure parents get access to modern learning environments.”

Ms Kaye opened the school with Mayor Vanessa van Uden of Queenstown and local MP Todd Barclay.

The school is part of the Wakatipu Basin Community of Learning, which involves all eight schools in the Queenstown area working together to raise student achievement.

**Notes**

**About Shotover School**

Shotover School is a state co-educational contributing school (years 1-8). Its roll as at June 1 March 2016 is 232 students.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
