Education Minister Hekia Parata has initiated consultation with the board of Salisbury School over the school’s future.

“The Nelson boarding school has a long history of educating girls with high and complex needs, but the successful implementation of the Intensive Wraparound Service (IWS) has reduced the demand for residential schooling,” Ms Parata says.

Since 2011 Salisbury’s roll has fallen from 72 to nine, pushing the per student cost of educating girls at Salisbury up to $214,909.

In comparison the average cost of providing intensive, localised support through IWS is $27,000.

“The high cost of continuing to fund Salisbury School for a very small number of students versus the significantly lower cost and higher demand for IWS raises questions about the most effective use of resources for students with high and complex needs,” Ms Parata says.

Ms Parata says she is also initiating consultation on an application from Halswell Residential College in Christchurch to become fully co-educational.  

“Because the decision on Halswell’s application could affect my decision on the future of Salisbury, I am initiating both these consultation processes at the same time,” Ms Parata says.

Ms Parata says if a decision is made to close Salisbury, the Ministry of Education will work with parents and the school to determine what is in the best interests of the students.

Consultation on the Halswell proposal will end on 15 July. Consultation on the proposed closure of Salisbury will end on 12 August. Following the consultation process, should the Minister decide that Salisbury School should close, the school board will have the opportunity to make further arguments in support of the school staying open.

The proposed date for the school’s closure is 27 January next year.
