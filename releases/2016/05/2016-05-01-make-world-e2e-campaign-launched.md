Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today launched the ‘Make the World’ Engineering to Employment (E2E) campaign to encourage more young people into a career in engineering.

‘Make the World’ will illustrate the wide range of choices available within engineering, with opportunities to design everything from life-saving medical equipment to the latest agricultural and manufacturing technologies.

“Engineering study opens the door to fantastic career choices. Engineering is central to growing a modern economy, and to New Zealand’s future success, it’s a priority of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. We want young people to take another look – engineering may well be for them.  It’s a great opportunity to lead the way in designing and building the future.”

“Universities are already training more engineers than ever before following the Government’s push to increase numbers. In 2014 engineering graduates represented 4.8 per cent of all graduates at the bachelors level or higher, an increase from 4.0 per cent in 2011.

“Now we’re looking at the next level.  In particular we need more engineering technicians and technologists studying at and graduating from polytechnics and institutes of technology through Diplomas in Engineering and Bachelors degrees in Engineering Technology

The campaign will target students, their families and friends who perhaps don’t recognise the very marketable qualifications and financially rewarding careers in engineering that polytechnics and institutes of technology can give them with shorter periods of study than the traditional Honours degree.”

The Government is supporting ‘Make the World’ with an investment of $2 million. The public awareness campaign is one strand of the $5.5 million Engineering Education to Employment (E2E) programme to increase the number of those graduating with tertiary engineering qualifications. 

“It’s no secret that we need more engineers, to help us build a high-tech modern economy. That’s why we are reaching out to young New Zealanders who want to take up tertiary study, but who might not have considered engineering, to take another look at what their local polytechnic and institute of technology has to offer, and get involved in engineering.”
