Entries open today for the 2016 Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships, which offer New Zealand executives the opportunity to improve their skills at the world’s best business schools.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says the scholarships are designed for senior managers, executives and business owners looking to expand their expertise by studying internationally. 

“These scholarships enable businesspeople to develop their management and international business leadership skills, in order to make their firms at home more internationally competitive,” Mr Joyce says.

“Having our business leaders study overseas brings tangible benefits to New Zealand businesses and helps to grow the economy. If we increase the number of business leaders with a global mind-set, our businesses are better able to operate to international best practices.

“The scholarships also support New Zealand businesspeople to develop valuable networks and overcome the challenges that our small economy and distance from overseas markets can pose.”

The scholarships cover up to half of the course-related costs of attending an international learning institution.

Last year’s scholarships saw 13 successful recipients enrol at prestigious international institutions such as Harvard, Wharton and Columbia Business Schools, Stanford University, and the London School of Economics.

Applications for the scholarships close on 27 June 2016.
