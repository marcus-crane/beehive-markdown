Trade Minister Todd McClay says the Waitangi Tribunal's finding that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) does not breach the Treaty of Waitangi, along with today’s MYOB survey on TPP demonstrates growing support for free trade agreements in New Zealand.

“Grant Robertson and Andrew Little need to tell Phil Goff, David Shearer, and their regional MPs why Labour has turned its back on the seafood, wine, kiwifruit, horticulture, forestry, meat, dairy, manufacturing, export education, ICT, and tourism industries,” says Mr McClay.

“As we continue to roll out the eighteen TPP roadshows and hui the debate is changing. As we explain TPP and help businesses prepare for unprecedented trade access to 800 million consumers in eleven counties, the talk has now turned to identifying opportunity and making the most of trade advantages. 

“This wider public engagement is helping address misconceptions and misinformation and I will continue to find ways to better engage with the public and business community.

“MYOB’s survey of more than 1,000 small and medium businesses (SMEs) shows that 75 per cent either support, or would not change how they would vote with only 25 per cent who do not support TPP,” says Mr McClay.

“Meanwhile, Labour continues to deny decades of bipartisan trade policy in New Zealand by refusing to support this agreement, even though it meets all their bottom lines.”
