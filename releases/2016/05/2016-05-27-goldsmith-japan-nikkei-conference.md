Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith will travel to Japan this weekend to represent the Government at the 2016 Nikkei International ‘Future of Asia’ Conference.

“The theme of this year’s forum is ‘Rising to Global Challenges and Realising Asia’s Potential’,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“I will address the conference on how we are working together to create greater economic integration through trade and business. I’ll touch on the regional significance of the signing of the TPP, as well as the Asia Region Funds Passport which opens up channels for international investment flows.

“The conference brings together regional leaders in the public and private sector to discuss issues relevant to Asia-Pacific regional integration and the economy.

The conference was established in 1995, and New Zealand has taken up an invitation to attend every year since 2011.

While in Japan Mr Goldsmith will also meet with range of Japanese government representatives, including his Commerce and Consumer Affairs counterparts and other key financial sector stakeholders.

“I am also looking forward to meeting with the Japanese Parliamentary Rugby Association. With the Sunwolves in the 2016 Super Rugby competition and the 2019 Rugby World Cup quickly approaching it will be a good opportunity to discuss the ongoing development of our national sport.”
