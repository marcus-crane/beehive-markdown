Transport Minister Simon Bridges has marked the start of construction today to upgrade the ferry terminal at Half Moon Bay which will become a key hub for a new east Auckland public transport network.

The $5.9 million upgrade will improve access for passengers as well as safer truck movements associated with the vehicular ferry terminal.

“This project is part of the Government’s committed to provide infrastructure that delivers better integrated solutions for urban transport networks,” Mr Bridges says.

“The passenger ferry service from Half Moon Bay provides a fast, reliable alternative route to the city and the improvements will ensure it can keep up with current and future increased demand.

“A new park and ride facility at nearby Lloyd Elsmore Park will provide an extra 100 parking spaces, with a weekday bus shuttle connecting passengers to the ferry terminal.

“As well as better shelter from the elements for ferry passengers, the upgraded facilities will also provide covered cycling storage and nearby bus stops to ensure the best all-weather facilities for all types of transport users.”

Construction is expected to be completed later this year.
