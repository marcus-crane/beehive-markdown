Budget 2016 invests heavily in core justice services, with $208.4 million in additional funding over the next four years – the largest increase to Justice and Courts in almost a decade, Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams says.

“This investment underpins the Government’s commitment to delivering core justice services and keeping New Zealanders safe. It will better support access to justice and strengthen efficiencies across the system,” Ms Adams says. 

“Justice sector agencies remain focused on crime-prevention, rehabilitation and reducing re-offending. Budget 2016 continues to invest in services to enhance our criminal justice system.”

The extra funding includes:

- $13.3 million for the Public Defence Service to ensure New Zealanders facing criminal charges receive high-quality legal representation.
- $16.2 million so restorative justice providers can meet growing demand for their services.
- $14.4 million for the Ministry of Justice to deliver more effective services.
- $55.9 million over 2016/17 and 2017/18 for the operation of the Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct.
- $76 million over the next four years plus $20 million in 2015/16 to enhance access to legal aid and community law centres.

A further $24.6 million has also been allocated over two years to deliver the 2017 general election.

In total the justice sector receives $837 million over the next four years, plus $56 million in 2015/16.
