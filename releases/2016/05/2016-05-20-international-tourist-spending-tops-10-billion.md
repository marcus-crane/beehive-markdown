Spending by international tourists in New Zealand has topped $10 billion for the first time, further evidence of the sector’s importance to the economy, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

International visitor spending increased 25 per cent to $10 billion in the year to March 2016, according to the International Visitor Survey released today.

“Surpassing $10 billion in visitor spend for the first time confirms that the tourism sector is continuing to grow and is adding significant value to the economy,” Mrs Bennett says. 

“The rapid visitor growth we’ve seen is testament to the hard work of the sector and the fantastic New Zealand experience offered to those who visit our shores.”

“This Government is continuing to support and work with the tourism industry to achieve further success,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Budget 2016 will see a further $45 million investment in tourism over the next four years. That includes $12 million to help communities with some of their smaller infrastructure needs and an extra $8 million for Tourism New Zealand to target key growth markets. This is in addition to the more than $130 million a year we already spend.”
