The Government is transferring up to $11.38 million in funding and programmes from the Ministry of Social Development to support Whānau Ora.

The transfer is part of a review of social service spending which aims to achieve better outcomes for the most vulnerable whānau and families.

“This transfer reflects the commitment by social sector Ministers to strengthen efforts to support Whānau Ora and identify opportunities for the Crown and Iwi to support shared development, aims and aspirations,” the Minister for Whānau Ora, Te Ururoa Flavell, said.

“The transfer will support the whānau-centred integration of social services at the community level. The programmes and funding chosen for transfer align with the Whānau Ora approach and the outcomes in which Whānau Ora Commissioning Agencies are investing.”

Social Development Minister Anne Tolley said the boost to Whānau Ora is part of the government’s focus on finding new ways to provide services and support for vulnerable whānau and families.

“The transfer provides further support for the flexible and innovative approaches to support whānau and families demonstrated by Whānau Ora Commissioning Agencies. It will strengthen the focus on priority areas and populations,” Mrs Tolley said.

The majority of these programmes and funding will transfer to support Whānau Ora from 1 July 2016 onwards, the beginning of the Government’s new financial year. The remainder of these whānau-centred contracts and funding are expected to be transferred in the financial year beginning 1 July 2017.

The funding and programmes will be allocated across the three Whānau Ora Commissioning Agencies which are contracted to identify programmes and services to empower whānau and achieve Whānau Ora outcomes.

Mr Flavell said the Whānau Ora approach is proving effective as a means of improving results for many vulnerable families, particularly Māori and Pasifika, with whom social sector agencies have traditionally struggled to engage.

“We welcome the addition of the funding and programmes to further support the whānau-centred integration of social services at the community level,” Mr Flavell said.
