Trade Minister Todd McClay travels to Fiji tomorrow to continue discussions with Fijian counterparts on PACER Plus - a regional trade and economic integration agreement involving all members of the Pacific Islands Forum - and deepen links with the Fijian private sector.

“As we move into the final stages of PACER Plus negotiations, we are working hard to conclude an agreement that benefits all Pacific Islands countries and New Zealand, through promoting economic integration and sustainable economic development,” says Mr McClay.

“My discussions with Minister for Trade Faiyaz Koya will provide an opportunity to engage with and understand Fiji’s perspectives on negotiations.

“I will use my visit as an opportunity to meet with regional civil society stakeholders interested in PACER Plus and I also plan on meeting with New Zealand stakeholders interested in negotiations in the upcoming weeks,” says Mr McClay.

While in Fiji, Mr McClay will also take part in a tour of Nature’s Way Cooperative, a fruit and vegetable exporter supported by the New Zealand Aid Programme.

“Fiji is our largest trading partner in the region and New Zealand continues to look for opportunities to deepen business and trade ties with Fiji,” Mr McClay says
