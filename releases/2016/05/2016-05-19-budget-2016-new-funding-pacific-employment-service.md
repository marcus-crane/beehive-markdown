Budget 2016 contains new funding to help pacific youth find work or take up suitable training programmes, Pacific People’s Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

$4.6 million is being allocated over four years to the Pacific Employment Support Services (PESS) to help young pacific people in Auckland find work.

“The programme identifies young people who need help. Staff place them in training programmes, then in to work or further qualification-based training,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The service was first set up after Budget 2010 and I am delighted Budget 2016 provides an additional $4.6 million of new operating funding.”

“17% of Pacific youth in Auckland are classified as NEET – Not involved in Employment, Education or Training.  That is 6,900 pacific young people in Auckland, aged between 15 and 24, who are not working, studying or training,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“One in every four babies born in Auckland now is of Pacific descent.  That means young pacific people will make up more of the future workforce.  Helping their employment prospects benefits everyone.”

The service identifies the needs of each participant, then develops a tailored programme which includes literacy and numeracy training, communication and interview skills, as well as career counselling and planning.

It also provides coaching and support, and job, apprenticeship or higher education opportunities.
