ACC Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed the results of a Research New Zealand survey which shows that public trust and confidence in ACC has reached a new high.

“The survey shows that 61 per cent of New Zealanders surveyed in the 12 months to March 2016 have full trust and confidence in ACC, up from 56 per cent in the previous 12 months, and the result for the last quarter is 64 per cent, which is the highest result since the survey began in 2004,” says Ms Kaye.

“This is good news, and whilst I’d like to see even higher trust and confidence, it confirms that ACC is heading in the right direction.

“The scheme is now in a sound financial position, having reached the goal of full funding. This means ACC holds sufficient financial assets to meet the lifetime costs of all current claims.

“ACC’s improved financial position has meant we’ve been able to deliver around $2 billion of levy cuts over the past five years.

“New legislation I announced last year also provides for more open and transparent levy setting, as well as a more robust, longer-term funding policy that will ensure greater levy stability. In addition, residual levies which collected historical claims costs have been removed, making work levies fairer.

“ACC has also begun a five-year programme aimed at transforming its people, processes and technology to deliver a more modern, integrated and customer focused service.

“The first stage of this programme focuses on improving services for businesses, from simplifying levy invoices to introducing online payments. Further ahead, real time information on workplace injury rates and trends will be provided, giving businesses a clearer picture of what’s driving levies and supporting them to develop more effective injury prevention.

“These improvements have been well received by the business community, and this reinforces steadily improving trust and confidence amongst businesses reflected in a separate ACC survey. This survey shows that as of March 2016, 52 per cent of businesses surveyed have high levels of trust and confidence in ACC, up from 40 per cent in September 2013.

“Successive stages of the transformation programme will focus on improving services for injured people and health providers. Importantly, the programme is about enabling ACC to refocus its attention on our most vulnerable, by freeing up staff to spend more time with people with complex injuries.

“ACC is also increasing its spending and working more collaboratively to improve injury prevention.

“ACC approves around 96 per cent of the nearly two million claims it receives annually. However, for those whose claims are declined and who want to challenge ACC’s decisions, it’s important that there’s a fair and timely process for doing this.

“Late last year I asked MBIE to commission an independent review of potential issues affecting dispute resolution for ACC clients. This review was begun in parallel with targeted consultation on a proposed ACC Appeals Tribunal.

“Once both these pieces of work have been completed I will be in a better position to assess the best way to ensure our system provides access to justice for ACC clients.

“The ACC scheme has come a long way in recent years, and there’s a lot of work underway to ensure it continues to improve its services. I’m confident that as this work delivers results, trust and confidence in ACC will continue to increase.”
