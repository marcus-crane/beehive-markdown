Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the appointment of an advisory group to consider possible changes to the education funding systems.

“The group comprised of school, early childhood education (ECE) and union leaders will test a number of proposed directions for change to improve the ECE and school funding systems to better support our kids to receive the best possible education,” says Ms Parata. “It will hold its first meeting on May 20.”

“The Government agrees with the sector that the present systems are unduly complex and do not sufficiently direct resources to where they’re needed, particularly for those most at risk of under-achievement. We also share the sector’s concern that the decile system has created false perceptions about the quality of individual schools.

“Group members bring skills and experience from across the early learning and schooling sectors, including from private, integrated and Māori medium settings. Their insights will be critical.”

“It’s important to remember we are still in the very early stages of the funding review and no decisions have been made. The Ministry will also seek input from the wider education sector,” says Ms Parata.

The advisory group will be chaired by Peter Hughes, the Secretary for Education. Wider sector engagement will run until 31 August 2016.
