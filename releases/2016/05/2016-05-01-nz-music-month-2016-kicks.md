New Zealand Music Month is a time to focus on the wealth of musical talent we have here in New Zealand, Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams and Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry say.

“NZ Music Month as an opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of all those who create, perform, record or promote New Zealand music.

“The success of NZ Music Month is in the wide support it receives, not only from the partnering organisations but also from New Zealand music labels, venues, media and the public,” says Ms Adams.

“When NZ Music Month began in 2000, it was about encouraging radio stations to play more local music, and we still do see individual stations lifting their local music content markedly in May.

“In 2015, there were over 1300 live music events where more than 1800 artists and bands performed across 65 New Zealand cities and towns.”

Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says NZ Music Month is a key event in New Zealand’s cultural calendar.

“This month is a celebration of the diversity of our music, showcasing a range of genres and world-class performers, from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to Shihad, ukulele groups to heavy metal bands and jazz ensembles to house DJs.

“It also gives the New Zealand music community a well-deserved boost, helping artists reach out to new audiences and win over new fans.”

NZ Music Month is led by the New Zealand Music Commission in partnership with the Australasian Performing Right Association and Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (APRA AMCOS), Independent Music New Zealand, NZ On Air, the Music Managers Forum, the Radio Broadcasters Association, Recorded Music New Zealand, V and H2GO.
