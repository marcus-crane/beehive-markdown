Minister of Energy and Resources Simon Bridges has switched on New Zealand’s first Tesla Energy Powerwall battery at a South Auckland primary school.

The Powerwall and solar system by lines company Vector was launched at Otara’s Rongomai School, one of thirty Auckland schools which will benefit from the state-of-the-art solar and battery package.

The battery stores electricity which is charged by the solar panels or from the mains grid during off-peak pricing times. It then provides power when the solar panels aren’t producing enough electricity.

“How we generate, manage and use energy in New Zealand is changing. We’re at the forefront of innovative and new technology that is giving consumers greater choice over their energy use and this is another great example,” Mr Bridges says.

“Using cutting edge technology like this in schools and homes allows solar power to be stored and will allow peaks in electricity demand to be managed more efficiently.”

Mr Bridges says solar combined with batteries has the potential to play an increasingly significant role in the electricity market.

“The electricity sector must keep pace with Kiwi consumers who are early and eager adopters of new technology, and take the opportunities this new innovation presents.

“Innovation provides greater choice, better services, and more value for money to consumers. New services are already giving consumers greater choices to meet their energy needs and use energy more efficiently, a trend that will only continue to gain more momentum.”

One hundred and thirty battery and solar array packages will now be rolled out across Auckland as a result of the Vector and Auckland Energy Consumer Trust Future of Energy competition last year.
