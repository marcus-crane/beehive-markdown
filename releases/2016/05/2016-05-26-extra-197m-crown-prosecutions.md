Budget 2016 provides $19.7 million of new operating funding for Crown prosecutions over the next four years.

“This investment will ensure serious offenders continue to be held to account through New Zealand’s high-quality Crown prosecution services,” Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC says.

Crown prosecutions are managed by Crown Law through a network of 17 Crown Solicitors who are responsible for the conduct of prosecutions on behalf of the Crown. Each Crown Solicitor is a partner in a private law firm.

“Crown prosecution services form a vital part of New Zealand’s justice system,” Mr Finlayson says.

“Budget 2016 demonstrates the Government’s commitment to effective criminal prosecutions and will ensure the sustainability of these high-quality services into the future.”

In total the justice sector receives $837 million over the next four years, plus $56 million in 2015/16.
