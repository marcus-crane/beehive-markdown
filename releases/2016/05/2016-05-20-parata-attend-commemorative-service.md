Education Minister Hekia Parata will today attend a commemorative service on the Greek island of Crete to honour the service and sacrifice of the New Zealanders who fought in the Battle of Crete that began 75 years ago today.

The service will be held at Galatas, the scene of fierce close combat between New Zealand and German alpine troops on the night of 27 May 1941.

”It will be a privilege to be there,” says Ms Parata who yesterday joined the Governor-General, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae in representing New Zealand at an Australian memorial service and the inauguration of a memorial at 42nd Street, scene of a famous rearguard action by Australian and New Zealand troops sparked by a fearsome Māori Battalion haka.

“These commemorations recognise the sacrifice and bravery of the Cretan people and the young men who came from New Zealand, Australia and Britain to defend the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and decency.

“The crowds turning up at each of these commemorations are testament to the high regard in which all those who fought alongside each other 75 years ago are still held.

“During the 12 days of fighting 671 New Zealanders died, 967 were wounded and 2180 were taken prisoner. For the most part they were ordinary people, but they did extraordinary things.

“We owe it to their memory to continue to champion the values they fought for.”
