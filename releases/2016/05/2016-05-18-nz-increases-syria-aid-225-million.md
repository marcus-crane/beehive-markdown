Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced $2.5 million in matched funding for New Zealand based non-government organisations, to help scale up their response to the Syrian refugee crisis.

“The fighting in Syria has killed more than half a million people and forced 11 million from their homes,” Mr McCully says.

“Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Turkey, are bearing the brunt of this refugee crisis and the funding we have announced today will help deliver practical support to displaced Syrian communities across the region.

“The Government will match ‘dollar for dollar’ the funds raised by New Zealand NGOs running Syria appeals up to a maximum of $2.5 million. This approach acknowledges the generous support of New Zealand public and will ensure every dollar they donate goes further.

“Over the past five years we have steadily raised our support for people forced from their homes by the fighting in Syria and Iraq, and this latest increase takes New Zealand’s total contribution to $22.5 million,” Mr McCully says.
