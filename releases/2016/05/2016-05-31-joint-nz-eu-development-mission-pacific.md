Foreign Minister Murray McCully and the European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Mr Neven Mimica will lead a joint mission to the Pacific this week, accompanied by Minister for Climate Change Issues Paula Bennett.

The NZ EU Pacific Partnership Mission departs 1 June and will travel to Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, and Tuvalu.

“New Zealand and the European Union work together closely in the Pacific, particularly in support of renewable energy initiatives. This mission is an opportunity to take stock of progress across the region and look for new areas of cooperation,” Mr McCully says.
