Customs Minister Nicky Wagner announced that the Government has agreed to a series of proposals that will modernise the Customs and Excise Act to, strengthen border management, streamline the excise system, and address a range of issues for New Zealand businesses.

“The changes will make the Act simpler, more efficient and increase transparency for businesses who import and export. We have worked with the sector and implemented many of the changes they have advocated for,” Ms Wagner says. 

“Many elements of the new Act that will appeal to the trade sector including the Cabinet directive that Customs and Inland Revenue work together to identify options for streamlining the payment of GST at the border. 

“The excise system will be streamlined and compliance costs reduced.  Alcohol manufacturers will be given more flexibility by expanding off-site storage to cover all products, and removing the requirement for manufacturers to apply for excise remissions for damage or loss for goods not released to market.

“Customs will establish an internal process for appeals over assessment of duty. Appeals will still be able to be taken to the Customs Appeal Authority, but the new process should provide a quicker, informal means of appealing Customs’ decisions.”

“Importers will be able to declare a provisional value for goods in specific circumstances and declare a final value later and Customs will be able to issue binding valuation rulings to give importers greater certainty about how to meet valuation requirements.”

“The Government has agreed in principle that Customs needs to meet a statutory threshold before examining electronic devices.  We have asked Customs to do further work on what this would look like in practice and report back prior to introduction of the Bill.  The Government has also agreed in principle that, once the threshold is met, a person should have to assist Customs with the examination if asked.”

“The changes to the Act will allow Customs to concentrate on high-risk goods and travellers, and make life simpler for the vast majority of traders and travellers who willingly comply with their legal obligations.

“I would like to thank the businesses and industry associations who have engaged with and worked closely with Customs on proposals for change.

“The changes will enable better assessment and management of risk, more effective cross-agency collaboration and flexible responses to future trends.”

A bill will be drafted for introduction to the House this year.
