Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced a new university scholarship initiative for Indian students. The announcement was made with the President of the Republic of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee in Auckland.

Thirty five top Indian scholars are being offered the opportunity to study graduate and postgraduate programmes at all eight of New Zealand’s world class universities, including in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), fashion, and business related courses through the New Zealand Excellence Awards.

India is New Zealand’s 10th largest trade partner. Last year our two-way trade reached $2 billion. This initiative signals the commitment of the New Zealand Government and our universities to strengthen the relationship and recognise India as a core trade, economic, political and education partner.

Education is key to New Zealand’s bilateral relationship with India. In 2014 more than 20,000 Indian students chose to study in New Zealand, making India the second largest source of international students to New Zealand.

“Scholarship programmes like this are an important aspect of strengthening the New Zealand-India education relationship. Each Indian student studying here will act as an ambassador for New Zealand promoting the high quality of our university system.

“Continuing to grow the number of higher-level Indian students studying courses in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes is a top priority, especially in study disciplines that New Zealand industries need in order to keep growing,” says Mr Joyce.

The successful New Zealand Excellence Awards recipients will each receive NZD $5000 towards their tuition fees and will begin their studies in 2016 and 2017.
