Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the new national telehealth service is providing high quality individual healthcare support to almost 14,000 people who call, text, and email each week.

“In just six months, the free integrated 24/7 national telehealth service has already proven to be invaluable to New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“The telehealth service is ensuring people can access the right advice, at the right time, no matter where they live, or how they choose to make contact.

"To date, the telehealth service has delivered over 350,000 consults across phone, text, email and webchat. In the last month, 86 per cent of people contacting the service by phone had their call answered within 20 seconds.

“It’s great to see that the national telehealth service has become a trusted part of the health system, connecting people seamlessly with the healthcare they need. It’s also built strong partnerships with providers and organisations like St John, Plunket, and the Universities of Auckland and Otago.”

Launched in November 2015, Homecare Medical is delivering the national telehealth service which includes Healthline, Quitline, Gambing Helpline, Alcohol and Drug Helpline, the National Depression Initiative, and poisons and immunisation advice for the public.

Emergency calls to ambulance and PlunketLine remain as standalones, but connect behind the scenes with the national telehealth service.

The national telehealth service is provided by 300 staff based in Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin, and Christchurch, and 88 nurses who work from home across New Zealand.

Homecare Medical is a teletriage organisation and is a partnership between Pegasus Health and ProCare.
