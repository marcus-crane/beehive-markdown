Queenstown Airport will offer long-awaited night flights during winter for the first time with the unveiling of new runway lights by Transport Minister Simon Bridges this evening.

About 200 lights have been installed or repositioned as part of Airways New Zealand and Queenstown Airport’s wider $18 million runway infrastructure upgrade.

“Air transport underpins our economic growth. Additional flights after dark will boost Queenstown’s tourism industry and wider economy,” Mr Bridges says.

“In the winter months, Australians make up 80 per cent of Queenstown’s international passengers. Previously night time flights weren’t an option but these new runway lights mean people now have more flexible and convenient access to the region all year round.

“Queenstown is one of New Zealand’s prime tourist destinations. In 2012, more than 1.1 million visitors passed through the airport. In 2015, the number grew by 400,000 visitors to 1.5 million.

“This strong growth in the number of people visiting Queenstown demand has created significant opportunities for the airport and the region and introducing night flights will help to manage and make the most of these opportunities.

“The likes of Air New Zealand and Jetstar have already announced they intend to operate daily services which means more choice for prospective visitors.”

Mr Bridges says the lights not only increase the capacity of the airport but also has added safety and surveillance benefits.

“The lights are a good example of industry and regulators collaborating to enable better and more frequent services without compromising safety.”
