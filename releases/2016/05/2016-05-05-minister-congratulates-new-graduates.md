Corrections Minister Judith Collins has congratulated the 37 graduates who today started their new roles as Corrections Officers and Offender Employment Instructors across the country.

“The Corrections Officer Development Pathway is an intensive 12 months of training and I commend each of the new graduates on their dedication and achievement,” says Ms Collins.

“The role of a Corrections Officer comes with a lot of responsibility, but with high responsibility comes high reward. The new recruits can be proud knowing that they are being positive role models and changing the lives of some of society’s most challenging people on a daily basis.”

The new staff will be based at Northland Region Corrections Facility, Auckland Prison, Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Whanganui Prison, Manawatu Prison, Christchurch Men’s Prison and Otago Corrections Facility.

Christian Glinister, of Auckland Prison, was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award, established by Minister Collins in 2009, to recognise his leadership, professionalism and willingness to help his fellow recruits throughout the training programme.

“I am grateful for the commitment and passion that this group has shown and welcome them into their new career with Corrections. I look forward to seeing them put their new skills and knowledge to use; helping to reduce reoffending and making our communities safer.”
