Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says today’s decision on Waiheke Island’s unitary authority proposal reinforces the need for local authority reforms.

The Local Government Commission announced today that the application to form a Waiheke Island unitary council would be treated as an alternative application to the process initiated by the North Rodney application to form a unitary authority. 

This means the applications for Waiheke and North Rodney will now be treated as two options for how local government in the Auckland Council area could be reorganised, rather than being assessed as part of two separate processes.

“The Local Government Commission is constrained by its current legislation and today’s decision is consistent with its previous decision on North Rodney.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Better Local Services package I announced earlier this year, on the other hand, includes a wider range of models for local government, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“There need to be more options than amalgamation or de-amalgamation.  Legislation to implement the Better Local Services package will be introduced next month. It is hoped that the legislation is passed by the end of the year.
