Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the updated lung cancer standards will help to ensure people with lung cancer receive the best possible care.

“Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in New Zealand and disproportionately affects our most vulnerable populations,” says Dr Coleman.

“Smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, with around 85 per cent of people who die from lung cancer were smokers.

“Revising the national standards is part of wider efforts to improve the overall care and support for patients and their families.

“We know that patients diagnosed with lung cancer earlier have better outcomes. That’s why these standards focus on improving early detection, timely access to diagnosis and treatment for all patients.

“The updated standards also specify waiting times for lung cancer treatment, and promote a multidisciplinary approach to treatment planning.”

In line with Faster Cancer wait time indicators, patients requiring treatment for lung cancer should start treatment within 62 days of referral. Additionally, patients with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer should be seen by a specialist within 14 days of their referral.

The Standards of Services Provision for Lung Cancer Patients in New Zealand have been developed by the National Lung Cancer Work Group.

Provisional national tumour standards for the 10 most common tumour types, including bowel, breast, and gynaecological, were released by the Ministry of Health in 2013.

These, and the finalised lung cancer standards, are part of the Government’s $63 million Faster Cancer Treatment programme, which includes funding for dedicated cancer nurse coordinators, psychologists and social workers, as well as other cancer service improvement initiatives.

The standards are available on the Ministry of Health website, [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz).
