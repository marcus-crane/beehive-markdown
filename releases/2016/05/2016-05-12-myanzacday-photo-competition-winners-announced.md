Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has congratulated the winners of a photo competition which challenged New Zealanders to define their modern Anzac Day experience.

Entries for the contest, run by the WW100 centenary programme, came from across the globe.

“From Gore to London, New Zealanders have taken some thought-provoking images which show what Anzac Day means a century on from the first Anzac Day services,” Ms Barry says.

A high-profile panel of four judges – actor Sam Neill, broadcaster Carol Hirschfeld, photographer Saint Andrew Matautia and New Zealand Photographic Society Vice President Peter Robertson – chose the winners.

Adam Jang-Jones’ image of a lone soldier at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park looking upwards to the National War Memorial was their pick for first prize.

“It’s a compelling image which captures a moment of reflection and a strong sense of what the day means to our nation,” Ms Barry says.

A People’s Choice prize voted on via Facebook went to Jarrad Scott’s image of the Gore RSA’s new poppy wall.

The judging panel also selected two runners up, Michelle Chalklin-Sinclair and Hayley Judd. Michelle’s image captures a moment during the ceremony in front of the Queens Garden War Memorial in Dunedin.

Hayley’s image shows a young girl dressed in red holding her father’s hand, surrounded by Field of Remembrance crosses.

The Judges’ Choice winner will receive New Zealand Post’s Commemorative WW1 silver proof coin and 1914-1916 WW1 booklets, two First World War history books, *New Zealand and the First World War* and *Holding on to Home*, and a Ngā Tapuwae New Zealand First World War merchandise pack.
