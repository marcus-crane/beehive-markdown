Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner launched the Hidden Talent Tour today in Hamilton to encourage employers to take on more disabled people.

“The Hidden Talent Tour is based on a similar concept developed in the US, which showcases the skills and talents of disabled people and encourages business owners and employers to hire and retain disabled people,” Ms Wagner says.

“In New Zealand, we know that only 45% of disabled adults are employed compared with 72% of non-disabled adults. There is a vast array of talented, loyal employees that employers aren’t tapping into. It’s a missed opportunity.

“I will be touring the country to encourage employers to take on more disabled people and to dispel some of the myths around employing those with disabilities, such as costliness and unwarranted health and safety concerns.

“We know that there are plenty of disabled people who want the opportunity to work who can provide a positive attitude to the workplace, add diversity and make businesses more representative of the communities they serve.

“It’s about making employers aware of the opportunities that add value to their businesses and make the world of difference to the lives of disabled people,” Ms Wagner says.
