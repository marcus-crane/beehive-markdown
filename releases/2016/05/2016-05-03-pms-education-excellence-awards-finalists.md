Fourteen finalists have been selected from more than 200 entries for the prestigious 2016 Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The finalists come from Northland, Auckland, Waikato, the Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Manawatu, Canterbury and Southland and include early childhood services, primary and secondary schools.

They were chosen by a panel of education experts from a total of 212 entries. 

“The finalists are a credit to their staff and students and provide a great example to others throughout New Zealand and internationally,” says Ms Parata.

“Their entries showcase innovative and effective teaching practice and highlight the importance of teachers working together and with students and the wider community to ensure every child succeeds. They also highlight the importance of teachers basing their decisions on evidence.”

Now in their third year, the Awards celebrate the best of teaching in New Zealand.

The panel of experts, convened by Education Council chief executive Dr Graham Stoop, said this year’s entries showed pride, passion and commitment, and a strong desire to make a difference.

A judging panel will visit each finalist during May and June, and the winners will be announced at a ceremony on 13 June, where each will receive a financial award and a professional development opportunity.
