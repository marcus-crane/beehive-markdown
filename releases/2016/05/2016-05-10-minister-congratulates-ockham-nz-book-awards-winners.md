The richness and diversity of modern New Zealand culture is reflected in the literature honoured at the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards 2016, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“From kiwis racing in the 1928 Tour de France to the complexities of Maori urban migration, the winning entries explore the diverse strands that combine to define us as New Zealanders.”

Ms Barry presented the four categories of Best First Book awards at tonight’s ceremony in Auckland.

“Congratulations to the winners, the short-list, the long-list, and I thank you for all you do to enrich our lives – our storytellers are an integral part of our nation’s cultural life.”

The awards have been revived after a year’s hiatus thanks to philanthropic support from Ockham Residential, the Acorn Foundation and Book Tokens Limited.

“The Crown, through Creative New Zealand, continues to be a major cornerstone funder of the Awards, as it has been for many years, contributing $80,500.

“We also provide financial support and recognition for our talented authors through the Prime Minister’s Awards for Literary Achievement, the NZ Book Awards for Children and funding to allow our authors to travel to international book events in Frankfurt and Taipei.

“I’m delighted that our national book awards are back as a fixture of our cultural calendar, honouring and celebrating our finest writers and giving them the profile they deserve.”
