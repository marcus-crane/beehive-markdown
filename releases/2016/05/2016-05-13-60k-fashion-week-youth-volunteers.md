Funding of $60,000 over three years to support a youth volunteering programme with Fashion Week New Zealand Limited was announced today by Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This funding will help up to 600 young people aged 16 to 24 get hands-on, behind the scenes experience, mentoring and instruction from industry experts and leaders during NZ Fashion Week,” says Ms Kaye.

NZ Fashion Week, which this year will be held in Auckland’s ANZ Viaduct Events Centre from 22-28 August, is a showcase for the New Zealand fashion industry, and enables local designers to promote their brands to a national and international audience.

“The volunteer programme offers experience in a variety of roles associated with NZ Fashion Week and the wider fashion industry, and is a potential stepping stone for young people interested in entering the industry.

“Volunteers can work in roles such as ushers, dressers and minders, and will get to experience first-hand the energy, excitement and amazing learning and networking opportunities of NZ Fashion Week.

“Skills that this experience will help young people develop include leadership, problem-solving, teamwork, decision-making and self-management. For those with a passion for fashion, it will be incredibly inspiring.

“Positive opportunities like this can have a tremendous impact on the lives of young people. I want young people to have a range of youth development opportunities that can provide them with new experiences and help them develop skills and improve their capability and resilience.

“In April this year, a new direction for youth development in New Zealand came into effect. This is about increasing the number of youth development opportunities available to young people, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds, and developing greater cohesion between the government and business and philanthropic sectors to create these opportunities.

“I expect the new direction will increase the number of opportunities from around 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.

“We have fantastic young people in New Zealand with unlimited potential. It’s great to be able to support opportunities such as the NZ Fashion Week volunteering programme, to help set young people on a path to a successful future.”
