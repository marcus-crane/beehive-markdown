Communications Minister Amy Adams has announced the creation of an Advisory Board to advise her on setting up the new national CERT.

“CERT NZ will be a central part of our cyber security architecture and a one-stop shop for anyone reporting or dealing with cybercrime. I want to see the CERT set up as soon as is practicably possible,” Ms Adams says. 

“There is substantial experience in cyber security in the private and non-government sectors – and I intend to tap into that as CERT NZ will not reach its full potential without a strong voice representing our private sector guiding its establishment and operation.

“We know from our international partners that that involvement of the private sector is critical to success of the CERT.”

The Board will have up to nine members, made up from a mix of cyber security experts from the private and public sectors. It will provide advice on the establishment, operation and longer-term organisational form of the CERT and the transition to this structure. The Board is also expected to build strong links with the key customers of the CERT.

“I encourage those with the cyber security know-how to put their hand up and be considered for the CERT Advisory Board,” Ms Adams says.
