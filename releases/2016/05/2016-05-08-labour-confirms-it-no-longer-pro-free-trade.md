Trade Minister Todd McClay is disappointed, but not surprised, that Labour has now confirmed that they will vote against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement legislation. 

 

“This flies in the face of Labour’s long history of welcoming free trade agreements, something fiercely backed by former trade minister Phil Goff, and former Leader Helen Clark, who said it was ‘unthinkable’ that New Zealand would not sign up to TPP,” says Mr McClay. 

 

“TPP is going to be worth billions to New Zealand and, as the China and Korea FTAs have shown, will create jobs and wealth for New Zealand.

 

“TPP meets every one of the bottom lines set by the Labour Party. New Zealand businesses will rightly be questioning how Labour, by not supporting one of the most comprehensive and valuable trade deals ever negotiated for New Zealand, can claim to support exporters to grow and create new jobs.

 

“This government strongly believes that New Zealand’s future is in being open and connected to the rest of the world. 

“TPP is part of our wider plan to diversify the economy by building strong trade, investment, and economic ties globally.

“The Asia Pacific region – the world’s fastest-growing - offers immense opportunities for New Zealand. Through agreements like the TPP we are exceptionally well-placed to take advantage of those.

“This government backs our export industries to succeed,” says Mr McClay.

“Even when our opponents won’t.”
