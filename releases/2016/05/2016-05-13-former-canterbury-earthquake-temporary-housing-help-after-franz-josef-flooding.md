Five Government-owned units used to house people after the Christchurch earthquakes will be sold to a Franz Josef hotel severely damaged by flooding in March, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today.

The Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation units from Kaiapoi Domain will be used to house hotel staff and temporary workers currently occupying hotel bedrooms at Scenic Hotel Franz Josef Glacier.

“Franz Josef is a critical tourism destination for the West Coast, and limited accommodation affects not just the hotel but also the wider region. These five units will enable staff to be housed and free up hotel rooms for tourists.

The units are among 22 temporarily located on the Kaiapoi Domain as accommodation for families while their homes were being repaired. The decision to phase down and close the temporary village was made last year, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment initiated a public sales process.

The other 17 units have been sold to two other buyers. The units are being sold at fair market price. The domain land will be remediated and returned to the Waimakariri District Council once the units have been physically removed.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service has helped more than 6260 earthquake-affected residents find temporary housing, including placing 1130-plus into temporary village accommodation. It’s great to see that these units are now sold and being repurposed to help others in another part of New Zealand,” Dr Smith says.

“The government recognises the importance of Franz Josef Glacier to the West Coast visitor industry and the unique problems posed by being in such a high-risk area for earthquakes and flooding. This accommodation is a pragmatic temporary response.

“I am also exploring with local MP Maureen Pugh, the Westland District Council and the Franz Josef community ways we can work together on a more secure future for this tourism centre in the long term.”
