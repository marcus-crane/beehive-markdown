Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced a new appointment and three reappointments to the Archives Council.

The Archives Council has a statutory role to provide the Minister with independent advice on archives and recordkeeping matters.

Dr Aroha Harris, Dr Gillian Oliver and David Reeves have been reappointed for a further term, starting on 30 May 2016. The new member is Sandra (Sandi) Beatie and she will also be starting on 30 May 2016.

They will join current members Anna Blackman, Dr Angela Wanhalla and Thomas Norcliffe.

“The reappointments reinforce the range of experience, skills and perspectives that will ensure the Archives Council has the necessary expertise to continue providing high quality advice.”

“The new appointment of Sandi Beatie brings a member with strength and experience in the information management, technology and public sector capability areas which align well with Archives New Zealand’s key priorities,” said Mr Dunne.

"I would also like to thank the outgoing member and Chair, Diane Morcom, for her commitment and valuable service for the past three years. I wish her well in the future”
