An extra $20 million will be invested over four years to maintain momentum in high performance sport and boost Drug Free Sport NZ, Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says.

“We have a world class high performance sport system, and Rio 2016 is shaping up to be our most successful Olympic Games,” Dr Coleman says.

“A $16 million investment in Budget 2016 over four years will enable High Performance Sport NZ to leverage all the work and preparation for Rio as we look ahead to the next Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.

“Success on the world sporting stage is important as it inspires Kiwis to participate in sport which leads to a more active, healthier population and ultimately better social outcomes.

“Sport is a key part of our national identity, and success at the top level also helps to promote New Zealand on a wider international stage.”

Around 220 New Zealand athletes will compete at Rio. High Performance Sport NZ is targeting 14 medals, and also 12 gold medals at the Paralympics.

The Government invests $62 million annually in High Performance Sport NZ to provide a one stop shop for high performance athlete’s needs.

Budget 2016 also invests an additional $4 million over four years for Drug Free Sport NZ.

“The integrity of sport is paramount. This extra funding will enable Drug Free Sport NZ to continue its anti-doping work which plays a crucial role in safeguarding the integrity of New Zealand’s sports system,” Dr Coleman says.
