ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today announced three reappointments to the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC).

The council represents the motorcycling community and advises ACC on safety initiatives that will make motorcycling safer on New Zealand roads

“The reappointed councillors, Janice Millman, Andrew Darrell and David Golightly, collectively bring strong management and governance expertise, combined with deep personal involvement in motorcycling and the motorcycling community,” says Ms Kaye.

“Janice is the President of the Women’s International Motorcycle Association’s New Zealand Division and has a strong background in senior leadership.

“Andrew is an experienced motorcyclist with a broad understanding of the perspectives of other riders, whilst David has extensive networks in the motorcycle industry and community and a background in motorcycle safety training. 

“The reappointments will ensure the MSAC continues to benefit from these councillors’ proven skills and passion for making New Zealand riders safer.”

Based on Ministry of Transport crash facts, motorcyclists are 21 times more likely to be killed or injured than car drivers over the same distance travelled.

“The MSAC plays a key role in influencing the work of ACC and others aimed at reducing motorcycle crashes and the impact they have on riders, their families and the community.

“Last year, I consulted on and decided to reduce the motorcycle safety levy, which pays for road safety initiatives specifically benefitting motorcyclists, from $30 to $25 per year from 1 July 2016.

“This strikes a balance between investing in safety initiatives that can reduce motorcyclists’ injuries, and not collecting too much in levies. There is currently around $15 million available in the motorcycle safety levy fund.

“To date, the MSAC’s advocacy has led to initiatives involving safer road design, rider visibility, moped and scooter safety and personal protective equipment.

“The Council is currently working with ACC to explore new initiatives focusing on rider skills, road user behaviour and motorcycle safety technology.”

**About the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC)**

The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC) is made up of motorcyclists who are committed to making riding safer for motorcyclists.

It was set up in 2011 to oversee investment of the motorcycle safety levy (MSL) fund.

The MSL is a $30 levy per motorcycle registration that’s earmarked for improving motorcyclists’ safety on New Zealand roads.

The MSAC provides advice and recommendations to ACC on investing MSL money on initiatives that will make motorcycling safer. These include research, awareness campaigns and the introduction of safer road design to reduce motorcycle crashes.

MSAC members are passionate about motorcycling and improving rider safety.

**More about the Council’s work so far**

Work to date by the Council has delivered an NZ-specific evidence base that has helped inform ACC’s input to the government’s Safer Journeys Action Plan 2016-2020, as well as a shared strategy between ACC and the Council.

The Council has helped enhance motorcyclists’ safety by:

- advocating for specific safety interventions benefitting motorcyclists on the Southern Coromandel loop road (with similar work ahead on the Northern Coromandel loop and Rimutaka Hill)
- recommending that ACC and NZTA improve the *Making Roads Motorcycle Friendly* guide, and supporting seminars to introduce the guide to road safety engineers
- establishing relationships with key sector groups able to influence motorcycle safety.
