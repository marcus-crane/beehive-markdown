Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government has approved an extra $9.7 million in funding to ensure the new Grey Base Hospital is a high quality facility with construction starting next week.

“The Government is committed to the Grey Base Hospital redevelopment and providing the services that the community needs,” says Dr Coleman.

 “Since February, the Ministry of Health and the West Coast Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group has worked closely with Fletcher Construction to finalise design costs after estimates came in over budget.

“Competitive pricing for subcontractors has taken the budget to $77.8 million which is $9.7 million above the original budget. The main driver of the extra costs are the result of the competition with the Canterbury rebuild.

“The Government is investing additional funding to ensure the service and design requirements for the new hospital remain unchanged from what was agreed with the DHB following consultation and clinical input.

“I made a commitment that construction would begin in May, and this extra funding will ensure that site work starts on Tuesday.”

The new hospital is expected to open in 2018. The 8,500sqm facility includes 56 inpatient beds, three operating theatres, and an integrated family health centre to support the delivery of primary healthcare services.

It will also house and support the delivery of other clinical services including a 24/7 emergency department, critical care unit, acute and planned medical and surgical services, maternity services, and outpatient care.
