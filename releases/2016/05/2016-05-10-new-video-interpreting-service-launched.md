Communications Minister Amy Adams has marked New Zealand Sign Language Week by announcing a new Video Interpreting Service for deaf and hearing impaired New Zealanders.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has signed a contract with CSD New Zealand for the new service, which will be available from 1 July 2016. The new service combines two existing services – the Video Relay Service and the Video Remote Interpreting Service.

“Around 4000 New Zealanders use sign language as their primary way to communicate,” says Ms Adams.

“The new Video Interpreting Service helps reduce communication barriers for deaf people making it easier for them to interact with their friends and family. It assists them in parent-teacher interviews, medical appointments, and meetings with businesses and government agencies.”

The service links any deaf or hearing impaired person with a Video Interpreter and a hearing person.

The deaf participant uses New Zealand Sign Language to communicate with the interpreter via an internet video connection. The interpreter then relays the conversation to the hearing person on the telephone or through video (if the deaf and hearing parties are in the same room). The hearing person’s messages are then relayed by the interpreter to the deaf participant through sign language.

“The new Video Interpreting Service is free and will be available from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday, and extend the typical hours of service by 4 hours per day, as the two current services are currently available from 9am to 5pm,” says Ms Adams.

New Zealand Sign Language Week runs from 9 May to 15 May. For more information see: http://deaf.org.nz/nzslw-2016-events
