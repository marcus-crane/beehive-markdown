Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye visited Warkworth Primary School in Rodney this morning to officially open the school’s new junior campus.

“All buildings in the junior school have been rebuilt, which means years one to three students and teachers now have a fantastic, innovative environment to learn and work in,” says Ms Kaye.

MP for Rodney Mark Mitchell was also at the official opening of the new campus, which comprises a classroom block containing 16 learning spaces, as well as a hall and administration area.

“This rebuild is a $7.6 million project which got under way last year, so it’s great to see the new facilities up and running in 2016,” says Ms Kaye.

Fields on the junior campus will also be developed as part of the project.

“The classrooms that the new block replaces were in poor condition, so today marks an important milestone for the school and community.

“As with any school redevelopment, the focus of the rebuild was on creating an environment that supports new ways of working and learning together, as is happening all over the country.

“The junior campus now features flexible learning spaces, all of which have high standards of acoustics and lighting and the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“Now that the junior part of the school has been upgraded, attention will turn to improving and expanding the senior campus for years four to six students.

“Warkworth Primary School is a welcoming, inclusive and high-performing school.

“As Auckland’s development spreads north the school will play an increasingly important role, so it’s great to see it being provided with facilities that will meet its needs now and into the future.”

**Notes**

**About Warkworth Primary School**

Warkworth Primary School is a state, co-educational primary school, with a current roll of around 580 students. The school consists of separate junior (years 1-3) and senior (years 4-6) campuses.

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
