Corrections is better utilising technology to improve the safety of community Corrections staff and hold offenders to account Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

Corrections has developed the staff safety mobile phone application (SSA) to enhance existing safety procedures and protocols and gives probation officers the ability to easily contact their office if they are concerned for their safety while visiting an offender’s home.

“The SSA gives probation officers a discreet way of alerting their colleagues if they find themselves in a situation where their safety is compromised and they are in need of assistance,” says Ms Collins.

The alerts sends a variety of information about the location, as well as images from the phone’s front and back camera and a short audio file.  The information also goes to a National Monitoring Centre to ensure that a response occurs swiftly.

“No staff member should ever be put in a situation where they are not confident of their safety; however, on occasion, incidents do occur.

“Some offenders have a long history of violence and intimidation as a means to getting what they want. Unlike prison staff, probation officers work in largely uncontrolled environments where they may be interacting with people affected by alcohol or drugs,” Ms Collins says.

To complement the SSA, Corrections has also developed an offender contacts application, which provides probation officers with offender information on their department issued work phone.

Staff can access information about any offender on their caseload at the touch of a button, including any alerts and relevant safety information

“Corrections has a responsibility to ensure that all staff are safe when faced with potentially volatile situations and I’m confident that staff safety will be significantly increased with these two applications,” Ms Collins says.
