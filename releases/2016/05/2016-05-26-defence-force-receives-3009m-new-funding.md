The Defence Force receives new operating funding of $300.9 million over four years as part of Budget 2016 to support the work it does, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“This funding follows the 2013 Defence Mid-Point Rebalancing Review, which determined indicative funding needs of the Defence Force to 2030,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Review continues to be implemented, and I’m pleased that this is the third year that new funding has been made available.

“The Government's long-term commitment to having a modern and responsive Defence Force is also reflected in the 2016 Defence White Paper, which will be released shortly.

“The White Paper confirms investment in major capabilities and infrastructure to deliver Defence policy out to 2030.

“The funding announced today allows the Defence Force to concurrently undertake domestic, regional and international security tasks, giving it greater options in responding to changes in the security environment,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It will provide for increases in a wide range of operational areas, such as personnel, and costs associated with new and improved capabilities.

“These increases are required for the Defence Force to carry out the tasks required of it by the Government. 

“It will also enable the continued introduction into service of new and upgraded capabilities and the regeneration of Defence properties,” Mr Brownlee says.

The new funding is made of up of $31.8 million in 2016/17 and $89.7 million in each of the following three years.
