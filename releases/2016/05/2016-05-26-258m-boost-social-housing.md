Budget 2016 invests $258 million to ensure people most in need of social housing have access to this essential service, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

“The additional investment in social housing will provide at least 750 more places for individuals and families on the social housing register with the most pressing housing needs,” Mrs Bennett says.

“A large portion of this funding is directed at social housing in Auckland, where the tight property market also has an effect on those in social housing. Rents are increasing and more social housing is required.”

Over four years, the package includes:

- $200 million for more social housing places in Auckland, costs related to redeveloping social houses in Tamaki and for increased Income Related Rent Subsidy payments because of higher rents.
- $41.1 million for emergency housing and a new Special Needs Grant.
- $7.5 million in new operating funding to manage social housing transfers to community housing providers.
- $3.7 million in 2016/17 for the Ministry of Social Development’s housing unit and the Auckland social housing team.

“MSD’s housing unit plays a critical role in getting the right people into the rightsocial housing and supporting tenants into sustainable housing, while the Auckland housing team focuses on the city’s high demand for social housing,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Government is focused on housing people in suitable houses that meet their needs, and growing a more diverse sector with community organisations playing a bigger role supporting our most vulnerable people.”
