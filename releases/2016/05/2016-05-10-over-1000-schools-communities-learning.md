Education Minister Hekia Parata says a significant milestone has been reached with more than 1000 schools now in Communities of Learning, supporting more than 320,000 kids.

Ms Parata today announced another 21 communities have been approved, taking the total number to 117.

“We’ve now got over 1000 schools involved in Communities of Learning which is 40 percent of all schools.

“This is magnificent. These communities will help drive up achievement for all kids all the way along the pathway from early learning to senior secondary.

“We have communities across all of the country, from Northland to Otago-Southland, and that’s something kids, parents, teachers, schools and their local communities will all benefit from,” says Ms Parata.

Of the Communities of Learning that have already been established, 19 have had their achievement challenges endorsed and 10 have appointed COL leaders. In addition just over 200 teachers have been appointed to new teaching roles within the Communities of Learning.

The 21 additional communities approved are in Auckland (7), Waikato (4), Bay of Plenty-Waiariki (1), Taranaki-Whanganui-Manawatu (1), Wellington (4), Nelson-Marlborough-West Coast (1), Canterbury (2) and Otago-Southland (1). They cover 175 schools and over 56,000 students including more than 13,000 Māori and 7,600 Pasifika students.

“I want to thank all the schools who have decided to systematically work together to lift every student’s achievement and I know that many more are looking to follow suit,” says Ms Parata.

“Bemoaning the state of learning from a previous sector, school, or classroom will shortly become a whinge of the past.”

The communities, funded through the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative, receive additional funding to enable teachers and principals to share teaching and leadership expertise.
