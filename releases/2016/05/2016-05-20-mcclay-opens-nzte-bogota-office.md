Trade Minister Todd McClay today announced the opening of the Bogota, Colombia office of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).

“Colombia is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand and New Zealand businesses,” says Mr McClay.

“The country has a strong economy and a strategically important location between Central and South America. Thus, having a New Zealand presence on the ground will help New Zealand businesses to be more effective in building links with businesses in Colombia,” says Mr McClay.

NZTE has appointed Colombian economist, Elvira Martinez to be country manager. She will be responsible for developing New Zealand’s commercial presence in Colombia in sectors such as agribusiness, manufacturing, technology and renewable energy.

“Currently, Colombia is New Zealand’s sixth largest export market in South America. It makes sense to have dedicated local experts as part of NZTE’s staff,” says Mr McClay.

Mr McClay’s visit to Colombia includes bilateral meetings with new Colombian Trade Minister, Maria Claudia Lacouture and with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patti Londono Jamarillo.
