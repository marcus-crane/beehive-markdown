The Government will invest around $4 million from Budget 2016 to provide new classrooms in the greater Wellington region, including Wairarapa, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today at Mt Cook School, Wellington.

“The 14 new classrooms to be built across the region are among the 480 new classrooms that were announced as part of Budget 2016 to meet roll growth,” says Ms Parata.

The schools that will receive new classrooms are:

- Karori West Normal School (4 new classrooms)
- Kapiti College (3 new classrooms)
- West Park School (2 new classrooms)
- Mt Cook School (2 new classrooms)
- Raroa Normal Intermediate (2 new classrooms)
- Alfredton School, Wairarapa (1 new classroom).

“Like other parts of New Zealand, the greater Wellington region is experiencing population growth,” says Ms Parata.

“This investment is about making sure that local schools can meet the needs of current and future students as rolls grow.”

Ms Kaye says the investment in extra classrooms announced today comes on top of nearly $100 million of funding announced for school redevelopments in the Wellington area over the past six months.

“A number of schools in the region have been affected by issues such as leaky buildings and structural issues. We’ve been acting to upgrade the condition of these schools, as well as provide extra capacity to meet roll growth,” says Ms Kaye.

“Late last year, we announced major redevelopments for schools such as Aotea College in Porirua and Wellington East Girls’ College.

“Thorndon School, Kelburn Normal School, Khandallah School, Newtown School and Ngaio School are other local schools that have had significant investments confirmed.

“This latest investment is the next step in ensuring that schools in the Wellington region have sufficient capacity, and provide students with the best education opportunities possible in innovative and safe learning environments.”
