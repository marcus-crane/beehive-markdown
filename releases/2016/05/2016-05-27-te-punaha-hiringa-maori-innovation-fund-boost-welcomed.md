Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has welcomed the additional funding allocated to Te Pūnaha Hiringa: Māori Innovation Fund announced in yesterday’s Budget.

Te Pūnaha Hiringa: Māori Innovation Fund will be expanded from $2 million to $3 million per year.

“This will help more Māori enterprises to gain the skills, knowledge and networks they need to get new ventures off the ground and grow existing businesses and asset bases,” Mr Flavell says.

“The fund is a huge help to Māori looking to take full advantage of their resources and identify the business opportunities open to them.”

Most of the funding goes towards the Commercial Advisors Scheme, which subsidises collectives to contract a commercial advisor to provide professional business advice and mentoring, Mr Flavell says.

“There’s strong demand for this scheme and the extra funding will enable even more Māori collectives to access business assistance and realise the economic potential of their assets.”

Te Pūnaha Hiringa: Māori Innovation Fund supports the implementation of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda and He Kai Kei Aku Ringa - The Māori-Crown Economic Growth Partnership, which provides a blueprint for a productive, innovative, and export-orientated Māori economy.
