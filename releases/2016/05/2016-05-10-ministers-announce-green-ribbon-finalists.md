Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry today announced the 2016 Green Ribbon Awards finalists to celebrate exceptional environmental achievements by New Zealanders.

“We are delighted to recognise these community groups, scientists, schools, councils and businesses for their innovation and achievements in the 26th annual Green Ribbon Awards,” Dr Smith says.

“This year we received a very commendable 106 nominations across the ten categories, with some projects making a positive difference over many years.

“Environmental initiatives include protecting our precious biodiversity, reducing carbon emissions, minimising waste, reducing water pollution, educating and inspiring leadership and implementing more sustainable business practice.”

Ms Barry says the finalists are doing extraordinary work in their communities to restore and protect the environment.

“All of these projects are achieving significant and measurable gains for conservation. They show innovation, are raising wider public awareness and involvement, and go the extra mile for the environment,” she says.

“We will also be presenting the Loder Cup at the Green Ribbons for the first time in its history. First awarded in 1929, it is one of the country’s oldest conservation awards and recognises outstanding work to protect our native plants.”

The Green Ribbon Awards have recognised about 200 organisations during the past 26 years.

“All the winners and finalists that have been honoured as part of the Green Ribbon Awards are an inspiration. These special projects are cleaning up past pollution, carefully managing today’s environment and safeguarding our environment for the future,” Dr Smith says.

The finalists will attend a ceremony at Parliament on 7 June, during the week of World Environment Day. Winners will be announced for each category, and then an overall supreme winner will be announced.
