Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the New Zealand Public Health and Disability (Southern DHB) Elections Bill has passed its third and final reading 95-26.

“I would like to acknowledge the cross-party support for this important piece of legislation which extends the term of the Southern DHB Commissioner and her team,” says Dr Coleman.

“Achieving financial stability at Southern DHB is a long term process. Without this legislative change the Commissioner and her team would have less than 18 months to improve the DHB’s position.

“This will enable the Commissioner and her team sufficient time to develop and implement a financially sustainable plan for quality health services for the people of Otago and Southland.

“An important part of the Commissioner’s plan is progressing the vital redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital.

“This means the next Board, to be appointed as part of the 2019 local body elections, will begin its term on a more secure financial footing.”

A Commissioner was appointed in June 2015 following serious concerns over the Board’s financial performance. A spiralling deficit had been forecast and it was expected to increase up to $42 million for 2015/16.

An improved deficit position of $35.9 million for 2015/16 for Southern DHB has been agreed, which shows progress is being made.
