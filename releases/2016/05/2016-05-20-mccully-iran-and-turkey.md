Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Tehran this weekend to meet with Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and other members of the Government, and then to Turkey for the World Humanitarian Summit.

“My visit to Tehran follows a successful visit to New Zealand by Minister Mohammad Zarif earlier this year,” Mr McCully says.

“Our discussions will cover a range of Middle East regional security issues and trade and economic relations between our two countries.

“While in Tehran I will sign an Agricultural Cooperation Arrangement, which will support exchanges between our farmers and producers, and announce the reinstatement of formal talks between Iran and New Zealand – known as the Political and Economic Cooperation Commission.”

Minister McCully will then travel to Istanbul to attend the United Nations World Humanitarian Summit.

“The World Humanitarian Summit is a chance for the international community to discuss our collective response to armed conflict and natural disasters. We will be particularly focused on highlighting the specific humanitarian needs of the Pacific region,” Mr McCully says.
