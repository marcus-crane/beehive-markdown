Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says that more than seven million breakfasts have been served in schools around the country since the Government expanded the KickStart Breakfast programme in 2013.

“With more than 114,000 breakfasts served every week to almost 28,000 children and young people we can be sure these students are getting the best start to their school day,” Mrs Tolley says.

“The KickStart programme is a true partnership between Government, Fonterra and Sanitarium, and the volunteers who run the breakfast clubs, and we’re seeing it working well.

“Ninety-nine per cent of schools are satisfied or very satisfied with the programme and are reporting positive changes in student engagement and achievement.

“So many of our communities are stepping up to ensure our children and young people have everything they need to learn and thrive.

“It will always be parents’ responsibility to ensure their children are safe, healthy and happy – and providing breakfast is a significant part of this – but if they aren’t able to do so we need to make sure their children don’t go without, and are able to make the most of their education.

“We want all New Zealand children to succeed at school and making sure they have access to a healthy breakfast is something we can all do to help.”
