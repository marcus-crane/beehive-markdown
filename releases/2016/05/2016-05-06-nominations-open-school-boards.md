Education Minister Hekia Parata is encouraging parents and others in the community to put themselves forward for School Board of Trustee elections now that nominations have opened.

“In our self-managing education system board members have big say in how our schools are run, what they teach and how they engage with students and the wider community,” says Ms Parata. “I urge all those who think they have something to offer to consider standing for election.

“You don’t need to be a parent or have a child at school but you do need

a broad, diverse perspective and a desire to see kids succeed and achieve.

Ms Parata says it is also important that boards reflect their communities by having a good balance of gender, ethnicity and skills. “Schools need people from as many walks of life as possible - parents, families, whānau, aiga, caregivers, hapū, and iwi representatives.”

School boards are responsible for the governance of schools, setting goals, determining strategic direction, monitoring schools’ performances, and raising the achievement of each and every student.

This is the 10th time board elections have been held since the introduction of self-managed schools in 1989. The board elections are one of the largest democratic processes in New Zealand.  Boards are being elected for 2400 state and state-integrated schools and more than 18,000 positions are available.

Nominations open today and close on 20 May and voting takes place by postal ballot between 25 May and 3 June.

Anyone with a child at school can nominate themselves or someone else for their school’s board of trustees.
