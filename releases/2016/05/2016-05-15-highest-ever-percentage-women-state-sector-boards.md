New Zealand now has the highest ever percentage of women on state sector boards and committees, Minister for Women Louise Upston announced today.

“I am pleased to report that women represented 43.4 per cent of state sector boards and committees, at the end of 2015. This is a significant increase on 41.7 per cent in 2014.

51.4 percent of Ministerial appointments to boards in 2015 were women.

Ms Upston also challenged the private sector employers to encourage the next level of leaders.

“Whilst women’s participation on public sector boards and committees has been over 40 per cent for the past decade, the private sector still lags behind with women’s representation on boards at only 17 per cent.”

“Through identifying, supporting and encouraging young women to reach their potential, we will broaden the pipeline and see more women in higher levels of leadership.”

“Having women at the board table isn’t just about numbers. It’s about better decision making, organisational resilience and the economic and productivity gains that come from gender balance in leadership,” Ms Upston said.

“Research has shown the benefits of gender diversity on boards and we are pleased to see that New Zealand boards are taking action.”

“By continuing to work together over the next year we have a great opportunity to reach the Government’s goal of 45 per cent of women on state sector boards and committees,” she said.

The Gender Stocktake of State Sector Boards and Committees is undertaken annually by the Ministry for Women. It counts the Ministerial appointments to state sector boards and committees as at 31 December 2015. The full stocktake is available at [www.women.govt.nz](http://www.women.govt.nz/).
