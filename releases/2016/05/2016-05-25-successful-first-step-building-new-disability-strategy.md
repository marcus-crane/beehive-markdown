Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner says the first round of consultation on the development of a new disability strategy for New Zealand has been a great success.

“587 individuals and organisations completed an online survey and a further 35 submissions were received in other ways – including five providing feedback via video.

“Thousands of people visited the ‘jointheconversation.nz’ website, hundreds attended workshops throughout the country and more than 10,000 people viewed a video featuring disabled people called ‘I have a voice’,” Ms Wagner says.

“I would like to thank all those who shared their thoughts and experiences online and in person. It’s been fantastic to hear people having open and honest conversations about what it’s like to live with an impairment in New Zealand. The huge amount of feedback shows just how important the topic is.

“One in four New Zealanders are limited by a physical, sensory, learning, mental health or other impairment and it’s important that they have a strong voice in how they can lead a good life, feel valued and participate in their communities.

“Feedback from the consultation will now be analysed and a new strategy drafted. The draft strategy will be taken back to the community for a second round of consultation in late July and August,” Ms Wagner says.
