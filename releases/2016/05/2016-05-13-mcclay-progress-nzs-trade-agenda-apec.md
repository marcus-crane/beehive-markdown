Trade Minister Todd McClay leaves for South America this weekend to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) on 17-18 May in Peru and then to visit Bogota, Colombia, on 19 May. 

APEC Trade Ministers will be focusing on Peru’s themes of ‘Quality of Growth and Human Development’ with a particular focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), trade in services, and advancing the collective vision of the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).  

“APEC provides the platform to meet and progress economic and trade issues with some of our most important trading partners. New Zealand exports over $NZD36 billion worth of goods and $NZD11 billion worth of services to APEC members every year,” says Mr McClay.

Following the MRT, Mr McClay will visit Bogota, Colombia. 

“In Bogota I will meet with Colombia’s incoming Trade Minister, María Claudia Lacouture, to discuss our growing relationship and the major potential there for New Zealand businesses. New Zealand’s relationship with Colombia has significant promise, with increasing trade links, particularly in the agribusiness sector, and almost 900 Colombian students enrolled at New Zealand educational institutions last year,” says Mr McClay.

Colombia is the fourth largest economy in Latin America and is a key member of the dynamic Pacific Alliance regional grouping.
