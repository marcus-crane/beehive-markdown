Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the health targets continue to drive performance across the health system, with the gains made in the previous quarter largely maintained.

“The health targets are important as they help to deliver better, faster access to key health services for New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“The elective surgery target has again been achieved with 146,018 elective surgical discharges provided for the year to date – 7,992 more than planned.  

“We’re committed to delivering more elective surgery to meet demand. We’ve delivered around 50,000 more surgeries over the last seven years.

“The more heart and diabetes checks target was met for the third consecutive quarter. Around 1.2 million people have had their cardiovascular disease risk assessed in the past five years.

“The latest update also shows DHBs have maintained the results made in the previous quarter on shorter stays in ED and faster cancer treatment. These results are a credit to our health workforce across the country.”

The health target results for Quarter Three 2015/16 (January-March) show:

- 94 per cent of patients were admitted, discharged or transferred from the ED within six hours – while the same result as the previous quarter, over 7,500 more patients presented to ED than the last quarter.
- Results for the faster cancer treatment target remained at 75 per cent.
- 86 per cent of PHO enrolled patients were offered help to quit smoking, up one per cent.
- Immunisation coverage for 8-month-olds dropped slightly to 93 per cent, this is consistent with dips in quarter three in previous years.

The new childhood obesity health target will replace the more heart and diabetes checks target from 1 July. Heart and diabetes checks will remain an accountability measure for DHBs to ensure the gains made are not lost.
