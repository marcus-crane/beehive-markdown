Budget 2016 will provide $14.4 million over four years for more apprenticeship training, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

“A strengthening labour market, a rebuilt industry training system and improvements in school achievement are resulting in greater demand for apprenticeships, as young people rightly see them as a great way to get into, and stay in, a rewarding career,” Mr Joyce says.

“Last year the number of new starts for apprenticeships like carpentry, plumbing and electrical engineering were at the highest levels in nearly a decade. There were more than 42,000 people enrolled in apprenticeships and apprenticeship training in 2015. This funding will help support another 5,500 apprentices by 2020.

“In 2013/14 the Government carried out major industry training reforms. Since then, both apprenticeship numbers and, more importantly, completion rates have increased.”

In 2014 the number of those in apprenticeship training was up by 11.5 per cent on the previous year and completion rates for apprentices were 88 per cent, compared with 72 per cent in 2009.

“We’re keen to stay on this roll and help people not just into employment, but into a lifelong career,” he says.

The new funding will also help meet projected skill shortages in high-demand industries like construction and infrastructure.

“The construction sector is growing strongly throughout the country. Increased apprenticeship numbers will help fill skill gaps and provide the new people needed to maintain that growth,” Mr Joyce says.
