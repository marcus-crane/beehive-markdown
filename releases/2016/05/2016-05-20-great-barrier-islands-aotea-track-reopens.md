One of New Zealand’s finest walks has been reopened on Great Barrier Island today, marking the end of work to restore damage caused by the June 2014 storm.

Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says the official reopening of the Aotea Track by local MP Nikki Kaye completes the Department of Conservation’s repair work on the island.

“The Aotea Track, which runs for 25km through the heart of the island, is one of Great Barrier’s major tourism draws and is important to its economy.”

In June 2014, the Auckland region was hit by a ferocious storm which caused extensive damage to Great Barrier’s infrastructure and DOC assets

“More than 440mm of rain fell over three days, including 304mm in just four hours over the night of June 10.”

Landslides and slips destroyed bridges and wiped out whole sections of track, including large parts of the 25 km long Aotea Track through the mountainous heart of the island.

“Most of the damage was repaired within six months, but four tracks, including the Kaiaraara section of the Aotea walk, needed more extensive work,” Ms Barry says.

“Five bridges and 13 sections of the Kaiaraara Track had to be rebuilt at a cost of $353,000 before it could be reopened.”

The full 25km Aotea Track loop has now been restored and can once again be enjoyed by trampers.

“A truly world-class multi-day walk, the Aotea Track forms the centrepiece of the Aotea Conservation Park which covers more than 40 per cent of Great Barrier and was opened last year,” Ms Barry says.

“It features beautiful native bush including kauri, rimu and the Great Barrier tree daisy, which is unique to the island. Walkers also have the opportunity to see kaka, kakariki and fernbirds among other native wildlife, only a 30 minute flight from Auckland.”
