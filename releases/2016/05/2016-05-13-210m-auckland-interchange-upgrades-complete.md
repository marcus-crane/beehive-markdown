Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened the Te Atatū and Lincoln Road Interchanges, a $210 million Government investment to increase capacity and ensure greater resilience for Auckland’s roading network.

The two projects on Auckland’s State Highway 16 are the first in a series of improvements to be completed this year as part of the Western Ring Route, one of the Government’s Roads of National Significance.

The $145 million Lincoln Road interchange and $65 million Te Atatū interchange will free up traffic flow on the Northwestern Motorway and extended bus shoulders along SH16 will improve bus journey times during peak periods.   

“These two projects are the first of several improvements to be opened this year as part of the Western Ring Route – the biggest infrastructure project in New Zealand, and a project that’s been sixty years in the making,” Mr Bridges says.

“The $2.4 billion Western Ring Route is a crucial part of this Government’s commitment to help promote economic growth, productivity and journey reliability. Once completed the 48-kilometre route will create a seamless motorway connection between Manukau and Albany along State Highways 20, 16 and 18.

“Widening these sections of the Northwestern motorway from two to three lanes will increase capacity to help deal with Auckland’s growing population and freight demands.

“Together the Lincoln Road and Te Atatū interchanges will work to create greater travel time reliability and resilience by offering an efficient additional route to get across and around Auckland,” Mr Bridges says.

Further projects currently underway as part of the Western Ring Route and due to be completed later this year include the Causeway Upgrade and the St Lukes to Great North Road Project, with the Waterview Connection due to be opened in early 2017.
