Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced that entries are open for the 50th annual New Zealand International Business Awards (NZIBA).

The awards celebrate the success of New Zealand businesses around the world and recognise professional excellence and innovative practice.

“We want to hear from New Zealand businesses that are successfully exporting overseas because their success contributes to this country’s achievements in doing business globally,” Mr Joyce says.

During the last half century some of New Zealand’s most iconic businesses have been inducted into the awards’ Hall of Fame, including Crown Lynn, Tonka, Gallagher, Telecom and Guthrie Bowron.

Mr Joyce says entering these awards takes businesses on a journey of critical analysis.

“The awards programme is designed to be rigorous, and is a great opportunity to benchmark your business against other high achievers,” Mr Joyce says.

The awards are run by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) with support from Strategic Partner ANZ.

Entries close Friday July 8. To enter the 2016 New Zealand International Business Awards, and for more information, visit [www.nziba.co.nz](http://www.nziba.co.nz).
