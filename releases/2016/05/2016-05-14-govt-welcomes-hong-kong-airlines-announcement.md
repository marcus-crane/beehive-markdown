Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed Hong Kong Airlines’ announcement that it intends to operate daily flights between Hong Kong and Auckland from November this year.

“This announcement further strengthens the flourishing tourism and trade between New Zealand, Hong Kong and mainland China,” Mr Bridges says.

“Hong Kong is small but densely populated, with a population of 6.5 million. Nearly 40,000 Hong Kong residents visited New Zealand in the past 12 months, and over 17,000 New Zealanders chose Hong Kong as their main travel destination.

“Hong Kong is an important trading partner for us in its own right, but also acts as a gateway for our exports into mainland China.

“Its plan to operate services direct to Auckland shows that Hong Kong Airlines sees our strong relationship continuing to grow.

“This proposal is the 19th new air route confirmed over the last year – showing the Government’s liberal air services policy is making it easier for New Zealanders to travel and trade,” Mr Bridges says.
