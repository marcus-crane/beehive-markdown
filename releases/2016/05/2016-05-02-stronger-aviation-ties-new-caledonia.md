Arrangements agreed today open up new opportunities for airlines to fly between New Zealand and New Caledonia.

Transport Minister Simon Bridges and New Caledonia President Philippe Germain today formalised new air services arrangements negotiated in November 2015. These included amendments to New Zealand's 1967 Air Transport Agreement with France, which pertain to New Caledonia.

President Germain is visiting New Zealand along with French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls.

“Under the new agreement, airlines from New Zealand and New Caledonia now have the opportunity to operate additional services to the other,” Mr Bridges says.

“The agreement will also make the process easier for New Zealand airlines to fly from New Caledonia to other international destinations in future.

“The two countries are close Pacific neighbours, with nearly 30,000 passengers travelling between them each year. Arrangements such as these, which assist the movement of people and goods, are an important part of the relationship.”

Mr Bridges says this another example of the Government’s success in negotiating air services agreements.

“With more than 50 new or amended air service agreements negotiated over the last four years, the Government’s International Air Transport Policy is bringing a number of benefits to New Zealand including tourism and trade.

“In the last year alone, 18 new air routes have been announced, making it easier for New Zealanders to travel and trade internationally.”
