The Government’s investment in health will reach a record $16.1 billion in 2016/17, Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman says.

“Delivering better health services remains this Government’s number one funding priority. Budget 2016 delivers on that by investing an extra $2.2 billion in health over four years for new initiatives and to meet cost pressures and population growth.

“An extra $568 million will be invested in 2016/17 - the biggest increase in seven years, and almost $170 million more than last year.

“DHBs will benefit from an extra $400 million in 2016/17 to invest in services, improve access, and to meet cost pressures and population growth.

“This investment in Budget 2016 will help New Zealanders continue to access the healthcare they need. The new Health Strategy sets the direction for a more integrated and patient-centred system. We want more services delivered in the community, with more prevention and self-management,” Dr Coleman says.

This extra funding over the next four years includes:

- $124 million for Pharmac to provide more access to new medicines.
- $96 million to provide more elective surgery, a key Government priority.
- $39.3 million to start the roll-out of a bowel screening programme.
- $42 million for vulnerable groups:
  
  - $18 million to expand the Healthy Homes Initiative which aims to reduce preventable diseases in young children.
  - $12 million to increase support for primary care and social services to enable people to access mental health help earlier.
  - $12 million to expand a successful programme that provides intensive alcohol and drug support for pregnant women.
