“I am very pleased to appoint Peter Hughes as the next State Services Commissioner and Head of State Services,” says Mr Key.

“Peter has dedicated his working life to the public service and is one of New Zealand’s most experienced and respected Public Service Chief Executives.

“The State Services Commissioner is a vital role, leading and overseeing the performance and integrity of the State Services, employing most Public Service Chief Executives, as well as driving the ongoing improvements of the State sector and how it operates.

“Peter has strong relationships with other Public Service leaders, Ministers and Members of Parliament across the political spectrum, as well as business, industry and union leaders. He will be an effective leader of our public service.”

Mr Hughes is currently the Chief Executive and Secretary for Education, a role he has held since February 2013.

Mr Hughes replaces Iain Rennie, who has held the position since 2008.

“I would like to thank Iain for his work, he has made a significant contribution to New Zealand State Services. I wish him all the very best for the future,” says Mr Key.

The State Services Commissioner is appointed under the State Sector Act 1988 by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The Minister of State Services had oversight of the recruitment process on the Prime Minister’s behalf.
