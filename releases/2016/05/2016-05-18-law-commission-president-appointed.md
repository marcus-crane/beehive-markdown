Former Appeal Court Judge Hon Douglas White QC has been appointed as the next President of the Law Commission, Justice Minister Amy Adams announced today. 

Justice White was appointed as a part-time Law Commissioner in February and becomes President effective immediately, as Sir Grant Hammond is stepping down after nearly six years in the role.

“Justice White is a distinguished lawyer and judge, and I’m pleased that a jurist of his calibre is set to lead the Commission,” Ms Adams says.     

Ms Adams paid tribute to Sir Grant for his work since appointed President in December 2010.

“Sir Grant has provided the Commission with very able leadership throughout his tenure. The Commission has given valuable and accessible advice on a wide variety of complex and sensitive issues.”   

The Law Commission is an independent Crown body charged with the systematic review, reform, and development of the law. It investigates and reports to Parliament on how laws can be improved in specific areas it is asked to investigate by the minister responsible.
