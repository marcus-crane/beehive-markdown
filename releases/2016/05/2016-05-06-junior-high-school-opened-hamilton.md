Education Minister Hekia Parata today welcomed the official opening of Rototuna Junior High School in Hamilton.

The school, which caters for Year 7 to 10 students, opened its doors at the beginning of the year with the largest-ever first day intake of students – 634.

“The size of the opening day roll is testament to the vision and hard work of the Establishment Board of Trustees and Principal Fraser Hill,” says Ms Parata, who was due to attend the official opening, but was prevented by fog from getting to Hamilton.

“I’d also like to pay tribute to my colleague and Member of Parliament for Hamilton East David Bennett for his advocacy on behalf of the fastest growing area of the city.

“Rototuna Junior High is grounded in the community with strong partnerships with local iwi Ngāti Wairere, as well as councils, other local schools, tertiary providers, local businesses and other community organisations.

“Its modern facilities will encourage students to collaborate, co-operate, be independent, take risks, be self-regulating, solve problems and have fun learning,” Ms Parata says. “And from next term they’ll be able to do this in specialist learning areas including Food Technology, Performing Arts Studios, Music Suites, and a Recording Studio.”

The school uses the latest environmental technology, such as collecting rainwater for non-drinking purposes, and using intelligent controllers for lighting and heating.

It had a construction budget of $60 million but is on track to be completed for considerably less. From the first term of next year it will be joined by Rototuna Senior High, which will share the site and some facilities.

“The school’s vision is ‘Connect, Inspire and Soar’, like the local Kahu which flies regularly over the school site,” says Ms Parata.

“I look forward to seeing its students doing their best at the school, and going out into the world to succeed.”
