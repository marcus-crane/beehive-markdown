The Government will invest an additional $20 million over four years to further support tourism across New Zealand, Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key announced today.

*“*This funding builds on the wide range of Government support already in place to assist the sector to provide high-quality experiences that attract high-value visitors all year round,” Mr Key says.

“The new funding, which is in addition to the over $130 million a year the Government currently spends, aims to help all regions realise their tourism potential and reap the economic benefits that it brings.”

The $20 million over four years will go towards:

- A new Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Fund to help communities with small infrastructure projects that enhance visitor experiences and help them cope with growing numbers of tourists and independent travellers, such as Freedom Campers. ($12 million over four years).
- Additional funding for Tourism New Zealand to target key growth markets ($8 million over four years).

“We recognise that some of our smaller communities need extra facilities to deal with the increase in tourist numbers, and in particular manage Freedom Campers,” says Mr Key.  “Budget 2016 will include a new $12 million fund to help them fund some of their smaller infrastructure needs.

“The Budget also includes an extra $8 million over four years for Tourism New Zealand to target key growth markets such as India and the eastern seaboard of the United States which have huge potential.

“Our tourism industry is in good heart. More visitors are coming, staying longer and spending more. These new initiatives will help grow our tourism industry even further and all ensure more regions and New Zealanders are benefiting.”
