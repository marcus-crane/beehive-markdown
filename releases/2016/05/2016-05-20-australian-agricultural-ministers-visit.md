Primary Industries Ministers Nathan Guy and Jo Goodhew have welcomed Australian Ministers of Agriculture to New Zealand for a study tour and forum.

“The primary industries are the engine room of both New Zealand and Australia, and an important goal of both countries is growth in value-added products,” says Mr Guy.

“The study tour has focused on exciting progress being made by the Primary Growth Partnership, which involves industry and Government co-investing in innovation. It is helping develop value-added products and services, through new science and technology,” says Mr Guy. 

On the study tour, Ministers visited Plant & Food Research to learn about plant breeding technologies, and Villa Maria Winery to hear about the Lifestyle Wines PGP programme which is developing lower alcohol and lower calorie wine.

They were also briefed on two other PGP programmes—Precision Seafood Harvesting (PSH) and SPATnz.

“New Zealand and Australia are also successfully partnering to prepare for the event of a significant biosecurity threat, including the unlikely event of a foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak,” says Mr Guy.

“It is well known that an outbreak of FMD in either country would have devastating impacts. It makes sense for us to work together and share our knowledge and experience.

“Veterinarians and industry officials from New Zealand and Australia have participated in first-hand field experience with FMD in Nepal. There is also  mutual understanding of how systems operate in both countries, meaning staff can rapidly integrate into each other’s systems in the event they are needed,” says Mr Guy.

“This AGMIN event is a great opportunity for continuing to build on the already strong relationship between Australia and New Zealand,” says Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew.

“I am pleased to be able to welcome our Australian colleagues, and to show them some of the great research our high-tech food businesses are doing,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The visiting Ministers and officials are from the Australian federal government, New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territories, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
