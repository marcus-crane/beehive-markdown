Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York next week for meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council.

“The United Nations General Assembly has called for a high-level debate on the peace and security challenges that the UN currently faces,” Mr McCully says.

“This is an opportunity to make the case for the UN to invest more in conflict prevention, in order to address threats to security before they escalate. 

“As the current President of the UN Security Council, Egypt is hosting a ministerial debate on counter-terrorism. This will focus on steps to combat extremist ideology,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully will deliver New Zealand’s statements at both events and will also meet with a number of Foreign Ministers in support of Helen Clark’s campaign to become the next UN Secretary-General.
