Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman say the Government is investing up to $500,000 from the Major Events Development Fund into the 2016 Youth Sailing World Championship.

“This is a world-class sailing event which New Zealand has a proud heritage in. It’s great that we have been able to secure this opportunity to continue our fine record of hosting international sailing regattas,” Mr Joyce says.

“It also presents another excellent opportunity to showcase New Zealand to visitors from across the world.”

“We have a great tradition of sailing in New Zealand. It’s an important sport for New Zealanders at both the local and elite levels,” Dr Coleman says.

“Around 400 competitors from the best young sailing talent across the world will be competing in Auckland.”

The Youth Worlds are being hosted in conjunction with World Sailing and Yachting New Zealand in Auckland from 14 – 20 December 2016.

The event is open to over 70 countries including USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and South Africa.

Sailors aged 15 to 19 will compete for both individual titles and overall, as a country, for the Nations Trophy. First introduced in 1991, the Nations Trophy is awarded annually to the top performing nation. New Zealand has been awarded the trophy twice, in 1994 and 2002. 

The Government is committed to working with New Zealand's major events sector to help attract, retain, grow and enhance selected high quality major events in New Zealand.

The Government invests, through the MEDF, in major events that generate significant immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand that align with wider Government objectives through leverage and legacy outcomes.
