Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced that social enterprise and community sector leadership organisations can now apply for grants under the Community Leadership Fund – Hapori Whakatipu.

“The new contestable fund provides up to $500,000 annually to support the development of community sector leadership and social enterprise.

“Increasing the sustainability and resilience of the Community and Voluntary sector as a whole will help strengthen New Zealand communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The priorities of the fund are to support collaboration and connection across social enterprise, volunteering, and community led-development. The fund complements other grants available for operational and project costs for individual community organisations.

“This is an exciting new era for community funding. With this fund we are supporting organisations that will provide guidance and support to smaller organisations across the country,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Applications for the Community Leadership Fund - Hapori Whakatipu open today and run until 15 June 2016.
