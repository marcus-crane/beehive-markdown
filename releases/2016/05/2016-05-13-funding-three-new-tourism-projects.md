Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the Government is investing in three new projects to help boost tourism in the regions.

“Tourism is a significant part of our economy and a major employer,” says Mr Key. “Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government is investing $8 million per year to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities in the tourism sector.”

The new projects are:

- $2.5 million for Te Puia, for new facilities at the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute in Rotorua, including a new bone, stone and pounamu carving school, a ta moko (Maori tattoo) studio and a taonga gallery.
- Just over $1.2 million for Timber Trail Adventures Limited for the development of an 80-bed lodge located at the halfway point on the Timber Trail cycleway at Piropiro in the Waikato.
- $500,000 for Queenstown Bungy for an innovative world-first bungy launch system at their Nevis site.

“The Government has now invested $14.6 million in 22 projects. This is in addition to the applicants’ contributions of $44.3 million, giving a total $59 million investment in the tourism industry,” says Mr Key. “We want to attract more visitors to New Zealand and projects such as these will help us do that.”
