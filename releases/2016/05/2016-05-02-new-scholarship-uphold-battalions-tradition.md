Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that a new education research scholarship worth $15,000 a year for up to two years is to be awarded in honour of the 28th (Māori) Battalion.

“The Education Research Masters Scholarship will be awarded by the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund to support an exciting, up-and-coming education thinker examining ways to ensure even more Māori enjoy and achieve education success as Māori,” says Ms Parata.

The fund commemorates Victoria Cross winner Second Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu and other members of the 28th Battalion. It was established to promote Māori education.

“We have made great gains in Māori education in recent times, but there is still much to do. The more bright minds we have focussed on raising achievement, the better,” says Ms Parata who is chair of the Scholarship Fund Board.

The new scholarship will be awarded to a student undertaking research that is relevant to major education policies and in particular the impact on Māori achieving education success as Māori.

In addition to financial support, the winner will secure a paid internship with the Ministry of Education for up to six weeks for each year of study.

Applications for the six scholarships offered by the fund opened today.  They are:

- three undergraduate awards of $10,000 per year for up to five years
- the masters education research award
- one masters award of$15,000 per year for up to two years
- one doctoral scholarship of $25,000 per year for up to two years to support a candidate through the final 24 months of study.

“Each of the successful applicants will have an excellent academic and cultural record and demonstrate the characteristics of the 28th (Māori) Battalion: leadership, service and excellence,” Ms Parata says.

Applications close 30 September 2016.
