Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner congratulates the New Zealand Defence Force team on their success at the 2016 Invictus games in Florida.

The Invictus Games are a Paralympic-style sporting championship for wounded, injured and sick military servicemen and women, both serving and veterans.

“I congratulate the outstanding performance of the New Zealand team. The team of 21 competitors have won 9 medals. It’s a tremendous result that the team should be extremely proud of,” Ms Wagner says.

“Using sport as means of promoting rehabilitation and recovery is an underlying principle of the event. The results show just how effective sports can be at helping disabled people to overcome obstacles.

“The Games bring out the best in those with impairments and show the tremendous results they can achieve post injury. Through their hard work and determination, the competitors serve as excellent role models for the disabled community and wider New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.
