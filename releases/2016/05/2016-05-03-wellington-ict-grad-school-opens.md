Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has this evening opened Wellington’s new ICT Graduate School.

The Wellington ICT Graduate School is the second of three new schools around the country designed to lift the number of ICT graduates available to staff New Zealand’s fast-growing software and software services industry. 

“The Wellington ICT Graduate School is a collaboration between Victoria University, WelTec and Whitireia. It has the strong backing from the ICT industry who are represented on the governing board, and thriving relationships with local companies and networks,” Mr Joyce says.

“Wellington is home to some highly successful technology-based companies.  Students at the new ICT Graduate School will have access to the Capital’s best and brightest minds in the ICT sector. Courses will combine a strong vocational emphasis that is firmly grounded in industry relationships, with strong academic rigour.

“The Wellington ICT Graduate School will offer four Masters-level programmes as well as Ph.D programmes. It also plans to offer graduate and post-graduate diplomas. Students will have opportunities to complete paid Summer of Tech internships, or Creative HQ start-up programmes.”

Close working relationships with local innovation networks, such as Summer of Tech, Creative HQ and BizDojo, as well as with the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency (WREDA) and the Wellington Tech Hub will offer students opportunities to gain practical business skills and access to mentoring and experience. The Wellington City Council is also supporting the ICT Graduate School to be based out of the Wellington Tech Hub at BizDojo on Tory Street in downtown Wellington.

“This will see the school turn out industry-ready graduates capable of leading innovations in digital technology in a growing sector.” Mr Joyce says.  “The Wellington ICT Graduate School will be a huge help in meeting the skills needs of the ICT Sector.”
