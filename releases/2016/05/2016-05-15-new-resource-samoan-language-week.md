Samoa Language Week this year for the first time includes a new education resource to help people learn Gagana Samoa, the Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

*Vaiaso o le Gagana Samoa: Samoan Language Week* runs from Sunday May 29 until Saturday 4 June.

“The challenge for all of us during this language week is to find opportunities to use Gagana Samoa more in our community, churches and workplaces.  We also need to keep using the language for rest of the year,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The first education resource co-created by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples and Museum of Te Papa Tongarewa, with the help of Samoan Language Week partners, is being released in time for Samoan Language Week.

“Sixty per cent of Samoans in New Zealand speak Gagana Samoa and it is the third most commonly spoken language.  I would like to see that number grow and *Vaiaso o le Gagana Samoa: Samoan Language Week* is a time to focus on how we can make that happen,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The resource is a response to requests from schools and communities for more tools to help teach Gagana Samoa and participate in Samoan Language Week.

“The resource supports Samoan Language Week with an explanation of the theme, pronunciation support, helpful words and phrases and a lot of activity ideas,” Minister Lotu-Iiga says.

The theme for the week is *E felelei manu, ae ma’au i o latou ofaga: Birds migrate to environments where they survive and thrive.* It explores how identity, environments, diversity and sustainability are crucial aspects of creating communities where people are supported to learn and use Gagana Samoa.
