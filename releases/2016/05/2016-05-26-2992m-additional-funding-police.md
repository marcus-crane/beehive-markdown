Budget 2016 demonstrates the Government’s continued commitment to preventing and reducing crime, with Police receiving an extra $299.2 million primarily for pay increases, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

“Since June 2011 the crime rate has fallen by 16 per cent, resulting in over 53,000 fewer crimes. Police are continuing to deliver good outcomes for New Zealanders,” Ms Collins says.

“This additional funding will enable Police to further improve the services it provides, with a continued focus on preventing crime, reducing victimisation and keeping communities safe.”

The operating funding over four years, which includes $49.2 million from a Budget 2015 contingency, will fund:

- $279.9 million for Police pay increases.
- $8.2 million for the child protection offenders register development and operating costs.
- $6.4 million to ensure Police comply with the provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009.
- $4.7 million to cover the first two years of the new operating costs of Christchurch’s Justice and Emergency Services Precinct.

The funding for pay increases is on top of $30.6 million provided in February 2016.

“This additional funding will ensure the Police can continue their focus on preventing crime,” Ms Collins says.

In total the justice sector receives $837 million over the next four years, plus $56 million in 2015/16.
