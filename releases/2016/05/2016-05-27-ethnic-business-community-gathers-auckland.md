More than 400 delegates from around New Zealand and overseas have gathered in Auckland for the 5th EPIC conference today.

“New Zealand’s economy is largely dependent on international trade.  Our increasing diversity brings significant benefits to our regional and economic growth with international connections, innovative thinking, and increased trade and investment,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world.   

A quarter of all people who call New Zealand home were born overseas and the region is home to more than 200 different ethnicities.

Ethnic People in Commerce is organised by the Office of Ethnic Communities with private sector sponsorship to promote links between mainstream and ethnic business communities. 

Delegates have heard from business leaders including Traci Houpapa, Sir George Fistonich and Wei Gao.  The Prime Minister, John Key, also spoke at the conference.

“Ethnic New Zealanders have a range of skills and experience that can contribute to the broader Government goals for creating jobs and promoting economic growth and regional development,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I am encouraged that you will be making connections, and exchanging ideas that will help us unlock the benefits of diversity for New Zealand in a connected global market.”
