The Government’s support for Christchurch has topped $17 billion as new arrangements bring in an exciting phase of regeneration, the Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee says.

“Since the earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, the Government has backed greater Christchurch and our financial support has helped people make huge strides in their recovery,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The forecast financial commitment now stands at a total of more than $17 billion, around $700 million more than signalled in the last Budget. The Government is supporting initiatives for peoples’ wellbeing, the repair of homes, rebuilding roads and anchor projects that will revitalise the central city.

“The recovery phase in greater Christchurch formally came to an end last month, with the expiry of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 and the end of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority.

“The move to local leadership has begun with the establishment of Regenerate Christchurch, jointly funded by the Government and Christchurch City Council, to oversee the regeneration of key areas of Christchurch.

“Ōtākaro Limited, a new Crown-owned company, is continuing the development of central city anchor projects and precincts.

“A new unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Greater Christchurch Group, is co-ordinating the Government’s role in the regeneration, providing advice to Ministers and monitoring and reporting on progress in greater Christchurch.

“These changes are not just about rebuilding, but fulfilling the long-held potential of these areas,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Government is progressively stepping back so local institutions such as the Christchurch City Council can take on more of a leadership role. But the new arrangements we’ve put in place mean the Government’s support of the region and its people will remain.”
