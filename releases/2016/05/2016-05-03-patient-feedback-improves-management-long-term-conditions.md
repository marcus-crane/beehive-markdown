Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a group of patients is providing useful feedback on the way long-term conditions are managed.

“It’s estimated that two out of three New Zealand adults have at least one long-term condition and it’s the leading cause of preventable death,” says Dr Coleman.

“The management of long-term conditions like diabetes, depression, asthma, cardiovascular disease and arthritis are a major health challenge for New Zealanders and their families.”

To help improve the management of these diseases ten patients from across the country were pulled together to establish the Health Consumer Advisory Service in February 2015. It provides feedback on ways to improve systems and services.

In its first year the Service has been involved in a range of issues, including the revised Pharmacy Action Plan which will be launched in the coming months.

The Service has also provided feedback on the management of Hepatitis C, the self-management of cardiovascular disease, governance of cardiac registries, and the use of technology in General Practice.

“Long-term conditions have a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families. It’s important people receive the support and services needed to better manage their conditions,” says Dr Coleman.

“We recognise the value in having patients involved in designing health services. This approach is reflected in the New Zealand Health Strategy which I recently launched.

“I’d like to acknowledge and thank the Service for their contribution and commitment.”
