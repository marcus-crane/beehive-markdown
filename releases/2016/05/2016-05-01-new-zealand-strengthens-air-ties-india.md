New Zealand’s new air services agreement with India strengthens ties with one of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies.

Transport Minister Simon Bridges signed the agreement with Sanjeev Balyan, India’s Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, in Auckland today.

The signing was witnessed by Prime Minister John Key and India’s President Pranab Mukherjee.

“New Zealand airlines now have the opportunity to code-share to seven cities in India - Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai and New Delhi,” Mr Bridges says.

“India is an emerging superpower, and its population of 1.25 billion people presents enormous opportunities for New Zealand.

“Our annual trade with India is worth more than $1 billion. In the year to 31 March 2016, almost 52,000 Kiwis travelled to India and close to 60,000 Indians visited New Zealand. In addition, more than 160,000 people of Indian descent live here.

“Today’s signing will boost tourism, trade and personal ties between our two countries.”

Mr Bridges says the Government’s liberal International Air Transport Policy is bringing many benefits to New Zealand.

“Since the policy was implemented in 2012 more than 50 new or amended air agreements have been negotiated, bringing the total to 78. Most of the major airlines in the world are now able to operate services to New Zealand without restriction, with 18 new air routes announced in the past year alone.

“Our success in negotiating Air Services Agreements is providing New Zealand access to a large wealth of benefits including tourism and trade. We’ll continue our efforts to grow and enhance these connections, making it easier for New Zealanders to travel and trade internationally.”
