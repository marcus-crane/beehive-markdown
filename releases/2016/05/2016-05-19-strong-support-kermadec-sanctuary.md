A Colmar Brunton poll showing 89 per cent of New Zealanders support the proposed new sanctuary around the Kermadec Islands reinforces the wide mandate for progressing this ocean protection initiative, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“This 89 per cent level of support for the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary, which was announced by Prime Minister John Key last year, is phenomenal and the highest I can recall for any political issue in a Colmar Brunton poll. It shows this initiative connects with New Zealand’s core values.

“New Zealanders have a strong cultural association with the ocean from our geography, as well as our Maori and European heritage. We are also very aware of the threats to the ocean environment thanks to the advocacy of people such as the late Sir Peter Blake, and we want New Zealand to be leading in marine protection.”

The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary fully protects the 620,000 square kilometre area of the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Kermadec Islands, an area the size of France. The area is renowned for its depth of ocean; at more than 10km, it is the second deepest trench in the world. It also has the longest underwater arc of volcanoes, with more than 50, and is home to six million seabirds and 35 species of whale and dolphin.

The Bill creating the sanctuary was introduced to Parliament on 8 March 2016 and gained unanimous support from all parties on its first reading and referral to select committee. The Labour, New Zealand First, Maori and ACT parties have subsequently stated they are reconsidering their support after concerns raised by Maori and fishing interests.

“This is an internationally significant environmental initiative from New Zealand. I remain confident of Parliamentary support for the sanctuary, and this poll reinforces the level of public backing. I will be working to secure the broadest support possible as the Bill progresses through Parliament.”
