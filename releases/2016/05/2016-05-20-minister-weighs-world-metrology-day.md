Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today acknowledged World Metrology Day, which celebrates the 1875 signing of the Metre Convention, and the integral role the science of measurement plays in both trade and science.

“The answer to the age old phrase ‘how long is a piece of string’ is the same worldwide, thanks to the work of our legal metrologists,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Consumers make decisions based on weights and measures every day, from which grocer has the best price for a kilo of apples to where to fill up your car with fuel.

“The Trading Standards team at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment oversee legal metrology for New Zealand, ensuring the weights and measures businesses and consumers rely on are accurate.

“A reliable legal metrology system plays an important role in a healthy economy, as it allows both buyer and seller to be confident in transactions.

“As a member of the International Organisation of Legal Metrology and the Asia-Pacific Legal Metrology Forum, the Trading Standards team cooperate with other countries to ensure these measurements are standardised to facilitate fair and accurate trade both domestically and internationally,” Mr Goldsmith says.
