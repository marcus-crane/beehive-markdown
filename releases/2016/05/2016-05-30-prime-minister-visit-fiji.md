Prime Minister John Key will travel to Fiji to meet with Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama to further strengthen relations between the two countries.

“My visit marks the next step in what has been the steady renewal of political and diplomatic links with Fiji since its general election in 2014,” Mr Key says.

“Prime Minister Bainimarama and I will use the opportunity to discuss a range of issues including Fiji’s recovery from Cyclone Winston and the Pacer Plus trade negotiations.”

Mr Key’s official visit will be the first to Fiji by a New Zealand Prime Minister in 10 years.  

In Fiji he will also meet with business representatives and visit reconstruction work carried out by the New Zealand Defence Force during the Cyclone Winston relief effort.

Total New Zealand aid to Fiji following the cyclone was more than $15 million and saw one of our largest ever peacetime troop deployments.

“New Zealand was proud to stand alongside its neighbour in a time of need and our relationship is now stronger as a result.

“I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Bainimarama to discuss how we can build on that progress and work even closer together.”

The Prime Minister will be in Suva on June 9 and 10.
