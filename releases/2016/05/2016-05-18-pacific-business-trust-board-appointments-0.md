Two experienced Pacific leaders have been appointed to the Pacific Business Trust (PBT) Board, Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

PBT is a charitable trust helping Pacific people start businesses, grow jobs and increase economic development.

“I am pleased to announce Pelenato Sakalia and Tiumalu Peter Fa’afiu are joining the PBT board for the next three years, bringing with them valuable experience and expertise,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Pelenato Sakalia is the Managing Director of Sakalia Enterprises Ltd and has extensive experience leading complex projects in the public and private sectors.

Tiumalu Peter Fa’afiu is Manager of Corporate Affairs and Engagement at the Tamaki Regeneration Company.

The appointments follow the resignation of Teremoana Kenneth Mato, and Repeka Lelaulu who completes her term at the end of June.

“I thank the departing board members for their contributions to the important job of boosting Pacific economic success,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

They join current members Repeka Lelaulu, Kenina Court, Rachel Afeaki-Taumopeau and Fa'amatuainu Tino Pereira.

“The Government is committed to improving economic outcomes for all New Zealanders and PBT is playing a critical role in making sure Pacific peoples are part of driving this future success,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
