A new shared cycle pathway in Palmerston North will enhance connections between the city’s residential, employment and educational areas, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Mr Bridges turned the sod on the new Linton Shared Pathway – He Ara Kotahi today.

The new 6.6 km off-road cycle pathway and bridge over the Manawatu River will link Massey University, the Fitzherbert Science Centre, and Linton Military Camp with Palmerston North’s central business and residential areas.

“Palmerston North already has one of the highest rates of commuter cycling in New Zealand. It was the first city in New Zealand to have a cycle way completed under the Government’s Urban Cyleways Programme with the Longburn Cycleway finished in July 2015.  This new pathway will provide a crucial link into existing infrastructure,” Mr Bridges says.

“When completed the new pathway is expected to be used by more than 1000 people a day. It will be both scenic and safer, taking a route along the river away from high speed traffic along the state highway.”

The $10 million pathway is being jointly funded by the Government’s Urban Cycleways Fund, the National Land Transport Fund and the Palmerston North City Council, with significant support from Powerco.

“This collaboration between central government, local government and business will help make cycling a safer and more attractive choice for those commuting to work, and students – whether they are heading to school or university.”

The new pathway and bridge is expected to be completed by mid-2018.

Mr Bridges says making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a top priority.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”
