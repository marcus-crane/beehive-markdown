Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today unveiled Queenstown Airport’s first eGate, one of six that will be installed over the coming weeks in time for the peak winter season.

“The world-class next-generation eGates are a first for Queenstown Airport. They use a one-step integrated process and biometric technology to complete Customs’ processing requirements for legitimate passengers pass through easily, and enable Customs officers to focus on high risk areas,” Ms Wagner says.

“The new eGates are a fast and easy way for travellers to self-process at the border, taking only 25 seconds and will double passenger processing capacity through Customs.

“International passenger numbers to and from Queenstown increased by 27% from 355,000 in 2014 to 451,000 in 2015. Between July and September, around 180,000 people are expected to travel to and from Queenstown, and approximately 60% of those visitors are likely use the new eGates.

“These travellers will benefit from the four brand new next-generation eGates for arriving passengers and two for departing passengers.

“International travel forms a vital part of New Zealand’s growing economy and the government is investing $6.6 million to expand and modernise automated passport processing at our international airports.

“29 new eGates will be installed and 22 eGates replaced as part of a national programme which started late last year with the installation of 9 eGates at Auckland Airport departures” Ms Wagner says.

Queenstown’s new eGates will be available to New Zealand, Australian, US, UK, and Canadian ePassport holders over 12-years old from mid-June.
