Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell have tonight congratulated The Proprietors of Rakaia Incorporated, this year’s Ahuwhenua Trophy winner.

The Proprietors of Rakaia Incorporated were presented with the 2016 Ahuwhenua Trophy BNZ Māori Excellence in Farming award tonight in Hamilton.

“The Incorporation has a long and proud history back to 1886. They have set a fantastic example to other Māori landowners of what can be achieved through ambition and hard work,” says Mr Guy.

“They converted to dairy farming in 1996 and sustainable irrigation has helped them grow and develop wider opportunities for whānau,” says Mr Guy.

Minister Flavell says the Ahuwhenua Trophy competition highlights the importance of Māori agribusiness in the New Zealand primary industries.

“These awards highlight that success that can be achieved in the primary industries whilst maintaining environmental objectives, and that Māori agribusiness plays a central role,” says Mr Flavell.

“We congratulate Rakaia Incorporation and Jack Raharuhi who won the Young Maori Farmer Award for their commitment to lifting the profile of Māori agribusiness and growing New Zealand’s primary industries,” says Mr Flavell

The Ahuwhenua Trophy competition was first held in 1932 and celebrates skills in the primary industries and the pursuit of innovation and new approaches by Māori farmers committed to tapping the full potential of their holdings.
