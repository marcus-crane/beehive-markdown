Budget 2016 is investing 1.5 million over two years into export security initiatives and $7.1 million over four years to reduce compliance costs, speed up border clearances and increase the effectiveness of risk assessment tools say Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“International trade is vital to New Zealand’s economy. Trade volumes are forecast to grow by 30% between 2015 and 2020. That is why it is important for our borders to become more streamlined while increasing our risk assessment capabilities,” Ms Wagner says.

“To reduce compliance costs and speed up border clearances for exporters, the government will look at establishing a Secure Trade Lane with Australia.

“The Secure Trade Lane will accelerate border clearances by shifting information requirements from traders to third parties and coordinate border management across customs agencies.

“Customs will also develop a random inspection programme for incoming cargo, passengers and craft to produce improved risk assessment data and give Customs the ability to better target resources at higher risk trade.”

“To support trade security the Government is also increasing Customs’ verification, monitoring and auditing of members in its Secure Exports Scheme (SES), to validate the security of exports.

“Customs will negotiate more Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with key export markets and increase the membership of the SES to support exporters.

“The Government’s investment will increase the competitiveness of New Zealand goods by reducing compliance costs for importers and exporters, improve risk assessment capabilities and minimise intervention at overseas borders,” Ms Wagner says.
