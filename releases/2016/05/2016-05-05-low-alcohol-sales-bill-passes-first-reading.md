A Bill to make minor technical changes to New Zealand’s alcohol legislation has passed its first reading in Parliament with unanimous support.

“Since the passing of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act in 2012, we’re already seeing fewer alcohol outlets, the first local plans coming into force, and more communities getting the chance to have their say on the sale of alcohol in their neighbourhoods,” says Justice Minister Amy Adams.

“This Bill addresses two minor issues that have been identified since those reforms were passed – namely how non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beer and wine are displayed in stores.”

The Sale and Supply of Alcohol (Display of Low-alcohol Beverages and Other Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill 2015 will:

- permit supermarkets and grocery stores to display low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer and wine in the same area of the store as regular alcohol
- clarify that a company can hold an alcohol licence.

“We have seen low and non-alcoholic beers and wines increase significantly in popularity in the last year or two. These are positive moderation beverages, which allow people to enjoy the social aspects of drinking while limiting their intake of alcohol,” says Ms Adams.

“Our amendments permit supermarkets to place these alternatives to full-strength alcohol where shoppers would expect them to be. This will remove the need for these beverages to be stocked with fizzy drink and fruit juice.

“It is a common sense solution that provides clarity for stores, responsible drinkers and the general public.”

The Bill has been referred to the Justice and Electoral select committee.
