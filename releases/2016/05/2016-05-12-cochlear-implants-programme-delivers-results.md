Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a Ministry of Health review of the cochlear implant programme for children shows positive results.

“Cochlear implants are life changing as they can significantly improve a child’s hearing and learning ability,” says Dr Coleman.

“Budget 2014 provided an extra $6.3 million over four years for a bilateral cochlear implant programme for children.

“As a result of this programme, 61 children have to date received two cochlear implants, and a further 20 children have received a single implant.

“In conjunction with the universal newborn hearing screening and early intervention programme young children are being identified, diagnosed and receiving implants by 12 months of age in the majority of cases.

“The review by the Ministry shows those involved in the programme are positive about the results for children who have received implants.”

The programme is managed by the Southern Cochlear Implant Programme (Southern Trust) and the Northern Cochlear Implant Trust (Northern Trust).

“The Trusts are working to further improve services to better meet regional needs,” says Dr Coleman.

“In 2015, the Southern Trust, based in Christchurch, opened a second satellite centre in Wellington to provide ongoing services post implant to the lower North Island, which makes up 40 per cent of their caseload.

“In the Northern Trust region, some children living outside of Auckland have had their cochlear implant programmed remotely, saving time and travel costs.”

**Notes to editors:**

The review of the programme’s first year showed 33 eligible children received two implants in 2014/15. To date, 28 children have received two implants in 2015/16.

13 children received a single implant in 2014/15, and a further seven single implants have been provided to date in 2015/16.  

Between July 2014 and June 2015, one off funding that year meant another 31 children who had a funded single implant received a second implant.

In addition, 96 children who had a second implant funded privately before July 2014, are receiving help towards the ongoing support and costs.

The Government invests $8.4 million a year to support up to 16 newborns, 30 children and 40 adults to receive cochlear implants. There is no waiting time for children after they are assessed as eligible.
