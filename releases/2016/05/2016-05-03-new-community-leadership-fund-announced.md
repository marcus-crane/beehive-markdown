The Community Leadership Fund – Hapori Whakatipu, will benefit communities across New Zealand by strengthening the level of support available to organisations providing leadership and capability building, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

The Community Leadership Fund – Hapori Whakatipu, which means “growing community capability” when translated, will provide $500,000 annually, on a contestable basis, for organisations with a national focus whose primary role is to provide leadership and capability building across the community and social enterprise sectors.

“This new fund is a new type of funding, with support for community leadership organisations and social enterprise at its heart.

“This fund will bring sector leadership to the fore and gives an opportunity for support to not only national community organisations, but also for social enterprise, a new but rapidly expanding sector in New Zealand.

“There are thousands of people working successfully throughout New Zealand to make their communities a better place in which to live and work. The Community Leadership Fund will target those whose work improves the sustainability and resilience of the sector as a whole, thus ensuring New Zealand has a strong and vibrant community sector into the future,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The priorities of the Fund are:

- supporting collaboration and connection across the sector
- social enterprise
- volunteering
- community led-development.

Applications to the new Community Leadership Fund will open in late May 2016. More information and resources, including the fund criteria, will be available closer to the opening date at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
