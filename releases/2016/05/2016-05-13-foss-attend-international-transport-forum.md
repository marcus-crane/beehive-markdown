Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss will travel to Germany this weekend to attend the Summit of Transport Ministers at the 2016 International Transport Forum (ITF).

“The ITF summit is an annual meeting of key transport players from 57 countries, making it an excellent opportunity to ensure New Zealand remains up-to-date on changes and developments in this dynamic sector,” Mr Foss says.

“It’s also an opportunity to help shape the transport policy agenda on a global level, as well as further strengthen our connection to international partners and markets built up over a number of years, particularly last year when New Zealand held the Forum Presidency.”

During the three-day summit Mr Foss will meet other transport ministers from around the world, and attend ministerial roundtables, workshops and tours.

“This year’s summit theme is *Green and Inclusive Transport* — I look forward to discussing the challenges and opportunities this presents,” Mr Foss says.

“While in Germany, I’ll take the opportunity — in my capacity as Minister of Veterans’ Affairs — to pay my respects to the 55 New Zealanders buried in the Berlin (1939-1945) War Cemetery.”
