Legislation paving the way for a two-stage transition of Environment Canterbury back to an elected council passed its third reading in Parliament today.

Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith said the time was right to transition ECan back to an elected council, and he welcomed the passage of the bill with support from the Maori and ACT parties.

“The Commissioners have done an outstanding job of progressing the plans required to properly manage freshwater, rebuilding the organisation, strengthening its relationships with the ten councils across Canterbury and supporting the earthquake recovery.”

Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston said it would be a two-step process, with seven councillors to be elected in October this year to work alongside six appointed councillors, before moving to a fully elected council in 2019.

“This transition is important in maintaining continuity and the momentum of ECan in areas such as the earthquake recovery, the completion of catchment water plans and its work in regional economic development.”

Dr Smith said the transition was particularly important in respect of freshwater management.

“Canterbury had no operative regional plan in 2010, nor any limits on intensification and nutrients. It was a huge step forward when the Commission completed the regional water plan. The key to its success is in completing zone plans in each of Canterbury’s ten catchments. This task is doable with the transitional mixed governance model and special streamlined planning process provided for in this bill.

“This pragmatic transition for ECan is about supporting Canterbury move from earthquake recovery to regeneration, and getting the foundations right for the long-term management of the region’s freshwater resources,” he said.
