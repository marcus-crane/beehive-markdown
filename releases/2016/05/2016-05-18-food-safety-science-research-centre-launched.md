Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew today launched the New Zealand Food Safety Science and Research Centre at Massey University in Palmerston North.

Formed as a partnership between government, industry organisations and research institutions, the virtual centre aims to ensure New Zealand’s food safety system remains among the best in the world.

“The centre will use the best science available to protect and enhance New Zealand’s international reputation as a producer of safe and trustworthy food,” Mr Joyce says.

“Research will meet the needs of industry, helping to grow exports and ensure local food and beverage businesses have consistent access to foreign markets.

“We will look to get further industry organisations on board over time, both to boost funding and ensure the research is relevant, with broad commercial applications.”

Industry funders the Dairy Companies Association, the Meat Industry Association and Zespri have committed $2.05 million per annum. The Government will match this contribution, bringing total funding to $4.1 million per annum.

“New Zealand prides itself as a producer of safe and high quality food. Our exports are dependent on a robust and internationally credible food safety system,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The centre will see our best scientists collaborating on work programmes that cut across different food and beverage sectors, placing us as a global leader in food safety science.

“The research that will be conducted by centre partners also aims to protect New Zealanders by minimising the risks of foodborne illness such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. It will go beyond short-term, reactive issues to look ‘over the horizon’ and pre-empt emerging food safety risks across multiple sectors.”

Research partners include hosts Massey University, along with AgResearch, Cawthron Institute, ESR, Plant and Food Research, the University of Auckland and the University of Otago.

“By working together to share and coordinate resources, we have an opportunity to not only deliver excellent food safety science and research, but also to boost our capability and international reputation in this field,” Mr Joyce says.
