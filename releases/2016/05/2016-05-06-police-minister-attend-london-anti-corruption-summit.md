Police Minister, Judith Collins will represent the Prime Minister at the London Anti-Corruption Summit being hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron on 12 May 2016.

The Summit will promote the importance of exposing corruption, punishing those responsible and supporting those who have suffered, and driving out the culture of corruption, where it exists.

“The Summit is an opportunity to promote New Zealand’s reputation as one of the least corrupt countries in the world and demonstrate our commitment as a responsible member of the international community,” says Ms Collins.

World leaders from the G20, as well as other nations who face challenges with corruption, will agree a package of practical steps to counter corruption at the Summit.

New Zealand has recently taken steps to combat corruption. Last year Parliament passed the Organised Crime and Anti-corruption Legislation Bill in November 2015, which enabled New Zealand to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

Prime Minister Cameron is also inviting the leaders of the world’s major international institutions that play a key role in anti-corruption efforts around the globe.

While there, Ms Collins will call on the Victims’ Commissioner for England and Wales, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, the Under Secretary of State for Prisons and the Director of the SFO. Ms Collins will also visit a prison.

Ms Collins returns to New Zealand on 16 May 2016.
