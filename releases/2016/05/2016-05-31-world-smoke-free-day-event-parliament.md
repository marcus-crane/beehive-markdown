The Associate Minister of Health Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says reducing the harm from tobacco is the key focus of international efforts spearheaded by the World Health Organisation.

Mr Lotu-Iiga held an event at Parliament this evening.

“This year World Smokefree Day focuses on standardised packaging of tobacco. Today I have released draft regulations and a consultation document which aims to standardise the look of cigarette packs”.

“4,500 to 5,000 New Zealanders die each year from smoking related illness.  Standardised packaging is working as intended in Australia and it can do the same here,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

The government has a suite of tools and programmes to reduce smoking rates and discourage people from taking up smoking. These include Quitline which has been upgraded as part of the new Healthline and is available 24 / 7 to support those trying to quit; media campaigns and face-to-face smoking cessation programmes.

Since 2010, tobacco consumption has dropped by 25 per cent.

“From 1 January 2017, excise duty on tobacco will be increased by 10 per cent each year for the next 4 years. This will increase the average price of a packet of cigarettes to around $32. Evidence confirms price increase is an effective tool for driving smoking reduction,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“We also expect to pass the Smokefree Environments (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Amendment Bill later this year.”

The consultation period for the draft regulations ends on 29 July. A paper will then be taken to Cabinet for approval of the Regulations. 

New statistics on smoking rates among young people were also released at a World Smokefree event at Parliament this evening.

“The ASH Year 10 smoking survey shows daily smoking rates for Year 10 young people fell to 2.44% last year and the percentage of “never smokers’ rose and now sits at 78.68 per cent.  Increased tax excise is working for this price sensitive age group.”

New Zealand is working hard to reduce the harmful impacts of tobacco and to discourage people from taking up smoking.
