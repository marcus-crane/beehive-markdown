Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner encourages all New Zealanders to take part in New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Week to celebrate one of the country’s official languages and its role in developing a strong Deaf community.

“Next week allows us to take stock of just how much we have achieved in the 10 years since NZSL became an official language and to acknowledge how it has supported the growth of a vibrant, healthy and flourishing Deaf community in New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.

“Over 750 NZSL taster class will be delivered as part of the NZSL Week activities. All of the classes are fully booked, which shows how enthusiastic Kiwis are about supporting New Zealand Sign Language. It is fantastic to see so many people taking up the opportunity to learn NZSL.

“Access to sign language is central to Deaf culture and identity. It is crucial to Deaf people’s ability to communicate and fully participate in society.

“This is why our government has supported the establishment of the NZSL Board and continued to support the NZSL Fund, which is currently receiving $1.25 million each year. The Fund has directly supported two consecutive NZSL Weeks by contributing $645,000,” Ms Wagner says.

New Zealand Sign Language Week runs from 9 May to 15 May. For more information on what is happening around the country: [http://deaf.org.nz/nzslw-2016-events](http://deaf.org.nz/nzslw-2016-events)
