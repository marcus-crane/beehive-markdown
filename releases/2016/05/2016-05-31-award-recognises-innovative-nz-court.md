The pioneering work of the Ngā Kooti Rangatahi/Rangatahi Court has been acknowledged in its receipt of the 2015 Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration Award (AIJA) for Excellence in Judicial Administration, says Courts and Justice Minister Amy Adams.   

“I want to congratulate the judges and Ministry of Justice, in particular the Chief District Court Judge and Principal Youth Court Judge, and Youth Court Judge Heemi Taumaunu who established the first Rangatahi Court in Gisborne back in 2008,” says Ms Adams.

“This award recognises the significant collaboration between courts and communities to help young New Zealanders turn their lives around.”

Ms Adams says the initiative is also gaining international recognition. Initial research suggests in the following year, participants committed 14 per cent fewer offences and were 11 per cent less likely to commit new offences.

The Courts are part of a suite of initiatives that have reduced offending by young Māori since 2009. In 2015, over 1000 fewer Māori aged 12 to 16 appeared in the Youth Court compared to 2009 – a reduction of 47 per cent.

The Rangatahi Courts address offending by young Māori by involving communities in the youth justice process and encouraging strong cultural links. The Court creates an environment where young people are supported by their whānau, kuia and kaumātua, to take ownership of their offending.

“Young Māori and their whānau engage with the justice system, and draw upon the support of the marae, iwi, whānau and hapū to address the needs of the young person.

“Rangatahi Courts are now widely accepted within New Zealand's justice sector and by the Māori community, as a legitimate response by our courts in addressing some of the fundamental issues underlying offending by Māori youth in our country, and I congratulate the judiciary for this achievement.

“I also want to acknowledge the commitment of kaumātua and community leaders, and other supporters who are working together to make a difference in the lives of young people, their communities, and future generations,” says Ms Adams.

There are now fourteen Rangatahi Courts in New Zealand and two Pasifika Courts. Between January 2009 and April 2016, 1434 young people attended family group conference plans monitored in Rangatahi Courts, and 361 in Pasifika Courts.
