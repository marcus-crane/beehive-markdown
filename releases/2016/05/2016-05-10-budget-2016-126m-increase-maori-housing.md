The Māori Housing Network is to receive a $12.6 million boost over the next four years, helping more whānau to realise their housing aspirations, Maori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says.

“Māori are over-represented in housing deprivation statistics and this increase in funding would allow the Network to help more whānau in need,” Mr Flavell says.

“The Māori Housing Network is about ensuring whānau have access to safe, secure and healthy homes which in turn improve their health and wellbeing.”

The Māori Housing Network, which was launched last year, provides funding for new homes and housing repairs for whānau. It also works to develop the Māori housing sector in areas of high housing need.

Since last October the Network has helped build 42 affordable rental homes and is supporting housing repairs for around 165 whānau. It is also funding infrastructure (power, water, sewerage system, roading, gas, and telecoms) for social and affordable housing and papakāinga housing on Māori land for 113 whānau.

More than a third of New Zealanders considered to be severely deprived of housing are Māori.

The new operating funding means the Māori Housing Network, operated by Te Puni Kōkiri, will have a total of $17.6 million a year for Māori housing projects.
