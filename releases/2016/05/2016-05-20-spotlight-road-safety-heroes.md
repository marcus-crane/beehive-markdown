We all have a role to play in making our roads safer, and this year’s Road Safety Week is shining a spotlight on our ‘Road Safety Heroes’, says Associate Minister of Transport Craig Foss.

“We all share responsibility for making our roads safer,” Mr Foss says. “Road Safety week reminds everyone in our communities that they can be a hero by playing their part in making our roads safer. It’s been great to see so many schools, organisations and individuals getting involved.

“Every death or serious injury on our roads is one too many. So far this year 131 people have lost their lives on our roads.

“Since the introduction of the Safer Journeys strategy in 2010, we’ve been following the safe system approach to road safety.

A Safe System is a more forgiving road system that reduces the price we pay for human error. In a Safe System, although crashes are inevitable, death or

serious injury is not.

“A few simple actions can, quite literally, be lifesaving. Remembering a few simple actions like wearing a safety belt or helmet, travelling at a safe speed for the road and conditions, and sharing the road safely with others means we can be road safety heroes every day,” Mr Foss says.

“Every week, not just Road Safety Week, we should be all taking responsibility to keep ourselves and others safe on our roads.

Road Safety Week ends on Sunday. It is promoted by road safety charity Brake NZ with the support of the NZ Transport Agency, NZ Police, Auckland Transport and sponsor QBE Insurance.
