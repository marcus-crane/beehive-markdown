Corrections has increased its focus on rehabilitation of women prisoners, with Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility (ARWCF) delivering 682 rehabilitative interventions this financial year to date compared with a total of 357 last year, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

“Women at ARWCF deal with a range of challenges. Many of them enter prison with alcohol and drug-related dependence. Some women are victims of abuse, and many battle with anti-social behaviour, self-harm practices, and mental health problems.

“The majority of women prisoners at ARWCF have received multiple interventions over the past year, specifically tailored to address their rehabilitative needs while in custody,” Ms Collins says.

As well as a parenting programme, motivational programmes and a Māori women’s leadership and tikanga Māori programme, ARWCF also offers education, training and employment courses and opportunities to prisoners.

Corrections spends around $170 million per year on services to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders. All of the programmes are evaluated for effectiveness.

“Evidence shows that rehabilitation and reintegration programmes along with constructive activity helps reduce reoffending and gives offenders the skills they need to live crime-free on release.”
