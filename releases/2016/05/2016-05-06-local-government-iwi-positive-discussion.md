The Minister of Local Government Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says Maori involvement with local government is being actively discussed by iwi leaders and councils.

Minister Lotu-Iiga met with the Iwi Chairs Forum at Whakarewarewa yesterday to present his Better Local Services reforms package

“The BLS reforms preserve existing arrangements under Treaty settlements and those specifically established under legislation.  For example, they protect arrangements such as co-governance or co-management in respect of the Rotorua Lakes and the Waikato River.

“The changes to the Local Government Act mean councils can lead re-organisations across regions by creating Council Controlled Organisations. Those CCOs will deliver shared services particularly for water and transport to achieve better value for ratepayers,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Local Government Commission will also have to consult iwi and local communities when considering re-organisations.

During the visit to Rotorua yesterday Minister Lotu-Iiga also met with members of the Bay of Plenty and Waikato Regional Councils and six territorial authorities to discuss the reforms and issues affecting local authorities.

“It is pleasing to see Councils and Iwi working through various consultative arrangements to provide better local services and community engagement for ratepayers and their families,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Minister says the *SmartGrowth* project, involving tangata whenua, sets a strategic vision for growth and development of the Western Bay of Plenty.

“This provides a shared pathway towards a single vision – making the Western Bay a great place to live, learn, work and play. The reforms will enable better implementation of regional growth strategies,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
