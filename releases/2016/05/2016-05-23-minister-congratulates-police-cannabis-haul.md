Minister of Police Judith Collins today congratulated Police for the success of the 2015/16 National Cannabis and Crime Operation.

The six month long Police Operation, code-named “Operation Dee” resulted in the seizure and destruction of more than 130,000 cannabis plants and almost 80 kilograms of dried cannabis, totalling the second highest recovery rate of cannabis by Police in the last nine years.

173 firearms were also seized as a result of the operation, the largest number seized since the 2011/2012 operation.

In addition, Police have this year placed a strong emphasis on seizing the assets gained from drug dealing and assets used to assist and enable the criminal activity. As a result, more than $4 million worth of assets are currently under investigation or restraint following a court order.

Ms Collins said the results of Operation Dee would send a strong message to those who tried to produce drugs in New Zealand that they would be caught.

"The message to those who manufacture and sell drugs in our community is that the Government and the police are determined to shut down your activities, and will use every tool at their disposal to do so," Ms Collins said.
