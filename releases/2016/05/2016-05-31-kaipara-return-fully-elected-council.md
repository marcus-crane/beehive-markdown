Associate Local Government Minister Louise Upston today announced the Kaipara District Council will return to a fully-elected Council later this year, and encouraged locals to get involved.

“The Kaipara community has an opportunity to determine its future and I encourage community members to make sure their voice is heard in the elections. I also encourage any community members who want to make a positive difference to stand for Council,” Ms Upston says.

Commissioners were appointed to the Kaipara District Council in 2012 to address significant governance and financial challenges facing the Council. The Kaipara Commissioners’ term will end when the newly-elected Council comes into office.

“The Kaipara Commissioners have made significant progress in getting the Council into a stable financial position. It is time that the Council returns to a fully-elected Council. I have called an election of the Council, to coincide with the local body elections in October 2016.”

Ms Upston said that she will also appoint a Crown Manager and a Crown Observer to support the newly-elected Council as it settles in.

“I will appoint a Crown Manager to take responsibility for certain outstanding legal actions, on behalf of the newly-elected Council. Newly-elected Council members will then be able to focus on providing effective governance and on the District’s future, rather than being distracted by past issues.

“It is important that newly-elected Council members have the right support to be successful in their demanding and complex role. With this in mind, I will also appoint a Crown Observer to help ensure newly-elected Council members are well supported. The Crown Observer will not be involved in decision-making and will only offer advice or guidance.

“It is crucial that the Kaipara District is able to look to the future. The return to a fully-elected Council, together with a Crown Manager and Crown Observer supporting the Council, will provide the District with a fresh start.”

Crown Manager and Crown Observer appointees will be announced in the coming months.
