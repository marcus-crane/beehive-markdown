An increasing number of offenders on community sentences are getting hands-on experience learning how to be “road safe” in an initiative aimed at reducing further offending, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

Today, around 40 offenders from the Wellington District (which includes Kapiti, Hutt Valley, Porirua and Wellington), who are serving a variety of community sentences, will take part in a Road Safety Expo being organised by Upper Hutt Community Corrections. This is the latest in a series of similar road safety days which have been held around the country.

“Many offenders have been given sentences for driving offences and this initiative aims to make the roads safer for everyone by reducing dangerous driving behaviour,” Ms Collins says.

Offenders will take part in activities including navigating an obstacle course while wearing Fatal Vision Goggles that simulate being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The Police and Fire Service will give presentations on road safety and drink driving messages. Offenders will also see a car which was involved in a fatal local crash.

“These activities are designed to encourage participants to think twice before they get on the road,” says Ms Collins. “Educating offenders about the importance of safe driving is the first step in making our communities safer and reducing the likelihood of them reoffending.”

The expo is especially timely with this week being Road Safety Week, an annual community event, to help raise awareness about the importance of being safe on New Zealand’s roads.

Corrections works with many offenders and prisoners to help them gain their driver licence, to help break the cycle of re-offending. The Department also funds alcohol interlock devices for eligible offenders on community sentences. The devices are connected to the start-up mechanism of a car and make it impossible to start the car until the driver has successfully passed a breath alcohol test.
