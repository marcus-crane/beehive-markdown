Organised crime has been hit hard by the forfeiture and restraint of the proceeds of crime, with new figures putting the preventative and disruptive impact on illegal operations at more than $1 billion.

“Since 2009 police have had the power to seize the proceeds of crime to reinforce the message that crime doesn’t pay and to boost the ability of our law enforcement authorities to combat it,” Police Minister Judith Collins says

The New Zealand Proceeds of Crime Disruption Index measures the impact funds and assets seized under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act had on criminal operations.

The impact is defined as the estimated dollar value available for reinvestment in future crime had police not intervened.

It estimates the impact since the Act came into effect on 1 December 2009 at $1.19 billion as at 30 April 2016.

Police have restrained and secured the forfeiture of around $391.5 million of cash and assets in the same period.

“This represents a significant dent in criminal activities across New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

“By value the vast majority of restraints and forfeitures have related to drugs and or organised crime. These activities are a stain on New Zealand communities and these seizures are removing the ability of criminals to profit from crime.”   

Funds recovered under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act are used to fund law enforcement initiatives.
