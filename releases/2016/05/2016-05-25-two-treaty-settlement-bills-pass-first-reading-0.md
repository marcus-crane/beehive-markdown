The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Bill and the Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngā Pōtiki Claims Settlement Bill through their first readings. The bills have been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.

“Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Bill addresses the historical grievances of Whanganui Iwi in relation to the Whanganui River,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Whanganui Iwi has sought protection of the Whanganui River for over a century. This bill recognises the deep spiritual connection between iwi and the river and creates a strong platform for their involvement in the future of the river.”

The legislation will establish a new legal framework for the Whanganui River which recognises the river as an indivisible whole from the mountains to the sea, known as Te Awa Tupua. Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person.

Financial redress of $80 million is included in the settlement as well as an additional $1 million contribution towards establishing the legal framework for the river.

The Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngā Pōtiki Claims Settlement Bill will give effect to the individual settlements of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngā Pōtiki.

“This bill provides important redress and acknowledgement of past wrongs for these groups,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today brings Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngā Pōtiki a step closer to a stronger future.”

The settlement includes financial and commercial redress of $26.5 million for Ngāi Te Rangi, $3 million for Ngā Pōtiki, rights of first refusal and the opportunity to purchase specified Crown properties. Cultural redress includes the vesting of two island reserves and statutory acknowledgements over several streams in the Tauranga area.

Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngā Pōtiki are part of the Tauranga Moana Iwi Collective. The bill addressing the collective redress of these iwi received its first reading last month.

“The number of Treaty settlement bills currently before the House demonstrates this government’s commitment to resolving historical Treaty claims with all willing and able iwi,” Mr Finlayson said.
