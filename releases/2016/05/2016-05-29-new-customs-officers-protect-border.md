Customs Minister Nicky Wagner congratulates twenty-five new Customs officers who will help to manage increasing travel volumes at the border.

“The new officers are a welcome addition at Auckland airport as travellers to New Zealand continue to grow,” Ms Wagner says.

“By 2019, Customs is expected to process 12.7 million travellers per year – 20% more than 2015.

“Customs’ new recruits have just completed an intensive training course designed to support world class border management operations.

“The recruits have come to us with a diverse range of skills and experience. They are the perfect fit and will be helping us to put the customer at the centre of service delivery while protecting our borders.

“While technology plays a major part in passenger processing Customs officers will always be the most important part of New Zealand’s frontline. I congratulate our newest Customs officers and welcome them to the team,” Ms Wagner says.
