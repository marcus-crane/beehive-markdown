Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the Social Sector Trials which have been taking place around the country have provided good information to help design community-led models for better social service results.

“If we want to get better results we must continue to try different approaches and different ways of doing things, and we will be using what we’ve learnt from the trials in the design of future programmes and initiatives,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The trials brought together decision-makers at a local level, such as mayors, stakeholders and agency representatives to collaborate on how social services were funded and delivered. They were most successful where there was good co-ordination from those involved.

“Eleven out of the sixteen trial areas will now be supported to transition to new community-led models with a less narrow focus for the delivery of services by the end of the year, using evidence of what has worked in each location and with less central government involvement.

“As with all trials, some aspects have worked better than others and I want to thank everyone involved for their efforts.

“We now have a much clearer understanding of what does and what doesn’t work in a community-based model, and that will be hugely beneficial for the future success of how social services are delivered.”
