The Crown has signed an Agreement in Principle with Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa Tāmaki Nui-ā-Rua to settle its historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today. 

“Today marks an important step in settling all historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāti Kahungunu in the Wairarapa and the Tāmaki Nui-ā-Rua regions,” Mr Finlayson said. “This agreement provides a basis for the Crown and the iwi to develop a detailed deed of settlement.”

The Agreement in Principle sets out a broad settlement package which includes a Crown apology as well as financial and commercial redress of $93 million and the opportunity to purchase Crown-owned properties.

Cultural redress includes the vesting of 19 Crown-owned sites of cultural significance to the iwi and four sites to be shared with Rangitāne o Wairarapa and Rangitāne o Tamaki Nui-ā-Rua. 

“The Crown is making significant progress towards settling historical Treaty grievances, signing 54 agreements in principle since the beginning of 2009,” Mr Finlayson said.
