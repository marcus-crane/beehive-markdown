Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today welcomed a report which highlights the positive economic impact of New Zealand hosting the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2015.

The report shows the tournament boosted New Zealand GDP by $30.4 million. It attracted over 3,600 international visitors, generating 52,650 international visitor nights with an average visitor stay of 14.3 nights. Over 300,000 spectators attended 52 matches across the seven host cities.

“2015 was a busy year for hosting major events in New Zealand. This report reinforces the Government’s decision to invest in major international sporting events such as the FIFA U-20 World Cup,” Mr Joyce says.

“Leverage and legacy outcomes are a key consideration for Government investment in major events. The success of this tournament means it’s been able to return $500,000 of the Government’s $5.5 million investment, which has been returned into the Major Events Development Fund.”

“Football clubs around the country are enjoying the benefits of hosting FIFA’s second largest men’s competition. This includes around $5 million worth of new playing fields and equipment, including restoring and building quake-damaged fields in Christchurch,” Dr Coleman says.

“As well as turning on some great football moments, with 154 goals scored, hundreds of New Zealanders are now involved in the sport. Youth football participation was up 13.4 per cent for 2015 and New Zealand Football recorded 1,000 new volunteers.”
