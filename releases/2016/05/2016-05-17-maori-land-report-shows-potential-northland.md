Māori land owners in Northland have promising options for developing their land, according to a report commissioned by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Te Rūnanga-Ā-Iwi-O-Ngāpuhi and the Far North District Council.

“The report shows that in a 50km radius around Kaikohe there are nearly 4000 small parcels of unproductive land that have the potential to be developed for uses like horticulture and agriculture,” says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy. 

The report highlights two case studies focusing on horticulture and pastoral land use scenarios that show the potential for many parts of Northland.

“This will help land owners make informed decisions on sustainably developing their land. The real challenge is not so much the physical change, but the organisational change required to make this happen.”

The Government is undertaking a major reform into Māori land which will make it easier for land owners to better utilise their land, if they chose to do so. The Ture Whenua Māori Bill was introduced into Parliament earlier this month.

“We know there is significant untapped potential for Māori land owners and this report provides further evidence of the opportunities for development,” says Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell, who is leading the Whenua Māori reform.

The report will be presented at the He Kai Kei Aku Ringa Regional Hui in Kerikeri on Wednesday 18 May.

In total the Mid-North (Northland) Multiple Māori Land Blocks report identifies 3,986 land blocks totalling 84,003 ha around Kaikohe. 

The development of under-utilised Māori land is one of the actions identified in the Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan which was launched in February 2016. The Action Plan identifies 58 actions for stimulating the Northland economy.

The Mid-North (Northland) Multiple Māori Land Blocks report is available on the Ministry for Primary Industries website:
