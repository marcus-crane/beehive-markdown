Justice Minister Amy Adams has welcomed the start of the search for a new Chief Electoral Officer.

Current Chief Electoral Officer Robert Peden advised Ms Adams last year that he would not be seeking reappointment after completing a five-year term in the role.

The Chief Electoral Officer is the Chief Executive and member of the three-person Board of the Electoral Commission, appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of Parliament. 

Ms Adams says the Commission plays a central role in New Zealand's democratic process.

"The Commission is a politically neutral and independent organisation that promotes democratic participation and ensures New Zealanders can easily enrol and vote in General Elections, by-elections and referenda. 

“As the Commission's Chief Executive, the Chief Electoral Officer plays a key leadership role by ensuring New Zealand's elections are undertaken with integrity, efficiency and transparency," Ms Adams says.

The Chief Electoral Officer also undertakes a number of statutory obligations and governance roles.  As well as sitting on the Commission's Board, the Chief Electoral Officer sits on the Representation Commission, which draws up electoral boundaries, and is responsible for providing policy advice to Ministers and select committees on electoral matters.
