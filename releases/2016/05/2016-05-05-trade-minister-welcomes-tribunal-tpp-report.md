Trade Minister Todd McClay has welcomed the Waitangi Tribunal’s Report on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement which found no breach of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“New Zealand’s approach to its free trade agreements reflects the constitutional significance of the Treaty of Waitangi to New Zealand. TPP specifically recognises the Treaty of Waitangi, so that nothing in the TPP will prevent the Crown from meeting its obligations to Maori” says Mr McClay.

“The Tribunal recognised that the development and successful incorporation of the Treaty exception clause, which has been in every free trade agreement signed by a New Zealand government since 2001, was an achievement and of credit to the government.

“As I have said to Iwi Leaders at their Forum meeting this week, I am happy to continue to engage with Maori on TPP and future free trade agreements.

“Maori have much to gain from the agreement. Maori businesses are big exporters and have significant ownership in key sectors such as forestry, fishing, red meat, and dairy. The tariff savings under TPP on current exports across these sectors are significant, amounting to an estimated $200 million a year once the tariff commitments are fully phased in," says Mr McClay.
