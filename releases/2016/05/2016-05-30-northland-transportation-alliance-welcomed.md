The Minister of Local Government Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says a roading and transport alliance in Northland is a step towards efficient shared services that will save ratepayers’ money.

The Chair of the Northland Mayoral Forum Sheryl Mai today announced the establishment of the Northland Transportation Alliance (NTA), a collaborative alliance for transportation and roading services in Northland. 

“The Northland Transportation Alliance (NTA), is the first collaboration of its kind in New Zealand.  The NTA has taken several years to get to this point.  It has come about because the four councils and NZTA believe there is value in working together,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The alliance is expected to deliver $18m in financial benefits over ten years.

“The local government reforms announced earlier in the year will allow councils better use of council-controlled organisations to deliver services, potentially achieving great savings and efficiencies for ratepayers,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says

“I have now finished a series of meetings, which took me from one end of the country to the other. I have talked with councillors, officials and iwi about shared services and the reforms.  We have received valuable feedback which indicates that councils will likely use the new provisions to better collaborate across the regions.”

It is expected the Better Local Services reforms will be passed this year so councils, elected in October’s local body elections, can use them early in their new term.
