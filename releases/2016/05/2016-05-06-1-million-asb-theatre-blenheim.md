The ASB Theatre in Blenheim will receive $1 million from the Government to assist with its development, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced.

“This is an important project for Marlborough which until now has not received direct central Government support,” Ms Barry says.

“We recognise the need to help the efforts made by the community and council to make the theatre a sustainable prospect, and I’m pleased to announce our $1 million commitment today.”

The funding will help reduce bank loans underwritten by the Marlborough Council to support the state-of-the-art new theatre, which opened in March.

As a multi-purpose building with an auditorium able to hold more than 700 people and conference facilities, the theatre represents a significant economic asset for Marlborough as well as a cultural centre capable of hosting world-class performances.

“Local MP Stuart Smith has been a strong advocate for Government support of the theatre, recognising its potential and importance to the community,” Ms Barry says.

“As a Government we are committed to regional development opportunities and I look forward to seeing the theatre become an integral part of cultural life in Blenheim and the wider Marlborough region.”

The ASB Theatre has previously received a combined $1.33 million from the Lottery Community Facilities and Significant Projects funds.

It is also eligible to apply for support from the newly renamed Regional Culture and Heritage Fund.
