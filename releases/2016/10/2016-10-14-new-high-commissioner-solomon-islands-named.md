Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced Don Higgins as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Solomon Islands.

“New Zealand has a close relationship with the Solomon Islands, characterised by regular political dialogue, a strong development partnership, and growing links between our populations,” Mr McCully says.

“We are proud of New Zealand’s ongoing contribution to security in Solomon Islands through the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

“New Zealand has a significant aid and development programme in Solomon Islands, with a focus on infrastructure development, education, and fisheries support.”

Mr Higgins served as adviser to the Administrator of Tokelau from 2012 to 2014, and was most recently New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Kiribati.
