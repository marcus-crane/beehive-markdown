Around $800,000 will be invested to build one new classroom each at Oakura School and West End School in Taranaki, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“Both schools have growing rolls and need extra space to accommodate more students in the future,” says Ms Parata.

Today’s announcement is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth.

“We’re committed to building new classrooms for schools that need additional capacity,” says Ms Parata.

Taranaki also benefitted from the first round of investments in June, when around $2.2 million was announced to build a total of six new classrooms at Mangorei School and Te Pi’ipi’inga Kakano Mai Rangiatea in New Plymouth.

“We’re committed to building modern, innovative learning environments for local students,” says Ms Parata.

“We want to support students to achieve to the very best of their potential, and having the right infrastructure is an important part of this.”

More announcements as part of the second round of investments in roll growth classrooms will be made this week, with a third round of investments expected to be announced in February next year.

Oakura School and West End School are in discussions about establishing a local Community of Learning (CoL). Communities of Learning are about schools working together to help students achieve their full potential.
