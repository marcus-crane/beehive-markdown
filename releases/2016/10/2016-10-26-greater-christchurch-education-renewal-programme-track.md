Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed a Treasury report which has highlighted the strong performance of the Greater Christchurch Education Renewal Programme.

The report confirms that not only is the rebuild on-schedule, but that all schools’ projects are on budget with some tenders even coming in under-budget.

“This is a significant milestone in the renewal of the greater Christchurch education network,” Hekia Parata says. “I want to especially thank the students, their families, our teachers and schools for their resilience and hard work.

“The disruption to learning has been minimised due to the professionalism of all of the stakeholders and it makes me immensely proud as Minister.

“We had to make some difficult decisions in the aftermath of the quakes, but greater Christchurch is now well on its way to having the most modern and dynamic schooling network in the country.”

The strong progress of the programme has seen Treasury confirm it no longer needs to actively monitor the Greater Christchurch Education Renewal Programme.

The programme is a huge undertaking with $1.137 billion being spent over 10 years to rebuild and repair greater Christchurch’s schools.

Seven schools are now complete: Pegasus Bay School, Halswell School, Waitākiri, Marshland, West Rolleston, Rāwhiti and Lyttelton Primary.

19 schools are under construction with Rolleston College and Haeata Community Campus due to be completed and ready for students at the beginning of Term 1 2017.
