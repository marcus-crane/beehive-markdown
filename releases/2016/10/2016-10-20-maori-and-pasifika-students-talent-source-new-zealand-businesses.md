Young Māori and Pasifika students are a significant source of talent for New Zealand businesses says Associate Minister for Economic Development Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

Speaking at the launch of TupuToa at the University of Auckland today, Mr Flavell says the new internship and leadership support programme initiated by Global Women will provide a welcome pathway into the domestic and international business worlds for Māori and Pasifika students.

“TupuToa reflects a recognition by New Zealand business leaders that Māori and Pasifika students can provide a significant source of talent for their companies and help them retain their competitive edge in a more diverse country.”

Mr Flavell says because of their culture, Māori and Pasifika students can thrive in their chosen career pathways through this new initiative.

“Māori and Pasifika students offer a unique perspective to an increasingly diverse business world which demands authenticity in relationships.

“At the heart of these two cultures is the notion of relationships in balance, with each other, the environment and the world.

TupuToa has also set itself ambitious targets with the major aim of supporting 300 Māori and Pasifika interns and 320 emerging leaders annually, Mr Flavell says.

“The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Te Puni Kōkiri and the Ministry for Pacific Peoples provided a total of $108,000 in start-up funding for TupuToa. The programme is expected to be self-sustaining from corporate support after Year 4.

“I would like to congratulate Global Women for initiating the programme and the corporate sponsors providing placements and early career support for the interns.”
