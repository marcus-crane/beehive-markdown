Around $1.8 million million will be invested to build a total of five new classrooms at schools in Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The schools are:

- Kaiti School, Gisborne – two new classrooms
- Eskdale School, Napier – two new classrooms
- Clive School, Hastings – one new classroom.

“Like many parts of New Zealand, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay are experiencing population growth. We’re committed to building new classrooms where this growth is having a flow-on effect on school rolls,” says Ms Parata.

“Earlier this year, along with Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye, I announced $4 million for eight new classrooms in Hawke’s Bay as part of Budget 2016.

“Today’s investment comes on top of that, and is part of a second round of investments in roll growth classrooms under this year’s Budget.”

More announcements about the second round of roll growth investments will be made over the coming weeks, with a third round expected in February next year.

“As well as meeting roll growth, we’re also committed to modernising local schools,” says Ms Parata.

“Last month I announced $19 million for the redevelopment of Flaxmere College and Kimi Ora Community School in Hastings, and Gisborne’s new Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Horouta Wananga is also on-track for delivery by 2018.”

Budget 2016 sets aside $882.5 million for school infrastructure, more than double that of last year’s Budget.

Clive School is a member of the Whirinaki Community of Learning (CoL), while Eskdale School belongs to the Napier City CoL. Communities of Learning are about schools working together to help students achieve their full potential.
