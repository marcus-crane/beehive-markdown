Justice Minister Amy Adams will today travel to Melbourne to attend the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council (LCCSC).

“The LCCSC is a joint-Ministerial council which helps maintain a consistent Trans-Tasman focus on fighting crime and promoting best practice in law, criminal justice and community safety,” says Ms Adams.

The meeting will focus on a range of topics including:

- Family violence
- Unexplained wealth
- Illegal firearms
- Cyberbullying and other modern forms of harassment and intimidation.

“I was delighted to chair the previous meeting held in Queenstown earlier this year, which included good discussions on topics ranging from family violence to natural disasters,” says Ms Adams.

“This meeting is another chance for New Zealand to share our experiences and learn from other jurisdictions facing similar challenges across the justice and emergency sectors.”

The LCCSC is made up of around 17 Attorneys General and Ministers from across law and order, and emergency management portfolios from New Zealand and all Australian jurisdictions, and meets twice a year.
