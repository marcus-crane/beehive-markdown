Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Brussels this week for the signing of a new partnership agreement with the European Union and to attend a conference on the future of Afghanistan.

“The Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation (PARC) commits the EU and NZ to co-operation and dialogue across a broad range of issues,” Mr McCully says.

“The PARC represents a significant step forward in New Zealand’s relationship with the EU and it is the precursor to a free trade agreement.”

Minister McCully will also attend the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan which brings together representatives from up to 70 countries to discuss the Government of Afghanistan’s plans for peace-building, development, and reform.

“The Brussels Conference is expected to focus on increasing the effectiveness of international support to Afghanistan and regional efforts to support peace and cross-border economic cooperation,” Mr McCully says.
