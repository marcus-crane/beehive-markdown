An increase in the number of applicants for social housing shows people in urgent need of housing are becoming more aware that help is available to them and seeking it out, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The number of people seeking social housing on the Housing Register at the end of September was 4602, up 725 or 18.7 per cent on the June quarter.

Another 1168 people and their families are already in social housing and on the register seeking a transfer to another house.

“These latest figures reflect the current housing market and intense demand for accommodation, particularly in Auckland,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The main reason people gave for applying for the Housing Register over the last quarter was that their current accommodation was inadequate or unsuitable. We are pleased that people in urgent housing need are becoming more aware of the help available to them and are seeking it.

“In the past year, we have placed 6225 households off the Social Housing Register and into social housing. In the last quarter alone, 1646 households were housed.

“The Government’s Budget funding means that people are able to access emergency housing when they need it through the new non-recoverable special needs grant and providers have the financial confidence to build new emergency places across the country,” Mrs Bennett says.

The Government’s comprehensive plan to increase the supply of social housing and address housing issues for vulnerable people includes:

- More than 3000 emergency places a year, with more to come
- The redevelopment of 300 existing Housing New Zealand properties into about 1200 new homes in Northcote, Auckland
- The development of Education land in Otahuhu, Auckland, for 51 homes for families on the Social Housing Register
- Plans for modular housing on three Auckland sites
- A new special needs grant for people who need emergency accommodation
- An extra $24.4 million for community housing providers in Auckland, on top of $120.1 million already announced to help more community housing providers grow their stock and to offer tenancy management and wraparound services.
- $9 million for two innovative ways community organisations can help people into housing and sustain tenancies.
- Housed an average of close to 140 people a week
- Acquired an average of 15 houses a week, 14 of them new builds, through HNZ and community housing providers
- Given financial assistance to people who wanted to move out of Auckland but couldn’t afford to.
