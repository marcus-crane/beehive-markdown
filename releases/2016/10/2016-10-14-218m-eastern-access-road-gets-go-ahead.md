Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed today’s announcement that funding has been approved for the construction of Queenstown’s $21.8 million Eastern Access Road.

The Eastern Access Road is a critical link in Queenstown’s transport network which will help to relieve congestion through the Frankton Flats area, bypassing the airport and connecting Remarkables Park to Frankton-Ladies Mile.

“This is fantastic news for Queenstown. Visitor numbers in the area are continuing to grow, and new developments associated with a strong economy are putting increasing pressure on the local transport system. The Government is responding to this growth by investing in a significant programme of work for the district,” Mr Bridges says.

The work programme includes:

- A two-lane bridge being built over Kawarau Falls which will open in the second half of 2017.
- The BP roundabout at the junction of SH6 and 6A will have a second lane added on the western side by mid-2017 to improve capacity through this highly congested area.
- Future plans to make improvements to SH6 from the Grant Road roundabout through to the Kawarau Falls.

“The Government, through the New Zealand Transport Agency, is pleased to be working constructively alongside Queenstown Lakes District Council to support the growth and development of the city’s transport network. Today’s announcement confirms the Council will be able to begin work on what is an important transport project for Queenstown.”

A sod turning to mark the start of construction is expected to occur early next month.
