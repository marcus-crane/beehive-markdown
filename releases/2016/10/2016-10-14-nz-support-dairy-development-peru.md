Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has today announced New Zealand will contribute $4 million to a four-year dairy development partnership with Peru.

“The New Zealand Peru Dairy Support Project will use our expertise to improve the profitability of up to 90,000 dairy farmers in the Peruvian Sierra,” Mr Joyce says.

“The project will focus on assisting Peruvian farmers with New Zealand technologies to improve milk and cheese production, handling and processing practices, and more effective research and extension.

“Dairying has good potential to increase smallholder dairy productivity and incomes in the Sierra, generating regular cash income and contributing to household nutrition and food security.

“Domestic demand for milk and milk products is steadily growing in Peru and the industry has a strong commercial basis and reasonably well-developed value-chains to support future growth.”

“Peru’s Government is committed to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of its dairy sector and has already made considerable national and regional level dairy investments in the Sierra,” Mr Joyce says.

The New Zealand Aid Programme investment to the project is being matched by funding from Peruvian programmes.

The announcement was made at the project’s launch in Lima, where Mr Joyce is also attending the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting.
