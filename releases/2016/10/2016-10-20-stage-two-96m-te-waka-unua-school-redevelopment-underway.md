A sod turning ceremony attended by Education Minister Hekia Parata today marked the start of the second stage of the redevelopment of Te Waka Unua School in Christchurch.

“This stage of the project will see eight new learning spaces built, as well as a new multipurpose hall and extension of the existing administration block,” says Ms Parata.

The redevelopment of Te Waka Unua School, which was formed by the merger of Woolston and Phillipstown Schools, is part of the Government’s $1.137 billion Christchurch Schools Rebuild programme.

“This programme, which is now in its third year, is on track to rebuild and renew 115 schools,” says Ms Parata.

Work at Te Waka Unua School was broken into two stages to enable the school to stay open throughout the redevelopment. Stage one involved setting up temporary classrooms and also saw three new learning spaces built.

“Te Waka Unua School brings together the proud histories of two schools and is also part of the Linwood Community of Learning, so it has a tremendous spirit of collaboration.

“Having the right facilities will further support their commitment to helping students achieve the best possible outcomes, so it was great to be at the ceremony today to be part of this important milestone.”

Construction is expected to be completed in Term 3, 2017.
