Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has announced an appointment to the Takeovers Panel, the regulator of the corporate takeovers market.

Nathanael Starrenburg has been appointed as a new member of the Panel for a five-year term, from 25 October.

“Mr Starrenburg has a strong background in corporate and transactional law. His practical experience in securities law compliance and equity capital markets transactions will add considerable value to the Takeovers Panel,” Mr Goldsmith says.

Mr Goldsmith also acknowledges outgoing panel member David Flacks.

“I would like to thank Mr Flacks for the significant contribution he has made to the performance of the Panel since his appointment in 2011,” says Mr Goldsmith.
