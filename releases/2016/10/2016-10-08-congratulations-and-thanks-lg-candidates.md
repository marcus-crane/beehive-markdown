Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today congratulated the successful candidates in the 2016 local authority elections.

“Representing your community’s best interests requires commitment, energy and leadership. Thank you for standing and serving your local communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

“Congratulations to the new Auckland Mayor Phil Goff and to the new Wellington Mayor Justin Lester.  Well done also to Lianne Dalziel who has retained the Christchurch mayoralty.”

“I look forward to building a good working relationship with mayors, councillors and board members elected today to deliver better value local services for ratepayers.”

Overall voter turnout based on the prelimnary results is 39.5%, down 1.8% on the last election.  The 2010 turnout out 49%.

In Wellington the turnout is up slightly from 41.6% in 2013 to 42.1% today.  In Christchurch turnout dropped from 42.9% last election to 37.2% now.

“Overall voter turnout is slightly lower than in 2013.  The Government is open to looking at new initiatives to assist local government as it works to promote better turnout,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This includes online voting, but more work needs to be done to address concerns around security and vote integrity before a trial can take place.  It is also important to note that international evidence suggests online voting has not led to a significant increased turnout in areas where it has been introduced.”    

“Thank you again to everyone who put their names forward as candidates.  Congratulations to those who have been elected.  And many thanks to everyone who made the effort and voted.”
