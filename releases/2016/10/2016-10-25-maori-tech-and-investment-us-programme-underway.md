“This intensive eight-day programme, Te Tira Toi Whakangao, is part of the Government’s push for more export growth and high-value jobs for Māori,” Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says.

“Innovation and technology careers and businesses offer a path to doing that. We need to connect Māori to the best programmes that connect themn to jobs and income growth. Much of this happens at a whanau and community level. But this programme offers it on a global scale which is huge.

“Māori-owned technology is an area with huge growth potential. The start-ups and established technology companies taking part in this visit are already on a growth trajectory, and many have exciting commercial developments coming together.

“The challenge for the delegation, the New Zealand Government and our industry partners is to take this experience and apply this knowledge to benefit other emerging Māori tech start-ups and encourage more rangatahi to enter the tech space, for the benefit of New Zealand.”

The technology companies will be accompanied by leading Māori investors who have assets across a range of sectors, and are looking to learn more about global tech opportunities and where New Zealand businesses fit in.

The programme aims to:

- Accelerate Māori tech companies’ plans to enter or expand in the US market
- Improve understanding among Māori tech companies and investors of trends and opportunities in the global technology sector
- Promote investment in Māori-owned technology

Mr Flavell says attracting high-quality investment can help companies like these to access export markets and global supply chains, increase spending in R&D and create jobs.

“The US is already our third largest trading partner and there is plenty of opportunity for New Zealand technology companies to expand business partnerships and explore new ones, and leverage US knowledge networks to learn more about the global technology landscape.”

The programme will run from 30 October – 8 November and has been organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise with support from Ernst Young’s Māori advisory practice EY Tahi.

Last month, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell opened applications for the Government’s Māori Digital Technology Development Fund, designed to improve and promote pathways for Māori to enter the digital technology sector.
