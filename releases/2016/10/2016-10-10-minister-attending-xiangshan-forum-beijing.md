Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will today arrive in China to attend the 7th Xiangshan Forum in Beijing.

The annual regional security event is hosted by China and brings together defence ministers, military chiefs, senior defence officials and academics to discuss key security challenges facing the Asia Pacific and how to address them.

“New Zealand prioritises our attendance at regional security dialogues, such as the Xiangshan Forum and the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I am looking forward to the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of other countries’ perspectives on key security issues that also affect New Zealand.”

Mr Brownlee will speak at a session focussed on cooperative responses to various security challenges Asia Pacific nations are confronted with now and will be confronted with in the future.

Around 63 countries and international organisations are attending the 7th Xiangshan Forum.
