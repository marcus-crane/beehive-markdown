Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a three way kidney transplant exchange has been carried out in New Zealand for the first time.

“Organ transplantation is a life-saving treatment and for people with organ failure it’s often the only option available,” says Dr Coleman.

“Individuals are often very keen to help a friend or loved one needing a kidney, but are unable to because of tissue compatibility issues.

“A transplant exchange is when you take two incompatible donor and recipient pairings, and match them with each other to allow a transplant to take place.

“Earlier in the month three such pairings, involving three donors and three recipients, took part in New Zealand’s first three way kidney transplant exchange.

“This is an innovative approach to kidney transplants, and is an important step towards helping to further increase our kidney transplant numbers.

“I’m advised that all patients are recovering well. I’d like to acknowledge the New Zealand Kidney Exchange Programme and the DHBs for their part in bringing about these life changing operations.

“A total of 147 kidney transplants were carried out in 2015, and while great progress is being made on organ donation rates, more can still be done.”

Kidney transplants are provided in three DHBs, Auckland, Capital and Coast and Canterbury. Auckland DHB also provides transplantation of other organs including hearts, lungs and livers.

In the past four years, an additional $8 million has been provided to increase support and education for hospital staff, fund donor liaison co-ordinators, and help overcome cultural barriers to donation.

The Ministry of Health is currently finalising its advice following consultation on ways to boost deceased organ donation and transplantation. That advice is expected by the end of the year.

Proposals that received considerable public and sector support included streamlining how hospitals identify potential donors and discuss donation with families, and raising public awareness about becoming a donor.
