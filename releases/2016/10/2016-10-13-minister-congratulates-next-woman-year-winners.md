Minister for Women, Louise Upston, tonight announced the 2016 NEXT Woman of the Year award winners in Education, Health and Science, and Sports. 

The NEXT Woman of the Year annual awards celebrate outstanding female leaders across six diverse categories.

Ms Upston, who was a member of the judging panel, said to the 30 finalists that their success would inspire other women to aim high and push the boundaries of what they could accomplish.

Ms Upston urged the finalists to share their experiences with young women, encouraging them to use their talent, skills and drive to achieve success.

“Young women and girls need inspiring role models. Through your actions you have shown others what is possible, by demonstrating you have what it takes to go global, while keeping your hearts local.”

“It is so important for younger women to see forward thinking female leaders excelling in a diverse range of fields. Nominees for these awards produced results in areas such as expanding grassroots sport, creating tech solutions for social good and building multi-million dollar global enterprises,” she said.

Ms Upston said that the government was supporting women to achieve at the highest levels in leadership and governance through initiatives like the expanded Future Directors programme. 

“We now have the highest ever percentage of women on state sector boards at 43.4%, showing we are well on our way to meeting our target of 45%.”

The six categories in the NEXT Woman of the Year were: Arts and Culture, Business and Innovation, Community, Health and Science, Education and Sport.

“It was an absolute privilege to be part of this event and see what New Zealand women have been achieving. There are brave and inspiring women in New Zealand, and this is a great event that brings these women and their achievements into the spotlight,” said Ms Upston.
