A $15 million road safety engineering programme designed to help keep all road users safe on key tourist routes in the South Island has got the green light, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

The funding is part of the $25 million road safety package for visiting drivers announced by the Government late last year.  

“We want all visiting drivers to experience New Zealand as a safe, attractive and accessible place,” Mr Foss says.

“The engineering programme, which will benefit all road users, includes signage and marking improvements, barriers, intersection treatments, hazard removal, shoulder widening and sealing on state highways in Otago, Southland and on the West Coast.

“The wider Visiting Drivers Project — a partnership between central government, local government and the private sector — has rolled out dozens and dozens of initiatives since it began in 2014. This summer, the Government and its Project partners will continue to build on those initiatives to further reduce harm on our roads."

  Recently completed initiatives:

- In Otago, 154 new curve signs have been installed on SH6 from Lumberbox Creek near Queenstown to Kingston.
- In Southland, 26 new curve signs have been installed on SH94, along with a safety barrier at Rocky Point near Mossburn.
- In Southland and Otago, signage at 22 rest areas has been upgraded to give drivers more advance warning.

“I want to be clear, there is no silver bullet, but the Visiting Drivers Project works alongside the Safer Journeys programme and all the infrastructure projects to create a safer environment that helps prevent crashes but also improves the outcome of any crashes that do occur," Mr Foss says.

The engineering programme will be completed over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 summer construction seasons.
