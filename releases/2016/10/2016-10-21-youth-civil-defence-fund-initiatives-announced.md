Seven initiatives will each receive $5000 of funding under the inaugural Youth in Civil Defence Fund, Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

“This fund is about increasing the involvement of young people in civil defence and emergency preparedness,” says Mrs Tolley.

Organisations including local Councils, Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups, a youth theatre trust and a regional helicopter trust will receive funding, for initiatives ranging from a two-day workshop which includes a trip to White Island’s active volcano, to the creation of a civil defence video resource.

“It’s important for our future resilience as a nation that young people are engaged in preparing for emergencies, and are part of the effective response to them,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The youth-led initiatives funded all seek to reach out to other young people and inspire them to get involved.

“As well as learning more about civil defence and emergency preparedness, participants in the initiatives will also develop valuable skills such as leadership and mentoring.”
