Earthworks are set to begin on the 196-home Massey East project as part of the Crown Land Housing Programme, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Today’s blessing of the site by Fletcher Residential’s partner, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, and the turning of the first sod pave the way for earthworks to start in early November,” Dr Smith says.

“The staged development is a mix of detached single story dwellings, terraces and duplexes, with the first homes to be completed by the end of August 2017 and the whole development completed by mid-2019.

“A 30 per cent portion, or 59 homes, will be made available for social housing. Community Housing Providers (CHPs) will have first option to purchase these homes and, if not taken up, they will be available to first home buyers. Fletcher Residential is already in negotiations with three CHPs on purchasing homes in the development. The Government is providing support to the CHPs through Income Related Rent Subsidies and upfront funding.”

The site was formerly held by the Ministry of Education for a new school but became surplus to its requirements when Hobsonville Point Secondary School was built instead.

It was bought by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment in November 2015 and offered to the *Tāmaki* Makaurau Limited Partnership in January 2016 but this was not taken up. Fletcher Residential, was offered the site as the highest-ranked member of the development panel in April and Heads of Agreement reached in June 2016. Resource consents have subsequently been granted by Auckland Council for the subdivision and earthworks.

“This project will provide nearly 200 homes in a part of Auckland where housing demand is strongest. The Government is using its ownership of the land to require a pace of construction and a mixed development with a significant portion of social housing,” Dr Smith says

“It is good to get the earthworks under way but I will be particularly pleased to see the first homes completed by next August.”
