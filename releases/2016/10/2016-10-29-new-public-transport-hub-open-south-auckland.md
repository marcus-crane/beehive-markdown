Transport Minister Simon Bridges today officially opened the newly upgraded Ōtāhuhu Station train and bus interchange in Auckland with Mayor Phil Goff.

The new $28.7 million facility will incorporate the existing train station, linking the rail platform with two new bus platforms and a terminal building via an elevated concourse.

“The upgraded Ōtāhuhu Station is a shining example of integrated public transport at its best. We know that to keep the city of Auckland moving we need to give people great public transport choices,” Mr Bridges says.

“By delivering a convenient and sheltered overpass to link the trains with two new bus platforms, we’re creating better connections for people to transfer between modes.”

From tomorrow, the introduction of the Southern New Network in South Auckland will make it even easier for people to access the station with a new timetable and network of more direct bus services.

“Importantly, safety is right at the heart of this station project – with cyclists and pedestrians safely separated from bus and car traffic,” Mr Bridges says.

The upgraded station will include improved CCTV security and will allow for future links by rail. Buses will also continue to run between the station and the town centre, retaining the link to local shops and businesses.

Mr Bridges says the Government has made it a priority to give people safer and more reliable transport choices.

“South Auckland is a key area for future urban growth, so fantastic station upgrades such as this which have the needs of the community at heart are great news for everyone.”
