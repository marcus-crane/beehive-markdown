Eight members of the Partnership Fund Board that will lead the development of new collaborative partnerships to increase youth development opportunities were announced today by Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley.

They are Karen Shires, Sam Johnson, Paul Walsh, Mike Knell, Charlizza Harris, Anne Rodda, Terry Shubkin and Dr Angela Lim.

“Under the new direction for youth development announced last November, the Government will coinvest in youth development opportunities with philanthropic and business partners, to increase the number of opportunities available,” says Ms Tolley.

“The role of the board is to draw on their expertise and networks, within their own sectors and by engaging with iwi and other potential funders, to generate new ideas and forge new partnerships to grow youth development opportunities.”

“This is about the Government, business and philanthropic organisations coming together to contribute ideas and funding to grow youth development opportunities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“There are many talented young people who with the right support can go on to achieve great things. By working together we can help more young people develop the skills and qualities they need to be successful in their lives.”

Mrs Tolley says the board members announced today were selected from a pool of 155 applicants.

“I’d like to acknowledge everyone who put themselves forward. There were some very high-calibre candidates, and as a result we have a board with outstanding skills and connections.”

A ninth board member to represent the Maori community is currently going through the Cabinet appointment process.

The new approach to youth development aims to increase the number of opportunities for young people from 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with the overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.
