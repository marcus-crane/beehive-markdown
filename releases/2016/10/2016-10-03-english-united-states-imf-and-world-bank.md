Finance Minister Bill English departs today for the United States to attend the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington DC.

“The meetings will provide me with a valuable opportunity to discuss issues of economic interest to New Zealand with representatives of other governments and policy specialists and to get a read on international developments,” Mr English says.

“New Zealand is in the relatively unusual position of having a growing economy, sound government books, growing job numbers and rising real wages at the same time as low inflationary pressures, but we cannot afford to take this state of affairs for granted.”

The annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank bring together finance ministers, central banks, businesspeople, representatives of civil society and academics.

While in the US Mr English will also meet with international ratings agencies to discuss the New Zealand economy and the international outlook.
