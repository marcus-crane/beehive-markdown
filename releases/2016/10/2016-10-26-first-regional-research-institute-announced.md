Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today announced that the New Zealand Research Institute of Viticulture and Oenology (NZRIVO) has been selected to become the first new Regional Research Institute.

“The NZRIVO, which will be based in Marlborough, will undertake new research activity and collaborate with other domestic and international research institutions to support the growth and continuing success of New Zealand’s wine and viticulture industry,” says Mr Joyce.

The Government will provide funding of $12.5 million over four years for the new institute with additional funding from industry, and it will operate as a private, independently governed organisation.

“In its proposal to establish the NZRIVO as a Regional Research Institute, New Zealand Winegrowers and its partners made a strong business case demonstrating ongoing financial sustainability beyond initial government support,” says Mr Joyce.

“The new wine research institute will support innovation in Marlborough and bring jobs to the region, will work to grow industry R&D intensity across the country, and assist related organisations to make the most of their unique business, technology, and economic growth opportunities.

“I look forward to seeing the results from this new institute benefit the Marlborough region and local and national players in the grape growing and wine making industries.”

Regional Research Institutes were announced in Budget 2015. In Budget 2016, the Government set aside $40 million of additional funds to support this initiative, bringing the total funding available to $65 million. The institutes are designed to encourage industry research and development and innovation in regional New Zealand.

In addition to the NZRIVO institute, there are currently two shortlisted proposals in final stages of business case development:

• Centre for Space Science Technology, Central Otago– research allowing the use of space-based measurements and unique to New Zealand satellite imagery to develop solutions tailored to regions and key sectors, for example, in water resource management and regional planning.

• Earth+Vantage, Southland – research using real time satellite and ground-based data to lift primary industry productivity across New Zealand, in areas such as precision farming, forestry and marine management.

Applications for the second funding round for Regional Research Institutes will open in early November.
