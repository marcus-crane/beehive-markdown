Around $2.7 million dollars will be invested to build a total of eight new classrooms at schools in the Bay of Plenty and Coromandel, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The schools are:

- Matua Primary School, Tauranga – three new classrooms
- Katikati Primary School, Katikati – three new classrooms
- Tairua School, Coromandel – two new classrooms

“The Bay of Plenty and Coromandel are experiencing population growth and this is having a flow-on effect on school rolls,” says Ms Parata.

“We’re committed to providing new classrooms for schools that need extra capacity.”

Today’s announcement is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 classrooms nationwide to meet roll growth.

“Oropi, Welcome Bay and Maungatapu Schools in Tauranga all received new classrooms under the first round of funding announced in June,” says Ms Parata.

“At the same time, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye and I also announced $18 million for a new school in the Pyes Pa area in Tauranga.

“More announcements as part of the second round of roll growth investments will be made over the coming weeks, with a third round expected in February next year.

“We want to support students to achieve to the very best of their potential, and providing the right physical learning environment is an important part of this.”

Matua Primary School is a member of the Otumoetai Community of Learning. Communities of Learning are about schools working together to share expertise and lift students achievement.
