Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the sod on the seventh and final section of the Government’s $2.1 billion Waikato Expressway.

The $115 million Longswamp Section involves widening and upgrading State Highway 1 between Hampton Downs and the Rangiriri Interchange to four lanes, with improved local road connections and a new local road overbridge.

“This marks a major milestone for the Waikato Expressway with all the remaining sections now under construction,” Mr Bridges says.

The 102 kilometre expressway is one of the Government’s seven Roads of National Significance which have been identified as key to unlocking New Zealand’s economic growth.

“When the Expressway is completed in 2020 it will reduce congestion and unlock economic potential by providing stronger links between the business and agricultural centres of Auckland and the Waikato, as well as the Bay of Plenty,” Mr Bridges says.

“This project will not only benefit businesses, it will also provide commuters, tourists and all those travelling between Auckland and Hamilton a safer and more efficient connection.”

The Longswamp Section is expected to be complete in late 2018.
