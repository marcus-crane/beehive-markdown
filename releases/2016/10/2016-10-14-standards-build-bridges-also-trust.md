Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has welcomed World Standards Day being recognised today.

“World Standards Day provides the perfect opportunity to reflect on the benefits that standards bring to our everyday lives, the market economy, and to the smooth running of public affairs,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Although we may not consciously think about it, every day standards and standardisation make a difference in all our lives.

“Standards help keep our homes, buildings, playgrounds, electrical appliances, and health services safe. They can also help protect our environment, increase productivity and drive innovation.

“For example the planning, design, and materials such as steel and concrete used for constructing bridges, such as the Auckland Harbour bridge, are all developed to certain standards.

“Standards also play a significant role in the performance of the protective safety gear that is worn on the bridge’s bungy jump or bridge climb,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The theme for World Standards Day for 2016 is 'Standards build trust'. More information can be found on the Standards New Zealand website.
