Prime Minister John Key today confirmed Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama will visit New Zealand from 19 - 23 October.

“This will be Prime Minister Bainimarama’s first official visit to New Zealand as Fiji’s Prime Minister,” Mr Key says.

“I look forward to welcoming him, following my own visit to Fiji in June.

“New Zealand and Fiji have strong ties in a range of areas, and the Prime Minister’s visit presents a further opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest.”  

Prime Minister Bainimarama will be formally welcomed in a ceremony at Government House in Auckland on 22 October, followed by bilateral talks.  He will also take part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

Both Prime Ministers will attend the Bledisloe Cup match in Auckland on 22 October.
