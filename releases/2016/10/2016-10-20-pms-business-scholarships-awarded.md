Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships for 2016 were awarded today to nine New Zealand senior executives.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says the scholarships provide a unique opportunity for some of our very best up and coming executives to expand their international expertise and to help New Zealand businesses to grow and develop on the world stage.

“The Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships are a one-off opportunity for these executives to expand their horizons and turbo-charge the growth of their companies,” Mr Joyce says. ”These scholarships are an opportunity to learn international best practices in management and leadership at some of the world’s best business schools and organisations.”

The scholarships were established in 2010 to help improve the international competitiveness of New Zealand companies by developing the management and leadership skills of owners, senior managers and executives. Since 2010, 73 executives have received scholarships.

The people who are awarded scholarships are reimbursed 50 per cent of course costs and other costs directly related to their study. The rest of the costs must be paid for by the firm or by the recipients themselves.

“These executives will bring back knowledge and contacts from the world’s top business schools,” Mr Joyce says.

“Our distance from overseas markets and the size of our economy can be a challenge to firms wanting to enter international markets.

“The scholarships will help to develop valuable networks and the global mind-set of our business leaders. Ultimately, this will help to grow our economy and make New Zealand businesses more internationally competitive.”

- Cassandra Crowley of Ngāruahine Fisheries Limited - Hawera
