Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced diplomat Lucy Duncan as New Zealand’s first resident Ambassador to Colombia.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Colombia is growing fast, and the establishment of an Embassy in Bogota will allow us to expand our links into Latin America,” Mr McCully says.   

“Colombia is a Pacific-rim relationship of growing importance for New Zealand and there are opportunities for expansion, particularly in the education, tourism and export sectors. 

“Following the referendum held on 2 October, the Colombian Government and the FARC have indicated their commitment to work together to achieve a lasting peace. Colombia can count on New Zealand’s support in this process.”

Ms Duncan is currently Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She acted as the Prime Minister’s special envoy to Spanish-speaking countries during New Zealand’s UN Security Council campaign and has served as Ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
