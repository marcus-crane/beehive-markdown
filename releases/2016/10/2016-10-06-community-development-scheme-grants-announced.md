Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Hon Jo Goodhew has today announced the outcome of the Community Development Scheme funding round for 2016/17.

“The purpose of funding provided through the Community Development Scheme is to help communities succeed by addressing local issues that are important to local people,” Mrs Goodhew says.

In the most recent funding round, seven communities located throughout New Zealand will each receive $80,000 per year for three years from the Community Development Scheme to fund a community development project worker. The project workers support members of the community to achieve the community’s vision and goals.

“This year a diverse range of communities are being supported; from urban communities such as Avondale and Strathmore Park, to the smaller rural community of Milton and the Pasifika community in Horowhenua,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“For example, in Horowheua, where there is a rapidly growing Pasifika population, a number of fono have been held to bring together the range of Island groups. It’s exciting to see an emerging focus on the community working together to realise their aspiration of being a thriving connected community.

“The projects will help these communities to come together and build on their strengths, creating positive and enduring outcomes. I am looking forward to hearing about each group’s achievements,” Mrs Goodhew says.

This year is the last three-year funding round for the CDS, which has been replaced by the Community-Led Development Programme.
