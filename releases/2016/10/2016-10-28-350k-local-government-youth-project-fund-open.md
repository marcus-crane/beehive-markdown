The $350,000 Local Government Youth Project Fund is open for applications, Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

“This fund is about supporting local councils to deliver projects that encourage young people to make a difference in their communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We want to help councils reach out to young people aged 12 to 24, and offer them more volunteering, mentoring and leadership opportunities.”

The fund can provide one-off amounts to individual councils of between $10,000 and $30,000.

“The Ministry of Youth Development recognises the wide networks that local councils have with young people, local businesses and NGOs,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This fund enables young people to make use of these connections for their own development.

“I anticipate that councils will partner with other groups and organisations in their community to organise and deliver successful projects for young people.”

Applications for the Local Government Youth Project Fund close on Friday 18 November 2016.
