Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes the New Zealand Deaf Games 2016, held in Hamilton from Friday 21 to 23 October.

“The Deaf Games is the premier national sports competition for the Deaf in New Zealand. First held in 1969, the Games run every two years and are a fantastic chance for Deaf athletes from all over New Zealand to show their prowess in their individual sport,” Ms Wagner says.

“Around 140 athletes will compete across 11 sports, including basketball, football and touch rugby.

“Given that a strong sense of community and wellbeing is crucial for keeping New Zealand Sign Language alive and strong, the games also provide a great opportunity to build up confidence and resilience among New Zealand Sign Language users,” Ms Wagner says.

“Our government contributes $25,000 through the New Zealand Sign Language Board to support the games and to look at changing the games in future from a Deaf-exclusive event to a NZSL-friendly event.”

“I wish the competitors all the best for this excellent event. I’m sure the competitors will be inspired by the New Zealand Paralympic Team’s outstanding results in Rio and will put on a great show for those watching,” Ms Wagner says.
