Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes the start of national Blind Week.

“Next week is a chance for us to support to people who are blind or who have low vision,” Ms Wagner says.

“A recent study shows that around 47,000 New Zealanders aged 15 years and over are blind or have low vision. That’s almost enough people to fill Eden Park.

"We all want to make sure that people who are blind or who have low vision are included in our communities and have the same opportunities and outcomes as everyone else.

“One of the exciting things happening during Blind Week is the 7 Day Challenge. Seven talented people who are blind or who have low vision are completing an amazing journey over seven gruelling days finishing on Friday 7th October. They will sail, climb mountains, run, cycle, and canoe to cover 700km in just one week.

"This follows from the great results from the New Zealand athletes at the Paralympics in Rio last month.

“The 7 day Challenge is a great demonstration of disabled people living their ‘Life without Limits’. Keeping active is such an important part of living a healthy life and all New Zealanders can be inspired by the 7 Day Challenge participants,” Ms Wagner says.
