Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has commissioned a joint working group to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the local bylaws system and specifically prioritising the freedom camping regime.

“Last year nearly 44,000 international visitors went freedom camping while they were here. As well a growing number of New Zealanders also travel the country by campervan, in commercial rental vehicles or in their own cars,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I am expecting to see some real improvements in the way freedom camping is managed and regulated as a result of this working group.  With freedom camping season approaching this is a priority.”

“The working group is made up of 40 council officers and central government officials.  It is a great opportunity for central and local government to collaborate and find a better way to deal with freedom camping issues.”

“It is becoming clear that tighter local controls on freedom camping are having unintended consequences. More visitors, with fewer places to go is concentrating campers in limited locations.”

“When councils regulate locally they need to be thinking regionally and nationally about the impact.”

“We are working to give local councils the tools to get benefits for their communities from the freedom camping market. Otherwise we risk missing an opportunity to see real benefits from these visitors, especially for regions with limited accommodation options.”

“As the working group identifies areas for change, the proposals are being tested with a reference group of private sector, Local Government New Zealand, Society of Local Government Managers and wider public sector representatives.”

The Department of Internal Affairs is co-ordinating the work. The analysis on freedom camping is expected by the end of this month.
