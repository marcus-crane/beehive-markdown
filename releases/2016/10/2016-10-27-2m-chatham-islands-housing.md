Māori Development and Whānau Ora Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says the investment will be managed by the Chatham Islands Housing Partnership.

The new entity comprises Ngāti Mutunga o Wharekauri Iwi Trust, Hokotehi Moriori Trust, Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust and the Chatham Islands Council.

“Living in a remote area like the Chatham Islands has its challenges,” Mr Flavell says.

“However, today we have a new housing entity with the combined talents and expertise of four groups to wisely decide how the investment will be used.”

The $2 million housing pūtea fulfils a Government promise made in 2014 to improve housing on the Chatham Islands.

Plans are being finalised to invest a further $500,000 in emergency housing, an initiative likely to also be owned by Chatham Islands Housing Partnership Trust.

Mr Flavell says the funding was made possible by the tireless work of his predecessor and the former Associate Minister for Housing, Dame Tariana Turia.
