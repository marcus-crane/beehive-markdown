Corrections Minister Judith Collins today acknowledged seven staff who have helped to assist and develop Corrections services in the Pacific Islands over the last ten years.

Today’s ceremony in Christchurch followed the ceremony in Wellington last month in which Ms Collins awarded Pacific Pins to the first batch of 17 staff who had been posted to Pitcairn Island, Vanuatu and Samoa.

“There are around 60 staff nationwide who have provided outstanding services in the Pacific and last month’s ceremony in Wellington was a great success,” says Ms Collins.

“Today we recognise staff from the South Island who have contributed to helping raise the levels of professionalism within corrections operations in the Pacific.”

Each member of staff receives a Pacific Pin, known as the Hoe Akau. The Hoe Akau is a steering paddle, giving direction and support to other paddlers to ensure the most efficient arrival at a given destination.

Corrections personnel have worked in Vanuatu since 2005 helping update the management and operations of the Corrections services on the island. A number of reform proposals have been devised including the establishment of a Community Probation Service.

In Samoa, Corrections assisted with the development of training and operational protocols for the Samoan Ministry of Police and Prisons.

On Pitcairn Island, Corrections staff monitored six offenders found guilty of sexually abusing children and have since returned for another deployment.  

“Following a request from the British Government Corrections has sent a second deployment to Pitcairn to provide custodial supervision support. Four staff are supervising a prisoner for the next ten months,” said Ms Collins.

“For many years the Police have recognised staff that have served overseas and I thought it was time that Corrections staff received a similar recognition for the outstanding work they do, particularly with our island neighbours,” says Ms Collins.
