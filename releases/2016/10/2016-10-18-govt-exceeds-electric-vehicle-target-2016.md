More than 2000 electric vehicles are now registered in New Zealand, surpassing the Government’s aim to double the fleet this year.

In May, the Government set a target to double EV registrations each year to reach 64,000 by 2021.

To date in 2016 there have been 1003 registrations, compared to 500 in 2015. This brings the total number of EVs in New Zealand to 2029.

“It’s clear that support for EVs is gathering momentum with registrations already double what they were last year. It’s fantastic to see people and businesses recognise the environmental and economic benefits of going electric,” Mr Bridges says.

Registrations show this year there’s been a move from new plug-in hybrids in early 2014 to an increasing number of used EVs in 2016.

“This increasing number of imported used vehicles will diversify the range of EVs on offer and make them more affordable and accessible for a wider range of people and businesses,” Mr Bridges says.

The Government is also continuing to roll out initiatives from its Electric Vehicle Programme including working alongside businesses on procurement options for bulk purchasing EVs.

“We want to encourage New Zealanders to go electric because the benefits are clear. They’re cheaper to run than petrol or diesel vehicles and, because they’re powered by our abundant renewable electricity supply, they’ll reduce the amount of emissions that come from the country’s vehicle fleet,” Mr Bridges says.
