A total of 100 families and individuals have taken up an offer of financial help to move out of Auckland, freeing up social housing for others in urgent need.

The Government introduced the grant of up to $5000 for relocation costs to help people who wanted to move from Auckland but otherwise could not afford to, on June 20, 2016.

“This is a fantastic result. This is potentially 100 homes that have been freed up for people in urgent housing need in Auckland, with more to come,” Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

“It also means 100 families and individuals have been able to move out of Auckland to other regions where they may have good family and community support networks.

“I am also pleased that 15 households that had been living in emergency or short-term housing were able to improve their living arrangements by taking up the grant,” Mrs Bennett says.

- So far grants have totalled $411,044
- 45 households moved to private accommodation
- 55 moved to social housing
- 22 people received payments exceeding $5000
- Nine people who relocated were aged over 65
- People have relocated to areas across the country
- Only one recipient of the relocation grant has returned to Auckland
