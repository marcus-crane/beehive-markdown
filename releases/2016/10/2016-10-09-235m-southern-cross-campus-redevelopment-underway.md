Construction work has started on the $23.5 million second stage of the redevelopment of Southern Cross Campus, a co-ed school for years 1 to 13 in Mangere, Auckland, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This stage of the redevelopment will see 24 new teaching spaces built, along with a new multi-purpose centre, library and administration facilities,” says Ms Parata.

The first stage saw the creation of a new $3.5 million trades academy.

“This latest investment will deliver state-of-the-art learning spaces, to inspire and support students to achieve to the very best of their abilities,” says Ms Parata.

“As well as the trades academy, Southern Cross Campus shares its site with a kura, a daycare, a special school satellite unit and early childhood centres. It is also part of the Mangere South Community of Learning, so it’s a great example of how education in New Zealand is being strengthened through collaboration.

“The construction work now underway at Southern Cross Campus mirrors similar projects happening all across Auckland, as we modernise schools and expand capacity to create a 21st Century learning environment.

“Since late June, work has started on over $150 million worth of upgrades and redevelopments, including at Takapuna Primary School, Bayswater School, Western Springs College, Freemans Bay School, Papatoetoe Central School and The Gardens School.

“Earlier in June, Minister Kaye and I announced a further $153 million investment in Auckland schools, as part of the $882.5 million set aside for school infrastructure under Budget 2016.

“This huge investment reflects the Government’s commitment to meeting the needs of students in our largest and fastest-growing city, now and into the future.”
