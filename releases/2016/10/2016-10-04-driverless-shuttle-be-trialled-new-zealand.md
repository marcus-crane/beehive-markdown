Transport Minister Simon Bridges says New Zealand’s first research trial of a driverless electric shuttle will provide invaluable information about the vehicle and its potential for use in New Zealand.

HMI Technologies and Christchurch International Airport Limited have today announced a two-year research trial of a French-built Navya shuttle in Christchurch, starting in 2017.

They will collaborate with the University of Canterbury, Christchurch City Council, the NZ Transport Agency and the Ministry of Transport.

“The Government is putting New Zealand ahead of the curve in transport innovation,” Mr Bridges says.

“Our supportive regulation around testing autonomous vehicles, enabling new technology to be tested while protecting public safety, have helped make this trial possible.

“The opportunity to conduct extensive research about this 15-seat electric passenger transport shuttle will provide essential information about the vehicle and how it might be used in different New Zealand transport environments.

“Autonomous vehicles are an important part of the future of transport and offer potential safety, efficiency and environmental benefits. It’s exciting to see a New Zealand-initiated trial where the skills and knowledge about managing and deploying the technology will transfer to New Zealanders.

The NZ Transport Agency and the Ministry of Transport will work with HMI Technologies and the Christchurch Airport to ensure the trial appropriately manages any safety risks.
