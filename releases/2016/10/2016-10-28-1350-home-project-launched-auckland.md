The 85 hectare, 1350 home “Auranga” greenfield development at Drury has been launched today by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith.

“The beginning of earthworks on this development further confirms the momentum and scale of residential investment under way in Auckland. This development has progressed from concept to rezoning and consenting faster than any scale housing project in New Zealand history and has been made possible by the Special Housing Areas (SHA) process,” Dr Smith says.

“SHA status was approved by Government and the Auckland Council in two stages in August last year and February 2016. The rezoning process was concluded in just 22 days, highlighting the benefits of the streamlined planning and consenting process.

“I also welcome the commitment by Auranga that at least 200 of the 1350 properties will be completed at below $580,000 as set by the Auckland Council. The challenge in Auckland is to grow both the supply of housing as well as increasing the number of homes being built in the more affordable price range for Auckland families.”

Qualifying developments have been lodged by developers in 115 of the 154 SHAs in Auckland, and a record level of earthworks is expected this summer. The latest Statistics New Zealand figures show annual building activity in Auckland has topped $7 billion per year, an all-time high in real as well as nominal terms.

“The Government has multiple reforms under way with Special Housing Areas, the new Unitary Plan, the National Policy Statement on Urban Development, the Resource Management Amendment Bill, KiwiSaver HomeStart and the Housing Infrastructure Fund, as well as the Crown Land Housing Programme,” Dr Smith says.

“We are step by step, development by development, resolving Auckland’s housing challenges.”
