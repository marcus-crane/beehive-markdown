Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says applications are now open for the 2016 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards.

“The pacific community is one of the fastest growing and youngest populations in New Zealand. Making sure they thrive is crucial for the country’s economic and social outlook,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards recognise and reward high-achieving young pacific New Zealanders who have the potential to make a big contribution to New Zealand.”

Awards are presented in a number of categories including leadership, business and enterprise, STEM and sports.

“There are many talented and gifted young pacific people in every award category and I encourage them to apply for these awards,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Applications close at 0900 on 7 November. Applications forms are available at:
