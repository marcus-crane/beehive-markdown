Associate Justice Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed three major banks agreeing to a funding proposal to assist community law centres.

Community law centres are funded partly by the Government and partly from the pooled interest on money held in lawyers’ trust accounts.

ASB, Westpac and ANZ have volunteered to take a smaller share of the interest than they are entitled to by law, meaning community law centres will receive more. BNZ and TSB Bank are already doing so.

“The banks are to be applauded for this additional support for community law centres, Mr Bridges says.

“Community law centres play an important role in ensuring that all New Zealanders have access to free legal advice.

“The additional funding will increase access to justice for those most vulnerable in our communities.”

The Government provided $4.3 million over the next four years in Budget 2016, which ensured funding certainty for community law centres through to 2020, enabling them to plan for the future.
