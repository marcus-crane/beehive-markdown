Police Minister Judith Collins has today congratulated 39 new Police officers and three Police Dog Patrol teams at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.

Ms Collins joined family and friends to celebrate the attestation parade of Wing 300 with their Patron, John Allen.

The Wing 300 attestation parade marks the completion of the first phase of the Police officers’ training which involves an intensive 18 week course at the Royal New Zealand Police College.

Wing 300 continues to build Police’s commitment to representing our communities, with members from India, Iran, South Africa, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States.

A number of the new constables are no stranger to being part of the Police family, with six recruits having family members who are or have been Police officers, and numerous others who have worked for police in other roles such as authorised officers and file management support workers.

Ms Collins also joined the family members of the three Dog Patrol teams who are parading today which marks 10 months of training at the Dog Training Centre in Trentham.

Today’s Patrol teams include a range of experience, with one handler graduating for the first time, one with his second dog, and the final with his fourth dog.

Dog teams are an integral part of New Zealand Police and they make an invaluable contribution in terms of response, prevention and as ambassadors for the organisation.
