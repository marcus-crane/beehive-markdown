Public attitudes to road safety have been put under the spotlight, revealing some encouraging trends as well as some worrying behaviour, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

The [2016 Public Attitudes to Road Safety survey](http://www.transport.govt.nz/research/roadsafetysurveys/publicattitudestoroadsafety-survey/), released on the Ministry of Transport website today, shows public support for road safety advertising and police enforcement remains high but it doesn’t always translate into safe driving behaviour.

“While the majority of Kiwis clearly support road safety messages, too many of us are ignoring those same messages when out on the road,” Mr Foss says.

“For example, 87 per cent of survey respondents agreed that enforcing the use of safety belts helps lower the road toll, but last year 91 unrestrained drivers and passengers were killed in crashes. Putting on your safety belt is such a simple action but it can be the difference between life and death.

“Road crashes are devastating for all involved — not only the victims, but also their family, friends and emergency service staff.

“We all have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe on the roads.  This long weekend, I urge all motorists to wear a safety belt, drive to the conditions and avoid distractions.”

The official Labour Weekend period will run from 4pm on Friday 21 October to 6am Tuesday 25 October.
