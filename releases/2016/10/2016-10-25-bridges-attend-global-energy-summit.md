Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges leaves for Singapore today to attend International Energy Week.

The global event brings together 28,000 representatives of the energy industry, Governments and non-government organisations from across the Asia-Pacific region and from around the world.

Discussions will focus on the future of energy supply and ensuring people across the region have access to reliable energy.

Mr Bridges will take part in panel discussions at the Singapore Energy Summit, the Energy Access Forum, the Asia Clean Energy Summit and the Gas Asia Summit.

“Globally we are seeing low oil, gas and coal prices but at the same time we have to take significant steps to reduce our carbon emissions if we are to manage the impacts of climate change,” Mr Bridges says.

“For the Asia-Pacific region in particular, which contains many developing nations, this situation raises some big questions. It is important for New Zealand to take part in the debate.

“With more than 80 per cent of our electricity coming from renewable sources, it’s an ideal opportunity to share our experience with renewable energy and promote our considerable expertise in renewable technologies.”
