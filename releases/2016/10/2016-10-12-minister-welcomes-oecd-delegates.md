Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith welcomes delegates from the OECD who are gathering in Auckland today, to participate in the Global Symposium on Financial Education.

“This is the first time New Zealand has hosted this bi-annual forum and it is a great opportunity to showcase the work we are doing in the area of financial capability,” says Mr Goldsmith.

This year’s programme also includes seminars on consumer protection, innovation strategy, and in particular the role of digital disruption in the banking sector.

“The government watches developments in FinTech closely to ensure its regulatory settings enable innovation,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Another focus for government has been increasing levels of trust in our financial markets.

“Like every nation we seek to balance innovation, transparency and regulation, each of which are essential ingredients in developing robust financial markets that attracts investment.

“The recently released Global Competitiveness Index ranked New Zealand first out of 138 economies for financial market development and shows we are on the right track. I look forward to sharing some of our insights with the delegates,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Global Symposium on Financial Education runs over Wednesday 12th and Thursday 13th October at the ANZ Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland.
