Transport Minister Simon Bridges has made a series of appointments and reappointments to transport sector statutory bodies.

Nigel Gould has been reappointed Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority, Peter Griffiths as the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) Deputy Chair and Jim Boult as a CAA board member.

“Mr Boult, Mr Gould and Mr Griffiths are high performing members of a strong team. They are involved in overseeing regulatory changes at CAA, and their reappointments will maintain continuity on the Board,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Griffiths has been reappointed for a two-year term, and Mr Gould and Mr Boult have been reappointed for three years.

Mr Bridges has also reappointed Dr Martin Peterson as the Medical Convener for another three-year term.

“Dr Peterson is a highly specialised medical practitioner who is experienced and knowledgeable in civil aviation. He takes a methodical, evidence-based approach, and he has excellent qualifications and experience.”

In addition, Mr Bridges has appointed Fred McLay as a member of the Oil Pollution Advisory Committee.

“With his long history of working in the petroleum industry and with associated community stakeholders, Mr McLay brings a wealth of petroleum industry knowledge and business experience,” Mr Bridges says.
