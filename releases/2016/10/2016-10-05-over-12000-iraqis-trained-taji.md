The number of Iraqi Security Forces personnel trained by the Australia-New Zealand Building Partner Capacity mission has passed the 12,000 mark, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

The milestone was reached when two Iraqi Army units completed training this week.

“It’s pleasing to see a high number of trainees going through the training offered at Camp Taji in Iraq by the joint mission,” Mr Brownlee says. 

“The Government announced in February last year a two-year deployment of New Zealand Defence Force personnel to Iraq to help train the Iraqi Security Forces to combat Daesh.

“In June the deployment was extended until November 2018. 

“The number of Iraqi personnel receiving training, combined with the gradual progress being made by the Iraqi forces on the ground against Daesh, shows the mission is meeting its aim,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The work of our personnel is valued by the Iraqi Government, its military leaders, and the troops that are being trained.

“Our forces are highly effective trainers, and through this deployment New Zealand is making a real contribution to Iraq’s ability to combat Daesh.”

The latest group to complete training comprised some 3000 Iraqi personnel.

The training offered by the joint mission at Taji includes weapons handling, combat first aid, live firing, building clearance, counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device), leadership, and tactics and techniques for squad through to company-level operations
