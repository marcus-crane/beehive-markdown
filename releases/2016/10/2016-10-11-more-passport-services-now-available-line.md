Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne says applications for urgent, lost, stolen or damaged passports and those that require a name change can now be made on-line, in a further improvement of the passport service.

“Urgent applications make up around seven percent (44,000) of the total number of passports issued annually. Urgent passport applications are processed and completed within three working days and can be delivered to most locations in the world within several days.

“The world class reputation and travel accessibility offered by the New Zealand passport makes it a highly valued item but misfortune can strike travellers at any time so it is reassuring to know that lost or stolen passport applications can now be completed online 24 hours a day anywhere in the world.

“The loss or theft of a passport or travel document is a serious matter. It is very important that the loss or theft of a passport is reported to the nearest New Zealand Passport Office or New Zealand Embassy, High Commission or Consulate so it can be cancelled and border control authorities can be notified”, said Mr Dunne.

Since the start of the year nearly every month has seen an increase in the number of passport applications made online with nearly 23,000 applications being received in September.

In another change, participating Australia Post shops are now able to supply NZ residents with an emailed photo suitable for them to complete a New Zealand passport renewal online.
