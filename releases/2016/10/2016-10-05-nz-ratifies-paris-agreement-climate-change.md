New Zealand has helped make history today by ratifying the Paris Agreement, Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett says.

“By ratifying today, we are helping to get the Paris Agreement officially over the line, and demonstrated our commitment to global action on climate change.

“Although New Zealand contributes only a small proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, the early timing of our ratification enables us to join the group of countries that make up 55 per cent of global emissions - the minimum needed to get this agreement across the line. Our contribution counts.

“A significant benefit of the Government ratifying early is that it guarantees New Zealand a seat at the decision-making table on matters that affect the Paris Agreement at the next United Nations climate change meeting in Marrakech in November, which I look forward to attending,” Mrs Bennett says.

Mrs Bennett says the Paris Agreement is a comprehensive and durable international agreement, and New Zealand is committed to playing its part in keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C.

“I’d like to thank the select committee and my parliamentary colleagues for the cross-party support of New Zealand’s involvement in this significant agreement.

“New Zealand’s big challenge now is to develop an effective plan for meeting our target of reducing our emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, Mrs Bennett says.
