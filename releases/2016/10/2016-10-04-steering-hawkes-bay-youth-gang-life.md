A $50,000 youth leadership and mentoring programme aimed at helping steer young Hawke’s Bay people from gang life was announced today by Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley.

“This is about giving young people with known gang connections opportunities to develop skills that open up alternative pathways to gang membership,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The programme will support the learning of skills such as leadership, problem-solving, teamwork, decision-making and self-management. It will also give participants the chance to make a positive contribution to their communities.”

Mrs Tolley says the programme is funded by the Ministry of Youth Development, and will provide opportunities for at least 20 local young people.

“In March this year I announced $1.1 million of MSD funding to pilot community programmes in the Bay of Plenty and on the East Coast, aimed at helping partners and children overcome negative gang influences and lead more successful lives.

“The Hawke’s Bay youth-focused programme will complement these pilots, and supports the goal of breaking the cycle of intergenerational gang life and welfare dependence.”

The programme will be designed and delivered in partnership with local community groups.

“Positive youth development opportunities can have a tremendous impact on young people’s lives,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It’s important we look at ways to help lift young people out of negative lifestyles, and give them confidence to build better futures for themselves.”
