Patient Safety Week starts today and coincides with the release of a new report showing patient harm reduction and cost savings have been achieved through improved health services.

Running until 5 November, Patient Safety Week 2016 encourages open communication between health professionals and consumers. It is promoted by many district health boards and other health providers and supported by the Health Quality & Safety Commission (HQSC) and the Accident Compensation Corporation.

The Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne has welcomed today’s HQSC report which marks a positive start to the week, and says it shows our hardworking doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are delivering results for everyone in New Zealand to receive safe, quality health care.

“Hospitals have introduced measures to prevent people from falling, getting infections or being given the wrong medicines, and programmes to make surgery as safe as possible.

“The *Open4Results* report from shows that, in the area of falls, for example, there have been 52 fewer in-patient falls resulting in a broken hip since January 2015. Since July 2013, there has been a reduction in surgical site infections related to hip and knee replacements. We are also seeing fewer older people admitted repeatedly to hospital.

“In all, improvements in these areas have saved $50 million and added value of over $350 million since 2010, when the Commission was founded.

“Throughout Patient Safety Week, many hospital staff will be wearing name stickers to introduce themselves and focus on building that human connection and trust, setting a foundation for better communication about every aspect of a patient’s care,” Mr Dunne said.
