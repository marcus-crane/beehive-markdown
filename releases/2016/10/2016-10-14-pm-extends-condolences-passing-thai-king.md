Prime Minister John Key says his thoughts are with the people of Thailand following the death of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

“King Bhumibol was the world’s longest serving monarch and presided over a period of transformative growth and development that saw Thailand emerge as a regional leader and one of South East Asia’s major economies,” says Mr Key.

“During his reign, New Zealand and Thailand developed a close and friendly relationship, built on a shared desire for peace and security in our region.

“King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit helped to cement the relationship when they visited New Zealand in August 1962.

“More than 100,000 New Zealanders visit Thailand each year and with the strong bond of friendship between our two countries, I know many will share in the deep sense of loss and sadness being felt by the Thai people.

“I extend the New Zealand Government’s sincerest condolences to Queen Sirikit, Thailand’s Royal Family and all the people of Thailand,” says Mr Key.
