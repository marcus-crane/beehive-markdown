Justice Minister Amy Adams has today announced two key appointments to the Electoral Commission.

Alicia Wright is to be appointed as the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commission and Kristy McDonald QC as the Deputy Chair. Both will be appointed for a term of five years.

Ms Adams says the Commission requires strong leadership in order to maintain New Zealand’s politically neutral and independent democratic processes.

“Both appointees possess the range of skills and attributes that will ensure that the Commission continues to administer the electoral system impartially, efficiently and effectively,” says Ms Adams.

“Ms Wright has held a number of leadership roles in the public sector and has a track-record demonstrating a clear commitment to neutrality and delivery in a complex political environment.

“Ms McDonald has extensive experience in governance roles and has good strategic planning skills, expertise in financial management and risk management, and unquestionable personal integrity and independence.

“Each of the appointees will provide very able leadership to the Commission, and will take up their positions in due course.”

Ms Adams also thanked outgoing Chief Electoral Officer Robert Peden, who had previously indicated he was not available for the reappointment and Deputy Chair Jane Huria for their dedicated service during their terms.
