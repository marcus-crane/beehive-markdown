Education Minister Hekia Parata today welcomed the opening of two new classroom blocks at Ellerslie School in Auckland.

Maungakiekie MP Sam Lotu-Iiga visited the school today to officially open the new blocks on Minister Parata’s behalf.

“The new blocks represent an investment of more than $10 million and follow the modernisation of other classrooms at the school,” says Ms Parata.

“This is about ensuring that Ellerslie School has capacity to meet a growing roll and provide a 21st Century learning environment.”

Each new block contains 12 classrooms and is two-storeys high, to maximise outdoor recreation space on the school’s relatively small site.

“I know the school community will be thrilled with the new facilities and the innovative learning environment that’s been created,” says Ms Parata.”

Construction is currently under way on numerous other school redevelopments and upgrades across Auckland, with over $150 million worth of projects kicking off in the last four months alone, at Takapuna Primary School, Bayswater School, Western Springs College, Freemans Bay School, Papatoetoe Central School, The Gardens School and Southern Cross Campus.

Around $153 million will also be invested in Auckland school infrastructure as part of the $882.5 million announced for school infrastructure under Budget 2016.
