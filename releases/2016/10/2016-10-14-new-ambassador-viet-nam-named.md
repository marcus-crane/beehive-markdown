Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Wendy Matthews as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Viet Nam.

“In recent times, relations between New Zealand and Viet Nam have gone from strength to strength,” Mr McCully says.

“Cooperation between our two countries is expanding in areas such as agri-business, clean technologies and disaster management, aviation, tourism, defence and education.

“The introduction of seasonal direct flights and Viet Nam’s position as APEC Chair in 2017 will provide further opportunities to deepen connections between us.

“Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth and it’s been New Zealand’s fastest growing two-way trade relationship in South East Asia, with growth more than doubling from 2010 to 2015.”

Ms Matthews is currently a Manager in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Asia Pacific Division and was Deputy High Commissioner in New Delhi.
