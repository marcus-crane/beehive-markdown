The Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the broad public support of proposed future land uses in the Waimakariri District’s red zones. 

About 84 hectares of mainly residential land in Kaiapoi, Pines Beach in Kairaki sustained severe land damage in the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

The Crown subsequently bought more than 1000 properties in the district to allow people to move on with their lives.

“Despite the widespread destruction, the earthquakes have provided unique opportunities to transform and future-proof affected communities,” Mr Brownlee says.

“In September 2015, I directed the Waimakariri District Council to develop a Draft Recovery Plan outlining the intended uses of the land.

“This process has enabled the Waimakariri District Council to work with communities and develop a plan that promotes the wellbeing of residents and supports economic development and growth in an affordable and consistent manner.

“Public feedback on the draft plan closed last month and, of the 60 comments received, there was broad support for the land uses outlined.

“The most commonly raised themes were support for green spaces while a smaller number of commenters supported commercial and residential development.

“In Kaiapoi South, commenters particularly supported the heritage and mahinga kai proposals and a number of people proposed riverside residential and commercial development.

“I will now consider the written comments and the Draft Recovery Plan and intend to make a decision before the end of the year,” Mr Brownlee says.
