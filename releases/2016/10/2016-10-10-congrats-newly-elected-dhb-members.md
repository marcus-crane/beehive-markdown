Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today congratulated the newly elected members to 19 of the 20 District Health Boards across the country.

“DHB Boards have a critical leadership role in the health sector, and the Boards have an important role in the sector’s ability to further improve the health outcomes of all New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“I look forward to working with the new Board members over the next three years. I’d like to thank the outgoing Board members for their contribution. I’d also like to acknowledge all the candidates who put themselves up for election.

“DHB Boards will be the driving force to implement the New Zealand Health Strategy.

“The Strategy signals a focus on prevention and wellbeing, and more integrated services. At the same time we want to see support for innovation, better collaboration, and new ways of working to reach our most vulnerable.

"DHBs need to continue to improve key frontline services in emergency departments, cancer treatment, and elective surgery.”

As the final results are confirmed, DHBs will be publishing the names of their newly elected Board members on their websites.

The country’s 20 DHBs have a combined budget of $13.266 billion for 2016/2017. That’s an increase of $3.401 billion over the last eight years.

Each DHB board has up to 11 members, of which seven are elected. Dr Coleman will be making appointments, as well as appointing new chairs next month.

The New Zealand Public Health and Disability (Southern DHB) Elections Act extended the term of the Southern Commissioner. The next Board will be appointed as part of the 2019 local body elections.
