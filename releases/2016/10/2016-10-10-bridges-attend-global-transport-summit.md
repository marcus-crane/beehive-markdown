Transport Minister Simon Bridges will leave for Melbourne today to attend the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) World Congress to promote New Zealand as a test bed for new technologies.

The Minister will attend from 10 to 12 October and participate in technology demonstrations and bilateral meetings with transport leaders and groups from around the world.

“This summit brings together thinkers and entrepreneurs at the leading edge of new transport technologies. I’ll be leading a delegation of public and private sector representatives that will showcase the innovative work taking place in New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.

“Fast developing ITS technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have great potential to contribute towards safer and more efficient transport systems.

“To ensure we can realise these benefits, testing and trialling opportunities are needed to help us understand how new technologies will work in different environments, and what we’re going to need to do to get ready for them.

“New Zealand offers a fantastic testing environment for many ITS technologies, and we want to send a very clear message during this World Congress that we are open for business.”
