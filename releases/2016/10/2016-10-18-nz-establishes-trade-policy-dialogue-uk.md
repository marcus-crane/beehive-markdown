Trade Minister of Todd McClay has established a trade policy dialogue with his United Kingdom counterpart, Secretary for International Trade Liam Fox in London today.

"For New Zealand, this is about being ready to cement our formal trading relationship with our fifth largest trading partner, once the UK is in a position to negotiate independently of the European Union.

"I discussed with Secretary Fox the importance of remaining closely engaged, particularly as New Zealand advances our priority of a free trade agreement with the European Union.

"I thanked Secretary Fox for assurances that New Zealand's trade interests will not be compromised by Brexit," says Mr McClay.

Mr McClay is also scheduled to talk with EU Trade Commissioner Malmström later in the week.

"The trade policy dialogue with the U.K. will also be an important forum for engaging across a range of shared trade policy issues, such as the World Trade Organisation, as it develops its approach to trade policy.

"Secretary Fox and I commend the value of this engagement, both to underpin our strong economic relationship, but also given New Zealand's recognised perspective in international trade policy."

The Trade Policy Dialogue will be convened at senior officials' level and cover market access and trade policy issues of mutual interest, including WTO processes and current and prospective negotiations. The first meeting will take place by early 2017, with subsequent talks to be held roughly every six months
