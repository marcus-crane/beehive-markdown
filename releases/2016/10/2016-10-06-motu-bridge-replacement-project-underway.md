Transport Minister Simon Bridges has marked the start of construction of the Motu Bridge replacement project near Gisborne.

The $6.5 million dollar replacement project was announced by the Prime Minister in January as part of the Government’s Accelerated Regional Roading Programme.

The current bridge, built in the 1930s, is the last remaining one-lane bridge on State Highway 2 between Gisborne and Opotiki.

“The replacement of the Motu Bridge will result in a safer, more reliable route linking the East Coast to the Bay of Plenty,” Mr Bridges says.

“This route is heavily relied upon for the movement of freight, for tourism, and for local people.  Currently, when the bridge is closed commuters are forced to travel an extra two hours via the East Cape along State Highway 5, causing delays for freight and the local farming community.

“The new two-lane bridge will improve safety and provide more predictable and reliable travel times. This will strengthen the region’s primary link with the Bay of Plenty and help boost economic growth and productivity on the East Coast.”

Other features of the project include a new parking area, which will make it safer and easier for schoolchildren in the area to catch the bus, and landscape planting using local plants, in keeping with the nearby Te Kapu Forest remnant.

“I’d like to acknowledge East Coast MP Anne Tolley who has strongly advocated for this project for the Gisborne area,” Mr Bridges says.

The full project, including realignment of the approaches to the bridge, and the removal of the old bridge, is scheduled for completion by early 2018.
