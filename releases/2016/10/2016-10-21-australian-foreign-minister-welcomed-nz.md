“Our talks will focus on bilateral issues ahead of the annual Australia – New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting early next year, as well as our ongoing work together in the Pacific.

“We will also discuss our shared interests in Asia and the Middle East, and New Zealand’s continuing work on global security issues at UN Security Council,” Mr McCully says.
