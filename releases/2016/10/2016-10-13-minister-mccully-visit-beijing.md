Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to China this weekend for discussions with his Chinese counterpart Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

“New Zealand attaches major importance to our relationship with China, as one of our largest export markets and as a partner in the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr McCully says. 

“Two-way trade between New Zealand and China now stands at $22 billion and this is underpinned by regular political dialogue at all levels.

“My meeting with Minister Wang Yi is an opportunity to discuss a range of issues, including cooperation in the Pacific and matters currently before the United Nations Security Council.”

While in Beijing Minister McCully will also meet with a number of other senior Chinese officials including the Minister for the International Department, Song Tao.
