Education Minister Hekia Parata this afternoon welcomed a historic school bus onto the grounds of Parliament.

“This is a replica of a Ford Model T bus, used for New Zealand’s first ever school bus service that began in Piopio in 1924,” says Ms Parata.

Volunteers from the Piopio College Trust and others created the replica, after sourcing an original 1921 chassis and motor and recreating the wooden framework and other details.

“I understand the team spent a huge number of hours researching specifications and tracking down authentic materials,” says Ms Parata.

“It was great to meet the team who travelled to Wellington for today’s event, and acknowledge their passion and energy.

“I’d also like to acknowledge Barbara Kuriger, MP for Taranaki-King Country, who supported the restoration project from the start and was at the reception today.”

Beginning 92 years ago, the Piopio service was the start of school buses in New Zealand.

“Each original Ford Model T bus would have transported about 30 students to school each day.

“Today, the Government spends about $185 million a year getting around 100,000 students to and from school.

“This project recognises the important role the school transport service has played in our rural communities.

“Since it began, the service has removed the barrier of isolation for many Kiwi students, so they have the same opportunity as their peers to participate in our world class education system.”
