Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse has this morning expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Helen Kelly who lost her battle with cancer overnight.

“Helen was a passionate advocate for the rights of New Zealand workers,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“She championed the cause of making our workplaces healthier and safer, particularly in the wake of the Pike River Mine disaster.

“I enjoyed our robust and respectful discussions on employment law and health and safety and admired her passionate advocacy of the causes she strongly believed in.

“I extend my condolences to Helen’s family and friends and to the wider Union family.”
