Corrections Minister Judith Collins has commended the Department for the work it is undertaking with the victims of crime.

Corrections is taking a  more proactive communication approach with registered victims. The new approach is intended to make things easier for victims to understand, to educate them on the processes they may not be aware of and the way the system works.

“Too often these victims, who have had their lives torn apart by crime, only hear from the Department’s Victim Information Service when there is an event to be notified of, such as an offender hearing or release. We want to improve this,” says Ms Collins.

“The first step is the creation of an annual newsletter. At no point do we want to intrude on the privacy of the victims but this newsletter, to people registered on the Victim Notification Register, will create a flow of information and will also allow the Department to keep their records up to date.”

Corrections consulted widely prior to the development of the newsletter including discussions with victims, the Chief Victims Advisors office and victim support groups.

“A newsletter such as this helps to personalise the Department and will give the victims some comfort that any issues they have, or questions they need answered, will be handled in a compassionate and professional manner,” says Ms Collins.

The first newsletter, produced and distributed this month, introduced some of the staff members involved in Victim Information Services.
