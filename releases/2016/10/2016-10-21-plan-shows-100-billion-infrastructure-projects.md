Finance Minister Bill English has today launched the Government’s Ten Year Capital Intentions Plan (CIP) which shows a pipeline of $100.9 billion worth of infrastructure projects over the next decade.

The 2016-2025 CIP is the third of its kind since it was launched in 2014 and brings together the infrastructure investment intentions of central and local government, State-owned enterprises, and public and private companies.

Of the 3823 projects in the 2016-2025 pipeline, 219 belong to central government and are valued at $40.5 billion, 3559 belong to local government and are valued at $51.1 billion, and 45 projects belong to the private sector at a value of $9.2 billion.

This year’s CIP gives a greater year-by-year breakdown of actuals and intentions.

It shows that the total actual and estimated spend out to 2025 has increased by nearly $15 billion since last year.

“Publishing this information offers transparency and provides businesses with greater certainty about current and future infrastructure provision,” Mr English says.

“Ensuring that the right frameworks are in place to support sound infrastructure investment decisions that meet the needs of a changing New Zealand is an important focus for this Government.

“Central and local government are increasingly working together to improve infrastructure investment and the management of existing infrastructure necessary to underpin economic growth.”
