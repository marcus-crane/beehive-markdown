Around $2.1 million will be invested to build a total of six new classrooms at schools in the Wellington and Kapiti regions, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The schools are:

- Rangikura School, Porirua – one new classroom
- Kimi Ora School, Lower Hutt – three new classrooms
- Te Kura-a-Iwi o Whakatupuranga Rua Mano, Otaki – two new classrooms.

“This is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth,” says Ms Parata.

“We’re committed to providing new classrooms for schools that need extra capacity.”

The first round of investments saw $4 million announced for 14 new classrooms in the greater Wellington region, including Wairarapa.

“As well as new classrooms, we’ve also been investing in redevelopments to address leaky buildings and modernise local schools,” says Ms Parata.

“Since November last year, almost $100 million has been announced for major redevelopments at Aotea College, Wellington East Girls’ College, Thorndon School, Newtown School, Kelburn Normal School, Khandallah School and Ngaio School.

“We want to support students to achieve to the very best of their potential, and providing the right physical learning environment is an important part of this.”

Kimi Ora School is a member of the Naenae Community of Learning (CoL), and Rangikura School is soon to join the Northern Porirua CoL. Communities of Learning are about schools working together to help students achieve their full potential.

More announcements as part of the second round of investments in roll growth classrooms will be made next week, with a third round expected in February next year.
