Communications Minister Amy Adams says VHF radio channels changes which take place this weekend will ensure New Zealand’s maritime radio services are in line with the rest of the world.  

“The changes come into effect today (1 October) and will allow us to expand ship tracking and data services. These services are part of our international obligations for radio spectrum management,” says Ms Adams.

The changes have been well signalled across the maritime community over the past two months in the lead up to today's changes.

In New Zealand’s coastal waters, maritime radio channels are used for many different purposes, ranging from broadcasting weather information, to providing a way to communicate in the event of emergency.

“Safety is a priority and Channel 16, the safety, distress and emergency communication channel will stay the same. Maritime New Zealand will continue to monitor it 24 hours a day,” says Ms Adams.

“I would like to remind boaties that there’s no need to buy a new radio – current radios will be able to access all the available channels after the changes take place. However, there may be a need to switch to a new channel number to continue to access the local repeater, or to listen to the weather forecast.”

Changing the maritime channels has involved Maritime New Zealand, The Royal New Zealand Coastguard, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Radio Spectrum Management team.
