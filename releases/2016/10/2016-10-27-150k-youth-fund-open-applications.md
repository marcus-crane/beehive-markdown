Applications are now open for Youth Fund 2017, which makes $150,000 available for community initiatives led by young people, Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

“The Youth Fund supports community projects that help more young people between the ages of 12 and 24 participate in volunteering, mentoring and leadership opportunities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“A unique aspect of the fund is that it supports projects designed and led by young people, either working alone or in partnership with youth organisations.

“Young people also make up the panel which will assess applications and recommend where funding goes, making this a completely youth-led initiative.”

Individual applications under Youth Fund 2017 can be made for amounts between $2,000 and $7,000.

“This is a great opportunity for young people to develop their own skills, while at the same time contributing to their community,” says Mrs Tolley.

Applications for Youth Fund 2017 close at midday on Friday18 November 2016.
