Prime Minister John Key has today congratulated Antonio Guterres on becoming the next United Nations Secretary-General.

“We look forward to working with Antonio Guterres. He is a friend of New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

"He has solid credentials. He is the former head of government for Portugal and was the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for ten years. 

“The role of UN Secretary-General is more important than ever and we have high expectations of him.”

Mr Key says he is obviously disappointed for Helen Clark.

“We did everything we could to support Helen. She would have been an outstanding Secretary-General but the clear preference was for Antonio Guterres.

“Helen fought a good campaign and New Zealanders can be proud of her.”
