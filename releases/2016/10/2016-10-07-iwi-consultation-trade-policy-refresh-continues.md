Trade Minister Todd McClay today continued engagement with iwi leaders at a Rotorua hui on the refresh of the government's Trade Policy Strategy.

"New Zealand's current trade strategy has served us very well over the past twenty years, securing market access and opportunities that underpin our exports, prosperity, and jobs.

"The current refresh is about factors that will shape our future trade policy efforts, and Maori are central to the New Zealand export story.

"This is particularly true in the primary sector where Maori own between 10 and 30 per cent of meat and dairy, and around 40 per cent of both forestry and fisheries,” says Mr McClay.

The Policy Strategy refresh is being led by the Trade Minister and supported by MFAT, which have undertaken a number of public meetings in September as well as in-depth sessions with stakeholders, including iwi.

"This is my sixth meeting with representatives of the Iwi Leaders Forum on trade issues this year.

“We have also held numerous hui on specific trade agreements such as TPP," says Mr McClay.
