Trade Minister Todd McClay will visit China and Hong Kong for a series of trade discussions, and participate in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Ministerial meeting in Cebu, Philippines.

While in Cebu, Mr McClay will meet bilaterally with his counterparts from a number of other negotiating parties to discuss both the RCEP negotiations and wider trade issues.

“Consistent with the Joint Statement on RCEP issued by Leaders in September, I will continue to encourage my counterparts to aim for a modern, comprehensive, high quality and mutually beneficial economic partnership with commercially meaningful outcomes.

“If RCEP is successfully concluded, it will offer New Zealand businesses and exporters significant opportunities under a single set of rules in a region that includes six of our top 10 trading partners”, says Mr McClay.

In Hong Kong, Mr McClay will meet with the Financial Secretary, and Secretary of Commerce and Economic Development, and will also engage with key investors with interests in New Zealand.

“I welcome the opportunity to meet with my counterparts in Hong Kong, and exchange views on regional developments and our many shared interests” says Mr McClay.

Hong Kong is New Zealand’s 15th largest trading partner with two-way trade worth NZ$1.6 billion and a growing source of investment into New Zealand. A free trade agreement with New Zealand came into effect in 2011.

Mr McClay will also attend the 15th Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business to engage with business leaders and executives from Germany, New Zealand and Asia and meet with Germany’s Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Mr Sigmar Gabriel.

Mr McClay will also travel to Beijing for a brief trade-related programme, including a meeting with his counterpart, Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng.
