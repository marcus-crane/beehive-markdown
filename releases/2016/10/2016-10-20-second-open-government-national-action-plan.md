State Services Minister Paula Bennett has today announced the publication of New Zealand’s second National Action Plan under the international Open Government Partnership.

“New Zealand is internationally recognised as world-leading in open and transparent government with well-established public accountability processes, advanced open data systems and a strong, high integrity public service,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Our second National Action Plan builds on New Zealand’s strong history of open, democratic government and further improves openness, transparency, public participation in government and use of technology,” she says.

The commitment areas include advancements in:

•              Official Information Act (OIA) practices by government agencies

•              Openness within the government budget process

•              Access to open data

•              Public engagement (including online)

•              Access to legislation

•              Policy practices

“The commitments in this plan are ambitious, but achievable. One of the commitments is for the State Services Commission and the Ministry of Justice to work on a more consistent set of agency practices around responding to official information act request and consistent measures of agencies’ OIA performance,” Mrs Bennett says.

The second National Action Plan is available on the new Open Government Partnership New Zealand website: [www.ogp.org.nz](http://www.ogp.org.nz)

The National Action Plan is a two-year work programme from 2016.
