Corrections will receive $2.5 million from the Justice Sector Fund to help offenders into stable employment.

The *‘This Way for Work’* initiative, is a two year pilot programme, and includes a new in-house recruitment function and the provision of Employer Starter Packs. The programme will complement the $15.3 million initiative to improve the employment prospects of released prisons announced by the Social Development and Corrections Ministers earlier this month.

Eight Offender Recruitment Consultants start their roles today to help place former prisoners and community offenders into stable employment. They will work one-on-one with these offenders and connect approximately 1,000 offenders per year with jobs.   

“This initiative will help remove some of the barriers released prisoners face when trying to secure employment,” says Ms Collins.

Employer Starter Packs were launched in August to provide some financial assistance to offenders to support them into work.

“This may include transport costs, equipment or uniforms, training, licence fees and drug testing costs.

“We know that employment has a positive effect on reducing recidivism,” says Ms Collins.

“Providing support and tools to help recently released offenders into employment is one way we can encourage these people to turn their lives around.”

The funding is for two years and will be evaluated at the end of that time.
