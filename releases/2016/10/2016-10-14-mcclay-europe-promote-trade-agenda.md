Trade Minister Todd McClay travels to Europe tomorrow for discussions on trade with the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK).

Mr McClay will visit London to meet UK Secretary of State for Trade Liam Fox, to discuss post-Brexit trade relations, and will further progress an EU-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with EU Trade Commissioner Malmström in Norway.

“The EU-New Zealand FTA is a priority, as is our relationship with the UK. We are grateful for the strong assurances we have received that New Zealand’s trade interests with both the EU and the UK will not be affected by the Brexit vote.

“My meeting with Secretary Fox will be an opportunity to again reinforce the importance of our trading relationship and that New Zealand will seek a trade deal with the UK once they are in a position to do so,” says Mr McClay.

Mr McClay will then join EU Trade Commissioner Malmström and a number of other WTO Trade Ministers in Norway.

“This will be my 5th meeting with the Commissioner since becoming Trade Minister and I look forward to discussing progress towards the launch of the EU-New Zealand FTA.”

In Oslo, Mr McClay will discuss potential outcomes for the 11th WTO Ministerial meeting, due to be held in Buenos Aires in late 2017.

“The 10th WTO Ministerial meeting in Nairobi in December 2015 represented a significant outcome for New Zealand and global trade, particularly the historic commitment to eliminate agricultural export subsidies and New Zealand is committed to achieving a similar result next year,” says Mr McClay

Mr McClay will also travel to Portugal to discuss the EU-New Zealand FTA and bilateral issues with Portuguese Ministerial counterparts, and meet industry leaders. Mr McClay is the first New Zealand Minister to visit Portugal since 2010.
