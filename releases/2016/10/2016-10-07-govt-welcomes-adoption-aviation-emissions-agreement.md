Transport Minister Simon Bridges has confirmed New Zealand will voluntarily join an international agreement addressing emissions from air travel when it comes into effect in 2021.

“New Zealand is one of 64 States, representing more than 83.8 per cent of international aviation activity, that intend to voluntarily participate in the global measure from its outset,” Mr Bridges says.

The voluntary global measure has been adopted by members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which is responsible for the regulation of international aviation, including measures for emissions reduction in the sector.

“International aviation is not included in the recent Paris Agreement, which is why New Zealand will join the voluntary global measure. Our participation reflects our strong commitment to playing our part in the global response to climate change.

“It joins the Government’s support for the Paris Agreement, which we have ratified this week, measures to increase electric vehicle uptake, and the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme – the world’s first major ETS to affect airlines.”
