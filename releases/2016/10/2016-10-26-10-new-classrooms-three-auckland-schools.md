Around $5 million is being invested to provide three Auckland schools with a total of 10 new classrooms, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“Six of these new classrooms will add additional capacity to the Auckland school network, to help meet roll growth, and the others will replace existing classrooms,” says Ms Parata.

“Belmont Primary School will receive three extra classrooms, Rongomai School will get two extra and three replacement classrooms, and Flat Bush School will get one extra and one replacement classroom.”

Around $2.2 million of the investment is being allocated from Budget 2016, with around $2.7 million allocated from Budget 2015.

“Today’s announcement is on top of $153 million announced in June for new schools and classrooms across Auckland,” says Ms Parata.

“More than one third of the country’s population now lives in the Auckland region, and we’re committed to adding capacity to local schools to help accommodate roll growth.

“As a result of initiatives such as the Auckland roll growth programme, school redevelopments, new schools and other projects, more than 17,000 new places will be created in Auckland schools by 2019.”

More announcements about roll growth classrooms under Budget 2016 will be made over the coming weeks, with a third round of investments expected to be announced in February next year.

Belmont Primary School is a member of the Devonport Community of Learning. Communities of Learning encourage schools to work together to share expertise and lift student achievement.
