Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and its partners have released a new plan to tackle the invasive weed hornwort at Lake Karapiro, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

“Lake Karapiro is a beautiful reservoir and one of the country’s most impressive venues for water sport, including rowing and Waka Ama” says Ms Upston.

“There’s a need for more sustained, targeted control of hornwort given the growing list of events scheduled to take place, including the World Masters Games in 2017.

“This plan will address that need as well as reduce the ongoing cost of weed control.” 

The plan was developed on behalf of the Lake Karapiro Aquatic Weed Management Group – a partnership including LINZ, the Waipa District Council, the Waikato Regional Council, local Iwi and Mercury Energy.

“I’m pleased the management group is making this happen.  This partnership is an excellent example of a wide range of organisations working together for our environment.”

The lake has needed large control operations in the past. In 2009 and 2010, LINZ treated about 180 hectares of hornwort in preparation for the World Rowing Champs.
