Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed 29 new Corrections Officers and Offender Employment Instructors who graduated today.

The new staff will be based at Auckland Prison, Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Waikeria Prison, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Hawkes Bay Regional Prison, Whanganui Prison, Manawatu Prison, Arohata Prison, Rimutaka Prison, and Christchurch Men’s Prison.

Amy Rainford, who will work at Whanganui Prison, was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award.

“Amy has been a leader from day one and has demonstrated the attributes of becoming an exceptional Corrections Officer,” says Ms Collins. “Her aspiration now is to serve the community and be a role model to both her fellow officers and prisoners.”

“We are grateful that people like Amy have joined the Corrections team,” says Ms Collins. “Corrections needs dedicated and committed people to give offenders the support and encouragement they need to turn their lives around.”
