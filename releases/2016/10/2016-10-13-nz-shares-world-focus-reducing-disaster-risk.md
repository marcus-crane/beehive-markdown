Acting Civil Defence Minister Craig Foss says that along with other countries around the world today, New Zealand is marking the International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction.

“The United Nations International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction is observed each year in October to raise the profile of disaster risk reduction,” says Mr Foss.

“Countries choose their own theme to recognise the day, and here in New Zealand our focus this year is on ‘prepared kids’.

“Kids can be great ambassadors for preparedness. When kids are involved, families also tend to be better prepared and that can flow through to the community.

“Teaching kids about preparedness also means we’re building more resilient generations for tomorrow.”

In support of this year’s theme, the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, together with EQC, has launched a modernised version of its primary school programme for teaching emergency preparedness in the classroom.

Called *What’s the Plan Stan*, the modernised programme features a range of interactive teaching resources that have been updated for the current curriculum.

“This updated programme is a great tool to help us be a safer nation,” says Mr Foss.

“As adults, we can be a bit complacent when it comes to being prepared, so I encourage all mums, dads and whanau to sit down with your kids and talk about planning for an emergency.”
