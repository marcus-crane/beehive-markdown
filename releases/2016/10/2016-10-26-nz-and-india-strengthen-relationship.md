Prime Minister John Key today announced that New Zealand will strengthen its political, security and economic relationship with India, following a meeting with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.

“It is important we work together with likeminded countries to enhance regional prosperity and stability and working more closely with India, which is playing an increasingly important role in global and regional affairs, will build on our efforts to do this,” Mr Key says.

The Prime Ministers agreed on the need for New Zealand and India to strengthen the trade and economic architecture between the two countries.

“Our economic relationship has grown significantly in the past five years, with two-way trade increasing by a third, but we can and should do more,” Mr Key says.

“Streamlining trade rules through high-quality trade agreements will support that and create more opportunities for our businesses.

“So I am pleased that Prime Minister Modi and I agreed to work towards a high-quality and comprehensive bilateral free trade agreement, and pledged to continue to play constructive roles in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership talks.

“We also agreed to new cooperation in areas such as cyber security, counter-terrorism, customs, education and food safety as well as for our leaders and officials to meet more regularly, reflecting the broadening of our relationship.”

Mr Key also confirmed Mr Modi would make a reciprocal visit to New Zealand.

“I’m delighted that Prime Minister Modi has accepted my invitation and I am sure all New Zealanders, including our large Indian community, will look forward to welcoming him when he can make it to New Zealand.”

Mr Key is currently in India with a delegation of business and education leaders focused on boosting New Zealand’s ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
