An additional $5.9 million will be invested in the redevelopment of Auckland’s Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This extra investment will take the total value of the project to over $21 million,” says Ms Parata.

Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae shares a site with Southern Cross Campus in Mangere, a co-ed school for years 1-13 which is also currently undergoing redevelopment, valued at over $23 million.

“The latest investment in the kura will enable it to be relocated on a larger area within the shared site,” says Ms Parata.

“This will set the kura up well to accommodate future roll growth. We’re committed to modernising facilities and expanding capacity in Auckland, our fastest-growing city.”

The Southern Cross site also includes a trades academy, early childhood centres, a daycare and a special school satellite unit.

“Together with the school redevelopment, this is about creating an education hub which provides modern, inspiring facilities to support the success of local students.

“Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae is also part of the Tainui Kahui Kura Community of Learning, so it’s another example of how education is being strengthened through collaboration.”

Work is expected to begin on the kura project next month.
