Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is encouraging boaties to get on board this Safer Boating Week.

“The theme for the week is *Prep, Check, Know* — prep your boat, check your gear and know the rules before you get on the water,” Mr Foss says.

“Labour Weekend, the traditional start of the recreational boating season, is right around the corner so now is the perfect time to make sure you’re prepared.

“If you discover something’s wrong with your boat or gear when you’re already on the water, it may be too late to avoid trouble.”

Safer Boating Week includes a range of events and activities by Maritime NZ, councils and boating organisations, including lifejacket checks, safety training courses, boat ramp visits and on the water checks.

“The activities are a mix of fun and good practice so I urge all boaties to get amongst it,” Mr Foss says.
