Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced three appointments to the board of Education New Zealand (ENZ).

Charles Finny has been reappointed at Chair, while Karen Rolleston and Linda Sissons are newly appointed board members.

“Mr Finny has played a significant role in establishing ENZ in 2011, and guiding it through its early stages. The number of international students studying in New Zealand, from primary to tertiary, rose above 124,000 last year. Charles will lead ENZ as it continues to contribute to this growth and embarks on the next stage of its development as an organisation,” says Mr Joyce.

“Karen Rolleston will bring a fresh perspective to ENZ’s work. She is the New Zealand Chief Executive for 3P Learning Ltd. Her commercial, marketing and education skills will be particularly valuable as ENZ focuses on the next stage in its development. Linda Sissons is a highly experienced leader in the tertiary sector and has just been appointed the Chief Executive of the Primary Industry Training Organisation. Her in-depth knowledge of tertiary education will be of significant value to ENZ’s board.”

“Departing board members Dr Neil Barns and Frances Valintine have played an important role in ENZ’s successes to date, contributing highly valued advice and expertise. I want to thank them for their service.”

ENZ is the government agency that promotes New Zealand education to the world. International students participate at every level of our education system, from early childhood centres to universities. This allows young New Zealanders to live and learn alongside peers from other countries.
