Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced 18-year-old Mina Bixley as the winner of the 2016 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition.

Mina, from Tauhara College in Taupo, won a $2000 education grant for her animated short film *Passchendaele on a Personal Scale.*

“Mina’s moving entry illustrates the personal nature of remembrance. It also captures the very essence of the competition — ensuring New Zealand’s sacrifice on the Western Front is not forgotten,” Mr Foss says.

Second place went to Nina Richardson from Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington. 

“Nina wrote a sophisticated and poignant poem entitled *The Things They Did, The Things They Didn’t.*  I was extremely impressed by the sincerity and thoughtfulness of both Mina and Nina’s art,” Mr Foss says.

“As part of their prize, these talented young women will be attending the Battle of Passchendaele centenary commemorations in Belgium next year with New Zealand’s Youth Ambassador delegation.”

The Battle of Passchendaele was one of New Zealand’s most deadly conflicts during World War I. On just one day — 12 October 1917 — nearly 850 Kiwi men were killed and more than 2700 wounded. 

The awards were presented at the Auckland War Memorial Museum this morning following a ceremony marking the 99th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele.
