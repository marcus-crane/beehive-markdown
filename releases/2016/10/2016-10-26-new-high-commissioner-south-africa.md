Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of diplomat Michael Burrell as High Commissioner to South Africa.

"New Zealand is placing increasing priority on our relations with Africa," Mr McCully says. 

"Our relationship with South Africa is based on our shared Commonwealth history, respect for democracy, strong links between our people, and close sporting ties.

“We are also continuing to grow our trade and investment links, and a significant aspect of the High Commissioner’s role is to support New Zealand business develop export markets in South Africa.”

Mr Burrell is currently the Director Sustainable Economic Development at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and before that was CEO of Aquaculture New Zealand.

Mr Burrell will also be accredited to Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Lesotho, Angola, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania.
