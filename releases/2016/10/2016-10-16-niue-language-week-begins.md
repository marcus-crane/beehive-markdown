Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is urging Niueans in New Zealand to share their language with friends and work colleagues during Niue Language Week which starts today.

“A week of celebrating Vagahau Niue begins this afternoon with a church service in Mangere.  It runs through to Saturday when we celebrate Niue Constitution Day,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The theme for this year’s Niue Language Week is ‘Ponataki, Tukutaula mo e Mauokafua e Vagahau Niue’ which translates into ‘Bind, Anchor and Stand Firm for Vagahau Niue’.

““The language week is championed by Vagahau Niue Trust, and in particular the matua (elders) and fuata (young people) from the Niuean community. They recognise and understand the importance of safeguarding the Niuean language and culture for future generations.”

“It is important to promote the teaching and learning of Vagahau Niue at home, at work and in everyday situations,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

“This year the Ministry for Pacific Peoples, Te Papa Tongarewa and members from the Niuean communities have worked together to develop a free education resource that will help people learn the Niuean language and connect with Niuean culture.”

Nearly 24,000 Niueans live in New Zealand, around 77% in Auckland.
