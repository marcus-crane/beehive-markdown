New mapping of parts of the Marlborough Sounds, Tāmaki Strait, Auckland and Kawau Bay seabeds will ensure maritime safety and help to improve marine habitat management, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) in partnership with Marlborough District Council has engaged the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research to survey Queen Charlotte Sound (Tōtaranui) and the Tory Channel (Kura Te Au) in the Marlborough Sounds with state-of-the-art sonar technology.

“This survey will start this month. For LINZ, the results will be used to update charts and navigation information, supporting the needs of cruise, cargo and fishing vessels. The Council will use it for managing marine habitats which are crucial for biodiversity,” says Ms Upston.

LINZ has also contracted Discovery Marine Limited to survey the approaches to Auckland and Kawau Bay and is currently contracting a supplier to survey Tāmaki Strait. These surveys are also due to start in October and will support navigation in areas with some of the most vessel traffic in New Zealand.

“The seafloor can be just as varied as the land, with valleys, canyons and reefs. Modern survey technology gives us a 3D picture of these features, as well as detail on depths and the shape of our coastline

“Current navigation information for the areas being surveyed has done the job well. But by updating this using the latest sonar technology we can anticipate the future demands of the shipping industry, especially as vessels increase in size.”

The public will have a chance to climb aboard the NIWA vessel that will be used for the Marlborough survey at a maritime open day to be held at Picton marina this Saturday (22 October).
