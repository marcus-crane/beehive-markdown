Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell announced the appointments of Hinerangi Edwards (Taranaki, Ngāruahine, Ngāti Ruanui, Te Arawa) and Wayne Panapa (Waikato Maniapoto) to the Board of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori today.

Current Board member, Ms Charisma Rangipunga has also been appointed to the role of deputy chair.

Mr Flavell says the new board members are a valuable addition to the board and their appointments are for a three year term.

“Both Ms Edwards and Mr Panapa possess the requisite language skills and experience. They bring to their roles an understanding and knowledge of the Crown regulatory environment, policy frameworks, and financial planning and management.”

Ms Edwards has a Bachelor of Arts in Māori Studies and experience in governance, education, career development and communications.  She is currently a director and consultant with Aatea Solutions with a focus on relationship management and strategy.

Mr Panapa is a chartered accountant and an experienced manager. He is currently a Divisional Finance manager for WEL Networks Ltd and chairman of Ngā Kaitatau Māori o Aotearoa, the National Māori Accountants Network

Mr Flavell acknowledges and thanks outgoing members, Hinurewa Poutū and Professor Rawinia Higgins, for their contributions and guidance to the Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori Board.
