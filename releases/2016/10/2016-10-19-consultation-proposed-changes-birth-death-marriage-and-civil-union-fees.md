Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne has announced that public consultation on proposed changes to birth, death, marriage and civil union fees has opened.

“The proposed changes follow a review of fees for products and services provided by the Department of Internal Affairs which have remained unchanged since 2003.

“Over the last 13 years the costs to provide these services has increased – these changes better reflect the actual cost of providing them and will ensure users pay a fair price for whichever service they require”, says Mr Dunne.

It is proposed to increase existing birth, death, marriage and civil union fees and to introduce new fees for independent and approved organisation marriage celebrants in 2017.

Public consultation on the proposed changes opens today and further information is available at [www.govt.nz/bdm-fees-review](http://www.govt.nz/bdm-fees-review)
