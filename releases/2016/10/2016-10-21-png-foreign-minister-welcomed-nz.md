Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed Papua New Guinea’s Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato to New Zealand for formal foreign policy talks today.

“PNG is an important partner for New Zealand in the Pacific and our second largest trading partner in the region,” Mr McCully says.

“During Minister Pato’s visit we will discuss PNG’s plans for the hosting of APEC 2018 and how New Zealand can best support this undertaking. Our talks will also focus on regional trade and political issues.”
