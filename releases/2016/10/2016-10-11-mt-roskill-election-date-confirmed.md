The Mt Roskill by-election will be held on Saturday 3 December, Prime Minister John Key confirmed today.

“I have been advised that given that Mr Goff’s resignation will take effect on 12 October, it is now appropriate to set a date for the by-election,” says Mr Key.

“The by-election Writ Day will be 2 November. The deadline for candidate nominations to be received will be midday on 8 November, and the last day for the return of the Writ will be 22 December.”
