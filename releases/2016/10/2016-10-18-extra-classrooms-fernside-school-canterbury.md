Around $750,000 will be invested to build two new classrooms at Fernside School in Rangiora, Canterbury, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth,” says Ms Parata.

The first round of investments was announced in May and June this year. That saw twenty-one new roll growth classrooms announced for Canterbury schools.

“Today’s investment, on top of that announced earlier this year, recognises that schools in Canterbury are experiencing roll growth as the local population grows or shifts,” says Ms Parata.

“The Government is committed to expanding capacity at these schools.

“We want to support students to achieve to the very best of their potential, and having the right infrastructure and learning environments is an important part of this.

“More announcements as part the second round of investments in roll growth classrooms will be made over the coming weeks, and a third round of investments is expected to be announced in February next year.”

In May, $276 million was announced under Budget 2016 for school infrastructure in Canterbury.  As well as roll growth classrooms, this will fund the ongoing Christchurch schools rebuild programme, which is on-track to rebuild and renew 115 schools.

Fernside School is part of the Rangiora Puketeraki Community of Learning, which is the largest in Canterbury with 17 schools. Communities of Learning are about schools working together to help students achieve their full potential.
