Transport Minister Simon Bridges has declared the International Naval Review a Major Maritime Event.

The event will take place in Auckland between 10 and 22 November.

Vessels not participating in the Naval Review will be required to stay clear of restricted zones in the Waitemata Harbour, Rangitoto Channel and sections of the Inner Hauraki Gulf. A 12 knot speed restriction will be in place in the Auckland Harbour, and diving or swimming within the permit area will be prohibited.

“The International Naval Review marks the Royal New Zealand Navy’s 75th anniversary, and will see vessels from 12 countries visit Auckland to celebrate and train alongside New Zealand sailors,” Mr Bridges says.

"Movement restrictions around the Review area and the participating vessels are intended to ensure the safety of everyone on the water, including people who are not part of the event,” Mr Bridges says.

“Many harbour users will be familiar from previous experience with the way that Auckland Council and event organisers manage the day-to-day conduct of these occasions. For example the relevant legislation was originally put in place prior to the America's Cup.”

Detailed information about transport arrangements, including maps of restricted zones, will be available from Auckland Council and event organisers.
