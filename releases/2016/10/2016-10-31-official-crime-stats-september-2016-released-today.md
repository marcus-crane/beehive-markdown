Official crime statistics for September 2016 released today, show Police recorded 1,390 more victimisations for the month compared to the same month last year says Police Minister Judith Collins.

For the twelve month period, 30 September 2015 to 30 September 2016, the total number of victimisations increased from 261,748 to 276,098.

There were 6,361 burglary victimisations in September.  In this crime category, there were 72,776 victimisations in the 12 months to September 2016 – a rise of 10,979 (17.8%) from the previous 12 months.

However, month to month (September 2016 compared to August 2016) burglary victimisations have fallen by 290.

 Burglaries, particularly dwelling burglaries, is a concern and a priority for Police. This is why an extra focus was put on attending house break-ins from the end of August,” Ms Collins said.

“While a review of the new Police policy that staff are expected to attend all dwelling burglaries will be conducted in December, provisional data show more than 90 percent of scenes were visited by Police in September.

“Across all crime types, Police have increased the number of proceedings against offenders - rising by 3,076 to 175,772 over the year.

“Police are working hard in our communities and remain committed to holding offenders to account.”
