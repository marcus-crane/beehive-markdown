Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced the appointment of Len Cook as a new member of the Remuneration Authority (the Authority).

The Authority is responsible for setting the rates of pay and allowances for Members of Parliament, the Judiciary and local authority members.

Len Cook replaces Angela Foulkes who has performed her duties admirably as a member of the Authority for eleven years.

“Len comes highly qualified for the role as an internationally respected professional statistician, with over 40 years of statistical, research and public policy knowledge,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Len has also served on a range of public and academic boards and his broad experience will be invaluable to the Authority’s work.

“The Authority is a small but important team and we are fortunate to have such a high calibre individual joining the team. I wish Len well in his new role.”
