Cabinet has today agreed to deploy an additional 35 New Zealand Defence Force personnel to an international peacekeeping mission in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“Our personnel will provide engineering support to build a security fence around the Multinational Force and Observers’ South Camp in the Sinai, near Sharm El-Sheikh,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The short-term contribution will bolster the security of the mission, which observes and reports on the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel.

“The work will last around 6 months and personnel will deploy in early 2017.

“The deployment is in response to a request from the Multinational Force and Observers to assist with infrastructure improvements at South Camp, where the mission’s headquarters is based.

“The security fence will further enhance physical protection at the camp, including for NZDF personnel. The estimated cost of the engineer deployment is NZ$1.538 million.

“The Government recently agreed to extend the mandate for NZDF personnel deployed to the Multinational Force and Observers,” Mr Brownlee says.

That deployment of up to 28 personnel has been extended until July 2018. This forms part of New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to peace and security in the Middle East.
