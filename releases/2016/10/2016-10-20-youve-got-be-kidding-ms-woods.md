Labour MP Megan Woods is behind the eight-ball with her Bill which would send Cantabrians to the polls for a second time in less than a year, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Megan Woods’ Bill seeks to dissolve Environment Canterbury and hold another local election within three months, should it pass. It comes less than two weeks’ after Cantabrians elected seven members and two days since the Government appointed six councillors, including two from Ngai Tahu. This uncertainty and another election are the last thing Canterbury needs now,” Dr Smith says.

The other four Government-appointed councillors have been on the council for the past six years, and their presence will ensure the huge progress the council has made in that time continues, including:

- Moving to more than 80 per cent of water takes being metered, up from less than 20 per cent six years ago
- Five of 10 zones now having operative water plans
- More than 2000 Farm Environment Plans now, compared with none pre-2010.

“We have deliberately chosen to re-appoint all of the commissioners who indicated they were available to continue. This is to maintain continuity and the specialist skills the council needs to complete water plans for the region. It also reflects the Government’s high level of confidence in the commissioners’ work during the past six years.

“The current council will consult during this term on the make-up of the wards and number of councillors ahead of elections for the full council in 2019. The Government has deliberately taken this course to ensure momentum and continuity are maintained.

“Megan Woods Bill would not only halt that momentum - it also seeks to amend an Act which is no longer in force. It’s out of step, a bit late and nothing more than a political stunt.”
