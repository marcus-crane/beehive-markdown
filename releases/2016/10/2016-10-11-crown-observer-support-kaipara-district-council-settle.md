Associate Local Government Minister Louise Upston today announced the appointment of Barry Harris as a Crown Observer to support the newly-elected Kaipara District Council settle into its new governance arrangement.

“Mr Harris is very experienced in local government and will be helping to support the Kaipara District Council as it settles in,” Ms Upston says.

“He has a strong background in governance and local government, having held directorships in the public and private sectors and chief executive positions at several councils.”

Barry Harris begins his Crown Observer role when elected Council members come into office. The term of the appointment will end on 30 September 2017. As a Crown Observer, Mr Harris will provide advice and guidance to the Council and does not have a decision-making role.

Ms Upston encourages locals to work with the newly-elected Council.

“I encourage locals to get behind their locally elected representatives. There are challenges ahead and it is important locals work with the Council to build a positive future together.”

“I would also like to thank the Kaipara Commissioners for their work and service to the Kaipara community.”
