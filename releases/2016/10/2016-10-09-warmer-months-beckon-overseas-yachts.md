The warmer weather signals the arrival of overseas yachts for the summer and Customs is geared up to welcome them says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The traditional small craft arrival season starts in mid-October and continues through to mid-December. Customs expects 420-440 arrivals during this time,” Ms Wagner says.

“This includes returning locally-registered yachts and a flotilla of foreign craft, from solo sailors to super yachts. Opua is the most popular destination accounting for 70% of the arrivals, with the rest opting for other destinations.

“These yachts bring great economic benefit to our country in exchange for our well known sights, hospitality, and marine services. Customs is doing its bit to help make their visit an enjoyable one..

“Customs streamlined its processes and doubled the temporary entry period for yachts to 24 months a couple of years ago, meaning they can stay for longer without paying duty or taxes.

“Duty and charges for yachts that come here for reasons other than recreation were also revised, making it more attractive for owners who want to charter their yacht or get maintenance work done.

“Customs and Ministry for Primary Industries will again join forces to facilitate the arrivals, while managing risks to protect our border.

“Part of this includes coordinating and deploying Customs’ and other agencies’ vessels for maritime patrols in the northern region and other ports.”

“Customs’ recent decision to invest in a world-class patrol vessel will further boost capabilities to carry out border protection beyond our territorial waters,” Ms Wagner says.
