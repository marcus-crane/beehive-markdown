Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed the release of the Chief Inspector of Corrections inquiry into ‘fight clubs’ and contraband in the Mount Eden Corrections Facility (MECF).

“The inquiry was very thorough and made a number of findings which were critical of Serco’s operation of MECF. The inquiry also found that the Department did not meet its monitoring obligations.

“The Chief Inspector made 21 recommendations for improvement and all of these recommendations are either completed or in progress.

“Serco, for its part, has apologised for some of its practices falling below the required standard and has paid Corrections $8 million to cover the cost of the “Step In” and performance notices.”

Serco has now reduced its contract to a labour supply agreement only as the prison transitions back to Corrections.

In response to the recommendations Corrections has strengthened its monitoring of external contracts by providing for extra monitors as well as new special monitors made up of former prison directors to provide additional levels of assurance to the Chief Executive.

The monitors will have new reporting lines, improved training and new reporting procedures.

A Major Outsourced Contracts Advisory Board, chaired by Geoff Dangerfield, has been established and a new Deputy Chief Executive, Commercial Services has been appointed.

“I have also asked the State Services Commission for advice on how the Corrections Inspectorate’s role can be further strengthened and made more transparent.

“I am confident that lessons have been learnt by all parties in relation to the events at MECF,” Ms Collins says.
