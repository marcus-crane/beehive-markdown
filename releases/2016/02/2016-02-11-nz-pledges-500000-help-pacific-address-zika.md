Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will provide $500,000 to help the Pacific region to counter the spread of the Zika.

“With the Zika virus now confirmed in a number of Pacific countries, New Zealand is committed to helping limit the impact and spread of the virus in the region,” says Mr McCully.

“New Zealand will provide $250,000 as a contribution to the WHO to implement the Pacific Zika Action Plan, and a further $250,000 to enable countries in the region to respond rapidly if required.

“Our package of support is targeted at prevention and detection measures and builds on our existing support for improving health outcomes in the region.

“We will continue to monitor the global and the regional situation closely and keep the need for further assistance under review,” Mr McCully says.
