Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has officially launched the new premium seafood category ‘*Tiaki*’ today, the latest phase in a $48 million joint programme between the Government and the seafood industry.

*Tiaki* is the result of the Primary Growth Partnership programme Precision Seafood Harvesting, which is developing a revolutionary new net that replaces traditional trawl methods.

“Industry and government are co-investing $24 million each into this programme which will have real benefits for New Zealand’s reputation as a producer of premium, high quality, sustainable products,” says Mr Guy.

“When fishing inshore species like snapper, *Tiaki* caught fish are bought on board alive and in pristine condition. Undersized or unintended catch can be returned to the sea with a much higher survivability rate.

“Customers around the world will know when they see the *Tiaki* label that the fish has been caught and carefully selected in a revolutionary way. They will also be able to use their smartphone to connect with where and how their fish was caught via a specially designed traceability app.”

The programme is expected to deliver around $44 million in economic benefits per year by 2025.

“This is an important step towards our goal of doubling the value of New Zealand’s primary sector exports by 2025.

“It’s not just the economic benefits either. Fishing the *Tiaki* way will help protect and ensure the sustainability of New Zealand’s valuable fish stocks.

“This is a good example of what can be achieved by industry and government working together. This programme would not have been achievable without the collaboration of the four co-investors, Sealord, Sanford, Aotearoa Fisheries Limited and the Ministry for Primary Industries.”

The Precision Seafood Harvesting programme started four years ago and has already won numerous accolades, including Supreme Innovator award at the New Zealand Innovators Awards in 2014.

Industry partners include Aotearoa Fisheries, Sanford and the Sealord Group. More information on *Tiaki* is available at:
