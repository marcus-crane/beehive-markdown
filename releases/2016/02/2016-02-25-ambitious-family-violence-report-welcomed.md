Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne is welcoming the release of the Family Violence Death Review Committee’s (FVDRC) Fifth Report, which calls for agencies to work together better on preventing family violence. Mr Dunne is the Minister responsible for the Health Quality & Safety Commission. The FVDRC is an independent committee that reviews and advises the Commission on how to reduce the number of family violence deaths.

The FVDRC report identifies how the family violence workforce can be strengthened and work together better. It also calls upon agencies to take more responsibility for the safety of family violence victims, rather than expecting victims to keep themselves safe from abusive partners.

“I commend the Committee for taking a long-sighted approach to the family violence problem in New Zealand. This report highlights many ways agencies can work together to address the country’s unacceptably high rate of violence. It supports the work being carried out by the Ministerial Group on Family Violence and Sexual Violence, led by Ministers Adams and Tolley, and involving the input of many Government agencies”, says Mr Dunne.

Since 2002, the Ministry of Health’s Violence Intervention Programme has trained health practitioners to identify intimate partner violence and child abuse

“Health services – such as GPs and emergency care – are an area many victims and people perpetrating family violence use routinely. The FVDRC report also suggests ways the sector can build on the Violence Intervention Programme and ensure those who seek our assistance get a lasting response”, Mr Dunne said
