Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says reports released today provide a useful snapshot of Auckland’s sport and recreation sector.

“Auckland is the largest and fasting growing part of the country. The diversity and population density of the Auckland region presents both challenges and opportunities,” says Dr Coleman.

Research released today shows 78 per cent of Aucklanders participate in sport and recreation in any given week, compared to 74 per cent nationally.

“While this figure is encouraging, Aucklanders are not immune to the global drift towards an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s estimated around 730,000 Aucklanders fall within Sport NZ’s Community Sport Strategy’s targeted participant groups which includes young people aged between 4 to 24 years as well as Pasifika and Asian communities.

“To help address this the Government, through Sport NZ, has put a strategic focus on Auckland’s sport and recreation system. This includes an additional $31.5 million over five years to help encourage these low participation groups to get active.

“New research also found that the sector contributes just over $1.7 billion, or 2.2 per cent, of the region’s GDP. This is through major sporting events and the day to day running of sport and recreation businesses.

“Together these reports show us the importance of local and central Government working together more closely with local and regional sporting organisations.”
