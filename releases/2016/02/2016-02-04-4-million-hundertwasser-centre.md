Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced that the Government will contribute $4 million to the construction of the Hundertwasser Art Centre and Wairau Māori Art Gallery in Whangarei.

The decision was announced as part of the launch of the Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan, which identifies 58 actions that will support and enable the growth of the Northland economy, Mr Joyce says.

“The Hundertwasser Centre will add another quality visitor attraction to the growing Northland tourism industry. Tourism in Northland grew 6% in the year to March 2015 and has continued to increase since then. It is one of the key industries in the economic growth plan for the North.”

Around 70 people will work on the Centre’s construction and 30 people will be needed to operate it. The Centre is estimated to bring an additional $3.7 million into the Northland economy each year.

“The Government is committed to helping Northland achieve economic prosperity and grow jobs, investment and visitor numbers,” Mr Joyce says. 

“Local MP Shane Reti passionately advocated for this project as a way to enhance the region’s tourism and cultural offerings, and Cabinet agreed with him.”

The original design for the centre was drawn in 1993 by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who resided in Northland. It will be dedicated to contemporary Maori art, with a section displaying Hundertwasser’s own work.

The Government’s contribution is contingent on the Whangarei Museum Trust obtaining the $8.2 million of additional funding required to build the Centre.

The Hundertwasser Art Centre and Wairau Māori Art Gallery is identified in the Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan as a key potential tourism project. The plan is part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme, which is working to increase investment, job opportunities and incomes in key regions around New Zealand.
