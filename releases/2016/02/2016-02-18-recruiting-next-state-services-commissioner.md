State Services Minister Paula Bennett has today announced that the process for appointing the next State Services Commissioner will soon begin, with applications expected to open in March.

Current State Services Commissioner Iain Rennie’s term ends on 30 June 2016.

“Mr Rennie has advised me that he is not seeking a further term as Commissioner, but will be staying in the role until the end of his current term,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The State Services Commissioner is a vital role, leading and overseeing the performance and integrity of the State Services, employing most Public Service Chief Executives, as well as driving the ongoing improvements of the State sector and how it operates.

“Mr Rennie has made a significant contribution to New Zealand’s State services over his 30-year career and will leave our system of public administration in a strong position to deliver essential services to New Zealanders into the future.”

Commissioner Rennie was appointed by the previous Government in 2008, and reappointed for a second term by this Government in 2013.

The State Services Commissioner is a statutory appointment, made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister under the State Sector Act 1988.

The Minister of State Services will be overseeing the recruitment process.
