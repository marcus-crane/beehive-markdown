Police Minister Judith Collins says the New Police Family Violence Information Disclosure Scheme (FVIDS) has been used 14 times since it was launched in December 2015.

“The Family Violence Information Disclosure Scheme allows Police to disclose a partner or potential partner’s history of violence. A request for the disclosure may be made to the Police by the partner of the potentially violent person, or a concerned third party,” says Ms Collins.

Police can also proactively release family violence information if they believe someone is at risk from their partner. If Police believe someone is in immediate danger they can take urgent action to protect them.

“The Family Violence Information Disclosure Scheme is based on a similar scheme in the United Kingdom known as Clare’s Law named after Clare Wood who was murdered in 2009 by a former partner. She had no knowledge of his violent past.

“Police have advised me that the disclosure scheme has already provided people with the information they need to leave potentially dangerous situations,” Ms Collins says.

Responding to family violence accounts for 41% of a frontline Police Officer’s time. On average, Police respond to a family violence incident every five minutes.

“People have the right to know about a partner or potential partner’s violent past,” Ms Collins says.
