The Government’s focus on rolling out better broadband and mobile connectivity is reaping rewards with New Zealand’s position continuing to rise compared to the developed world, Communication Minister Amy Adams says.

The OECD’s latest Broadband Subscriptions report to end of June 2015 places New Zealand second in the world for machine to machine connectivity, fourth for mobile broadband (up from ninth), and fourteenth for fixed broadband (up from fifteenth place) moving us ahead of the US for the first time.

“These recent OECD statistics reflect the ongoing positive developments we’re making in New Zealand’s connectivity and is yet more evidence that we’re making excellent progress,” Ms Adams says.

“Over the past year, our success in fixed broadband subscriptions has increased again, and we’re now 13 per cent above the OECD average. New Zealand has the fourteenth highest number of subscriptions in the OECD, placing us higher than the United States, Australia and Japan.

“New Zealand’s high rankings for mobile broadband subscriptions is fuelled in part by the Government’s opening up of 700 MHz spectrum for 4G use and our ongoing investment in the Rural Broadband Initiative.

“Our improvements against some of our key trading partners over the previous year demonstrates the priority this Government gives to faster and reliable connectivity for all New Zealanders – at work and at home,” Ms Adams says.
