Red Hill Primary School in Papakura, Auckland, will have virtually all its buildings replaced as part of a $10 million redevelopment, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The school has experienced problems with leaky buildings, and most of the existing buildings have reached the end of their economic life, says Ms Kaye.

“This redevelopment will see 10 new learning spaces built, along with a new administration block, library and resource room. Play areas and the carpark will also be upgraded.

“The new learning spaces will support the creation of an innovative learning environment at the school.

“This means the new spaces will be flexible, to support different ways of teaching and learning, and they will have high standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation. They will also feature the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“As part of the redevelopment, a satellite unit of Rosehill School, which caters for special education students, will also be established on-site. This will include two special education teaching spaces and break-out and support areas.

“I know that the history of whanau and whakapapa is a real source of pride at Red Hill Primary School, and the staff there have made a strong commitment to raising student achievement.

“It’s great that the school will be able to enjoy new facilities, which support every student to achieve to the very best of their potential.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand can learn in environments that inspire and support them to succeed.

“We continue to address the needs of schools with complex infrastructure issues, and today’s announcement follows other major redevelopments announced since October 2015, including Western Springs College, Takapuna Grammar School and Balmoral School in Auckland, Aotea College and Wellington East Girls’ College in the Wellington area, and Marlborough Girls’ and Boys’ Colleges. Together, these redevelopments represent an investment of around $265 million.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation nationwide. This is a more than 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”

The redevelopment of Red Hill School will be phased to minimise disruption, with construction of new buildings planned to begin in the second quarter of 2017.

Seven transportable classrooms will be located on-site for use during construction, with the project due to be completed in 2018.

**Notes:**

**About Red Hill Primary School**

Red Hill Primary School is a full primary school (years 1 – 8). The redevelopment will allow for a roll of around 230 students, plus 18 students with special education needs.

**About innovative learning environments**

An innovative learning environment (ILE) is the complete physical, social and teaching context in which learning takes place.

An ILE is capable of evolving and adapting as educational practices evolve.

Today, teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in different sized groups or individually, which requires learning spaces to be more flexible.

Flexible learning spaces are more open than traditional, single-cell classrooms and can be configured to support different ways of teaching and learning, eg they may be made up of many different-sized spaces, or be open enough to accommodate more than one class and several teachers.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation are also of a higher quality, to help students concentrate on learning.
