The New Zealand Government today received two international awards for the mobile apps ‘Force Fit’ and ‘Occupation Outlook.’

Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce congratulated staff at the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment who developed the apps, which received Best m-Government Service Awards at the annual World Government Summit in Dubai.

Force Fit won the International Health Category, while Occupation Outlook took out the International Trade and Economy category. Essential New Zealand Travel - 100% Pure New Zealand, was also a finalist in the International Tourism category.

“The Force Fit app guides people on how to prepare to join New Zealand’s Navy, Army or Air Force. By the time people have used the programme they’re prepared to meet the basic fitness requirements for joining,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It’s great to see this app, which is available to all New Zealanders as a fitness tool, rewarded on the world stage for efforts to ensure the public can access information and services digitally.”

Occupation Outlook was launched three years ago, and the 2016 version was released earlier this week.

“The Occupation Outlook app is an excellent tool for school students, tertiary students and job seekers to help them make good study and career decisions,” Mr Joyce says.

“It brings together the latest education, employment and income information about key jobs in a simple and easy-to-use format.”

The annual award aims to encourage government entities to provide creative and innovative solutions to the needs of the public via smart phone applications, mobile phones and smart wearable technologies.

The Chief of Army, Major General Peter Kelly, and the Honourable Sir Jim McLay, who is representing New Zealand at the Summit as the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy, accepted the awards on behalf of the Government.

The Force Fit app and 2016 Occupation Outlook app can be downloaded free from the App Store for iPhones and iPads, and the Google Play store for Android devices.
