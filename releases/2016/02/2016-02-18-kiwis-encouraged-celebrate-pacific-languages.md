Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is urging all Kiwis to learn a few words of another Pacific language this year to keep the use of these languages alive in New Zealand.

“While almost all New Zealanders will understand simple sayings such as ‘talofa lava’ (hello in Samoan), I would really like to see Kiwis connect with our Pacific cultures during one of our Pacific language weeks,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“We are a Pacific country and our Pacific neighbours have had a huge influence on our history and culture. New Zealand is home to many Pacific people but the use of their languages here is in decline.”

There are seven Pacific language weeks this year, each celebrating the language and culture of a Pacific Island nation.

“Our sense of self is inextricably linked to our heritage, culture and language. It is important that our young Pacific people retain their links to their heritage. It is wonderful that New Zealand recognises and embraces its place in the Pacific.

Google has this week launched Google Translate for Samoan, which Mr Lotu-Iiga described as a positive sign for Pacific languages.

“People are using Samoan enough on the internet that translation is required. I would love to see that extended to our other Pacific languages. If everyone spoke or wrote a few simple phrases in their everyday language, then Pacific languages will remain alive in New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The 2016 Pacific language weeks line-up begins with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week in October.

Dates for 2016 Pacific language weeks:

- Samoa Language Week: 29 May – 4 June
- Cook Islands Language Week: 31 July – 6 August
- Tonga Language Week: 4 September – 10 September
- Tuvalu Language Week: 25 September – 1 October
- Fiji Language Week: 3 October – 9 October
- Niue Language Week: 16 October – 22 October
- Tokelau Language Week: 23 October – 29 October
