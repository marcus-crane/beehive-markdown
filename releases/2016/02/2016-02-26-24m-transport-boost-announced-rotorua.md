Transport Minister Simon Bridges today announced the Government will inject $24 million into Rotorua’s transport network.

The roading package will focus on the city’s eastern and central corridors and will include:

- An upgrade to State Highway 30 / Te Ngae Road
- A new roundabout at the Te Ngae and Tarawera Road intersection
- Four-laning a section of Te Ngae Road, and
- Improved walking and cycling connections.

“The Government has been working closely with Rotorua Lakes Council to look at the best way to future-proof the city’s transport network, resolve congestion issues and address challenges surrounding local road access,” Mr Bridges says.

“Rotorua’s eastern corridor has long been identified as the location for the majority of future residential and employment development in the city. It is a key transport route and serves both an inter-regional and local function.”

Mr Bridges says investigations carried out by the NZ Transport Agency under the Government’s Accelerated Regional Roading Programme recommended that the previously identified option of the Rotorua Eastern Arterial (REA) not be built, and is unlikely to be built even in the long term.

“For some time the REA was seen as the long-term solution but investigations have recommended upgrading State Highway 30 / Te Ngae Road to support growth and improve Rotorua’s congestion issues,” Mr Bridges says.

“Nevertheless, the Government has asked the NZ Transport Agency to take a further look into options for Rotorua’s long term transport network and report back before any final decision is made on whether to lift the designation for the REA. We will be engaging with stakeholders and are keen to hear what the community thinks.

“Rotorua is a key connection point for road transport in the central and upper North Island, connecting industries such as tourism and forestry with the Port of Tauranga.

“This investment into Rotorua’s transport network is designed to support economic growth and development, help ease congestion and improve road safety.”

Preparation for the upgrades will get underway this year and work will be carried out over the next two to three years.

“This work will complement the more than $17 million worth of transport projects already announced in Rotorua including the $8.1 million SH5 Hemo Road roundabout, $5.5 in cycling and $3.5 million in safety improvements.

“The Government is committed to future-proofing Rotorua’s transport network and today’s announcement brings our total roading investment in the area to $41 million,” Mr Bridges says.

The works will be co-funded by the Government through the NZ Transport Agency and Rotorua Lakes Council, and will include funding from the Urban Cycleways Fund with potential for further investment based on growth.
