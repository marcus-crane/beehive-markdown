Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today officially opened the Auckland ICT Graduate School at Auckland University.

“The Auckland ICT Graduate School is a collaboration between The University of Auckland and University of Waikato, which will develop post-graduate students who  will have the technical, communication, critical thinking, business, and enterprise skills that employers’ value,” says Mr Joyce.

“The School has already successfully developed close links with industry, drawing on expertise and experience from across a number of ICT specialties and business sectors.”

“This gives a real world view and provides students the opportunity to build connections with the ICT industry while studying, which will support them to make the important transition from education to employment.”

The Auckland based school is one of three ICT Graduate Schools, alongside the South Island School based in Christchurch and the third based in Wellington, established to help deliver the skilled ICT graduates required.

The Government’s 2015 ICT Sector Report shows an IT sector that has been growing at speed, and a technology sector that is increasingly diverse and sophisticated. The number of domestic ICT graduates at the bachelors level or higher has risen by over 400 since 2010. 

“It is centrally important that New Zealand businesses can access the skills and knowledge they need to make the most of new global opportunities. They need the high-tech professionals and entrepreneurs these ICT Graduate Schools will produce,” says Mr Joyce.

The Government committed $28.6 million over four years for the development and delivery of the three ICT Graduate Schools. Once fully established, the three schools are expected to train more than 350 students annually in one year graduate and post-graduate courses.

“The Government’s Business Growth Agenda recognises that information technology is a key driver for economic growth. This is one of many initiatives targeted towards the future growth of the ICT sector,” says Mr Joyce.

The successful ICT Graduate Schools have been selected following a competitive procurement process run by the Tertiary Education Commission and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
