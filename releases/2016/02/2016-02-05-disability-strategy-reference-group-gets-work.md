Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today announced appointments to the New Zealand Disability Strategy revision reference group, who will begin work on revising this important national vision next week.

“The Disability Strategy provides a ‘big-picture’ vision for how we ensure more disabled people are supported to participate in New Zealand society,” Ms Wagner says.

“The reference group has been established with the diversity of New Zealand’s disability sector in mind. The reference group will help ensure the new Strategy is developed, owned and championed by all New Zealanders.”

The reference group of 14 includes members covering the perspectives of disabled Maori, Pasifika, youth, seniors, families, service providers and experts on disability issues. The group also represents Disabled Peoples Organisations and government agencies.

“The Strategy was initially agreed in 2001 and the time is right to ensure it remains fit for purpose. I am looking forward to working with disabled people, their families, the disability sector and others to develop this new vision for New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.

People will have an opportunity to have their say on the Disability Strategy through public consultation taking place during 2016.
