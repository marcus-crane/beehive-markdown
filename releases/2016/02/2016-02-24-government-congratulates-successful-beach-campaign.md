Conservation Minister Maggie Barry and Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner have congratulated the successful Givealittle campaign to buy Awaroa beach.

“Duane Major, Adam Gard’ner and the almost 40,000 Kiwis who donated close to $2 million to buy Awaroa beach deserve the thanks of the nation for their generosity, energy and spirit,” Ms Barry says.

“It’s been inspiring to see how the campaign reflected New Zealanders’ deep connection to our land and our desire to see it protected.

“As the Prime Minister said during the appeal, the Government was ready to step in with a modest contribution if needed.

“We’re very pleased that a commitment of $350,000 enabled the appeal to get over the line last night and buy the property for New Zealand.”

Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner says the funding will be allocated from the Nature Heritage Fund, a fund which enables acquisition of land for the conservation estate.

“Through the Fund the Government has worked with a wide range of private landowners and communities since 1990 to protect more than 340,000 hectares of land. This equates to over 1.3 per cent of New Zealand’s land area being protected either through purchase or covenants.

“I’m pleased that so many Kiwis have pulled together to ensure that this iconic piece of land will be held in trust and close to our hearts forever.”

“The process from here is for the campaigners to set up a trust or holding company to hold the land until it can be gazetted as part of Abel Tasman National Park and enter Crown ownership,” Ms Barry says.

“I’ve asked officials to do the necessary consultation and paperwork as quickly as possible. Once it becomes part of the National Park, access to the beach will be secured for the public in perpetuity.”
