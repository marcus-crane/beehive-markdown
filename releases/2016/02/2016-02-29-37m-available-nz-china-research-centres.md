Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced a call for proposals for three multi-institution New Zealand-China Research Collaboration Centres to be supported as part of the new Catalyst Fund international research programme.

The Catalyst Fund, worth $9.3 million annually and administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, supports initiatives  to strengthen international research collaboration and link New Zealand with world-class research projects, groups and infrastructure. A total of up to $3,750,000 in funding is available for the three Centres over five years

“This initiative will strengthen research collaboration with China in three priority areas – water research, food safety and security, and non-communicable diseases,” Mr Joyce says.

“International science and innovation connectivity supports the vision of the National Statement of Science Investment, allowing us to continually build on the excellence of our scientific outputs and their potential for impact.”

China is a priority collaboration partner for New Zealand and these Centres will deliver on a key action identified at the New Zealand–China Joint Commission Meeting on science and technology in April last year. The Centres will coordinate New Zealand’s engagement with China in these mutually important areas of research. They will build on the existing bilateral programmes leading to more enduring and more impactful collaborations.

This call complements the Catalyst “Seeding” and “Leaders” programmes which are administered by the [Royal Society of New Zealand](http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/international/catalyst-fund/catalyst-leaders/).
