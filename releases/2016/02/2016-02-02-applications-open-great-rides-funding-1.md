Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has announced further funding to maintain and improve the premier rides of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

Applications are now open for the fourth round of funding through the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, a Government initiative to maintain and enhance the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“This funding is part of the Government’s $8 million investment over four years to ensure the Great Rides are maintained to their current world-class standards,” Mr Key says.

“Nearly $2 million has already been approved for 30 projects, which include a range of improvements such as surface enhancements, safety barriers, an underpass installation, track re-routing and storm damage repairs.”

The Government is investing a total of around $50 million in the New Zealand Cycle Trail, which is helping to showcase New Zealand’s diverse landscapes to thousands each year.

“The number of people getting in the saddle to use the trails is continuing to soar with more than 125,000 people using the New Zealand Cycle Trail in January 2015, compared to 97,000 in January 2014,” Mr Key says.

“All indications are that these numbers will be even higher this year, which shows the trails have become a significant tourism asset. It is vital that each trail is maintained to the highest possible standard so that riders continue to have a safe and enjoyable experience.”

Funding for the fourth round will close on 29 February 2016.
