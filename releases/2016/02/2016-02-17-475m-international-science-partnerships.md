Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today announced $4.75 million will be invested through the Government’s new Catalyst Fund in 18 global strategic partnerships to support high-quality research in areas that will deliver a range of benefits to New Zealand.

The Catalyst Fund aims to strengthen international research collaboration by linking New Zealand with world-class international research groups, infrastructure and initiatives.

“Through this investment, New Zealand researchers will be working with a range of top teams across the globe,” Mr Joyce says. “For instance, Kiwi researchers will be working with teams in Korea and Singapore to build the next generation of internet capability. This allows us to develop links with industry leaders and puts us at the forefront of telecommunications when the 5G network becomes readily available.

“Our experts in ageing, housing and health will collaborate with their UK counterparts to make a significant difference to future housing for ageing populations in both New Zealand and the UK.

“A partnership with researchers in the USA, Australia and Canada will see new research in marine biosecurity. It will look at developing more efficient surveillance tools and innovative technologies for the control and eradication of invasive species, as well as better evaluation of the impacts of biosecurity incursions – all of which are vital to protecting the integrity of our marine environment.”

Other funded collaborative projects include:

- mitigating volcanic hazards through advanced technologies (with Japan)
- climate change adaptation in alpine and sub-Antarctic island plants (with Germany, France, UK)
- epigenetic inheritance and phenotypic variation in large  families (with USA and Canada).

“Collaborating with the world’s best research teams allows us to increase the excellence and impact of our science, ensuring we remain at the forefront of new knowledge,” Mr Joyce says.

This Catalyst Fund investment in global strategic partnerships has been made through the Catalyst: Strategic funding stream, administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
