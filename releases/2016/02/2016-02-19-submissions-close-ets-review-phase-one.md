Submissions on the first phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) Review have now closed.  

The priority matters being considered in this phase relate to removing the transitional measure where emitters pay one unit for two tonnes of Carbon Dioxide.

“Following on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Government is focusing on ensuring our domestic settings are in the right place to help New Zealand meet our fair and ambitious 2030 target,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We welcome the submissions received on this first phase. The ETS is a key tool to tackle climate change domestically and it’s clear for it to work carbon has to cost more than it does right now.”

The second phase of the review is looking at other important matters including emissions unit supply, price stability and operational issues.

Submissions on the second phase close 30 April 2016 and can be made at: [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/consultation/new-zealand-ets-review-201516-consultation](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/consultation/new-zealand-ets-review-201516-consultation)
