Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith has challenged Port Hills MP Ruth Dyson and the Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little to reconsider their calls for the Redcliffs school site to reopen in the wake of Sunday’s significant rockfalls.

“The major rockfalls on Sunday were in areas of identical geology and risk profile to those surrounding Redcliffs School. The school site has had five major rockfalls since 2010, ranging from 100 tonnes to nearly 50,000 tonnes. I have been further advised today that the cliff face behind the school suffered additional damage on Sunday with new cracks in the upper third of the rock face and a number of individual boulders dislodged from the face,” Dr Smith says.

“Labour MPs Ruth Dyson and Andrew Little have been playing cynical politics by calling the Education Minister’s interim decision to close the school ‘bizarre’. The Minister’s approach has been based on the very best professional geotechnical advice about the risks.

“We were fortunate that there was nobody seriously injured or killed in Sunday’s quake-initiated rockfall. This is not an area of risk in which we should rely on amateurs or instant experts. Sunday’s rockfall should give cause for reflection and for Christchurch to re-commit to ensuring the rebuild is as safe as possible and based on the very best technical advice.”
