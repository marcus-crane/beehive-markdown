Foreign Minister Murray McCully will visit Fiji today to discuss the response to Tropical Cyclone Winston with the Fiji Government and look at how New Zealand can support recovery efforts.

“The damage to property, and loss of life caused by Cyclone Winston in parts of Fiji is almost unprecedented in the Pacific,” Mr McCully says. 

“Our total contribution to the relief effort now stands at $3.2 million and NZDF assets and personnel are helping to deliver supplies and repair damage to critical infrastructure.

“While in Fiji I will meet with New Zealand response staff and hold meetings with the Fiji Government to gain an understanding of what the longer–term needs in Fiji might be,” Mr McCully says.
