Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand has completed the domestic processes required to lift the United Nations sanctions against Iran.

“We are pleased to support the Iran nuclear deal and the changes to our domestic regulations, which come into force today, will make it easier New Zealanders to do business with Iran,” Mr McCully says

“The main impact is that companies trading with Iran will no longer need to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“Iran was formerly New Zealand’s 5th largest export market and we are well placed to take advantage of the sanctions being lifted. We have bolstered our Embassy in Tehran to help develop trade and high level exchanges between our two countries are planned later in the year.

“In addition to creating economic opportunities we hope that efforts to progress the nuclear deal will create a window for Iran to reset its relationship with the international community,” Mr McCully says.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 terminates all existing United Nations (UN) sanctions resolutions against Iran and replaces them with a limited range of measures, including restrictions regarding the transfer of sensitive goods.
