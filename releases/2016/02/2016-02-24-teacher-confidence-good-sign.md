New research showing the overwhelming majority of teachers believe in their ability to make a difference for kids has been welcomed by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“Several surveys have established a link between teachers’ self-belief and higher levels of student achievement and motivation so I am delighted that our teachers are confident in their ability,” says Ms Parata.

The research is from the Teaching and learning International Survey (TALIS) which asked teachers from 34 countries about their schools and their work. In New Zealand, more than 2,800 Year 7-10 teachers and principals took part.

The survey found that, on average, New Zealand teachers were more confident, or as confident, as their international counterparts in their ability to manage classrooms, teach, and engage student interest.

Key findings from the survey included:

- 96% of New Zealand teachers feel they can provide an alternative explanation for students, compared to 92 per cent across the countries surveyed, 94% in Australia, 88% in Singapore, and 77% in Finland
- 94% of New Zealand teachers feel they can make their expectations about student behaviour clear, compared to 91% across the countries surveyed, 93% in Australia, 89% in Singapore, and 93% in Finland.
- 86% of New Zealand teachers feel they can help students value their learning, compared to the TALIS average of 81%, 81% in Australia, 81% in Singapore, and 77% in Finland.
