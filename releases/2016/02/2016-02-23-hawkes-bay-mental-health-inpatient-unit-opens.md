Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened the new $22 million mental health inpatient unit, Ngā Rau Rākau, in Hawke’s Bay.

“It’s important people get the mental health support and services they need. The Government is committed to investing in world-class mental health facilities,” says Dr Coleman.

Ngā Rau Rākau means a collective of trees, and this new purpose-built facility at the Hawke’s Bay Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital in Hastings will better support both patients and staff.

The 23 bed unit is made up of 16 inpatient beds and seven sub-acute beds. The unit is light, modern and as home-like as possible, and includes a gym to help patients to get active.

Later in the year, an intensive day programme will also be run from the unit for both inpatients and those who are acutely unwell in the community.

“Mental health issues affect a large number of New Zealanders. Providing a quality and timely mental health service has been a priority for this Government,” says Dr Coleman.

“We’ve put a number of initiatives in place to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders, including Rising to the Challenge, the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project, and the Suicide Prevention Action Plan.

“This work is being funded by the $1.4 billion spent on mental health and addiction services for 2015/16. Investments like the new Ngā Rau Rākau unit are also being supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year.”

In 2015/16 Hawke’s DHB received an extra $8 million in funding, taking its total budget to just over $489 million. Since this Government came into office Hawke’s Bay DHB has received an extra $94 million.
