Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith is urging consumers and the industry to have their say on how financial advice laws could be improved.

“The Government is reviewing both the Financial Advisers Act and the Financial Service Providers Act to ensure we have the best regulatory regime in place,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“We are looking at ways to simplify the regime and make financial advice more accessible to all New Zealanders.

“Getting professional financial advice is beneficial at any stage in life - from saving for that first house, raising a family, or planning for retirement.

“We know that a number of barriers exist in the system that may be preventing people from seeking financial advice. Some of these barriers are due to the complexity of the regime, conflicted advice, and a lack of consumer awareness about where to go to get advice.

“The Options Paper, which is out for consultation until the end of next week, proposes solutions to some of these core issues. The paper presents three potential packages of options which range from relatively minor changes to wider system reform.

“To encourage feedback from consumers the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has also produced a questionnaire to find out what people need when they get financial advice.

“The deadline for submissions is 5pm, Friday 26 February I encourage all those with an interest in this issue, who haven’t already done so, to read the Options Paper and make a submission,” Mr Goldsmith says.
