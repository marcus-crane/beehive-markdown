Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced that the MBIE procurement team will return to market for the All-of-Government Air Travel contract, which has saved government agencies more than $37 million to date.

“This contract was initially signed in late 2011 and around 290 agencies and schools are now participating. The contract expires in December 2016 and a decision has been made by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to retender it, rather than exercise any renewal options,” Mr Joyce says.

“The decision to retender follows a robust review which showed recent changes in both the domestic and international markets are generating increased competition on key flight routes, while some other routes are no longer serviced.”

Mr Joyce says a number of smaller regional airlines have entered the regional market since 2011 and there is also increasing competition internationally, with a number of new airlines entering that market and other airlines expanding their route coverage and flight frequency, making it an opportune time to return to market.

“The Ministry anticipates there will be significant interest from the market when a Request for Proposals is released later in the year,” Mr Joyce says.

A new contract will be in place by mid-December 2016.
