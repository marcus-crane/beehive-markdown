Disability Issues and Customs Minister Nicky Wagner will tonight travel to Europe to address the 31st session of the Human Rights Council’s meeting on the rights of disabled people in Geneva, as well as meeting with Disability Issues and Customs counterparts in London and Brussels.

Ms Wagner will meet Justin Tomlinson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Disabled People, and disability employment experts in London, as well as the UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, Catalina Devandas-Aguilar, in Geneva.

“One of my key priorities as Disability Issues Minister is to promote the employment of disabled people. These meetings will provide an excellent opportunity to share ideas and find out more about what works in Europe,” Ms Wagner says.

In Geneva, Ms Wagner will deliver the New Zealand Statement on the rights of disabled people during the Human Rights Council meeting.

“Attending the Human Rights Council meeting will also be an opportunity to support the campaign for Robert Martin, New Zealand’s candidate for the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Robert Martin’s candidacy presents an opportunity to have the first person with a learning disability elected to the Committee.”

Ms Wagner will also visit Customs counterparts in London and Brussels.

“Meeting Minister of State, James Brokenshire, will be an excellent opportunity to learn more about border technology and security, before visiting Heathrow Airport to explore the UK’s experience of automated passenger processing – similar to our SmartGates.

“I will meet with Exchequer Secretary, Damian Hinds, to discuss the United Kingdom’s experience of the growth in internet sales and their plans to adapt to a changing digital economy and increasing volumes of trade.

“I’m also looking forward to visiting the World Customs Organization (WCO) in Brussels to learn about promoting ‘Digital Customs’ as well as the WCO’s engagement in the Pacific region,” Ms Wagner says.

Ms Wagner departs New Zealand 26 February and returns 7 March.
