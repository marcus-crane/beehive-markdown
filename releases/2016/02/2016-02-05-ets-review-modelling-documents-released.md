Three technical documents are being released to help New Zealanders engage with the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) review, Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett says.

The first report, modelling the economic impact of removing the transitional measure where emitters pay the cost of one unit for two tonnes of Carbon Dioxide, was produced by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.

The second report outlines different ways the forestry sector may respond to various carbon prices and was produced by the University of Canterbury’s School of Forestry.

The third report is an evaluation of the ETS’ performance against its short, medium and long-term outcomes to develop a greater understanding of its impacts. It was prepared by the Ministry for the Environment, with quality assurance provided by Martin Jenkins.

“Following on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Government is focusing on ensuring our domestic settings are in the right place to help New Zealand meet our 2030 target,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The ETS is one of our most effective tools to tackle climate change domestically and we are keen to hear a broad range of views about its effectiveness and impact.

“Climate change is an issue that effects all of us, so these reports will help New Zealanders make more thorough and thoughtful submissions.”

The three reports are available at:
