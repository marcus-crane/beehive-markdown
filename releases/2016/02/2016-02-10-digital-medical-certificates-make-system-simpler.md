Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley say 72 per cent of all medical certificates for Work and Income clients are now being lodged electronically.

“There’s been a great uptake in GPs using the new secure electronic system to lodge work capacity medical certificates,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s meant that 1,200 clients per day no longer have to hand-deliver certificates to Work and Income offices.

“This is a good example of agencies working together to make dealing with government easier and less time consuming.”

The Ministry of Social Development is currently focusing on how it can further improve its interactions with clients.

“As a result of the new electronic medical certificate system, Work and Income staff are able to devote more time to one-on-one support for beneficiaries and superannuitants,” says Mrs Tolley.

“With increased use of online options, there is less need for clients to visit offices to fill in forms. It also means that dealing with Work and Income becomes simpler for clients.” 

Work and Income handles over 400,000 certificates each year, completed by 3,500 doctors.

Introduced in July 2015, the secure electronic service allows GPs to lodge medical certificates which include client details on medical conditions, their ability to undertake work related activities, and how long they are expected to be unable to work.
