A series of conversations with leading international open data experts will kick off the 2016 open government data programme, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston today.

“Last year New Zealand cemented its place as an open data world leader – a key indicator of a country’s innovation, transparency and lack of corruption. We’ll build on this in 2016 and take the open data message wider,” Ms Upston says.

Joel Gurin – author of bestseller *Open Data Now* and President and Founder of the Center for Open Data Enterprise – pioneering open government expert Beth Noveck, and the Open Data Institute’s International Director Richard Stirling will all take part in a series of Google Hangouts over the next four weeks.

“That these internationally renowned experts want to talk with us about the work happening here, and share their knowledge and expertise, is testimony to our reputation as an open data leader.

“Open data improves the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, increases transparency, accountability and citizen participation, and facilitates better information-sharing within government.

“The Open Government Data and Information Programme at LINZ encourages government agencies to release their data. Its annual survey last year showed a 37 percent increase in the number of datasets being made openly available. This represents a vast increase in the amount of government data being released.

“New Zealand has a strong and internationally-recognised history of open and transparent government. I look forward to even more progress making quality, publicly-funded, high value data available to the public in 2016,” Ms Upston says.
