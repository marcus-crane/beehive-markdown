Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Maori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell today announced the opening of the 2016 investment round for Te Pūnaha Hihiko - Vision Mātauranga Capability Fund.

“The Vision Matauranga Capability Fund, is designed to grow the skills and capacity of Māori researchers and organisations in science and innovation and support outcomes that benefit Māori and New Zealand," Mr Joyce says.

Up to $2 million per annum is available for investment in new programmes over the next two years.  

The Fund invests in programmes that contribute to the development of skilled people and organisations undertaking research that supports the four themes of the Vision Mātauranga policy:

- Indigenous Innovation: Contributing to economic growth through distinctive research and development

<!--THE END-->

- Taiao / Environment: Achieving environmental sustainability through iwi and hapū relationships with land and sea

<!--THE END-->

- Hauora/Health: Improving health and social wellbeing

<!--THE END-->

- Mātauranga: Exploring indigenous knowledge and science and innovation.

“This will be the third year of the fund's operation, Mr Joyce says.

"We’re already seeing some innovative results from the programmes funded to date.  These include thorough research that is important to all New Zealanders such as determining future resource development by integrating relevant scientific, planning and Mātauranga information.”

"This fund aims to support the development of the science and innovation potential of Māori, knowledge and resources, for the future benefit of New Zealand,” Mr Flavell says.

“These collaborative approaches provide skills, grow relationships, and develop research that can be led or adopted by Māori and within the science and innovation system.

“The pūtea enables science organisations to better identify Māori innovation potential and to improve the way knowledge is passed on between Māori and researchers. This could include knowledge about technology which can address issues such as those relating to water, which we all have interests in.
