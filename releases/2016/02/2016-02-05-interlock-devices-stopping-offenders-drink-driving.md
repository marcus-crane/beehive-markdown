A growing number of offenders are taking part in a programme which aims to curb their repeat drink driving behaviour, says Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

Corrections is running a pilot programme to fund alcohol interlock devices for eligible offenders on community sentences. The devices are connected to the start-up mechanism of a car and immobilise it. It is not possible to start the car until the driver has successfully passed a breath alcohol test.

“This makes our roads safer for both the community and for the driver.”

The pilot has been running since last October for eligible offenders on community sentences, who are repeat drink drivers with two convictions for drink driving in five years, or one conviction for a breath test above 800mcg.

“We know from international evidence that use of the of interlocks result in large reductions of between 64-70 percent in repeat alcohol-impaired driving.”

As at the end of January, 43 interlocks had been installed with a further 15 booked in for installation. Corrections aims to have at least 100 offenders on the pilot programme this fiscal year and the pilot is currently ahead of schedule.

“Eligible repeat offenders who have an interlock device will also have the chance to shorten their licence disqualification period. A shorter disqualification period could enable an offender to keep their job,” Ms Collins says.
