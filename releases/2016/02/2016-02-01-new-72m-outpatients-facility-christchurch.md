Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government has given the green light to a new $72 million Outpatients facility to be built in Canterbury.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that Canterbury DHB is well placed to continue to deliver high quality services,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new building will be located in the health precinct on St Andrew’s triangle directly opposite Christchurch Hospital, which is close to the CBD and on public transport routes.

“Spanning five storeys and 10,500m2 the new building will provide outpatient and other clinical services including diabetes, endocrine, ophthalmology, and dental.

“Patients and staff will benefit from having so many key services brought together in a purpose-built facility. Clinical leaders are having a high level of involvement in the design to help ensure the space is well utilised.

“While the final design and construction timeframes are expected to be confirmed in the coming months, the Government has made up to $72 million available for the project and the new facility is expected to be completed in 2018.

“The approval of the new Outpatients facility is a significant milestone in what is already the largest hospital redevelopment project in New Zealand’s history. In total close to $1 billion is programmed to be spent in coming years on a range of new and/or redeveloped health facilities in Canterbury.

“Canterbury’s health workforce has demonstrated incredible resilience and determination in recent years – this massive redevelopment programme seeks to help recognise this.”

Canterbury DHB has a $1.36 billion budget, up $254 million in seven years. In addition, the Government has provided the DHB with a one-off $16 million funding boost for 2015/16.

Post the earthquakes the Government has continued to support health services in Canterbury, including funding the $650 million redevelopment of the region’s hospitals.

The new hospital at Burwood is expected to be completed around the middle of this year and the new Acute Services Building at Christchurch Hospital is scheduled to open in 2018.

The new Outpatients building is being funding through the Christchurch Hospital Redevelopment Project and Canterbury DHB's Programme of Works funding. The design and construction of the facility overseen by the Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group.

Outpatient services will continue to be provided from the Hagley building and other sites on the campus until the new facility is open.
