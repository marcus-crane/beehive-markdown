Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced an extension of a lease on Crown-owned land to enable the iconic Re:START Mall more time operating at its current site.

The innovative container mall, which opened in 2011, is situated on a mix of Crown and privately owned land.

“The Government and Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust have backed the Re:START Mall from the beginning due to its important role in bringing locals and visitors into the central city after the earthquakes,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As has always been expected, some of that privately owned land is now earmarked for new developments in the Retail Precinct, and over time retailers will be migrating from Re:START Mall to new buildings.

“The Mall’s lease on the Crown-owned land was due to lapse in May this year. However we have now provided an extension through to 31 January next year, so that this very popular attraction is able to continue while new developments progress around it, and its existing tenants look to options for the future.

“The intention is that the Crown-owned land will ultimately be sold for a suitable commercial development within the Retail Precinct.”
