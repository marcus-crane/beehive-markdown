Education Minister Hekia Parata today released provisional NCEA data showing that more Māori and Pasifika students are achieving Level 2 than ever before.

“NCEA Level 2 is the passport to a better future so this increase is great news for our young Māori and Pasifika students,” says Ms Parata.

The provisional roll-based data shows that since 2008, the percentage of Māori students gaining NCEA Level 2 at school has risen by 33.2 per cent to 69.4 per cent, and the percentage of Pasifika students gaining NCEA Level 2 at school has risen by 48 per cent to 75.2 per cent.

“As these are provisional results, we expect to see further increases when the data is finalised,” says Ms Parata.

“When we came into government in 2008, almost half of Māori and Pasifika students were not achieving NCEA Level 2. Since then, their achievement rates have risen faster than for any other group of the population and the achievement gap is closing.

“Students, teachers, principals, parents, whānau and aiga all deserve credit for this significant turnaround. As a result of their combined efforts, thousands more young Māori and Pasifika are leaving school every year with the skills and qualifications they need to be successful.

“However, while there has been dramatic progress in recent years we will not be satisfied until every young New Zealander is receiving the education they need to reach their full potential.”

***Notes***

Roll-based measures of achievement count all students who enrol in year 11, 12 or 13 regardless of whether or not they attempt to achieve NCEA. Participation-based measures count only students who have enrolled for sufficient credits to gain an NCEA level certificate.
