Transport Minister Simon Bridges says the thousands of Kiwis taking part in Go by Bike Day across the country today demonstrates the importance of the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme.

Speaking at the annual event in Wellington this morning, Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a core priority.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history,” Mr Bridges says.

“We’re investing to give more New Zealanders more opportunities to choose cycling – whether to commute to and from work and school, to run errands, or get some exercise.”

Over the next three years 54 projects are scheduled to be completed through the Urban Cycleways Programme. Four cycleways are already complete in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch.

Mr Bridges says the Government was also focused on changing people’s perceptions and attitudes towards cycling.

“We recognise the contribution cycling makes to healthier communities, and that safe and attractive cycling infrastructure can encourage people in urban areas to change their travel patterns.

“That’s why we’re funding an integrated education programme to help people can better understand the benefits of a ‘bike-friendly’ country, and the positive impacts of more people riding bikes,” Mr Bridges says.
