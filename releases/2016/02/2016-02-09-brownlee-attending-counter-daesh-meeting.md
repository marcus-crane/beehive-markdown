Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today to attend the first Counter-Daesh Defence Ministerial meeting, involving all countries contributing to the Counter-Daesh Coalition.

The meeting will take place in Brussels, Belgium on 11 February.

Ministers will discuss a range of regional and international security issues, in particular their respective responses to the fight against Daesh, and how the campaign will evolve over the next 12 months.

“I am looking forward to talking with fellow Defence Ministers about our shared approach to defeating this barbaric organisation, ensuring the safety of New Zealanders at home and abroad,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Brownlee will be accompanied by Chief of the Defence Force, Lieutenant General Tim Keating.
