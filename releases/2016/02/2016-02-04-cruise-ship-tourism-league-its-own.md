The decision by P&O Cruises to base a ship out of New Zealand is an endorsement of our growing cruise industry, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Pacific Pearl will spend five months based out of Auckland, the longest deployment of a P&O ship in New Zealand.

Mrs Bennett today attended a celebration on board the Pacific Pearl to mark the beginning of the Downer National Rugby League Auckland Nines.

“Auckland and New Zealand have such a diverse range of experiences on offer, and what better way to show this than the coming together of rugby league and the cruise sector,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The cruise industry is a fast-growing and important sub-sector of tourism, and is a big part of tourism’s contribution to our continued economic growth. 

“This year’s record cruise season is estimated to deliver $251.7 million to the Auckland region, an increase of around $60 million on last year. That flows right throughout the local economy supporting retailers, hospitality, and other tourism providers.

“Importantly though, it’s contributing to the impressive regional tourism growth we’re seeing, with a record number of ships visiting ports in Tauranga, Picton, Napier and Akaroa.”
