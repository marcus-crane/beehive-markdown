Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming a new Ministry of Transport report showing the number of drivers travelling over the speed limit on both urban and open roads continues to fall.

“The Ministry’s annual speed survey shows drivers are choosing to travel slower, especially in urban areas where there are more vulnerable road users, including cyclists and pedestrians,” Mr Foss says.

“Over the last decade, the proportion of cars travelling over the speed limit on urban roads has dropped from 63 to 46 per cent, while the proportion of cars travelling over the speed limit on open roads has dropped from 32 to 23 per cent.

“It’s particularly encouraging to see heavy vehicles travelling slower in urban areas but we still have a long way to go.  The speed limit is not a target, it’s the maximum safe speed, assuming fine conditions and no other hazards or distractions.

“No matter what causes a crash, a driver's decision to travel at a certain speed directly affects the force of impact, and therefore the result of the crash. 

“Driving within the limit will help ensure drivers keep themselves, their passengers and other road users safe.”

**Notes for editors:**

Each year the Ministry of Transport conducts surveys designed to monitor free speeds of vehicles in both 100 km/h limit areas and main urban 50 km/h areas.

Free speeds are measured when vehicles are unimpeded by the presence of other vehicles (that is, there is some distance between a vehicle travelling at a free speed and the vehicle in front of it) or by environmental features such as traffic lights, intersections, hills, corners or road works
