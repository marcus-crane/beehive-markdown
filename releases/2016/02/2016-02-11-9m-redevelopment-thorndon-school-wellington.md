One of the capital’s oldest schools, Thorndon School in central Wellington, will undergo a $9 million redevelopment, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

Thorndon School spans three centuries, having been first established in 1852.

“The redevelopment will see new teaching and administration blocks and a new library built at the school, which has experienced weathertightness issues with its current buildings,” says Ms Kaye.

“The new teaching block will comprise 13 learning spaces, replacing the school’s 11 existing classrooms and providing two extra learning spaces to accommodate roll growth.

“All of the new learning spaces will provide innovative learning environments featuring flexible teaching spaces.

“The school sits on a small, compact site, so the new buildings will be configured in a way that maximises outdoor play space and enhances access-ways to and through the school grounds.

“Building work will be carried out in two phases, and a temporary village of classrooms will be situated on the neighbouring Wellington Girls’ College site while redevelopment work is underway.”

Today’s announcement means almost $100 million of school redevelopments have been announced in the Wellington area since last November. These include redevelopments in the city such as Khandallah School ($6 million); Kelburn Normal School ($8.5 million); Newtown School ($8.9 million) and Ngaio School ($3.4 million).

“The Government is committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand can learn in environments that inspire and support them to achieve to the best of their potential.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation nationwide. This is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”

Construction at Thorndon School is expected to start in late 2016 and will take approximately 15 months to complete

**Notes**

**About Thorndon School**

Thorndon School was first established as St Paul’s School in Sydney Street in 1852. Around 1873 its name was changed to Thorndon School, and it moved to its current site in 1880. It is a full primary (years 1 – 8) school with a current roll of 299.

**About innovative learning environments**

Innovative learning environments feature flexible learning spaces which can be configured to allow group or independent learning, enabling students to develop skills such as collaboration as well as independent problem solving.

Acoustics, lighting, heating and air quality are of a higher standard to help students concentrate on learning, and buildings are equipped with the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.
