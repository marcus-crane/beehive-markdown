New Zealanders wanting to have their say on the future of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) Review have one more week to make their views heard.

Submissions on the first phase of the review close 5 PM, Friday 19 February 2016. The priority matters being considered in this phase relate to removing the transitional measure where emitters pay the cost of one unit for two tonnes of Carbon Dioxide.

“Following on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Government is focusing on ensuring our domestic settings are in the right place to help New Zealand meet our fair and ambitious 2030 target,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The ETS is one of our most effective tools to tackle climate change domestically and we want to hear a broad range of views about its effectiveness and impact.”

So far, the Ministry for the Environment has received 17 submissions, and held nationwide information sessions attended by representatives of over 70 organisations.

“I encourage New Zealanders to get involved in the debate, and it’s not too late for them to have their say on this first phase,” Mrs Bennett says.

The second phase of the review is looking at other important matters including emissions unit supply, price stability and operational issues. Submissions close 30 April 2016.
