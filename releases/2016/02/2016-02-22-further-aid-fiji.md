Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced a further Defence Force flight to Fiji and $1.8 million in funding, bringing New Zealand’s total contribution to relief efforts following Tropical Cyclone Winston to more than $2 million.

“The death toll from Cyclone Winston continues to rise and reports of widespread damage are coming in from across Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

“This evening a New Zealand Defence Force C-130 will depart for Suva carrying relief supplies and a Joint Reconnaissance Team made up of NZDF personnel, and Fire Service and Ministry of Health staff.

“The Joint Reconnaissance Team will assist the Government of Fiji with damage assessments and help coordinate New Zealand’s aid effort.

“The $1.8 million in funding announced today will take New Zealand’s total contribution to more than $2million.

“The funding will be used to support New Zealand non-government organisations working on the ground in Fiji and to respond to requests for technical assistance from the Fiji authorities.

“It is clear that Fiji faces a major clean-up and recovery operation and we will continue to assist the people and Government of Fiji in any way we can,” Mr McCully says.
