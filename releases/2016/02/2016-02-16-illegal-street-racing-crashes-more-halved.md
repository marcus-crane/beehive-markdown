The Sentencing Amendment (Vehicle Confiscation) Act 2009 which allows vehicles to be seized and destroyed has seen Illegal street racing crashes, injuries and deaths more than halve, says Police Minister Judith Collins.

“The table below shows the number of deaths, injuries and crashes where ‘racing’ was recorded as a factor contributing to the crash, for each year from 2001 to 2015.

“When I passed this legislation in 2009, I said that confiscating and destroying the vehicles of the worst, repeat offenders would be the ultimate deterrent. 

“Critics of this law have completely missed the point. The number of deaths, injuries and crashes due to illegal street racing have plummeted.

“This shows that the law has been an extremely effective deterrent. It has made our streets safer and saved lives.

“The Sentencing Amendment (Vehicle Confiscation) Act 2009 sent a strong message that illegal street racing would not be tolerated. It is working exactly as intended,” Ms Collins says
