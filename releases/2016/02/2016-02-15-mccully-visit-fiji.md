Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Suva this week to meet with Fiji’s Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.

“This will be my first visit to Suva since the 2014 elections and it is an opportunity to discuss our ongoing re-engagement directly with the Government of Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

"My discussions with Minister Kubuabola and other Government representatives will cover a range of matters including regional issues, trade, and our aid and development programme.

“Fiji is New Zealand’s largest trading partner in the Pacific and a growing number of New Zealand businesses are active there. We are ramping up our development relationship and I plan to visit the Koronivia Agriculture Station near Suva, where New Zealand is looking to support an upgrade to help boost Fiji’s agricultural sector.

“While in Suva I will also meet with Opposition representatives and Pacific Islands Forum Secretary-General Dame Meg Taylor,” Mr McCully says
