As Christchurch’s new education network rises from the rubble, Education Minister Hekia Parata has praised all those involved in shepherding Christchurch’s kids through extremely difficult times.

“Despite the trauma of the 22 February 2011 earthquake and thousands of aftershocks, student achievement in the region has continued to rise. That’s a testament to the resilience, determination and hard work of students, parents, teachers, principals, boards and support staff,” says Ms Parata.

“The good news for the region is that a new state-of-the-art education network is beginning to emerge that will be the envy of the country.

“Over a ten-year period, the Government is investing $1.137 billion in renewing, repairing or rebuilding 115 schools across Christchurch.

“I officially opened two of the completed schools, Rawhiti and Marshland, just over a week ago, bringing the total of completed schools to six. Lyttleton Primary School will be completed this year and another 38 projects are currently in design or under construction.

“We have had to make some hard decisions, but the aftermath of the earthquakes has given us the chance to look at Christchurch schools and see what we could improve,” says Ms Parata.

“Schools are joining forces and creating innovative learning environments that support the very best teaching approaches and help every child and young person to learn.”
