Corrections Minister Judith Collins announced today that a further $100,000 would be given to PARS to assist New Zealand offenders returning from Australia.

“PARS Incorporated (formerly known as the Prisoners’ Aid and Rehabilitation Society has provided practical support to more than 100 returning offenders so far.

“Another $100,000 will enable PARS to support more returning offenders to reintegrate and help them to live crime-free.

“PARS provides a rapid response service for returning offenders, to address their immediate needs, such as housing, employment and healthcare.

Following a change to the Australian immigration legislation, increased numbers of New Zealand offenders in Australia have been deported or have voluntarily returned.

The Returning Offender (Management and Information) Act 2015, passed last November, enables Corrections to monitor eligible offenders under parole-like conditions. Corrections is notified of the deportees by Interpol.

Deportees are met at the airport by police and offered the PARS service. This is a voluntary service and deportees can decline the service if they choose.
