The Taranaki Biodiversity Trust is making a significant difference to conservation efforts in the region, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Launching the Trust’s new Wild For Taranaki identity at its Biodiversity Forum in Stratford today, Ms Barry says the group is an excellent example of communities coming together for the benefit of their natural environment.

“The 19 different groups which form the Trust, representing the Department of Conservation, Fish and Game, the regional council and many others will work together towards ambitious shared goals with benefits for both for conservation and the local economy,” Ms Barry says.

“This is an exciting time for conservation in Taranaki with the recent launch of the NEXT Foundation-backed Project Taranaki Mounga hoping to rid the Egmont National Park of goats – making it the first park to be pig, deer and goat free in the country.”

The trust was formed in 2015 to raise the profile of Taranaki’s native biodiversity, encourage participation in conservation and develop new projects.

“I look forward to seeing the shortlist of potential large-scale conservation projects the Trust hopes to develop at this Forum and how they will contribute to our developing vision of a predator-free New Zealand.”

The Trust is also opening its Community Biodiversity Fund for applications, with $40,000 available for projects which protect threatened species and habitat in Taranaki.

“By pooling their resources the Trust has been able to offer some new funding for community projects in Taranaki – a superb example for other regions to complement DOC grants and other sources.”
