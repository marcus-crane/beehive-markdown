In response to speculation in media today about David Bain’s compensation claim, Justice Minister Amy Adams said:

“I can confirm that I have received Mr Callinan’s report. In accordance with the agreed process, parties now have an opportunity to provide any further information they wish me to consider in respect of the report.

“I will not begin consideration of Mr Callinan’s report and the advice I will take to Cabinet, until I have that information.

“In the meantime, I’m not going to comment on media speculation as to what Mr Callinan’s report does or doesn’t say.

“To protect the integrity of the process, it has been agreed with the applicant that there would be no comment on the status or position of the claim until Cabinet has made its decision and accordingly I won’t be providing further detail until that time.”
