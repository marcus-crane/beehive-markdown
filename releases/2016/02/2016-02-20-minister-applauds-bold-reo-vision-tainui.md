Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has welcomed a new reo Māori strategy launched by Tainui today.

*Tikanga Ora Reo Ora* ­– outlines how the tribe will support iwi members to become fluent Māori language speakers. The strategy includes providing online learning tools and programmes to support whānau living outside of the tribal area.

“Tainui’s bold goal– for 80 percent of Waikato-Tainui iwi members to be fluent in its tribal reo and tikanga by 2050 – illustrates the commitment iwi have to revitalising te reo.

“These kind of bold initiatives will be supported by the new Māori Language (Te Reo Māori) Bill,” says Mr Flavell.

The bill is due to be reported back to Parliament by the Māori Affairs Committee by Friday next week. 

“I look forward to seeing how Tainui progress with their reo vision and how the Crown can support this and other community-led reo initiatives in the future,” Mr Flavell says.
