Increased spending on maintenance by Housing New Zealand’s is making its Waikato properties better places to live, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

Housing New Zealand (HNZ) spent $11.5 million on maintenance in Hamilton and the Waikato Region last year, an increase of $2.9 million since 2012.

“Ensuring vulnerable social housing tenants have homes that are healthy, safe, and suitable for their needs is a priority for this Government,” Mrs Bennett says.

“We know when vulnerable people have appropriate well-maintained housing, it’s easier for them to get and retain a job or training, keep their kids healthy, and less likely to be dependent on the State long-term.”  

The increase in spending means more has been spent on both regular maintenance and upgrading things like heaters and curtains.

“I know tenant wellbeing is the number one concern for HNZ’s Board and Management, and spending more on their homes shows how much of a priority this is,” says Mrs Bennett.

“It’s great to be in Waikato to make this announcement, and to catch up with the local HNZ staff who do such a fantastic job supporting their tenants’ pretty diverse needs.”

Social housing tenants each pay on average around $100 per week in rent, with the Government spending over $700 million per year subsidising the rest.
