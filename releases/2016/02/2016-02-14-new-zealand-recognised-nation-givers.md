Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is delighted that New Zealand has been recognised internationally as the second most generous country in the world for charitable donations as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP).

Mrs Goodhew says that according to the Charities Aid Foundation, (CAF), a survey of 24 countries confirmed that New Zealanders are amongst the most generous in the world.

"Charitable giving by individuals as a percentage of GDP in New Zealand was recorded at 0.79 per cent" said Mrs Goodhew.

"New Zealand came second only to the United States of America, at 1.44 per cent, and ahead of Canada at 0.77 per cent, with the UK a distant fourth at 0.54 per cent.

The report also confirmed a positive correlation between charitable giving and other philanthropic activities, such as volunteering and helping strangers, which supports the idea that nations can develop a culture of giving.

"This is great to see, because this government works hard to encourage Kiwis to consider how they can contribute their time, skills, energy and commitment to our communities.

“Each year, New Zealand’s volunteers contribute around 270 million hours to the community, providing approximately 67 per cent of the non-profit workforce and contributing about 2.3 per cent to New Zealand’s GDP.

“There is enormous personal satisfaction in making a positive difference for others,” says Minister Goodhew.
