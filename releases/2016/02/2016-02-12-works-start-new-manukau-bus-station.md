Transport Minister Simon Bridges has turned the first sod for construction on the new Manukau Bus Station in Auckland.

The $26 million project will deliver a high quality, 23-bay station next to the existing Manukau Train Station, connecting bus and train services.

When complete, the two stations will see trains and buses running every 15 minutes from 7am to 7pm, seven days a week.

“This is a significant transport project for this community that will allow people to connect more easily between bus and train travel in a busy part of Auckland,” Mr Bridges says.

“As the gateway to south Auckland, Manukau is experiencing strong business and population growth. This new high quality facility will support additional patronage and deliver more frequent and more connected travel.

“It’s a strong move towards a simpler, more integrated public transport network for Auckland,” Mr Bridges says.

The new station will be the final stop in 13 out of 15 bus routes planned for Manukau and will also serve as a key regional bus destination.

It will provide real time passenger information, convenience kiosks, toilets, AT Metro customer service and ticket office, 24-hour security, help points and CCTV.

“This project supports the roll out of Auckland’s new public transport network and aligns with the Government’s focus on providing better, safer transport options,” Mr Bridges says.

The station is due to be complete in August 2017.
