Finance Minister Bill English and Transport Minister Simon Bridges today released a joint report with Auckland Council which looks at the future of transport in Auckland.

The Foundation Report is the first of three reports to be produced as part of the Auckland Transport Alignment Project, which aims to achieve an agreed strategic approach for developing Auckland’s transport system over the next 30 years.

Mr English says it sets out a framework to determine options for how Government and Council can collaborate to tackle Auckland’s current and likely future transport issues.

“We’re looking to get agreement on areas that can be explored further and we’re well set up to proceed at pace, contesting these new ideas as they progress.

“The workstreams that will result from this report will help local and central government find a far-reaching, long-term solution for Auckland and it’s wider region,” he says.

Mr Bridges says the Government and Council need to have a common understanding on how – and where – Auckland is likely to grow in the future, and what the transport problems are that need to be addressed.

“By 2045 Auckland is expected to grow by more than 700,000 people, and freight volumes are likely to increase by 78 per cent. It is essential that central and local government works together in deciding how to best meet these demands,” Mr Bridges says.

“A core part of this report will look at how travel demands and technologies may change over that period.

“Transport technology will have an obvious benefit in a city like Auckland. We’re looking specifically at how it can play a role in solving the city’s transport problems, especially reducing congestion.

“This joint project will help provide a sense of long term direction and certainty for Auckland’s transport network,” says Mr Bridges.

The Foundation Report lays the groundwork for the next stage of the project. Officials will now evaluate a wide range of options including new infrastructure and how to better manage the travel demands from ongoing population and economic growth.

“After receiving final recommendations later this year, we will then consider our preferred approach,” Mr Bridges says.
