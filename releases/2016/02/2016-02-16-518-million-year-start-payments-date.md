Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says more than $5.18 million in School and Year Start Up Payments have already been paid to caregivers in 2016 with two weeks before applications close.

“Carers receiving either the Unsupported Child’s Benefit or Orphan’s Benefit can receive between $400 and $550 per child, depending on the age of the child, at the beginning of each year,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Caregivers for 10,680 children have already received assistance this year to help with uniforms, stationery and other back to school related costs.

“We want to make sure children who are unable to live at home still go to school with the same things their peers have, and everything they need to do well in the classroom.

“Our family carers play an invaluable role in our care system and this is a simple and practical way of supporting them to care for these children.”

Eligible carers need to apply for the School and Year Start Up grants through the Work and Income website or at a service centre before 29 February.

“Caregivers are also able to apply for Extraordinary Care Fund grants throughout the year to support children in their care to reach their potential with tutoring, speech therapy, orthodontic work, or extra assistance for those who excel in sport, art or cultural activities,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Children come into care through no fault of their own so it’s vital we support them and their caregivers to reach their goals and thrive.”
