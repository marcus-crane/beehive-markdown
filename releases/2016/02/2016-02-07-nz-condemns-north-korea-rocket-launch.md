Foreign Minister Murray McCully has condemned today’s long-range rocket launch by North Korea.

“This action contravenes United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that North Korea cease any launches using ballistic missile technology,” Mr McCully says.

“While North Korea has claimed it as a satellite launch, the real purpose is widely believed to a long-range missile test. 

“North Korea’s decision to conduct a launch, and the nuclear test they carried out on 6 January, are irresponsible and fly in the face of international opinion.

“New Zealand again calls on North Korea to refrain from actions which undermine peace and stability in the region.

“We will work with other Security Council members on an appropriate response to the launch,” Mr McCully says.
