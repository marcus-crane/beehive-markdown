Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key, and Minister for Economic Development Steven Joyce, today turned the first sod on construction of the New Zealand International Convention Centre in Auckland.

“SkyCity has now started construction on what will be a world-standard facility,” Mr Joyce says. “It is a very significant investment for Auckland and New Zealand that will bring an additional $90 million in tourism expenditure annually.”

The total project cost of the NZICC plus the associated new hotel, laneway and extra carparks is $700 million.

“This important national facility will now bring 2140 new jobs - 1000 during the construction phase and about 1140 people in the NZICC, the new hotel, the new retail outlets and the additional gaming and hospitality areas that are being constructed. That’s 340 more jobs than originally estimated.

“This will be a tremendous facility for New Zealand, and it will be built without any direct financial contribution from the Government.”

Mr Joyce paid tribute to the efforts of all those involved. “The SkyCity Board agreed to take on the challenge of making the convention centre into a successful business and in addition, they have decided to build a new five-star hotel and a retail laneway beside it. 

“The Design Team has created a building that will be inspiring, attractive to international delegates and will enhance Auckland’s landscape. It will be New Zealand’s meeting place, our face to the world, and a building of which New Zealand and Aucklanders will be proud.”

The NZICC will comfortably accommodate conferences of up to 3150 people, and will be able to host up to 33,000 additional conference delegates who will support the hoteliers, retailers and restaurateurs of central Auckland, Mr Joyce says.  It has 8100sqm of exhibition space, auditorium seating for 2850 delegates and at least 24 meeting rooms.

NZICC will open in 2019.
