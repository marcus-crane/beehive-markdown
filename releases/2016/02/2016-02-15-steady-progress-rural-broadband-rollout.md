Communications Minister Amy Adams says the Government’s Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) is making steady progress, with 87 per cent of new and upgraded towers complete.

“Compared to a year ago, there has been a 32 per cent increase in rural New Zealand households and businesses able to connect to faster and more reliable broadband,” says Ms Adams.

“As a result of the strong progress of RBI, almost 280,000 rural households and businesses can now access fixed wireless or improved fixed line broadband.”

RBI towers built in the last year have increased by 23 per cent to total 135 new towers, and there are now 336 upgraded towers nationwide.

“The RBI is also extending mobile coverage to rural areas across New Zealand. Rural users are already taking advantage of these benefits - in the last three months, almost 1.8 million individual mobile devices accessed services from the new RBI towers on just one network,” says Ms Adams.

“Chorus has upgraded more than 1180 cabinets in rural areas under the RBI, which means more than 106,000 rural households and businesses can now access faster broadband.

“As we move into 2016 I look forward to more and more New Zealanders connecting to RBI and maximising the benefits of this exciting, next generation infrastructure,” says Ms Adams.
