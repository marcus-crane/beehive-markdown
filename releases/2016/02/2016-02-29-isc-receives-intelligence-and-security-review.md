Prime Minister and Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) John Key confirmed the report of the Independent Review of Intelligence and Security has been received by members of the ISC today.

“I would like to thank the independent reviewers, Sir Michael Cullen and Dame Patsy Reddy, for their work on this report,” says Mr Key.

“After the report has been tabled in Parliament, the Government can begin working on its response.”

The independent review was commissioned to consider whether the legislative frameworks of the intelligence and security agencies are well placed to protect New Zealand’s current and future national security, while protecting individual rights.

The review also assessed whether the current oversight arrangements provide sufficient safeguards to ensure the intelligence and security agencies act lawfully and maintain public confidence.

The ISC will meet on 8 March 2016 to consider the report and determine when it will be tabled in Parliament.
