The start of the school year is a good opportunity for parents to remind their children of the harmful effects of cyberbullying and staying safe online, says Communications Minister Amy Adams.

“Today marks Safer Internet Day, which helps promote the safe, positive and responsible use of online technology and devices,” says Ms Adams.

“It also gives parents the chance to discuss cyberbullying and safe online behaviour, so our young people are armed with the skills to operate safely and securely across both social media and the internet.”

Ms Adams said that New Zealanders are now more connected than ever, and nearly two thirds of the population access digital content vis a smartphone each week. 

“The internet is more prevalent in our daily lives than ever before. In an average week, 3.1 million New Zealanders over the age of 15 spend 14 hours online, and time spent on the internet increased by 23 minutes a week in the last year.

“Although the internet brings significant benefits to our lives, New Zealanders must be aware that it does contain risks for users of all ages.”

Over 40 per cent of New Zealanders have been directly affected by cybercrime, or know someone who has.

“Safer Internet Day is a reminder for us all to be proactive in securing our digital devices, like smartphones and tablets, as well as reminding our children and extended family members to do the same,” says Ms Adams. 

### Five easy tips to stay safe online:

1. Be suspicious of emails from people you don’t know or that look unusual – it may be spam email with malicious software attached.
2. Be suspicious of links shared to unknown websites – even if they are from your friends. If you are not sure, don’t click on them. Only visit trusted or reputable sites. A secure and authentic website will have two e-security symbols: a closed padlock and https:// in the address bar.
3. Limit the amount and type of identity information you share about yourself, friends and family on your online accounts.
4. Make sure your desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones are all secured with different passwords.
5. Use strong or complex passwords including a range of upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation, particularly for your email accounts and online banking.
