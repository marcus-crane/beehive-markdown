The next round of applications for the Racing Safety Development Fund has now opened, says Racing Minister Nathan Guy.

A total of $381,179 is available in this second round of funding after $618,821 was allocated in the first round.

“The fund supports projects around the country for improving racecourse health and safety standards,” says Mr Guy.

“In the past this has included improvements for safety running rails, irrigation and drainage, swabbing boxes, and grandstand repairs.

“Health and safety at racecourses is important for the racing animals, riders, spectators and officials.

“Many of these facilities are public places and widely used by the community in rural areas, outside of racing events as well as at race days

“Applications close on 31 March and all racing clubs and code bodies can apply for funding.”

New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses.

On-line applications must be submitted by 31 March 2016.  Further information is available from: [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/) and [Racing Safety Development Fund - dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Racing-Safety-Development-Fund?OpenDocument)
