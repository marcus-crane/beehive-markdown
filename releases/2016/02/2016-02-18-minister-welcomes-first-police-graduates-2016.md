Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed 38 new police officers in the first recruit wing of 2016 to successfully achieve constabulary status.

Ms Collins joined family and friends to celebrate the attestation parade of Wing 294 at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.

She said the parade marked the beginning of a challenging and rewarding career for the new officers.

“It takes a special type of person to be a Police officer. There are few jobs that ask people to put themselves in the path of danger so that the public may be safe,” Ms Collins said.

“Last year confidence in the Police continued to remain high at 78 per cent, which puts them among the most trusted professions in New Zealand.

“Yet no organisation can rest on its achievements. The Police have an obligation to the public to be constantly evaluating how they can do things better and respond to new and existing crime trends more effectively.”

“This doesn’t just mean catching criminals, although that will always be the Police’s main priority, but also a strong focus on crime prevention and community policing,” Ms Collins said.

Under the new Career Foundation Initial Training programme, police trainees undertake a two year training course before they graduate.

The attestation parade marks the completion of the second phase of their training which involves an intensive 18-week course at The Royal New Zealand Police College.
