Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Daniel Mellsop as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Canada.

“Canada is one of New Zealand’s strongest international partners, with over 75 years of established diplomatic relations,” Mr McCully says.

“Our world views are underpinned by our shared parliamentary, legal, social and defence traditions.  As Commonwealth countries, we work closely together across a range of foreign policy issues.

“As one of our 11 partners in the Trans Pacific Partnership, our economies will be further integrated in the Asia-Pacific region and our relationship only further strengthened by this agreement,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Mellsop previously served at New Zealand’s embassies in Seoul and The Hague. Most recently he headed the International Branch at the Ministry of Defence.

As High Commissioner to Canada, Mr Mellsop will also be accredited to Jamaica.
