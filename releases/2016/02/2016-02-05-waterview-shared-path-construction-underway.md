Construction on Auckland’s $25 million Waterview Shared Path is now underway, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The first sod was turned today on the 2.4km shared path which will connect the Waterview and Mt Albert communities and provide another safe link in the Auckland Cycle Network.

“The construction of the Waterview Shared Path is the latest community cycling and walking facility for Aucklanders. It is an important part of the Government’s $1.4 billion Waterview Connection project, our largest ever infrastructure roading project,” Mr Bridges says.

The path will connect with the north-western cycleway along SH16 and with shared paths to Onehunga and New Lynn in the south-west and west of the city.

“This is an important project for these communities.  It will deliver seamless travel in a safe environment, helping locals to move around more easily and safely in this area,” Mr Bridges says.

“The shared path will be accessible from a number of locations including the Unitec campus and planned public transport hubs. It will also connect with other initiatives designed to encourage cycling and walking and add to Auckland’s growing cycling and walking network.”

Mr Bridges says the Government is committed to providing safe and attractive transport choices.

“That’s why we’ve made cycling and walking a priority, recognising the contribution they make to the whole transport network,” Mr Bridges says.

The project will be completed by 2017.
