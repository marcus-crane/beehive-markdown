The avocado industry has become the seventh industry partner to join the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) biosecurity partnership today, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced.  

“It’s very pleasing to have the avocado industry on-board, working with the Ministry for Primary Industries and other industry  partners to manage and respond to the most important biosecurity risks,” says Mr Guy.

Avocados are New Zealand's third largest fresh fruit export. In the 2014-2015 season the industry produced 7.1 million trays of avocados worth around $135 million.

“The GIA means the industry can work in partnership and contribute their time, expertise, and resources to achieve better biosecurity outcomes.

“Biosecurity is a shared responsibility and we need the input of industry and the wider public to make the system as effective as possible.

“I’ve always said biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and this is backed up with a range of new initiatives. Last year’s funding boost of $27 million has meant more detector dogs, x-ray machines and inspectors.

“We also have the new border clearance levy, a new inflight video for international passengers, and an $87 million biocontainment laboratory under construction at Wallaceville.”

The New Zealand Avocado Growers’ Association joins Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand, New Zealand Pork, New Zealand Equine Health Association, Onions New Zealand, the NZ Forestry Owners Association and the Ministry for Primary Industries under GIA.
