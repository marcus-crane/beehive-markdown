Fourteen new Special Housing Areas that will provide more than 4500 new homes across Auckland were announced today by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and Mayor Len Brown.

“This latest tranche of greenfield and brownfield sites will bring the total number of Special Housing Areas established so far in Auckland to 118, with a combined potential yield of more than 52,000 new homes. This is the scale and momentum both the Government and Auckland Council are pushing for to address the city’s housing supply and affordability challenge,” Dr Smith and Mr Brown say.

The 14 new SHAs announced today are:

- Argent Lane, Upper Orewa: 190.53 hectares, 2403 homes
- Bremner Road Extension, Drury: 22.61 hectares, 300 homes
- Brightside Road, Stanmore Bay: 0.41 hectares, 40-50 homes
- Canal Road, Avondale: 0.14 hectares, 7 homes
- Forge Way, Mt Wellington: 0.17 hectares, 41-50 homes
- Hobsonville Point (Catalina Precinct) and Marine Industry Precinct Extension: 13.67 hectares, 150-160 homes
- Kelmarna Avenue, Herne Bay: 0.23 hectares, 70 homes
- Link Crescent, Stanmore Bay: 2.07 hectares, 40-60 homes
- Manurewa Cluster: 0.77 hectares, 37 homes
- Moire Road, Massey: 9.20 hectares, 175-200 homes
- Ockleston Landing, Hobsonville: 3.61 hectares, 70-80 homes
- Onehunga Cluster: 0.46 hectares, 22 homes
- Tamaki Regeneration Area (Panmure and Point England): 119.90 hectares, 1192 homes
- Zion Road, Birkenhead: 0.19 hectares, 50 homes

The Auckland Housing Accord, which was agreed in October 2013 by Dr Smith and Mr Brown, provides for the creation of SHAs by Auckland Council with the approval of the Government. Qualifying developments in these areas can be streamlined and fast-tracked. 

“Once again, I am pleased to be standing alongside the Minister to announce yet another tranche of Special Housing Areas as part of our Accord with the Government,” Mr Brown says.  

“Housing has been a real focus for the council and our collaborative efforts have enabled many more homes to be made available for Auckland families. The partnership with Government has been extremely successful and it has been a relationship that is indeed benefiting Aucklanders.”

“Special Housing Areas are one part of the solution to improving the housing issues in Auckland. We need to keep our foot on the accelerator. The Government also has in place initiatives to constrain building materials costs, rein in development contributions, cut compliance costs and invest in improved sector productivity. Our new $435 million HomeStart support package, which came into effect last April, will help 90,000 people into home ownership over the next five years,” Dr Smith says.

“The next steps in our programme include advancing new housing on Crown-owned land, supporting the council in the completion of the new Auckland Unitary Plan, consulting on a new Urban Development National Policy Statement, and reform of the Resource Management Act to address the long-term issues affecting housing supply and affordability.”
