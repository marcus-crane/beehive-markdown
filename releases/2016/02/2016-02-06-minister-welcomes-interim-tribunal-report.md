Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, welcomes the interim Waitangi Tribunal report on Te Ture Whenua Māori.

The Tribunal released part of its report last night in response to an urgent hearing held last year.

Mr Flavell says he agrees with the Tribunal’s view that consultation with Māori is critical to the reform of the Ture Whenua Māori Act.

“This is why we have carried out extensive consultation on Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill and continue to consult with a range of Māori on the reform.

“Significant changes were made to the Bill late last year as a result of written submissions we received and feedback from nationwide hui. We listened to people and changed the Bill accordingly,” he says.

A new round of nationwide hui to explain those changes to the Bill starts next week.

The Minister looks forward to receiving the Tribunal’s final report which is due next month.
