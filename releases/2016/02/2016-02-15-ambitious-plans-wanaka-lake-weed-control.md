A new stage in the fight against lake weed at Lake Wanaka began today, with the launch of a plan of attack for controlling lagarosiphon weed over the next decade.

Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and their partners have been working collaboratively on weed control at the lake since 2005. The new 2016-2025 strategy will build on this success to ensure people can continue to enjoy the lake, Minister for Land Information Louise Upston said.

“LINZ has worked with experts and others with an interest in the lake to develop this strategy. Lagarosiphon crowds out native lake vegetation and clogs areas for swimming and boating, and there’s no quick fix,” Ms Upston said.

“This strategy sets out a long term approach to bringing the weed down to a level that can be easily managed.

“The main goal is to knock back the weed in the lake’s Paddock, Parkins and Glendhu Bays. So by the end of 2025, the weed should be limited to the south-east end of the lake, with the rest of the lake able to be kept clear by hand weeding. With a national War on Weeds underway, the new programme shows cross-Government determination to protect our native ecosystems from pest plants.”

The strategy was developed by LINZ in collaboration with the Lake Wanaka Lagarosiphon Management Committee. This committee is led by LINZ, and has members from Otago Regional Council, Queenstown Lakes District Council, the Department of Conservation, and the Guardians of Lake Wanaka.

The committee also has representatives from LINZ’s biosecurity partners Boffa Miskell, who manage the control programme, and from NIWA, who provide scientific advice.

The strategy was launched today at an event held at Lake Wanaka
