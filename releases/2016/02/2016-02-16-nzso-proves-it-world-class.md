The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra has done the country proud with its Best Orchestral Performance nomination at the Grammy Awards despite not taking home the prize, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“On behalf of the Government I extend my warmest congratulations to all members of the NZSO,” Ms Barry says.

“Just to be nominated for a Grammy is an extraordinary achievement and worthy of celebration. This was the NZSO’s first ever Grammy recognition, and while they did not win the top award at today’s ceremony, all New Zealanders should be proud of our national orchestra. It confirms the NZSO is world class and deserves to be compared with the very best in the world.”

The NZSO was nominated for the prestigious award for *Symphony ‘Humen 1839’*, a recording of works by Pulitzer Prize-winning Chinese composer Zhou Long in collaboration with compatriot Chen Yi. Singaporean Darrell Ang was conductor for the recording at Wellington’s Michael Fowler Centre in June 2013.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra from the United States won the Grammy for *Shostakovich - Under Stalin's Shadow - Symphony No. 10*.
