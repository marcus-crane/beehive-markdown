The Home and Community Support (Payment for Travel Between Clients) Settlement Bill passed its third reading in Parliament today.

Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says that as a result, around 24,000 care and support workers will be paid for the time and costs travelling between clients from 1 March 2016.

“This Bill is an important milestone in recognising the valuable contribution that care and support workers make to the lives of many New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s a major investment by the Government in some of the lowest paid members of the health workforce - they will benefit from a total investment of around $38 million a year, over $150 million over four years.

“This Bill is a responsible approach to resolving the long standing in-between travel issue. It puts in place an enduring, affordable, sustainable framework, and sets a roadmap for ensuring there continues to be a skilled workforce to support New Zealanders.”

The Bill resolves a claim filed in the Employment Relations Authority. It implements a settlement agreement between support workers, service providers, unions, DHBs and the Crown.

It formalises arrangements for travel time and costs for home and community support workers who assist older people, disabled people, and those recovering from injury or illness, with household and personal care needs.

This investment is supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the sector this year, taking the health budget to a record $15.9 billion.
