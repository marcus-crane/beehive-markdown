Foreign Minister Murray McCully has released the Whitehead Report, into diplomatic immunity issues surrounding Malaysian Defence attache Mohammad Rizalman.

“As previously indicated the conclusions reached by Mr Whitehead’s investigation are not unexpected but they are very disappointing,” Mr Mccully says.

“At the heart of the matter is a single email, along with procedural shortcomings, which gave Malaysian officials the impression it would be acceptable for Mr Rizalman to return to Malaysia.

“While Mr Rizalman has now been through the courts, this should never have been in any doubt. I would like to acknowledge the role of the Malaysian Government in ensuring that he returned to face justice in New Zealand. I would also like to reiterate my apology to the young woman who was so badly let down by the way this issue was handled.

“Mr Whitehead’s report has 21 recommendations to ensure that events like this will not happen again and these have now been fully implemented by the Ministry.

“We have waited until after Mr Rizalman’s sentencing to release the Whitehead Report and associated documentation on advice from Crown Law. We have released the report as soon as possible and I am pleased it is now available to the public,” Mr McCully says.

The Whitehead Report is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website: [https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/\_securedfiles/OIA/Ministerial-Enquiry-Whitehead-Report.pdf](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/_securedfiles/OIA/Ministerial-Enquiry-Whitehead-Report.pdf)
