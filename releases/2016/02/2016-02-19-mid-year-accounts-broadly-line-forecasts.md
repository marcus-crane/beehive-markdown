The Government’s accounts for the six months to 31 December show spending remains under control – reflecting a continued focus on fiscal responsibility, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) for the first half of 2015/16 was a deficit of $889 million. This was $92 million larger than forecast in the Half Year Update but more than $100 million smaller than the deficit at the same time last year.

“Although revenue is slightly under forecast, we are keeping a tight rein on what we can control - our spending,” Mr English says. “

“We’ll have to wait until the final accounts are published in October before we see the actual OBEGAL result for 2015/16 – but now that we are back near balance we will not react to small negative or small positive surplus forecasts.”

The mid-year results show core crown tax revenue was largely in line with expectations and over $1 billion higher than at the same time last year. Compared to forecasts, corporate tax was slightly lower (down $246 million, 5.9 per cent) being largely offset by higher source deductions (up $150 million, 1.1 per cent), consistent with stronger labour market data.

Core Crown expenses were $142 million (0.4%) lower than forecast, largely reflecting the timing of Treaty settlements.

“After achieving a surplus in 2014/15, our focus is now firmly on reducing debt– which is reflected in our target of reducing net government debt to around 20 per cent of GDP in 2020” Mr English says.
