Education Minister Hekia Parata has today officially opened the new $13.6 million Rāwhiti School in Christchurch.

Rawhiti School was a merger between Central New Brighton, North New Brighton and Freeville Schools and the new school buildings will accommodate up to 600 students. The new school includes six flexible learning studios and a multi-purpose hall, library and community space.

“Rāwhiti School’s innovative teaching spaces will support a wider range of effective teaching and learning approaches and contribute to the drive we’re making to lift student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“This school is a welcome addition to the Christchurch schooling network, which is emerging as one of the most modern schooling networks in the country.

“Merging three schools together is a challenge but the Rāwhiti School community have risen to that challenge and successfully developed a unified school culture,” says Ms Parata.

The Government is investing $1.137 billion renewing and restoring the greater Christchurch schooling network. This involves 115 school schools that are being rebuilt, repaired or remodelled by 2022. 

“We’re really pleased with the progress we’ve made in Christchurch and the way that the community have embraced the rebuild,” says Ms Parata.
