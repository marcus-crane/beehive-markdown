A $1.3 million redevelopment of Mulberry Grove School on Great Barrier Island was officially opened by Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today.

“This redevelopment was needed because the existing school buildings, situated next to the sea, contained significant asbestos and were impacted by age and the coastal environment,” says Ms Kaye.

“The old buildings had reached the end of their economic life and have been demolished and replaced, providing both the school and the local community with fantastic new facilities.

“Mulberry Grove School is an important community hub. As well as providing flexible learning spaces to support an innovative learning environment, the new facilities will also be used for community purposes.

“The school now has two brand new teaching spaces, a new library and new administration building

“As with any school redevelopment, the focus has been on providing flexible learning spaces that can support individual and group learning, and which feature higher standards of acoustics, lighting, heating and ventilation.

“In small or remote areas such as Great Barrier Island, school infrastructure is an integral part of the local community. I know the Ministry of Education and the school’s board of trustees worked closely together to ensure this project delivered buildings that meet the school’s and community’s needs.

“Local trades-people were also involved in the construction project, so the new school embodies both the spirit and hard work of the community.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand can learn in environments that inspire and support them to succeed.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation nationwide. This is a more than 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”
