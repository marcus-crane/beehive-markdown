Prime Minister John Key will lead a delegation to Australia this week for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will host the meeting in Sydney on Friday 19 February.

“The Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting is a well-established annual fixture which recognises the significant relationship between our two countries,” says Mr Key. 

“Our discussions will span a range of topics of mutual interest, including opportunities for further trans-Tasman collaboration on trade, regional and security issues.

“We will also continue to discuss the situation of New Zealanders living in Australia, and the ongoing management of deportations from Australia.” 

Mr Key will be accompanied by a delegation of senior business leaders. During the visit, the two Prime Ministers will speak to business leaders from both countries at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle event. 

Mr Key will also meet with New South Wales Premier Mike Baird, and attend a tourism event.
