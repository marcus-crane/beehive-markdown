Justice Minister Amy Adams says the law managing returning offenders is helping keep New Zealanders safe.

The law passed by Parliament in November 2015 to manage deported criminals has resulted in approximately 70 per cent of all deportees who have arrived since that date being supervised by New Zealand authorities.

“It’s pleasing to see that the laws we passed late last year are operating as intended and that the most serious deported offenders are being supervised to both ensure public safety and assist their re-integration into society,” Ms Adams says.

As at 9 February 2016, there had been 105 returning offenders since the Act came into force on 18 November 2015. Of those 105, 73 (70 per cent) have been found to be automatically eligible for supervision of varying periods.

The remaining 30 per cent are not eligible for automatic supervision because either they served less than one year in prison or were deported on character grounds not relating to conviction. Of this group, there have been three successful applications to supervise offenders who are not automatically eligible.

More than 40 applications have been made for special conditions to be imposed by the courts.

All 105 returning offenders have had identifying particulars and DNA collected from them.

“I’ve said throughout that while there is always a risk of reoffending, as there is with any offender who leaves prison, this law goes a long way to mitigate that risk for law-abiding New Zealanders. Early indications show the law is working as intended,” Ms Adams says.
