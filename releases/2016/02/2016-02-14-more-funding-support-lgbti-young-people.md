Youth Minister Nikki Kaye has announced $25,000 of funding towards more initiatives to support LGBTI young people.

“This latest funding will help InsideOUT New Zealand deliver workshops at the 2016 Shift Hui in Wellington, and help Q-Topia deliver the RainbowYOUTH education programme in Christchurch schools,” says Ms Kaye.

“InsideOUT New Zealand will offer a series of workshops at the Shift Hui. These will be aimed at enabling young people to identify themselves in leadership roles, and work towards starting diversity groups and queer-straight alliances in schools in their local communities.

“Up to 100 young people are expected to participate in the workshops during the hui.

“Twelve Q-Topia LGBTI young people have already been trained by RainbowYOUTH to be facilitators of RainbowYOUTH’s video-based education programme, which highlights and encourages acceptance of gender diversity.

“The funding provided to Q-Topia will now enable these facilitators to start delivering the programme in Christchurch schools, reaching at least 600 young people.

“It’s encouraging that different groups are working together on local initiatives to engage and support LGBTI young people, and this latest funding recognises and supports this collaborative approach.

"The new funding follows a range of funding to support LGBTI young people over the past two years, including small grants funding for services such as counselling, online help resources and safe places to meet.

“Last November I also announced a contract with RainbowYOUTH to help them deliver more services and strengthen groups for LGBTI youth around New Zealand.

“LGBTI young people are five times more likely than other young people to attempt suicide or deliberately self-harm. They’re also more likely to be bullied, physically harmed or afraid that someone may hurt them.

“The Government is taking steps to ensure vulnerable LGBTI young people receive the right support and services at the right time. Last November I released the document Supporting LGBTI Young People in New Zealand, which outlines some of the work underway to achieve this.”
