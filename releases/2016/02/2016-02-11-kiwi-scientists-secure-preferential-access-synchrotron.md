Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced a three-year investment of $2.8 million in the Australian Synchrotron, the largest piece of scientific infrastructure in the Southern Hemisphere, to secure preferential access for Kiwi scientists.

The Synchrotron is a source of intense light ranging from infra-red to hard x-rays, and is used for a variety of research purposes. The Government funding, along with co-investment from NZ research organisations, will support the operating costs of the leading-edge research facility.

“New Zealand has invested A$13.5 million into the Synchrotron since it began operations in 2007, in what is an excellent example of trans-Tasman cooperation and international scientific collaboration,” Mr Joyce says.

"New Zealand scientists have been enthusiastic adopters of Synchrotron science.  This renewed investment ensures they will have preferential access to the latest technology. Synchrotron science plays an important role in supporting New Zealand’s science capability. It has applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines highly relevant to us.

“We’re seeing more rapid and precise investigation of biological structures, diseases and medicine. Techniques that previously took up to 5 days can be achieved in 10-20 minutes using advanced synchrotron techniques.”

Scientists at the University of Canterbury have used the synchrotron to assess the feasibility of drilling into magma for geothermal power generation, and a Waikato University team has developed a process to decolour and de-odourise bloodmeal before converting it into a plastic.

The Australian Synchrotron, located next to Monash University in Melbourne, is one of two synchrotrons in the Southern Hemisphere.
