Seven young entrepreneurs who will receive a total of around $121,000 through Opportunities for Young People funding were announced today by Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

Ms Kaye made the announcement while attending the Young Enterprise Trust’s E-Day at Ellerslie Racecourse in Auckland, where school teams came to share ideas for products and businesses and get tips and feedback from local business experts.

“This funding is to support young people with smart, achievable projects that will make a social or environmental difference,” says Ms Kaye.

“We’ll be supporting a range of innovative projects, from nut-based yoghurt and cargo packaging, to initiatives that address social issues such as mental health and bullying.”

Opportunities for Young People funding comes from the $2 million Youth Enterprise Fund launched in December 2014, which largely supports organisations offering hands-on opportunities for young people to develop entrepreneurial skills.

“I meet countless young people who are coming up with great ideas for projects that are worth supporting in their own right, and that’s what Opportunities for Young People funding is all about.

“Young people, often with a modest investment, can turn their dreams and ideas into reality. We want to provide encouragement and support to help young people with great ideas take them to the next level.”

Today’s announcement comes on top of $79,000 Opportunities for Young People funding received by four recipients in May last year.
