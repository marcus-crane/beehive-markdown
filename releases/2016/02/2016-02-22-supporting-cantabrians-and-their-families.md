Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government is committed to ensuring Canterbury DHB is well placed to deliver high quality services.

“Canterbury’s health workforce has demonstrated incredible resilience and determination since the earthquakes five years ago,” says Dr Coleman.

“The DHB has responded to the unique challenges as a result of the earthquakes with an internationally recognised integrated health system.

“It has continued to deliver key services – a good example of this is the DHB’s elective surgery rates. Around 18,000 elective surgeries were carried out in the last financial year, compared to around 11,500 in 2007/2008.”

Since 2011 there has been a cross government psychosocial recovery plan.

There has been a strong drive to encourage people experiencing mental health problems to seek help. The All Right? campaign was designed to help Cantabrians think about their mental health and ways they can improve it.

In Budget 2014 the Government made $13.5 million available to support core psychosocial services.

“We know there has been an increase in demand for mental health services since the earthquakes,” says Dr Coleman.

“The DHB will spend around $147 million this year on mental health services - an extra $23 million compared to seven years ago. The Ministry’s Director of Mental Health is currently in discussions with the DHB and other agencies on whether any additional support is needed.”

The Government’s provided an extra $86 million to the DHB over and above the population based funding formula to meet the additional costs of recovery since the earthquakes, including an extra $16 million in November 2015.

“This funding reflects Canterbury’s unique circumstances and the need to maintain momentum on the hospital redevelopment, earthquake repairs, and the delivery of high quality services to Cantabrians,” says Dr Coleman.

“In total close to $1 billion is programmed to be spent in coming years on a range of new and redeveloped health facilities in Canterbury.

“Recently the Government gave the green light to a new $72 million Outpatients facility which is expected to be completed in 2018.

“The approval of the Outpatients facility is a significant milestone in what is already the largest hospital redevelopment project in New Zealand’s history.”

The new hospital at Burwood is expected to be completed around the middle of this year, and the new Acute Services Building at Christchurch Hospital is scheduled to open in 2018.

Canterbury DHB has a $1.36 billion budget, up $254 million in seven years.
