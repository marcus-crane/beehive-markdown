Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the World Health Organization’s declaration of Zika virus as a public health emergency is appropriate.

“Although cases of the Zika virus have been reported for over a decade in New Zealand, it’s generally been regarded as a mild illness,” says Dr Coleman.

“Recent developments overseas mean this declaration is the right step.

“The WHO declaration follows international clusters of microcephaly and neurological conditions associated with the virus. By elevating this to a public health emergency, much needed research can now be fast-tracked.

“I am advised that the threat within New Zealand is virtually non-existent as we don’t have the mosquito species, *Aedes aegypti*, which is spreading the disease.

“We have a longstanding programme in place to protect our borders and reduce the spread of communicable disease.

“Good surveillance and reporting means we can ensure people get the right diagnosis, with prompt help and advice.

“This includes information at the airport for travellers arriving in New Zealand advising them about the virus and where to get help if they become sick.

“Passengers coming from Zika infected countries are being given an information handout which has been translated into several languages. There are also large signs displaying this information at passport control.

“New Zealanders are only at risk if travelling to areas where Zika is prevalent.

“Until more is known about the virus pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant should consider delaying travel to areas with Zika virus. Anyone travelling to Zika infected countries should take appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”

Within New Zealand there have now been 10 Zika cases this year affecting travellers who have recently arrived from the South Pacific – eight of which are confirmed. Travellers with the disease have been in Tonga, Samoa, and American Samoa.

More than 20 countries, which are mostly in central America, are currently reporting cases.

The Ministry of Health continues to monitor international developments and is in the process of establishing a specialist advisory group to guide ongoing advice and actions.
