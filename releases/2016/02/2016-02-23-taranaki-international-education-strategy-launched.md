Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced $162,000 over two years for the implementation of Taranaki’s International Education Strategy, through Education New Zealand’s (ENZ) Regional Partnership Programme.

Mr Joyce was in New Plymouth to launch the strategy, making Taranaki the latest region to benefit from government investment in international education, both at the local and national levels. It formalises the existing cooperation between Taranaki education providers and Venture Taranaki.

“This is a great example of the economic development agency, local providers and ENZ working together.” Mr Joyce says. “This collaborative approach allows the group to share resources and make strategic and targeted investments together for greater impact.”

International education brings $2.85 billion in to the New Zealand economy annually, and supports 30,000 jobs across the country. The Government’s goals include growing the value of the industry sustainably to $5 billion by 2025.

“Regional New Zealand has much to offer international students, and sharing the benefits of this important sector across the country is a focus for ENZ,” Mr Joyce says.

“Taranaki’s plans set a clear direction for growing the value of international education in the region to $19 million by 2025, and the government is pleased to support their ambitious goals.”
