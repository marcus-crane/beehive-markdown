The $180 million investment into the rollout of Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) programme demonstrates the Government’s commitment to rebuilding a smart and sustainable Christchurch, Communications Minister Amy Adams says.

“As we mark the fifth anniversary of the Christchurch Earthquake, the Christchurch rebuild is gaining pace and the thousands of kilometres of fibre optic cables being laid under the city is transforming the way we work, learn and stay connected,” Ms Adams says.

“Christchurch is in a unique position to ensure that buildings are future-proofed and can make the most of the Internet of Things. No other city in New Zealand has the opportunity to build and capitalise on a smart and connected city like Christchurch does.

“The advent of UFB acts as a catalyst for innovative thinking and solutions throughout the Christchurch rebuild, whether its new roads, smart transport systems, connected greenfields or the construction of high-tech buildings.

“The UFB rolled out now is 56 per cent complete across the city, with the towns of Rolleston and Lincoln finished.”

More than 17,500 customers are now connected, which puts uptake at nearly 17 per cent. All 154 Christchurch schools are now able to connect to UFB (145 have connected), as well as 90 per cent of local businesses.

“Cantabrians are taking to UFB with gusto, with almost one-fifth of all orders in New Zealand in December coming from Christchurch alone.”

Local fibre provider Enable has laid more than 1600km worth of fibre across Christchurch – roughly the equivalent to the length of New Zealand.

“The UFB rollout is supporting Cantabrians with jobs, with the build project currently employing around 460 people,” Ms Adams says.

“UFB is essential for economic growth and supporting local Canterbury businesses compete on the global stage, through greater access to customers and suppliers.

“This world-class infrastructure is contributing to Christchurch’s resilience, with Enable’s network demonstrating tremendous resilience throughout all of the Christchurch earthquakes – with not a single fibre break.

“Christchurch has a bright future ahead of it as a thriving, innovative city. The Government remains committed to continue supporting Cantabrians through the rebuild, and ensuring the city is future-proofed to make it an even better place to live and work.

“I’m proud of the Government’s Christchurch partner Enable, who has done a sterling job connecting our city, under trying circumstances.”
