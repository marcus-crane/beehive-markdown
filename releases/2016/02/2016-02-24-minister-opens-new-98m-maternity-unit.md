Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened the new maternity unit at Whangarei Hospital.

“The new maternity ward will help to further improve the quality care being provided to women and babies at Northland DHB,” says Dr Coleman.

“The $9.8 million Te Kotuku unit brings together the hospital’s maternity services into the one place.

“The purpose-built unit includes eight birthing rooms, 18 beds, four antenatal clinic rooms and a high dependency unit. It also includes a central staff base which will help to further improve collaboration and communication.

“Investments like the new Te Kotuku unit are only possible under strong financial management. This work is being supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year.”

Te Kotuku will start taking patients from early March.

In 2015/16 Northland DHB received an extra $20.6 million in funding, taking its total budget to just over $508 million. This funding boost is included in the extra $119 million the DHB has received since 2008/2009.

“The Government recognises the importance of delivering high quality maternity care and we invested an extra $103 million over four years in Budget 2012 to improve maternity services,” says Dr Coleman.

“This includes the establishment of the National Maternity Monitoring Group to advise the Ministry of Health on quality improvements, and the roll out of a maternity quality and safety programme into every DHB.”
