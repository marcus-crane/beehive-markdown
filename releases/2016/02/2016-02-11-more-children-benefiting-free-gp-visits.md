Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new data shows free GP visits for under 13s is making it easier for families to get the care their children need.

“The Government is committed to supporting families in giving their children the best possible start in life. Removing the cost barrier is making a real difference to many families,” says Dr Coleman.

“While it’s early days, data for Quarter One 2015/16 (July to September) show the rates of children under 13 visiting their GP is 23 per cent higher than the same quarter last year.

“The data also shows that more Maori and Pacific children are being seen by their GP – there was a 25 per cent increase for Maori, and a 21 per cent increase for Pacific people.

“Uptake is in line with the introduction of free GP visits for under 6s which saw an increase in the first six to twelve months before levelling out. The under 13s rollout also coincided with a winter where flu and seasonal illnesses were at higher levels than previous years.

“It will take 12 months of data to fully assess the impact of the under 13s policy. The Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the uptake.”

On 1 July 2015, all New Zealand children aged under 13 became eligible to access free visits with their enrolled general practice and after-hours services, as well as free prescriptions.

“99 per cent of general practices across the country are now offering free GP visits for children under 13. This means that around 780,000 children under 13 are benefiting from free GP visits and prescriptions,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s fantastic to see such high uptake in the scheme – it exceeded expectations. I’d like to thank the sector for their support.”

As at 1 January 2016, just 10 general practices out of 1,015 have chosen not to provide free GP visits for under 13s. The majority of the practices which have chosen not to opt in are based in the Auckland region.

In Budget 2014 the Government committed $90 million over three years to extend free GP visits and prescriptions to children under 13.

This programme is supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year, taking the health budget to a record $15.9 billion.
