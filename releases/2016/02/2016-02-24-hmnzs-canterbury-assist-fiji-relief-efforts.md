Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that the Navy’s Multi-Role Vessel the HMNZS Canterbury will be sent to Fiji to support relief and recovery efforts following tropical cyclone Winston. 

“Cyclone Winston has caused extensive and widespread devastation across Fiji, taking lives, and destroying homes and infrastructure,” Mr McCully says.  

“New Zealand is committed to supporting the Government and people of Fiji as they respond to this disaster and this is reflected in the further deployments we are announcing today. 

“The HMNZS Canterbury will depart Auckland this weekend loaded with essential supplies such as building materials, water storage tanks, and medical supplies. As well as relief supplies, it will carry helicopters and medical and engineering personnel. The Canterbury will be supported by the Offshore Patrol Vessel the HMNZS Wellington.

“In addition a further contingent of NZDF and New Zealand Fire service engineers will depart from Ohakea today to support the Fiji authorities with repairs to public buildings and critical infrastructure.

“New Zealand Defence Force C-130s are already delivering relief supplies and equipment in Fiji, and the P3 Orion continues to carry out regular reconnaissance flights.

“This is one of the most damaging cyclones in Fiji’s history and this is reflected in the scale of our response. New Zealand will continue to do all we can to help and we will stand with Fiji in the aftermath of this disaster,” Mr McCully says.
