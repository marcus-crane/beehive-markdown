The new $10.2 million Marshland School was officially opened in Christchurch today by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The new school includes a block of four learning studios and a multi-purpose hall, library and community space. It also has three new playgrounds.

“Marshland School’s innovative learning environment will be an inspiring space for kids to learn in new and exciting ways,” says Ms Parata.

“These are special times for Christchurch as we continue to make strong progress with the rebuild. Of the 115 schools that are being renewed, repaired or rebuilt by 2022, Marshland School was the first to achieve completion.

“That’s great news for these kids and their families who are excited about their new school and the innovative learning opportunities it presents. I commend them for the resilience they have shown through tough times.”

The Government is investing $1.137 billion rebuilding and repairing Christchurch’s schools.

“By the end of this work, the Christchurch schooling network will be the most modern schooling network in the country.” 

The roll of Marshland School has increased rapidly with the construction of new subdivisions in the area and is approaching capacity of 400 students.

It is planned that the school will host a Ferndale Special Education satellite unit as part of the Marshland School Stage 2 build for an additional 100 students.
