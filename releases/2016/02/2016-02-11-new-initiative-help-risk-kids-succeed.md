Education Minister Hekia Parata today launched a new initiative aimed at supporting at-risk students to stay and succeed at school.

Based in the wider Gisborne region, Year 9 Plus will assist some of the most at-risk young people by focussing the right support at the right time.

“Year 9 Plus will make sure that students who may previously have dropped out of school are supported to continue their education,” says Ms Parata.

“It is targeted at students in their first year of secondary school and will follow them throughout their school education.”

Around 100 students from Wairoa to Hicks Bay identified as most at risk of needing help will receive extra support from an education champion. Champions will help young people to stay at school and achieve educational success.

“Champions will show students the value of education and the doors it can open for them,” says Ms Parata.

“They’ll do this by facilitating the development of young people, including through extra-curricular activities, as well as addressing any issues which are barriers to education – both in and out of school.

“Champions will work with the student’s family, school, community organisations and government agencies to ensure the student is well-supported to attend, stay and succeed at school. They’ll also work with the student’s siblings who may need similar support.”

The $2.2 million initiative will run from February 2016. It is anticipated that intervention in early secondary schooling will lead to positive changes in education outcomes, particularly retention, engagement and the attainment of NCEA Level 2.
