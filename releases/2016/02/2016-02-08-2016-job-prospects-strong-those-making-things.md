Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today released the 2016 Occupation Outlook report and mobile app which shows job prospects continue to be very good in highly skilled, fast growing industries such as high-tech manufacturing and ICT. 

“Software developers, ICT systems and business analysts, for example, are in high demand reflecting New Zealand’s growing technology software and services sector,” Mr Joyce says.

The fourth annual Occupation Outlook report contains all the information needed to help job seekers and students make good study and career decisions.

“The report and app bring together the latest information in an easy-to-use overview of job demand, likely income levels, and training requirements for different career pathways. This year we’ve also expanded the number of occupations from 50 to 60.

“The growth in Auckland, the ongoing Canterbury rebuild and other regional building activity means that there is steady work in the construction and infrastructure trades, with carpenters, joiners, project managers and architects all benefiting from increasing demand for their skills.

“We are still short of engineers in New Zealand. Job prospects are extremely good for civil, geotechnical and structural engineers, particularly in Auckland and Christchurch where large roading and infrastructure projects and building activity are fuelling demand.

“The Occupation Outlook provides current and relevant labour market information that is crucial in helping guide decisions for students and job seekers. It arms them with the information they need to carefully consider what career path they want to choose and what training they need to do to get there,” Mr Joyce says.

The Occupation Outlook app can be downloaded free from the App Store for iPhones and iPads, and the Google Play store for Android devices. The app also includes links to *Just the Job* occupation videos which bring to life what it is really like to work in particular occupations.

Included in this year's report are four special features: careers in the creative industries, on-the–job-training, management and defence forces.

The Occupation Outlook report is published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and draws on a wide range of information including:

- actual employment trends and other key statistics compiled by MBIE and Statistics New Zealand
- expertise from Careers NZ, tertiary institutions, industry associations, industry training organisations, licence and registration boards, and other industry stakeholders
- qualification completions and graduate income information from the Ministry of Education.

The 2016 mobile "Occupational Outlook" app can be downloaded at your app store.
