Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne travels to London today to present the Digital Leaders Network 2016 Annual Lecture.

This is a ministerial hosted event that takes place in Westminster, with a theme of meeting the demands and expectations of on-going digital transformation.

“As Minister of Internal Affairs, I have been invited to present the 2016 lecture, reflecting on the New Zealand journey of public sector digital transformation, encompassing topics such as New Zealand’s highly enviable online passports renewal scheme, and this Government’s Better Public Services Result areas,” Mr Dunne said.

“New Zealand and the UK share a lot of characteristics with in terms of digital transformation, and we have been undertaking extensive work collaboratively as co-founding member states of the Digital 5 Group, which also includes Estonia, South Korea, and Israel”.

“As a country we have a strong reputation as a home of great innovators, and I look forward to discussing and promoting New Zealand’s bold and impressive plans in the global digital economy,” Mr Dunne said.

“I have also been fortunate to secure several bilateral meetings with UK Cabinet Office counter-parts where I will undertake a range of discussions including digital government and Fire Services, and also in my Associate Health Minister capacity with Home Office representatives on topics of psychoactive substances and drug and alcohol policy”.

The lecture takes place on the evening of Tuesday 2nd March, and is expected to be televised by the BBC.
