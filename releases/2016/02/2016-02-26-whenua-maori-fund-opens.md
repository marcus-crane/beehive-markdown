Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell welcomes applications to the new Whenua Māori Fund. The fund will support owners and trustees of Māori land who are looking to improve their existing operations, diversify or prepare for new opportunities.

“Current use of whenua Māori by owners includes forestry, livestock, and dairy farming, or more diverse uses such as horticulture, viticulture, energy and tourism.

“Many of these newer commercial uses, such as producing mānuka honey, have their origins in traditional uses for the land. These are exciting developments and demonstrate the range of aspirations Māori land owners have for their land," says Mr Flavell.

The Whenua Māori Fund is now open for applications for Māori land projects that will:

• Assess land use capability

• Explore land potential/productivity

• Provide education and training for owners

• Identify land use options and improved land management practices

• Develop business and action plans; and

• Overcome constraints to Māori land development.

The Whenua Māori Fund will be managed by Te Puni Kōkiri. Māori land owners and trustees can find out more information from their regional Te Puni Kōkiri office or by going online to [www.tpk.govt.nz/whenuamaori](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/whenuamaori)

The fund provides $12.8 million over four years, including $3.2 million for applications in the current round. The Whenua Māori Fund is part of the wider work programme to give Māori landowners more say and control over what happens with their land.
