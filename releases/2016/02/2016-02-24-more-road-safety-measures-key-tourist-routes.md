Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says an additional 125 kilometres of centreline rumble strips on key tourist routes in Southland and Queenstown Lakes Districts will help keep all road users safe.

Mr Foss is visiting Invercargill today to meet the Southern Road Safety Influencing Group and local partners in the Visiting Drivers Signature Project (VDSP) — a partnership between central government, local government and the private sector.

The new rumble strips have been installed between Te Anau and the Fiordland National Park boundary on State Highway 94 and between Mossburn and Frankton on State Highway 97.

“The Government is committed to improving safety on all roads for all road users. Rumble strips are a simple yet effective way to help prevent crashes caused by inattention or fatigue,” Mr Foss says.

“These new rumble strips are in addition to the 50km of rumble strips between Queenstown and Milford Sound and 55km of rumble strips on State Highway 6 between Hokitika and Haast, all completed late last year.  There are now more than 350km of both centre and edge line rumble strips in the VDSP areas of Otago, Southland and the West Coast.

“The quantity and quality of measures rolled out under the VDSP are truly impressive.  Over the last year, project partners have launched initiatives targeting every stage of a visitor’s trip — planning, booking, in-flight, on arrival and on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

“While we still have some way to go, each new initiative builds on the last to create a safer overall system.

“This is about saving lives and preventing serious injuries.  I look forward to welcoming more initiatives throughout 2016.”
