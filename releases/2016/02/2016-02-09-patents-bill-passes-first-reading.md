Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Paul Goldsmith today welcomed the next step in establishing a single trans-Tasman patent attorney regime following the first reading of the Patents (Trans-Tasman Patent Attorneys and Other Matters) Amendment Bill.

“The Bill establishes a single joint registration regime for patent attorneys which will save them time and money as well as allow them to seamlessly practice in both Australia and New Zealand,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“The Bill will now be referred to the Commerce Select Committee for consideration and I encourage everyone with an interest to make submissions during this stage.

“Patent attorneys give specialist advice on the protection and exploitation of intellectual property rights and their occupational framework hasn’t been updated in over 60 years.

“The modern framework will include single qualification requirements, new professional standards and an accessible disciplinary regime which will give businesses increased confidence in the advice and services they receive.

“Currently most patent applications filed in New Zealand are also filed in Australia and undergo separate examination processes in both countries. The Bill introduces amendments to the Patents Act 2013 to reduce duplication by allowing for single patent application and examination processes between IP Australia and Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand.

“These changes are a small but significant step forward for our economic relationship with Australia and furthers the creation of a seamless trans-Tasman business environment,” Mr Goldsmith says.
