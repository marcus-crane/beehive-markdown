Prime Minister John Key has acknowledged the passing of leading Māori academic, commentator and writer Dr Ranginui Walker.

Dr Walker, who was of Te Whakatōhea descent, was appointed Professor and Head of Māori Studies at the University of Auckland in 1993. During his career, Dr Walker published a number of books and in 2009 received a Prime Minister’s Award for Literary Achievement for non-fiction work.

More recently, he made a significant contribution to the development of Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, and has been a member of the Waitangi Tribunal since 2003.

Dr Walker’s service to Māori was recognised in 2001 when he became a Distinguished Companion on the New Zealand Order of Merit.

“I am saddened to learn of Dr Walker’s passing,” says Mr Key.

“He was not only an insightful commentator on important historical and contemporary issues, but was a tireless and passionate advocate for Māori.

“I always enjoyed seeing Dr Walker, and felt privileged when he sent me copies of his work.

“Dr Walker was a leader by example, who will be missed by many. My thoughts are with his whānau and friends at this time.”
