More than 6,000 referrals have been made to an innovative post-release support programme for short- serving prisoners and remandees, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

The reintegration programme, called Out of Gate, commenced in 2013 with $10 million from the Justice Sector fund. Due to promising early results, Corrections was granted another $5 million from the Justice Sector Fund in Budget 2015 to extend the programme. Corrections contracts with providers to support offenders immediately upon their release from prison.

The focus is on employment, accommodation, education and training, living skills, health and wellbeing.

“At a practical level this may involve picking up the prisoner from prison or meeting them at their probation centre, setting up bank accounts, finding accommodation, helping write CVs and find jobs, and supporting offenders with health appointments.

“The first month after release is a crucial time when prisoners are at most risk of re-offending. Many short-serving prisoners cycle in and out of prison. This programme will give them every opportunity to stay crime-free.

“Out of Gate has been evaluated and it has been found that prisoners who took part have lower re-offending rates than those who didn’t.  This programme will help reduce re-offending and result in fewer victims of crime,” Ms Collins says.

There are two levels of service – standard, and intensive which is for younger prisoners with complex and challenging needs. Out of Gate is available nationwide.
