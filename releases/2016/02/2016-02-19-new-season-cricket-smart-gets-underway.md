Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has today launched a new season of Cricket Smart at Auckland’s Redoubt North Primary School.

“Cricket Smart is a range of curriculum-based learning and teaching resources for primary and intermediate students in Years 1 to 8. It’s a fun and interactive way to bring cricket into schools,” says Dr Coleman.

“Last year there was a strong uptake of Cricket Smart with 62 per cent (1,392) of eligible schools signing up. The programme is made up of both classroom and outdoor components where students can develop their cricket skills in the school yard.

“As well as helping children learn it also helps them develop a life-long love of sport and physical activity. The programme complements the wider work underway to tackle childhood obesity through the Childhood Obesity Plan.

“Cricket Smart was developed as part of the legacy from New Zealand’s co-hosting of the 2015 Cricket World Cup and is a great example of what the wider benefits can be of hosting major sporting events.

“The original programme had an emphases on the international aspect of the tournament, while the updated programme launched today has a greater focus on cricket in New Zealand.”

Dr Coleman and Blackcaps cricketer Ross Taylor and White Ferns cricketer Liz Perry today took part in a cricket game with a group of students and led a classroom cricket quiz.
