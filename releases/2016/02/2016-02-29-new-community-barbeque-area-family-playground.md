A new community barbecue area will be added to the Margaret Mahy Family Playground in the coming months thanks to the generosity of ANZCO Foods, Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Gerry Brownlee says. 

The community barbecue area will contain four electric barbecues as well as food preparation benches, a water supply and a landscaped seating area. It will be located in the north-eastern corner of the playground, bound by the Ōtākaro/Avon river and the carpark. 

“As more than 100,000 people have already visited the playground, I’m sure the barbecue area will be a welcome and popular addition for those using the area,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It’s fantastic that ANZCO Foods have made such a generous donation to the community. It has allowed CERA to work with them to design a great new space that will benefit all of Christchurch.

“The area will be available for both day-to-day use by the public as well as for organised events. It’s also been specifically designed to be accessible and safe for all users.”

ANZCO Food’s Managing Director Mark Clarkson is pleased that the company has been able to add to such a popular space.

“Fundraising for this project was an ANZCO employee initiative following the 2011 earthquake,” Mr Clarkson says.

“Our employees, customers, Westland Milk Products and suppliers have been delighted to support it and the company has matched what was raised dollar for dollar. Our employees feel that donating the barbecue area to the playground is a meaningful way for them to contribute to the Canterbury rebuild.

“We are excited to be working with CERA to make sure that we create a real asset for the community. We look forward to seeing it installed and ready to be used.”

Work will begin on the community barbecue area soon and it will be ready to be opened in the Spring.
