Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew today congratulated Fonterra on the opening of their new mozzarella plant at Fonterra’s Clandeboye site. The new plant will result in 25 new jobs and a doubling of Fonterra’s total mozzarella production to 50,000 metric tonnes per annum, over two plants.

The Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) programme “Transforming the Dairy Value Chain” helped Fonterra to commercialise their patented, breakthrough technology for producing frozen mozzarella cheese in a fraction of the usual time - without sacrificing functionality for their customers or sensory qualities for the end consumers. This technology will help to grow Fonterra’s Foodservice business in the $35 billion global pizza market.

“The Government has a goal of doubling the value of exports by 2025. Around half our exports are food, so our food safety systems are closely linked to this goal”, said Mrs Goodhew.

“From hygiene to x-ray machines, a food safety culture involves the demonstration and practice of food safety values and behaviours across a whole organisation, from senior management through to front-line staff.

“I commend Fonterra’s commitment to improving food safety and standards of quality, reliability and traceability. The expansion of the Clandeboye plant and initiatives such as these help to create a business environment that delivers more jobs, higher business investment and higher wages. I’d like to congratulate Fonterra for reaching this milestone.”

**Notes for editors:**

Transforming the Dairy Value Chain is one of the biggest PGP programmes, with $85 million in funding from the Government and $86 million from industry. It is helping build capability and knowledge in the sector, including new food research and training.

**About the Primary Growth Partnership**

- The PGP aims to boost the value, productivity and profitability of our primary sector through investment between government and industry. It provides an essential springboard to enable New Zealand to stay at the forefront of primary sector innovation.
- Government and industry are co-investing $746 million over time into 21 PGP programmes (2 completed and 19 underway).
- Decisions on whether or not to approve a programme are made by Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries, under recommendation from the independent Investment Advisory Panel (IAP).
- PGP programmes are generally long-run programmes of five to seven years’ duration and are subject to oversight and monitoring by an independent Investment Advisory Panel and MPI.
- Monitoring requirements include programme steering groups, quarterly progress reporting, annual plans, financial audits, and progress reviews, along with evaluation of the overall programme.  Government funding is only released to programmes on receipt of invoices for work completed in accordance with programme plans.
