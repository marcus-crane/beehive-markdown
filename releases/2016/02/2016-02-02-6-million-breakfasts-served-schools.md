Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says that with students returning to school, the six millionth Kickstart breakfast will be served this week since the Government expanded the programme.

“More than 27,000 school-age children sit down to a bowl of breakfast at more than 800 schools across the country every school week,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Feedback from schools is overwhelmingly positive, with 99.5 per cent of schools satisfied or very satisfied with the Kickstart Breakfast programme.

“Schools have also reported that general health, concentration and behaviour has improved.

“I want to thank all of the volunteers who help out every morning, making sure our children and young people get the right start to their school day. I also want to acknowledge the work of our partners Sanitarium and Fonterra.

“In 2013 the Government provided $9.5 million over five years to expand the programme from 2 to 5 mornings per week and to any school that wants or needs it, regardless of decile. Since then we’ve seen a 46 per cent increase in the number of schools participating.

“An underspend of around $1.1 million last year means the Government has also been able to fund the Nitbusters programme in 2016, which provides free head lice treatment to families in low decile schools.

“Last year schools involved in the programme reported a 16 per cent reduction in the number of children needing treatment for head lice alongside increased attendance, as fewer kids have to stay at home or be sent home.

“I’m delighted that both of these programmes are giving young Kiwis the chance to make the most of their schooling.”
