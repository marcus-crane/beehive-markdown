Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC is in Washington D.C. this week to attend the annual Five Country Ministerial and Attorneys-General Quintet meetings.

The Five Country Ministerial brings together ministers from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand to discuss a range of national security issues, including counter-terrorism, countering violent extremism and cyber-security.

The Attorneys-General Quintet, now in its seventh year, brings together the Attorneys-General of the same five countries to share approaches to legal issues. This year’s meeting will include a session led by Australia and New Zealand focusing on protection of individual liberties and the rule of law, particularly in relation to national security legislation.

“Both meetings provide a useful opportunity for New Zealand to engage with our partners on topics of common interest,” said Mr Finlayson. “Our countries are dealing with a number of similar issues, many of them with cross-border aspects, which underscores the importance of working together to address them.”

A communique will be issued at the conclusion of the meetings.
