Provisional NCEA data showing student achievement is continuing to rise has been welcomed by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“Education is more important than ever before and these results show more of our kids than ever are gaining the qualifications they need at school,” says Ms Parata.

The provisional roll-based data shows Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 NCEA achievement rates rose by between 0.4 and 1.8 percentage points last year to 73.2, 75.8 and 62 per cent respectively. Over the same period the proportion of Year 13 students gaining University Entrance increased 1.2 percentage points to 47.3 per cent.

Further increases are likely before the results are finalised as schools update and provide late internally assessed results, and learners apply for review and reconsideration of their results.  

“The latest results are a tribute to the hard work of students, teachers, parents and wider whānau,” says Ms Parata. “They show that since we took office in 2008 Level 2 achievement rates have risen 15 per cent. That means thousands more of our young people are leaving school every year with the skills and qualifications they need to succeed.  

“We have challenged all those involved in education to continue to lift their game and they have responded in spectacular fashion.

“However, there is more to be done. We will not be satisfied until all our students are receiving the education they need.”  

***Notes***

Roll-based measures of achievement count all students who enrol in year 11, 12 or 13 regardless of whether or not they attempt to achieve NCEA. Participation-based measures count only students who have enrolled for sufficient credits to gain an NCEA level certificate.
