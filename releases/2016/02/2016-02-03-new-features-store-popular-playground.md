Christchurch’s hugely popular new Margaret Mahy Family Playground will have even more exciting features added in the coming months, says Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Nicky Wagner.

“Since the playground opened just before Christmas, we estimate that well over 100,000 people have visited, and the feedback has on the whole been extremely positive,” Ms Wagner says.

“It’s not just the kids having a great time, but parents and grandparents as well. With more people visiting the central city, the playground is great for local businesses like those in New Regent Street too.

“With the school year beginning this week, we expect less demand on the playground. But starting in mid-February more playground equipment will be installed, including climbing towers and an 8.2 metre high spiral slide. There will be also be new shaded areas for people to relax under.

“These new features will be ready to use in early Autumn, and their construction will not affect access to the playground.

“Users of the playground have provided a range of feedback and some of it is helping us to make tweaks and adjustments to make it an even better experience. We always envisaged we would make improvements over time as people had used the playground, and we will continue to listen to what people have to say.

“The Margaret Mahy Family Playground is one of the largest outdoor playgrounds in the world, and it’s particularly special because the design was inspired by the wonderful ideas the region’s children submitted as part of the BNZ Amazing Place Competition,” Ms Wagner says.
