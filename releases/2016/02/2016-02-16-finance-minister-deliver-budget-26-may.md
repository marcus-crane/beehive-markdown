Finance Minister Bill English today confirmed Budget 2016 will be delivered on Thursday 26 May and will be focused on delivering policies that support more jobs, higher incomes and opportunities for New Zealanders.

“This will be the National-led Government’s eighth Budget and it will deliver further policies to support a resilient and confident economy.”

Mr English says that while there are a number of positive signs in the domestic economy, there is still a lot of work to do.

“An additional 175,000 jobs were created in the last three years, and the average annual wage is up by almost $11,000 since National came into office. Unemployment has fallen to 5.3 per cent and we are focused on bringing it lower.

“Budget 2016 will be about building on that success and ensuring that New Zealand families continue to see the benefits of a stronger economy.”

Mr English says there will be no let-up in the Government’s ongoing commitment to spending restraint after achieving a surplus in 2014/15.

“We’ve managed to turn an $18.4 billion deficit in 2011 into a $414 million surplus in 2015, but our focus is now on paying down debt built up following the Global Financial Crisis and Canterbury Earthquakes.”
