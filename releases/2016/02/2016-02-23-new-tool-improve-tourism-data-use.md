A new online one-stop-shop for tourism data will help businesses and regions take advantage of unprecedented growth in the industry, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The New Zealand Tourism Dashboard brings together a range of tourism datasets produced by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Statistics New Zealand.

“Between the record number of international visitors coming to our shores and New Zealanders getting out and seeing more of their own backyard, there are immense tourism business opportunities all over New Zealand,” says Mrs Bennett.

“This new tool is a fantastic, easy-to-use resource to help entrepreneurs visualise opportunities for new investment and job creation.”

Information is presented using dynamic graphs and data tables so users can easily look at trends in tourism growth.

“Tourism is central to the Government’s goal to increase exports and grow a more diverse economy. The Dashboard makes it simple for the public to use the tourism data that the Government relies on to understand the industry,” Mrs Bennett says.

2015 was also a record year for tourism, with 3.13 million people visiting, up 10 per cent on 2014. Tourism now directly contributes $10.6 billion to the economy, nearly 5 per cent of our GDP.
