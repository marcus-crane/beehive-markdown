Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today announced eight new generation eGates have been installed at Wellington International Airport and are fully operational for arriving and departing passengers.

“Eight new eGates are available to New Zealand, Australian, US, UK, and Canadian ePassport holders arriving and departing in Wellington,” says Ms Wagner.

“The next-generation eGates give travellers the option of completing Customs checks using the one-step electronic process,” Ms Wagner says “The new eGates are faster taking around 25 seconds.”

“The installation of the new eGates coincides with Wellington International Airport’s wider terminal expansion project, and will help meet the increase in travellers expected next month with the arrival of new flights to the Capital from Singapore.”

“The government’s $6.6 million investment from Budget 2015 into expanding and modernising automated passport processing will help manage growth in traveller volumes by allowing legitimate passengers to complete Customs checks easily, and enabling Customs officers to focus on high risk travellers.

“In total, 29 new eGates will be installed and 22 eGates replaced as part of a national programme which started late last year in Auckland. The next stage will take place in Christchurch in time for Christmas,” says Ms Wagner.
