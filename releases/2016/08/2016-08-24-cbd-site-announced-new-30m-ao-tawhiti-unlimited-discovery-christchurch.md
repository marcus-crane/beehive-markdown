The new site for Christchurch school Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery will be 177 St Asaph Street, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The purchase of a new site means Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery, which was formed by the merger of inner city schools Discovery One and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti but has been operating from temporary sites outside the inner city, can now return home to the CBD,” says Ms Kaye.

Ms Kaye visited Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery’s current Ilam site this afternoon with Christchurch Central MP Nicky Wagner to announce its new home.

“The new CBD site is great news, because the school’s approach to learning involves taking advantage of ready access to the amenities and experiences that an inner city location offers.”

Ms Kaye acknowledges that it has taken some time to find the right site for the new campus.

“I’d like to thank the school’s Director and Board for their patience and cooperation during this time.

“The Ministry of Education has worked closely with the school to identify a site that best meets its needs now and into the future.

“Now that the site has been secured, we can progress to the next stage and get design work for the new facilities underway.

“This is a huge, $30 million investment that will result in an amazing physical environment, which reflects Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery’s unique approach to learning as a special character school.

“The school’s vision is based on students directing their own learning, as well as family-like relationships between the school, parents, whanau and members of the wider community, who are heavily involved in school life and delivering the curriculum.

“I know the Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery community will be thrilled with today’s news, which is a big step towards bringing their special vision to life in their new home.

“Today is a big day for education in Christchurch and the revitalisation of the city’s CBD.

“The $30 million investment in Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery will be in addition to more than $276 million announced for Canterbury school infrastructure as part of this year’s Budget.

“We’re committed to building new schools and classrooms to meet growth in Canterbury, as well as ensuring that the 10-year Christchurch schools rebuild programme, aimed at rebuilding and renewing 115 schools, is on-track.

“Budget 2016 set aside $882.5 million for school infrastructure nationwide. In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government.”

Building work on the new Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery school is planned to start in 2017, with the new facilities expected to be in use by early 2019.

As with any new school or major school redevelopment, the focus will be on creating an innovative learning environment, with flexible learning spaces that support different approaches to teaching and learning.

**Notes**

**About Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery**

Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery is a special character co-educational state school catering for years 1 to 13 students. The new school will be built to accommodate a roll of 670.

**About special character schools**

A special character school is a state school with a particular character that sets it apart from ordinary state schools and kura kaupapa Maori. Parental acceptance of the school’s particular character is a requirement for all students enrolling at a special character school.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
