The nearly 1100 dwelling consents issued in Auckland in July shows New Zealand’s building boom is continuing to gather momentum, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“In Auckland, our greatest area of housing need, consents were issued for 1087 dwellings in July – up 18 per cent on June – while the 9622 issued for the year to July was 12 per cent higher than the previous year.

“Nationally, the 29,084 consents issued for the year to July was a 13 per cent increase on the previous year, while the 2811 issued during the month was 2 per cent up on June.

“The regions are also enjoying increased activity; 2398 homes were consented in the Bay of Plenty for the year (up 52 per cent), 3464 in the Waikato region for the year (up 37 percent) and 1593 in Otago (up 21 per cent).

“The value of residential and commercial building work is also booming and hit an all-time record of $18.5 billion for the year to July, up from $15.6 billion the previous year. Of this, $6.3 billion was non-residential, and half of that was for education buildings such as at Victoria, Canterbury and Otago universities.

“In Auckland, the total of all building work increased 32 per cent to $6.9 billion for the year, while residential increased 29 per cent to $4.4 billion.

“This Government’s Comprehensive Housing Plan is tackling housing shortages while ensuring we maintain a high standard of building work. These independent statistics show our approach of getting on and doing the job is working.”
