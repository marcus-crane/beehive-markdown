More than 2.3 million vehicles have travelled on the Tauranga Eastern Link since it opened a year ago - close to 40 per cent more than predicted, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

The 21km four-lane highway is the Bay of Plenty’s biggest roading project ever with seven bridges, the country’s biggest roundabout and a 6.8km cycleway.

It is one of seven Roads of National Significance identified by the Government as being crucial to building New Zealand’s economy. It opened to traffic a year ago today after being officially opened by Prime Minister John Key and Minister Bridges.

“The $455 million road is a key regional highway connecting Tauranga with the Eastern Bay of Plenty. One year after its completion, the benefits of this investment are obvious. On average 8000 vehicles travel on the new highway every day, a total of more than 2.3 million so far. This far exceeds our original expectations,” Mr Bridges says.

The new highway replaces a stretch of State Highway 2 that was ranked fourth most dangerous in the country in terms of crashes. It now has a five star safety rating, the highest in New Zealand.

“In the five years before the Tauranga Eastern Link opened, there were seven fatalities and 37 serious injuries. In the year since it has opened, there have been zero fatalities and only two serious injuries,” Mr Bridges says.

It has also reduced travel times through the region.

“Data shows that the average travel time on the TEL is nine minutes, compared to 15-18 minutes on the alternative route, the Te Puke Highway. At peak times drivers are saving 10 to 15 minutes by using the TEL,” Mr Bridges says.

“This highway was designed to open up this region, help grow industry and jobs, improve safety and support economic development and growth. A year ago today I described the TEL as a game changer and that is certainly proving to be the case,” Mr Bridges says.
