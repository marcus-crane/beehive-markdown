Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston today opened feedback on dog control rules. From 1 August through to 14 August you can share your views on how to reduce dog attacks.

Ms Upston says “our dog control laws value the role of dogs as pets, companions, and valued contributors to sectors of our economy and this will continue to be the case. But we need to find ways to reduce the danger posed by high-risk dogs and irresponsible dog owners.”

“I want to hear about ideas for action at all levels: what can be done by the Government, councils, dog owners themselves, and others to ensure people can feel safe in our communities” says Ms Upston.

“We’re particularly keen to hear ideas that focus on high-risk dogs and irresponsible owners rather than penalising all dogs and their owners.”
