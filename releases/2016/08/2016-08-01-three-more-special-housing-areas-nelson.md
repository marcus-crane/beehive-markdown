The Government has approved three new Special Housing Areas (SHAs) for Nelson, bringing the number in the area to 13 with the potential for up to 484 homes, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Average house prices in the Nelson region have increased by 10 per cent in the past year and we need to increase supply. The issues are not as acute as in Auckland but we need to grow out with greenfields development and also make provision for townhouses and apartments.

“There are people who are opposed to changes in their neighbourhoods but this cannot override the wider public good of increasing housing supply. The long-term consequences of not increasing supply are increased prices, lower home ownership and increased homelessness.

The new SHAs, approved by Cabinet on Monday, are:

- Wakefield Quay, a brownfield site with the potential for 12 homes.
- Haven Road, a brownfield site with the potential for 30 homes.
- Farleigh, a greenfield site expected to provide 19 homes.

“Amendments to two existing Nelson SHAs, at Ocean Lodge and Barcelona Lofts, have also been approved and allow for an extra storey within the existing height limits on the proposed development at each site,” Dr Smith says

The Nelson Housing Accord, signed by Dr Smith and Nelson Mayor Rachel Reese on 11 June 2015, provides for quicker zoning and consenting processes. Resource consents for developments on these new SHAs will have to be lodged by 16 September.

“SHAs are about overcoming the slow process that can take up to seven years to change zoning of land for residential development. It is not a guarantee that development will occur as the land owner still needs to secure the private investment and council consents to construct the homes.

“SHAs, the National Policy Statement on Urban Development, Resource Management Act reforms, increased apprenticeships and investment in housing infrastructure, as well as reforms to the Building Act, are all part of the Government’s response. The Government is also revising the HomeStart scheme to help first home buyers.”

Nationwide there are now 213 SHAs with the capacity to provide more than 70,000 new homes.
