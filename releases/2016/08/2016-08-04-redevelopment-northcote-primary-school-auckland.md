The Government will invest around $5.7 million towards the redevelopment of Northcote Primary School on Auckland’s North Shore, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This redevelopment will see the construction of a brand new, two-storey teaching block,” says Ms Kaye.

Minister Kaye made the announcement at the school this morning with local MP Dr Jonathan Coleman.

“Northcote Primary School has a number of old classrooms which are in poor condition and need replacing,” says Ms Kaye.

“At the same time, the school’s roll has grown and extra classrooms are needed to accommodate that growth.

“The redevelopment will see six existing classrooms demolished and replaced, and the school will also receive two additional classrooms. All of the new teaching spaces will be situated in the brand new two-storey block.

“The new classrooms will take the total number of teaching spaces at the school from 18 to 20.

“Northcote Primary School is situated on a relatively small site, so building up to two-storeys will enable the school to preserve valuable outdoor recreational space.

“Alongside the Government-funded property work, the school’s Board also has other property work underway or planned, including new administration facilities and netball courts. Where possible, the Ministry is ensuring that this additional work can be included in the redevelopment project.

“I’d like to acknowledge the school and community who have been working closely with the Ministry of Education on their vision for the school. It has taken some time to get to this solution, so it’s great that the project now has the green light and the school’s vision is set to become a reality.”

Construction of the new teaching block is expected to begin in September, with the first new classrooms ready in the third term of next year, and full completion by the end of 2017.

“This project is part of extensive work underway across Auckland to upgrade and expand the capacity of the city’s schools.

“This year’s Budget set aside $882.5 million for school infrastructure. Around $153 million of that will be invested in school property in greater Auckland, and this comes on top of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars invested by the Government over the past two years to upgrade and grow Auckland schools.

“In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government.”

As with any school redevelopment, the focus at Northcote Primary School will be on creating an innovative learning environment, including flexible learning spaces that can support different ways of teaching and learning.

**Notes**

**About Northcote Primary School**

Northcote Primary School is a contributing (years 1 - 6) primary school on the North Shore of Auckland. It has a current roll of around 450 students. The school’s capacity once the redevelopment is completed will be around 500 students.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
