Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the Sustainable Seas National Science Challenge will fund eight new scientific research projects through the Challenge’s new Innovation Fund.

“The Sustainable Seas Challenge team looked for proposals that would improve environmental outcomes while adding value to our marine economy,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is an important balance for the Challenge and one that enables innovation in the development of a productive and resilient marine environment and in marine-focused research and development.”

The Sustainable Seas innovation fund offers up to $1.5 million a year to support projects each up to a value of $150,000 per year for two years.

“These new projects will help the Challenge aim of enhancing the use of New Zealand’s marine resources, as well as helping New Zealanders to better understand and manage the oceans surrounding us. I look forward to the results that will come from this science,” Mr Joyce says.

The successful projects are:

- Maketu Estuary case: analysis and evaluation of the strategy and implementation of the co-governance group Te Maru o Kaituna, to restore the Ongatoro/Maketu Estuary (Waikato University).
- Submarine canyons: comparing coastal-derived plant material to the sediment and food webs of the high productivity Kaikoura Canyon and low productivity Hokitika Canyon using compound-specific stable istope analyses. (NIWA)
- Seabirds: examining how seabird location data can be used to improve understanding of seabird distributions. (NIWA)
- Taranaki shelf:   Determining the effects on deep-shelf benthic communities caused by human activities, such as seabed mining and fishing. (NIWA)
- Marine biodiversity: establishing and testing an innovative, cost efficient strategy for quantifying marine biodiversity using environmental DNA extracted from marine water samples. (University of Otago)
- Re-use of offshore infrastructure: studying the potential risks and benefits to the environments of in situ marine structures and whether they may bring value to communities. (Elemental Environment)
- Coastal acidification: to conduct a feasibility study of coastal acidification mitigation strategies for the mussel industry. (NIWA/University of Otago)
- Near real-time forecasting: using operational oceanographic forecasting to respond to changes in coastal conditions and contamination risk to reduce commercial shellfish harvest and beach closures. (Cawthron Institute/NIWA)

Sustainable Seas is one of New Zealand’s 11 National Science Challenges. These Challenges are designed to take a more strategic approach to the government's science investment by targeting a series of goals, which, if achieved, would have major and enduring benefits for New Zealand.

The Sustainable Seas objectives are to:

- Engage with New Zealanders to understand the cultural, spiritual, economic and environmental values of our marine environment.
- Investigate and describe the impacts of natural and human stresses on marine ecosystems.
- Overcome impediments to enhanced resource use.
- Uphold commitment towards Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the sharing of information, resources and opportunities, as well as learning, action and shared decision-making.
