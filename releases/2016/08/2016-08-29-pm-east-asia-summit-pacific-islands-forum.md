Prime Minister John Key will travel to Laos next week for the East Asia Summit, before heading to the Federated States of Micronesia for the Pacific Islands Forum.

“The East Asia Summit brings together leaders from across the Asia-Pacific to discuss ways to address important regional and international issues including maritime security and counter terrorism,” Mr Key says.

“It also provides an excellent opportunity to meet with the leaders of some of our most important economic and security partners to further those ties.” 

In Vientiane Mr Key will meet with Prime Minister Thongloun of Laos.

“Our two countries already share a strong relationship, working together on important issues like the removal of unexploded ordnance and tourism development in Laos. I look forward to building on that further.”

Mr Key will then travel to Pohnpei to attend the 47th annual Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting.

“Discussions at this year’s Forum will focus on key regional issues, including climate change, economic integration and sustainable fisheries management,” Mr Key says.

“New Zealand values the opportunity to meet with our Pacific partners to build on our efforts to address the issues affecting our region.”

Mr Key leaves for Laos on September 6, returning on September 11.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully will also attend the Pacific Islands Forum.
