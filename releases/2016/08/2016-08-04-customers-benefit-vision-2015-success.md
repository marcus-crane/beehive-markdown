Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today welcomed two reports which show the learnings of Immigration New Zealand’s successful Vision 2015 programme in being recognised  as a trusted partner, delivering outstanding immigration services and bringing in the best people New Zealand needs in order to prosper.

Vision 2015 was launched in March 2012 and formally closed in June this year with the successful launch of a new state-of-the-art identity management system that enables face photos and fingerprint information from applicants to be captured online and automatically matched against personal data already held by INZ.

“Vision 2015 has transformed services for customers with the deployment of Immigration ONLINE that allows online applications for student, work and visitor visas,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“More than 80,000 online applications have already been received and many online applicants can now apply for a visa without having to send in their passports.

“More than 40 Visa Application Centres have been set up all over the world to give customers a better service and trusted partnerships have been established with tourism providers to enable the facilitation of high-value, low-risk visa applicants.”

The reports released today identify active senior leadership as the single most decisive factor in the success of the Vision 2015 programme and provide learnings that will help other public sector agencies considering their own business transformations.

The two reports are available:
