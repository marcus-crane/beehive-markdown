Keeping up progress on global climate action and sharing insights about New Zealand’s efforts to reduce emissions will be the focus of Climate Change Issues Minister Paula Bennett’s visit to Canberra this week.

Mrs Bennett will meet with several Australian Federal Ministerial counterparts, including Foreign Affairs Minister Hon Julie Bishop; Environment and Energy Minister Hon Josh Frydenberg; and Industry, Innovation and Science Minister Hon Greg Hunt. She will also meet with Shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy Hon Mark Butler.

“The Trans Tasman relationship is incredibly important, and we have many mutual interests when it comes to advocating for global climate change interests,” Mrs Bennett says.

“I’m looking forward to discussing New Zealand’s investments in agricultural research and energy efficiency, and reinforcing our commitment to ratify the Paris agreement this year.”

Mrs Bennett will also discuss the social housing and the Government’s Social Investment approach to welfare with Social Services Minister Hon Christian Porter and Finance Minister Hon Mathias Cormann.

“The Government has made huge strides in improving how our most vulnerable people are supported. Every country’s circumstances are different, but I am pleased to share our insights with my Australian counterparts,” Mrs Bennett says.
