Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the bowel screening national roll-out programme is on track with Cabinet approving the business case.

“Around 3,000 Kiwis are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year, and it’s the second most common cause of cancer death,” says Dr Coleman.

“We know that screening saves lives by detecting cancers at an early stage. Once fully implemented the national bowel screening programme is likely to screen over 700,000 people aged between 60 and 74 every two years.

“Approximately 500-700 cancers each year are expected to be detected during the early screening rounds.

“Cabinet’s approval of the business case confirms that the national roll-out programme for bowel screening remains on track, starting with Hutt Valley and Wairarapa DHBs next year.

“In line with international best practice for adoption of national screening programmes, a progressive roll-out is being adopted.

“This will be New Zealand’s first national cancer screening programme for both men and women.”

Budget 2016 invests $39.3 million for national bowel screening, starting with Hutt Valley and Wairarapa DHBs in 2017.

Additional funding has also been set aside in contingency to enable the IT support required for a national screening programme.

More than 80 per cent of cancers found through the Waitemata pilot were in those aged 60 to 74. Screening in this age range will maximise the number of cancers found while minimising the cases where problems are not found.
