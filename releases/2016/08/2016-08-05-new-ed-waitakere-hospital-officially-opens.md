Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s opening of Waitemata DHB’s new $9.8 million Emergency Department (ED) at Waitakere Hospital. Minister Paula Bennett officially opened the facility.

“The new fit-for-purpose ED at Waitakere Hospital is almost double in size, creating the extra capacity needed to meet the future needs of the local community,” says Dr Coleman.

“Last year Waitakere Hospital’s ED treated nearly 50,000 patients – a significant increase on the 17,000 patients treated in its first year of operation back in 2005.

“The new facility will enable Waitakere Hospital to provide faster, high quality integrated care for patients.

“A new front of house area has increased the number of consultation cubicles from five to ten. The new facility includes a new triage, reception, and resuscitation areas, four ambulance bays, separate adult and paediatric waiting rooms, and a purpose built family area.”

Waitemata DHB is receiving an extra $51 million in new money this year, taking the DHB’s total funding to $1.5 billion for 2016/17. That’s an extra $409 million in funding over the last eight years.

The redevelopment is one of several projects in Waitemata DHB’s 10-year plan to ensure they meet the future needs of the local community:

- He Puna Wāiora – a new 46-bed mental health services inpatient unit.
- Hine Ora – a dedicated 15-bed women’s health ward.
- North Shore Hospital Sky Bridge – links the Elective Surgery Centre with the main hospital building.
- Expansion of outpatient services at North Shore Hospital is underway.
- Expansion of North Shore Hospital’s short stay ward and inpatient cardiology procedures expected to begin in 2017.
