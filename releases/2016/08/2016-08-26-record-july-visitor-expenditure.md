Winter 2016 continues to break records with visitors spending the most they ever have in every region for the month of July, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The latest Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates released today shows domestic and international visitors spent over $1.7 billion last month, up $288 million from June 2016 and $69 million compared to July 2015.

Every region showed an increase in expenditure for the year to July 2016. Nelson posted the largest increase, with 11 per cent over the year to $302 million, followed by Otago (up 11 per cent to $3.2 billion) and Auckland (up 7 per cent to $6.7 billion).

“Today’s results reinforce what I see when I travel around the country – smart, innovative people providing outstanding local experiences for visitors from other parts of New Zealand and abroad,” Mrs Bennett says.  

“It’s no secret tourism is booming, and the Government is incredibly pleased all parts of New Zealand are benefiting. We remain absolutely committed to encouraging further growth in the sector.

“The Government’s $3 million annual Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund, to help communities with their smaller infrastructure needs, is now open for applications.

“Changes to the Tourism Growth Partnership will also see half of the $8 million annual fund made available exclusively for projects in the regions.
