Minister for Ethnic Communities Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced the opening of the funding round for the new Ethnic Communities Development Fund (ECDF).

“The new contestable fund provides $520,000 annually to enable ethnic communities to be stronger, more cohesive and resilient. It is important that all ethnic people have a sense of belonging and participation in New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The priorities of the fund are to support leadership development, social cohesion and cultural events.

“The ECDF replaces the Settling In Fund and is designed to better support the ongoing needs of ethnic people,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The fund promotes diversity and inclusiveness through ethnic communities. It also supports two key government strategies – the New Zealand Migrant Settlement and Integration Strategy and the Refugee Resettlement Strategy.”

The funding round opened yesterday and closes on 27 September 2016. Any not-for-profit group can apply.
