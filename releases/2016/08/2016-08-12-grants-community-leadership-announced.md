Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced the first group of grant recipients from the new Community Leadership Fund – Hapori Whakatipu.

“It is fantastic to see such a range of recipients being assisted to improve the sustainability and resilience of the Community and Voluntary Sector,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The new fund has the express purpose of strengthening leadership and capability building across the community and voluntary sector and has priorities that support collaboration and connection across the sector, social enterprise, volunteering, and community led-development.

This year’s allocation of $500,000 was distributed among six organisations; Ara Taiohi Incorporated, Hui E! Community Aotearoa, Ākina Foundation, Inspiring Communities Trust, Volunteer Army Foundation and Volunteering New Zealand.

“Whether it be nurturing the capability and leadership of organisations working in youth development, growing social enterprise, promoting community led development or engaging the volunteers of the future, these efforts to strengthen collaboration and leadership across the sector will all contribute to the strong and resilient communities of the future,” Mrs Goodhew says.
