Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Stephen Payton as New Zealand’s next ambassador to Japan.

“New Zealand has long-standing and strong ties with Japan, underpinned by a close network of personal and business relationships,” Mr McCully says.

“A major focus for the Ambassador will be on helping to promote New Zealand interests in the areas of food and agriculture, security, and energy.

“Japan will host the Rugby World Cup in 2019 and the Olympics in 2020. Both these events will provide an opportunity to strengthen links between our two counties at all levels,” Mr McCully says”

Mr Payton has served as Director of the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei.  He speaks Japanese and was previously New Zealand’s Consul General in Osaka.
