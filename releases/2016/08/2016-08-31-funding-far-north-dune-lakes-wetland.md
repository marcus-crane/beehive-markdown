Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell have today announced funding of $320,000 for the restoration of two Far North dune lakes and a wetland.

“Lake Wahakari, the Waiparera Wetland and the Rotoroa/Split lakes are all of ecological significance and are currently at risk from various land use activities,” Dr Smith says.

“The Government is committed to improving the quality of these lakes and wetland. This funding will go towards a project run by Te Hiku o Te Ika Iwi Development Trust which will work towards their long-term restoration, enhancement and protection through native planting, weed and pest control and fencing.”

The Government funding of $320,000 comes from the Te Mana o Te Wai Fund, which was announced as part of Budget 2014 in partnership with the Māori Party. It provides $5 million over two years to support iwi and hapū-led initiatives to improve the quality of local freshwater systems. Reconnecting Northland will also contribute $80,000 to the two-year, $409,000 project.

Mr Flavell says involving iwi and hapū is both valuable and crucial.

“As tangata whenua, local hapū and iwi are in a strong position to help protect and improve the water quality of the area’s dune lakes and wetland. The basis of Te Mana o Te Wai is that healthy waterways support healthy environments, which in turn supports healthy whānau,” he says.

“Iwi and hapū play important roles in improving our country’s freshwater. Through partnership and collaboration with government departments and agencies, positive and lasting gains will be made.”
