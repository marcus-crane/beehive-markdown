Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced Michael Upton as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Kiribati.

“New Zealand and Kiribati have a strong relationship and we work closely in areas of sustainable economic development, fisheries cooperation, water and sanitation, climate change, and maritime safety,” Mr McCully says.

“The High Commissioner will be responsible for overseeing New Zealand’s aid programme in Kiribati, which will total around $17 million this year.

“A major focus is working to address the impacts of overcrowding in South Tarawa, where about half of Kiribati’s population live, and improving waste management, water and sanitation.

“Kiribati faces some major challenges that will only be made worse by climate change. We are currently considering a major programme of investment, alongside other donors, that will help address these issues and offer the people of Kiribati some protection against rising sea levels and King tides,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Upton has extensive experience working across the Pacific region and is currently First Secretary at the New Zealand High Commission in Samoa.
