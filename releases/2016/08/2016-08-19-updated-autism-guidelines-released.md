Minister of Education Hekia Parata and Associate Minister of Health Peseta Sam Lotu-liga today welcomed the release of the 2016 edition of the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Guideline.

The Guideline, launched at the Autism New Zealand Conference held in Wellington, is based on the most up-to-date information available and aims to improve the health, education and social outcomes for people with autism.

"We welcome the release of the 2016 Guideline, which demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to helping improve the lives of New Zealanders on the Autism spectrum," Ms Parata says.

"We encourage those providing services and supporting individuals with ASD to use the information in the Guideline to aid informed decision making."

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the Ministries of Health and Education have been working together to ensure people with ASD, and their families, receive relevant and co-ordinated services.

"This is the world's first living guideline in this area and acknowledges the whole of a person's life, from early identification and support to helping adults with ASD to live in the community," Minister Lotu-Iiga says.

"The Guideline helps us better understand how to support people with ASD and their families. It also provides a framework to improve services based on the most recent and reliable evidence available."

The Guideline has had input from individuals with ASD, parents of children with ASD, medical practitioners, educational and community providers, government agencies and researchers. It will be regularly updated to reflect new evidence and changing user needs.

"In April 2014 the Ministry of Health clarified the eligibility criteria for people with ASD, enabling them to access Disability Support Services. This means that where ever a person with ASD lives in New Zealand they can get help," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
