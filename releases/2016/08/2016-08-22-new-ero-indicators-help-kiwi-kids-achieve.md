Education Minister Hekia Parata has today officially launched the Education Review Office’s new school evaluation indicators which identify effective practices to achieve equity and excellence for all children.

“Achieving equity and excellence for every child and young person at school can be a challenge for our education system,” says Ms Parata.

“The insights that the indicators will provide schools will act as a catalyst for change so that every Kiwi kid can achieve educational success.”

ERO’s *School Evaluation Indicators: Effective practice for improvement and learner success* were developed and reviewed with expert advisers and draw on the best evidence of what really works to achieve equity and excellence in a New Zealand context.

The six domains that form the evaluation indicators and have been identified as having the most significant influence on improving student outcomes are:

- Stewardship
- Leadership
- Educationally powerful connections and relationships
- Responsive curriculum, effective teaching and opportunities to learn
- Professional capability and collective capacity
- Evaluation, inquiry and knowledge building for improvement and innovation.

The domains reflect the vision of The New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa that all young people are successful "confident, connected, actively involved, lifelong learners".

“The domains are interdependent and success relies on all of them, not just one. Our best performing schools display all of these characteristics now, so we know others can too,” says Ms Parata.

ERO uses the [School Evaluation Indicators](http://www.ero.govt.nz/publications/school-evaluation-indicators/) in all its school reviews.
