Around 240 people have dined on meals prepared and served by prisoners at Rimutaka Prison as part of the Prison Gate to Plate dining experience, says Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

This is the fourth year the prison has taken part in Visa Wellington on a Plate and the tickets to the 2016 event sold out in three minutes.

Under the guidance of celebrated chef Martin Bosley, guest chefs Chetan Pangam and Amy Gillies, and catering instructors, the prisoners have been taught to prepare and present gourmet courses to the public.

“Some of these men gain catering qualifications in prison and will be able to find employment in this field once they leave prison.

“The success of this event is the result of a true collaboration, as Corrections partners with industry groups and high profile individuals who want to put something back into their community.”

Minister Collins will attend the Rimutaka Gate to Plate this evening.
