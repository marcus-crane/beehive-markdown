Finance Minister Bill English has welcomed the appointment of Lawrence Yule, Geoff Hunt and Fiona Mules to the National Infrastructure Advisory Board, and the appointment of existing board member John Rae as the new board chairman.  

“The new members bring skills and experience from the local government, procurement and the construction sectors,” Mr English says.

“These are important attributes for the board which advises the government on a range of infrastructure matters.”

Lawrence Yule is the Hastings Mayor and president of Local Government New Zealand. Geoff Hunt has been the CEO of Hawkins Group since 2013 and has extensive commercial experience in the electricity transmission and generation sector.

Fiona Mules, who is Canterbury-based, has expertise in public sector funding and procurement, especially in relation to large-scale infrastructure and the delivery of public-private partnerships.

John Rae has been a board member since 2014 and has substantial experience in the infrastructure, energy, waste and investment sectors.

Mr English also acknowledged outgoing chairman Lindsay Crossen and board member Matthew Birch.

“They have both contributed significantly to the development of The Thirty Year New Zealand Infrastructure Plan and have helped to build industry understanding of the need for a coordinated approach to infrastructure development,” Mr English says.
