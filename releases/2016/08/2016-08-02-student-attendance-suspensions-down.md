Education Minister Hekia Parata has today released figures that show student stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions are at their lowest levels since records began 16 years ago. At the same time the number of students skipping school is also going down.

“These figures are really positive for our young people. They show that students are spending more time in class, which is vitally important for their future prospects,” says Ms Parata.

The 2015 Student Engagement and Participation information shows that since 2008 the number of suspensions in state and state-integrated schools has fallen by 40.1 percent to 2,618.

“The data also shows that over the same time stand-downs have dropped by 30 percent to 14,198, while exclusions have fallen by 35 percent to 883.”

The number of expulsions has fluctuated over the years. 156 students were expelled in 2015, compared to 154 in 2008 and 201 in 2010.

Ms Parata praised the efforts of schools, families and whānau for the reduction in student removal rates.

“Schools and their communities work incredibly hard to keep students in class and on track with their achievement, attendance and behaviour. It’s also great to see programmes, such as the highly successful Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L), having an impact.

The attendance figures showed that per day, over a one week period in June 2015, just 4.1 percent of students were recorded as being on an unjustified absence. Another 5.8 percent were recorded as being on a justified absence, for example at a medical appointment. The overall figure of 9.9 percent is down from 10.8 percent in 2014.

“Whilst these figures are good news for our students there is still more to be done, particularly for Māori and Pasifika students. That’s why we’re encouraging young people to see the relevance of formal education, and stay in class longer through programmes like Year 9 Plus and Count Me In,” says Ms Parata.
