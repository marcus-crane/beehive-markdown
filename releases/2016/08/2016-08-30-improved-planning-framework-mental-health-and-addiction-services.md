Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new framework for planning and designing support for people with mental health and addiction issues will help to further improve care.

 

“The new Commissioning Framework is about better planning and design of mental health and addiction services,” says Dr Coleman.

 

“It’s a methodology that will shift the focus from inputs and outputs to understanding the real difference that services make to people. This is about putting people at the centre of planning.

“The framework sets national expectations and requirements while at the same time, enabling providers the ability to develop responses that better meet the needs of local communities and people.

“It’s important to ensure no matter where someone lives, or whatever their circumstances, they get access to the mental health and addiction services that they need.”

 

The Government recently announced that Budget 2016 includes $12 million over four years to increase support for people to access mental health services at an earlier stage. It is targeted around three initiatives:

- A mental health triage system delivered by the national telehealth service. This will help strengthen the response to people who reach out to police, social, and community services at a time of mental health distress, identifying appropriate responses and referrals.

<!--THE END-->

- Support for primary care and social services through a dedicated mental health expert advice service to help them to help people address their mental health issues before they escalate.

<!--THE END-->

- Improving local mental health pathways will map out existing services and better direct people to help in their communities.

The *Commissioning Framework for Mental Health and Addiction: A New Zealand guide* was designed with consumers of services and the wider mental health and addiction sector.
