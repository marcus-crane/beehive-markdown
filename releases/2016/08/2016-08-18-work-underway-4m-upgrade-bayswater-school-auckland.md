Construction work has begun on a $4 million upgrade for Bayswater School on Auckland’s North Shore, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This project will deliver two new buildings comprising a total of six new learning spaces, and is one of several upgrades and redevelopments either announced for or underway on the North Shore,” says Ms Kaye.

“In April, I unveiled a plaque to mark construction getting underway on a $26 million redevelopment at Takapuna Grammar School.

“Earlier this month, I also visited Northcote Primary School to announce Government funding of $5.7 million towards a redevelopment there.

“The North Shore is a popular area undergoing urban intensification, and the Government is responding to growth there and across Auckland by building more classrooms and schools.

“Two of the new learning spaces at Bayswater School will help it accommodate expected roll growth, with another two replacing ageing existing buildings. A two-classroom satellite unit of the Wilson Special School is also being built as part of this project.

“I announced this project in April this year, so it’s fantastic to see that work is now underway and on-track for completion for Term 2 in 2017.

“This year’s Budget set aside $882.5 million in total for school infrastructure. Around $153 million of this will be invested in school property in greater Auckland, and this is on top of around a quarter of a billion dollars invested by the Government over the two years to May 2016 to upgrade and grow Auckland schools.

“A further $72 million has been announced in the last two months alone for Auckland school redevelopments and upgrades.

“As well as the $5.7 million project at Northcote Primary School on the North Shore, these Auckland-wide projects include:

- Te Atatu Intermediate School ($3.7 million)
- Te Huruhi School, Waiheke Island ($23 million)
- Waiheke High School ($17 million)
- Newmarket School ($8.7 million)
- Clayton Park School ($14.5 million).

“Construction has also begun during the last two months on the $19 million redevelopment of Freemans Bay School and the $22 million redevelopment of The Gardens School in Manurewa.

“This ongoing investment and building activity shows we’re committed to modernising Auckland’s schools and getting ahead of demand in our largest city.

“From 2014, as a result of the Auckland roll growth programme, school redevelopments, new schools and projects green-lighted under Budget 2016, we will deliver more than 17,000 new places in the city by 2019.

“In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government.”

**Notes**

**About Bayswater School**

Bayswater School is a contributing primary school (years 1 to 6) and part of a Community of Learning with Takapuna Grammar School. It has a current roll of 213, and the additional classrooms will allow the roll to grow to around 260.

**About Wilson School**

Wilson School is a state school which welcomes students with a wide range of disabilities and special learning needs. It has a base school in Takapuna and also provides a number of satellite classes in mainstream schools.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.
