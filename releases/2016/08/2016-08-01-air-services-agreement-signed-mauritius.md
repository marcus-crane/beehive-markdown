Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the signing of an air services agreement opening the opportunity for code-sharing between New Zealand and Mauritius airlines.

The agreement was signed today after being negotiated by officials at an international air services conference in Turkey in 2015.

“This agreement opens up opportunities for code-share services linking New Zealand and Mauritius, through Air Mauritius services to and from Perth, Australia. Passenger airlines of each side can now also operate up to 14 services per week,” Mr Bridges says.

“This agreement will further enhance New Zealand’s international air connectivity, bringing both trade and tourism benefits.”

Mr Bridges says the Government’s liberal International Air Transport Policy is bringing many benefits to New Zealand.

“Since the policy was implemented in 2012 more than 50 new or amended air agreements have been negotiated, bringing the total to 78. Most of the major airlines in the world are now able to operate services to New Zealand without restriction, with 19 new air routes announced in the past year alone.

“We’ll continue our efforts to grow and enhance these connections, making it easier for New Zealanders to travel and trade internationally.”
