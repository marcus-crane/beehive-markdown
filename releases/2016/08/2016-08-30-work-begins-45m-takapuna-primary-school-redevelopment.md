Construction has started on a $4.5 million redevelopment at Takapuna Primary School on Auckland’s North Shore, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This investment will see a new, two-storey classroom block built, and adds to three other upgrades and redevelopments either announced for or currently underway on the North Shore,” says Ms Kaye.

“Construction work began in April on the $26 million redevelopment at Takapuna Grammar School, and just under a fortnight ago work started on a $4 million upgrade at Bayswater School.

“Earlier this month, I also visited Northcote Primary School to announce Government funding of $5.7 million towards a redevelopment there.

“We’re investing in schools on the North Shore because it’s a popular area undergoing urban intensification, and this is leading to roll growth.

“The new block at Takapuna Primary School will comprise 10 learning spaces. Seven of these will address the school’s growing roll, and the other three will replace old teaching spaces.”

Total learning spaces at the school will increase from 15 to 22 once the new block is up and running.

“The new building will also house a new speech clinic, to replace the school’s current speech facilities.

“As with any major school redevelopment, the focus at Takapuna Primary School will be on creating an innovative learning environment, featuring flexible learning spaces that support a range of teaching and learning approaches.

“This is an exciting time for schools on the North Shore. We’re committed to modernising and expanding schools in the area, to ensure students learn in an environment that helps them achieve to the very best of their abilities.”

Construction of the new facilities at Takapuna Primary School is expected to be completed by May 2017.

“This year’s Budget set aside $882.5 million in total for school infrastructure. Around $153 million of this will be invested in school property in greater Auckland, and this is on top of around a quarter of a billion dollars invested by the Government over the two years to May 2016 to upgrade and grow Auckland schools.

“A further $72 million has been announced in the last two months alone for Auckland school redevelopments and upgrades.

“As well as the $5.7 million project at Northcote Primary School on the North Shore, these Auckland-wide projects include:

- Te Atatu Intermediate School ($3.7 million)
- Te Huruhi School, Waiheke Island ($23 million)
- Waiheke High School ($17 million)
- Newmarket School ($8.7 million)
- Clayton Park School ($14.5 million).

“From 2014, as a result of the Auckland roll growth programme, school redevelopments, new schools and projects green-lighted under Budget 2016, we will deliver more than 17,000 new places in the city by 2019.

“In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government.”

**Notes**

**About Takapuna Primary School**

Takapuna Primary School is a coeducational primary school for Years 1 – 6 students, located on Auburn Street in Takapuna.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
