Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne has called on the New Zealand public to take the opportunity to have their say on the operation of Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ).

“New Zealand’s fire services have been operating under legislation that hasn’t seen significant change since the 1940’s. Our firefighters and the communities they serve deserve a fit for purpose, modern legislation that supports an integrated fire service to serve communities now and into the future.  Fire and Emergency New Zealand, is a significant move towards strengthening, future-proofing and ensuring fire services remain connected to the communities they represent,” Mr Dunne said.

The Fire and Emergency New Zealand Bill was introduced to Parliament on 6 July 2016 to create one national fire service – bringing together more than 40 separate organisations, over 600 fire forces and brigades, more than 12,000 volunteers, and approximately 3000 paid staff. 

A Discussion Document was released on the new fire services regulations and the public has until 18 August to make a submission. The regulations will contain the operational detail to enable the legislation.

“We want to hear from interested parties on the key elements within the regulations such as levy exemptions, property exemptions, establishment of local committees and fire control matters.  This is your opportunity to ensure your community has the highest standard of service it needs to protect lives and property and I encourage you to have your say on the regulations that will shape how FENZ operates,” said Mr Dunne.

The discussion document is on the Department of Internal Affairs website ([https://www.dia.govt.nz/Fire-Services-Transition](https://www.dia.govt.nz/Fire-Services-Transition)), along with a submission form.  Feedback should be sent to [FireServicesTransition@dia.govt.nz](mailto:FireServicesTransition@dia.govt.nz)
