The Government will invest around $6.9 million to redevelop Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere in Northland, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This redevelopment will include new buildings as well as building upgrades, and will provide the kura with fantastic new facilities,” says Ms Parata.

The redevelopment will see:

- the conversion of existing buildings to create new facilities for senior students, including flexible learning spaces; a remote learning suite; and specialist science, art, design and technology workshops
- the construction of four brand new learning spaces for junior students, which will replace a number of old, relocatable classrooms
- a new gymnasium.

“The new facilities for senior students are especially exciting,” says Ms Parata.

“Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere achieved wharekura status in 2010, enabling it to cater for year nine to 13 students. The redevelopment will provide students in the wharekura with inspiring learning spaces that encourage them to excel in their chosen areas of study.

“The remote learning suite is an important addition because it will allow students to connect with teachers based off-site and in other parts of New Zealand via video-conferencing.

“This is a great way to enable students to access specialist learning, regardless of where they are based.”

Ms Kaye says teachers, students and the local community will welcome today’s announcement, which marks a significant chapter in the kura’s evolution.

“Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere has gone through several changes during its 21 year history,” says Ms Kaye.

“After starting out as a registered private school, it became a kura for year one to eight students in 1995, before achieving wharekura status in 2010.

“In 2009, the kura suffered a significant setback when a fire affected several buildings.

“There is currently a mix of new, old and temporary buildings, which reflect these different stages and events in the kura’s history.

“The redevelopment is about building facilities which represent the kura’s focus and needs in 2016, and which also set it up for the future.

“The gymnasium, for instance, will be designed to enable it to be extended, and the teaching spaces will allow for roll growth from the current roll of 112 to a capacity of 130 students.

“When I have visited Northland, I have been hugely impressed by the passion and potential of their young people. It’s great to be able to ensure that another education facility in the region can provide more modern and innovative learning environments.”

The $6.9 million investment in Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere comes on top of:

- $19 million announced earlier this year to provide a new site and buildings for Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Tonga o Hokianga, and a total of 16 new classrooms at Whangarei Girls High School, Parua Bay School and Bay of Islands International Academy
- $14 million announced in 2015 for the redevelopment of Northland College, and $6 million to increase capacity at Hora Hora School.

Over $50 million has been committed to upgrade schools and add capacity in Northland between 2008 and 2015, on top of the money normally provided to schools to maintain their property.

“In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government,” says Ms Kaye.

Project design work on the Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere redevelopment is now underway, with construction of the new facilities scheduled to be finished in late 2017.

**Notes**

**About Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere**

Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere is a kura and wharekura for years 1 to 13 students located on Station Road in Moerewa, Northland.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
