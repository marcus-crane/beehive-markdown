Although women are participating in the workforce in greater numbers than ever before, they remain under-represented in science, technology and engineering, Minister for Women Louise Upston said this week.

Ms Upston made the comments at a meeting of women scientists and engineers from the Asia Pacific region.

Every year, women with an interest in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) gather to promote the interests of women in STEM and discuss gender issues unique to the region.

Ms Upston said job opportunities based on STEM skills are broadening in New Zealand and internationally, and this is expected to continue.

“We need to encourage more women and girls to be educated and trained in areas that match employment growth.

“By matching skills with opportunity women can achieve greater economic independence, which is better for their families, their communities and for New Zealand.”

STEM subjects are increasingly important for growing and sustaining New Zealand’s economic competitiveness.

They underpin the development of innovative technologies and high-value products, and can lead to a range of rewarding careers, Ms Upston said.
