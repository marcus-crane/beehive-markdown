Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry leaves for the United Kingdom tonight to attend and speak at the Edinburgh International Cultural Summit, a major gathering of arts sector leaders from around the world.

“This is a valuable opportunity to gather new perspectives and ideas about the place of culture in society, the sustainability of the arts and the benefits of increasing participation in cultural activity,” Ms Barry says.

Held from 24-26 August, summit attendees come from more than 30 countries, including China, Canada and Australia.

Discussions and workshops will be held around three themes: culture and heritage, culture and economics and culture and participation.

“I look forward to sharing New Zealand’s experiences at the culture and participation plenary, as well as gaining insight from other nations’ approaches to sustainability in the cultural sector.”

The Minister will meet with her counterparts in the Scottish and United Kingdom Governments, and will discuss funding initiatives and innovations for arts and heritage.

“Scotland and New Zealand have similar-sized populations and challenges to face around support and funding sustainability for the arts, and I am sure we can learn a lot from each other.”

Deputy chair of the Arts Council of Creative New Zealand, Michael Moynahan, will attend the summit with the Minister.
