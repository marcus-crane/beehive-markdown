Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has officially opened the $3.9 million refurbished integrated hospital and health centre, Clutha Health First.

“It’s great to see a community-run hospital and health centre evolve to provide the integrated models of care that the local Clutha community needs,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s important that all New Zealanders can access timely and high quality healthcare closer to home, that’s a key focus of the refreshed New Zealand Health Strategy. 

“The refurbished Clutha Health First facility creates a more efficient working environment for staff and a better experience for patients.

“This second phase of the redevelopment has included an extensive refurbishment of the inpatient wards, the replacement of the birthing pool in the maternity ward, and the replacement of all the mechanical systems.

“The refurbishment, which took 18 months to plan and complete, went smoothly which is a credit to the contractor Naylor Love, and the facility staff who managed the refurbishment at the same time as operating a busy health centre and hospital.”

Phase one of the redevelopment completed in 2013 resulted in extra general practice space for nurse-based clinics, medical student education, and a dedicated primary-led urgent care service staffed by a nurse practitioner. The Outpatients Clinic was also co-located with general practice.
