Education Minister Hekia Parata today opened one of two new learning hubs in the Whanganui region to inspire and enable young Māori to achieve their NCEA and plan for their future.

“This is an opportunity for Māori aged 16 to 18 years to get back on track, catch up or get ahead with their NCEA Level 2 qualification.

“I especially want to encourage young people who have already left school without NCEA level 2. It is not too late to access the support to enable you to achieve the skills and qualifications to succeed in life”.

The Express to Success hubs are part of a wider programme of work to lift Māori and Pasifika achievement. Five hubs opened earlier this year in Kaikohe, Mangere, Hamilton, Gisborne and Kawerau.

The two new ones are at Whanganui City College - also serving Cullinane College and Whanganui Girls College, and Raetihi Primary School.

The hubs are designed to involve the whole whānau, and to connect parents with their children’s learning says Ms Parata.

“We know how important it is for young people to have the support of their whānau. So we want mums, dads, younger brothers and sisters, aunties, uncles and grandparents to come along too.

“The hubs also build on the positive relationships that are already in place between local schools and Whanganui iwi. They, as well as early childhood education services, kōhanga reo and local businesses are already working together to support Māori children to enjoy and achieve in education”.

While in Whanganui Ms Parata also signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding between the Crown and Whanganui iwi.
