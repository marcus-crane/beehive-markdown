A creative sector programme that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make positive life changes will receive $90,000 under a new partnership between the Government and Te Aratika Trust, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The Government will contribute $30,000 and Te Aratika Trust will contribute $60,000 to support at least 770 young people to participate in the programme, which will be delivered by AdairBeatz,” says Ms Kaye.

“This new partnership will target young people from disadvantaged communities living in Rotorua, Hastings and Christchurch.

“The programme will consist of workshops delivered over several weekends, and will support participants’ personal development through the acquisition of skills such as performance and technical skills, marketing, teamwork and leadership.

“There are incredibly talented young Kiwis out there who are living in situations where positive opportunities are limited.

“This partnership is about reaching out to these young people and, along with support from family and the community, supporting them to overcome issues such as violence and substance abuse and chart a positive new path.”

The funding announced today will support AdairBeatz to provide the workshops over 2016/17. Invitations to take part in the programme will be made via schools and social media, etc, to young people living in the targeted communities.

“The partnership with Te Aratika Trust is the second I’ve announced under a new approach to youth development in New Zealand. This new direction is seeing the Government coinvest with philanthropic and business partners to increase the number of youth development opportunities available.

“Last month, I announced the first partnership under the new approach. This partnership, with The Vodafone Foundation, will support around 1500 mentoring opportunities in Auckland and Waikato.

“I expect the new approach to increase the number of youth development opportunities from 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with the overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.”
