The Government will invest around $3.7 million towards the redevelopment of Te Atatu Intermediate School in Auckland, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This redevelopment will see a new two-storey block built, containing six learning spaces,” says Ms Kaye.

Most of the new learning spaces are to address roll growth.

“Like schools in other parts of Auckland, Te Atatu Intermediate is experiencing growing rolls, with the number of students increasing from around 290 in 2012 to around 330 this year,” says Ms Kaye.

“Over the next four years the roll is expected to increase further, reflecting ongoing population growth in the surrounding area. This redevelopment will support a roll of 400.

“The four learning spaces on the top storey of the new block will be used by Te Atatu Intermediate, while the two spaces on the ground floor will become the new satellite for the Arohanui Special School.

“Arohanui Special School currently operates out of a relocatable building on the Te Atatu Intermediate site. This building will be removed once the new two-storey block is completed.

“The new learning spaces for Te Atatu Intermediate will support an innovative learning environment. This means they will be flexible to support different ways of teaching and learning.

“As part of the redevelopment, improved access and drop-off areas will also be provided for students of Arohanui Special School.

“Around $2 million of this total $3.7 million redevelopment is coming from Budget 2016, which earmarked $18 million for a number of classrooms announced for Auckland in July 2015 which require additional funding, and which now have final approval.

“This year’s Budget set aside $882.5 million in total for school infrastructure. Around $153 million of this will be invested in school property in greater Auckland, and this is on top of around a quarter of a billion dollars invested by the Government over the two years to May 2016 to upgrade and grow Auckland schools.

“A further $72 million has been announced in the last two months alone for Auckland school redevelopments and upgrades. As well as the $3.7 million Te Atatu Intermediate project, these include:

- Te Huruhi School, Waiheke Island ($23 million)
- Waiheke High School ($17 million)
- Northcote Primary School ($5.7 million)
- Newmarket School ($8.7 million)
- Clayton Park School ($14.5 million).

“Construction has also begun during the last two months on the $19 million redevelopment of Freemans Bay School and the $22 million redevelopment of The Gardens School in Manurewa.

“This ongoing investment and building activity shows we’re committed to modernising Auckland’s schools and getting ahead of demand in our largest city.

“From 2014, as a result of the Auckland roll growth programme, school redevelopments, new schools and projects green-lighted under Budget 2016, we will deliver more than 17,000 new places in the city by 2019.

“In total, this Government has committed around $5 billion to school property, significantly more than any previous government.”

Building work is expected to start at Te Atatu Intermediate in early September and be completed for Term 2 in 2017.

**Notes**

**About Te Atatu Intermediate School**

Te Atatu Intermediate School, for years 7 and 8 students, is located on the Te Atatu Peninsula, Auckland.

**About Arohanui Special School**

Arohanui is a school for students with special learning needs. It has a base in Te Atatu South and satellite classes in a number of mainstream schools across West Auckland.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
