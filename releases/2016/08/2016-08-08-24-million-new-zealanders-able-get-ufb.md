Communications Minister Amy Adams says demand for the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband continues to grow as the rollout forges ahead.

“More than one million households, businesses, schools and hospitals are now able to access Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) services. This means 2.4 million New Zealanders are now able to connect to UFB, which is an outstanding achievement this far into the build,” says Ms Adams.

“There are now more than 830 new households and businesses connected to fibre every working day – more than one every minute – as New Zealanders realise the benefits of the Government’s investment in high-speed broadband.”

Ms Adams today released the latest quarterly report on the UFB and RBI programmes that highlights the enthusiasm New Zealanders have for faster and more reliable internet.

Nationwide uptake of UFB is just under 24 per cent, and over 240,600 New Zealanders are now connected.

“Internet connectivity has become an essential part of day to day life, and access to faster broadband opens up opportunities across business, health, education and within the local community,” says Ms Adams.

“Faster and more reliable broadband is transforming the way New Zealanders live, work and learn.”
