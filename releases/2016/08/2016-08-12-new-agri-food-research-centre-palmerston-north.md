Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today announced that AgResearch and Massey University will jointly build New Zealand’s largest agri-food research centre in the Food HQ Precinct on the Massey University campus in Palmerston North.

As part of AgResearch’s Future Footprint Programme, AgResearch and Massey University are investing $39 million in the Food Science Research Centre and the design for the new buildings is well underway.

“The research conducted at the Centre will span the agriculture sector from farm to consumer, with a focus on dairy and red meat research,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Centre will also support education – training under-graduate and post-graduate students to support the future of the food industry.’

The development and leveraging of Food HQ is a key initiative of Accelerate 25, the Manawatu-Whanganui Regional Economic Action Plan.

The Food Science Research Centre will be housed alongside the Massey University Institute of Food Science and Technology, the Riddet Institute, and the Massey Food Pilot. Construction is expected to be complete by the end of 2018.

The Government will also provide $100,000 to help FoodHQ attract international research and development and connect directly to multi-national companies; and FoodHQ partners have committed, in principle, to match the Government’s contribution.

“The investment will fund a new business development manager, who will support FoodHQ to accelerate growth and create a more compelling value proposition for global R&D firms,” Mr Joyce says.

“The business manager will focus on market development and lead a strategy refresh that will ensure FoodHQ is able to capitalise on lessons learnt since its inception in 2013.

“Food innovation is one of the Manawatū-Whanganui region’s key strengths, and there are significant opportunities for growth and job creation in further lifting innovation across the region and producing more commodity and value-added products.

The Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan has been developed by the region with central government support. It forms part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme.
