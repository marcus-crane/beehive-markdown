Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the Education Legislation Bill passing its second reading in Parliament, including two amendments.

“After the Bill was introduced to the House, the Government became aware of the need for two more amendments”, says Ms Parata.

“The Education and Science Select Committee received further submissions on the amendments from a number of organisations, and recommended the amendments be included in the Bill.”

The first amendment allows school boards of trustees to appoint students of approved initial teacher education programmes to paid trainee teacher positions. The second allows for technical amendments to be made to modernise the New Zealand Council for Educational Research Act 1972. The proposed changes mainly affect the composition of the NZCER council.

“We have been focused on improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education as part of our drive to strengthen the teaching profession and raise student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“Field-based ITE programmes offer an alternative pathway into teaching from traditional ones. This amendment creates a new type of position called “trainee teacher”, giving school boards the ability to appoint students on a field-based ITE programme as teachers.

“Appointments to field-based ITE roles, like Teach First NZ positions, will only be open to trainee teachers, not the whole teaching workforce.” 

A key feature of the Education Legislation Bill is greater flexibility for how schools and early childhood education providers operate.

“The options this Bill allows for will benefit students, parents, teachers and boards of trustees”, says Ms Parata.
