The government is committing $100,000 to help Havelock North Village get back on its feet following the gastroenteritis outbreak, Small Business Minister Craig Foss says.

“Two weeks ago the village was nearly empty — our business owners, their staff and customers either too unwell to venture out or too busy caring for sick loved ones,” Mr Foss says.

“Havelock North has long been known as a clean, beautiful place to visit with world-class fresh produce and friendly locals. This funding will help bolster Havelock North’s reputation as a top destination in a region popular with both domestic and international tourists.

“It will also help assist with a speedy economic recovery, particularly for the village’s many small locally owned and operated businesses.

“The money will be allocated to a promotional fund established by the Hastings District Council, which is the body responsible for providing safe drinking water and therefore supporting the community through this outbreak.

“I welcome the Council’s commitment to matching the government’s contribution and encourage local businesses to get in touch with the Council or the business association to discuss any challenges and opportunities.

“Supporting the village and its businesses in this way benefits not only the local community but all of Hawke’s Bay,” Mr Foss says.

Earlier this week the government confirmed Inland Revenue will waive interest on any late PAYE, provisional tax and GST payments for affected businesses.
