Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the announcement that New Zealand will host a world-first trial of pizza delivery using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV, commonly known as ‘drones’).

Domino’s Pizza Enterprises (Domino’s) have announced in Auckland today that they have joined forces with UAV industry leader Flirtey to launch the first commercial drone delivery service in the world.

“Domino’s and Flirtey have chosen New Zealand for the trial because our forward-thinking aviation regulations encourage innovation, while protecting safety,” Mr Bridges says.

New aviation rules came into force on 1 August 2015 to regulate and enable the use of UAVs for recreational and commercial purposes in New Zealand.

“As Transport Minister I have been actively promoting New Zealand as a test bed for new transport technology trials. Our enabling laws and regulation means we have the ideal environment to trial all forms of technology.

“The announcement of this trial confirms that New Zealand’s framework for UAVs is world-class. In addition, the Government has reviewed the laws for driverless vehicles and Small Passenger Service operators, to ensure New Zealand stays at the forefront of transport innovation.

“The trial is also a valuable opportunity for the Civil Aviation Authority, who are making sure that appropriate safety precautions are taken,” Mr Bridges says.

The Government is also continuing to work with Domino’s on the possibility of testing a driverless pizza delivery unit on land.

Subject to obtaining the appropriate approvals, the UAV delivery trial is expected to get underway later this year.
