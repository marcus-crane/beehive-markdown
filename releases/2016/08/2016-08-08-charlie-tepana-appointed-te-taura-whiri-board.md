#### Kua whakatūria a Charlie Tepana ki te Poari o Te Taura Whiri

Nā te Minita Whanaketanga Māori a Te Ururoa Flavell te kōrero kua whakatūria a Charlie Tepana ki te Poari o Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.

He uri a Tepana nō Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Raukawa, Rangitāne, Te Uri o Hau, Ngāti Rangiwehiwehi, Ngāti Pākehā me Ngāti Kōtimana.

E ai ki a Miniata Flavell kua puta a Charlie i Te Panekiretanga o te Reo Māori, nō reira he matatau ki te reo Māori, he kaingākau hoki ia ki te reo me ōna tikanga Māori.

“He kura, he taunga, he matatau ia ki ēnei momo mahi kōkiri reo ā-hapori i te mātauranga, me te arotahi nui ki te mahi whakatakoto mahere reo.”

“Kua roa a Tepana e whakapau kaha ana i roto i ngā mahi whakarauora i te reo Māori, ka mutu he waia ki ngā mahi whakahaere, whakahaere poari hoki i te ao mātauranga me ngā rāngai hapori nā reira e tino whai hua tāna mahi ki te Poari.

Ka toru tau te roa a te noho o Tepana ki te poari, ka mauria mai hoki e ia tōna tino mōhiotanga ki te rāngai reo Māori i āna mahi tātaki i te whakakaupapatanga o te Rautaki Whakarauora i te reo Māori o te Iwi o Raukawa.

He mema ia o te Rōpū Tohutohu Reo Māori 2014 i whakatūria e te Minita ki te arotake me te whakatakoto tūtohu e pā ana ki te Māori Language Act 1987, he mea i whakakorengia i nā noa nei, nā te whakaturetanga o Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori 2016 / Māori Language Act 2016.

Kāore e ārikarika ngā mihi ki te mema e heke ana a Te Awanuiārangi Black, i noho hei Toihau Tuarua i ngā wāhanga e rua ki te Poari o Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.

 

#### Charlie Tepana appointed to Te Taura Whiri Board

Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell today announced the appointment of Charlie Tepana to the Board of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.

Mr Tepana identifies tribal affiliations as being Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Raukawa, Rangitāne, Te Uri o Hau, Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Pākehā, Kōtimana.

Mr Flavell says as a graduate of the Institute of Māori Language Excellence, Charlie Tepana had a high level of fluency in te reo Māori and a strong commitment to te reo and tikanga Māori.

“He brings valuable and extensive experience working in a number of community language initiatives in education, with a particular focus on language planning.

“Notably Mr Tepana has an impressive record of commitment to education and the revitalisation of te reo Māori and his leadership and governance experience in the education and community sectors will serve the Board well.”

Mr Tepana will serve a three year term and brings to his position a strong understanding of the Māori language sector having played a leading role in the implementation of the Raukawa Tribal Māori Language Revitalisation Strategy.

He was a member of the 2014 Ministerial Māori Language Advisory Group established to review and make recommendations on the Māori Language Act 1987 which was recently repealed with the enactment of the Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori 2016/ Māori Language Act 2016.

Mr Flavell acknowledges the efforts of outgoing member Te Awanuiārangi Black who has served two consecutive terms as Deputy Chair while appointed to the Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori Board.
