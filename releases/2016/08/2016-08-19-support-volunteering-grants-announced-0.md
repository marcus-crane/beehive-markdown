Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced this year’s grant recipients from the Support for Volunteering Fund.

“Around 1.2 million kiwis volunteer for at least one charity or not-for-profit organisation so this fund will help support the enormous contribution they make to New Zealand society and to helping build stronger, more cohesive communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Volunteers play a crucial role in almost every type of activity, from sports, recreation, arts, culture and heritage to emergency and social services, health, education, conservation, the environment, and working with migrants.

“Most community groups in New Zealand could not function without support from volunteers, they are a big part of what makes New Zealand such a great country,” Mrs Goodhew says.

This year’s allocation includes grants for Volunteering New Zealand, seventeen regional volunteer centres and twelve organisations undertaking volunteering projects across the country.

The Support for Volunteering Fund will provide:

- $100,000 to Volunteering New Zealand, which plays a leading role in the volunteer sector and builds volunteer capacity within its member organisations;
- $325,966 to 17 regional volunteer centres; and
- $80,000 to 12 organisations focusing on Māori, Pacific and ethnic communities, who will promote and support volunteering and build volunteering capacity and capabilities within their communities.

An example of a project funded is the South Invercargill Urban Rejuvenation Charitable trust’s plans for a volunteer development forum for volunteers to share knowledge, build resourcefulness, and engage with other volunteers.
