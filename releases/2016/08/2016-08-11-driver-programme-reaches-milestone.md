Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is today congratulating the Community Driver Mentor Programme (CDMP) on helping 500 young people successfully sit their restricted driver licence test.

“The CDMP is an excellent example of communities, volunteers and businesses coming together to help improve the lives of young people,” Mr Foss says.

“Having a licence can open up the world for teens and young adults — providing more freedom, mobility and employment opportunities.

“With suitable vehicles and experienced drivers, this programme removes many of the barriers young people may otherwise face.

“It also has huge safety benefits.  Anyone going through this programme gains experience across a range of conditions and situations, as well as the skills and confidence to drive safely on our roads.

“Improving the safety of young drivers is one of the key priorities of the Government’s Safer Journeys road safety strategy.”

The CDMP is a joint initiative between the NZ Transport Agency, the Automobile Association and six communities throughout the country: Porirua, Te Kuiti, Gisborne, Christchurch, South Auckland and Whangarei.
