Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed the *‘Improving Outcomes in Aged Care’* report which was released today.

The report finds changes to audit processes for rest homes have contributed to better quality care for residents.

“As the number of older New Zealanders grows, it is vital that aged residential care facilities are providing safe and healthy environments for residents,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“A switch to unannounced spot visits means rest home managers and staff should be “audit-ready” every day so residents receive better care.”

“The report also says medication management and safety is improving with the publication of the Medicines Care Guides for residential aged care facilities.”

“The report is useful in highlighting trends across the sector and helps plan quality initiatives,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

AUT University was contracted to produce the report.

“The main finding of the report is that residents are receiving better quality care as a result of the changes in the audit processes,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Background:

All rest homes are independently audited against 50 standards and require certification to ensure they provide safe and effective care.

The audit reports identify any risks and areas where the homes need to improve.

The ‘Improving Outcomes in Aged Care’ report is available on the Ministry of Health website: [http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/improving-outcomes-age-residential-care](http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/improving-outcomes-age-residential-care)
