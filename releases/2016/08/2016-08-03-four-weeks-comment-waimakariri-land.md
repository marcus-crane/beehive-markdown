Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee is encouraging people to have a say on a draft plan for the future use of the residential red zones in Canterbury’s Waimakariri District.

“I have received the Draft Waimakariri Residential Red Zone Recovery Plan from the Waimakariri District Council, and I thank the Council for its work in producing this comprehensive document,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Last year I asked the Council to produce a draft recovery plan for 84 hectares of largely Crown-owned land in Kaiapoi, Kairaki and The Pines Beach red zoned due to damage caused by the earthquakes. 

“The proposals in the draft plan have drawn on analysis of hazards and other land issues, and a range of public feedback that began back in 2014 when the *Canvas* public consultation campaign gauged what people wanted for the red zones.

“Features of the draft plan include recommendations for interim and long term uses such as sports fields and recreation, a dog park, a memorial garden, and business uses.

“People now have the chance over the next four weeks to view the draft plan and have their say on the proposed future uses for different areas.

“What happens with this land will play a big part in the future prosperity of the whole Waimakariri District and will have impacts right across greater Christchurch, so I hope people take the time to have a look and give their thoughts,” Mr Brownlee says.

After the period of public feedback on the draft plan ends on 1 September 2016, the feedback will be analysed by officials and advice provided to the Minister along with the draft plan to make a decision or whether or not to approve the plan, or to make any changes.  A final Ministerial decision is expected later this year.

Mr Brownlee says his process for the red zones in the Waimakariri District is separate to that for the red zones in Christchurch city. 

“The process of gathering the public’s views on the future use of the Christchurch red zones will be led by new entity Regenerate Christchurch, and it will provide more information about this over time.”
