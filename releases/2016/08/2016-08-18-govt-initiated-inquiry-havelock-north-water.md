Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today confirmed there will be a Government initiated independent Inquiry into the Havelock North water contamination issue.

“The situation in Havelock North is concerning. It is important that the public has confidence in their water supply,” says Dr Coleman.

“To ensure we have a clear understanding of what has happened in Havelock North as well as any learnings from the situation, the Government will launch an independent Inquiry.

“This approach has been agreed between the Government and Hastings District Council as the best way forward.”

The Inquiry will be undertaken under the Inquiries Act 2013. This will ensure that it follows a clear statutory process and will have a range of powers such as the ability to call witnesses.

“The Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are still to be confirmed. The Inquiry will look at the events surrounding the outbreak and the response, as well as consider any wider systemic issues,” says Dr Coleman.

“This will be a wide-ranging Inquiry to ensure that all New Zealanders can feel confident about the quality of drinking water supplies.

“This has been a difficult time for many. It is important that people continue to follow the advice of health professionals. That means boiling water and if you or someone in your family is unwell call Healthline on 0800 611 116.”

On Monday Cabinet will consider the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry. Details on the exact form and membership of the Inquiry team will be decided shortly.
