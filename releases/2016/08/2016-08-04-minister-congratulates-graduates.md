Corrections Minister Judith Collins has congratulated 24 new Corrections Officers and Offender Employment Instructors who graduated today.

The new recruits will be based at prisons across the country including Auckland Prison, Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison, Whanganui Prison, Arohata Prison, Rimutaka Prison and Christchurch Men’s Prison.

Brendon Queree, 23, of Christchurch Men’s Prison, was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award in recognition of his leadership, professionalism and achievement during his training.

The Minister’s Excellence Award was established in 2009 to promote and honour excellence.

“I have no doubt that Brendon and all the new recruits will go on to become great role models for the prisoners in their charge and contribute to the Department’s efforts to reduce reoffending,” Ms Collins says.
