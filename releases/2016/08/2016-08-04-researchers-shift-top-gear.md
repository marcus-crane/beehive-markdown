New Zealand’s world-leading research database continues to grow with the inclusion of new data from the transport sector, Statistics Minister Craig Foss says.

The Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) holds a wealth of information, including anonymised tax, education, welfare, migration, crime and health data. 

“The IDI is a kind of data warehouse — it brings together information about people, households and businesses from across the public sector and combines it with data from the census and other Statistics NZ surveys,” Mr Foss says.

“Following the latest quarterly refresh, the IDI now also contains driver licence and motor vehicle register details from the New Zealand Transport Agency.

“The more information we have in the IDI, the more complex social questions we can answer. For example, what are some of the factors creating barriers to employment for young people?

“The government is using administrative data to enable better decision-making across government, target spending and, most importantly, improve New Zealanders’ lives.”

Mr Foss says all data available in the IDI is anonymised and the privacy and confidentiality of that data is paramount. Security is in place to ensure the data is not misused and researchers are only able to access data relevant to their research.
