Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the announcement by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos of the conclusion of a peace agreement between the Colombia Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC) guerrilla movement.

“This is an important development for Colombia and for the region, that will afford the people of Colombia greater stability and prosperity in the years to come,” Mr McCully says.

“The accord concludes the domestic conflict with the FARC that has impacted on Colombia for the past 52 years.

“New Zealand has worked to support Colombia’s peace efforts, including through our position on the United Nations Security Council, and we will continue to support them as they begin to implement this agreement,” Mr McCully says.
