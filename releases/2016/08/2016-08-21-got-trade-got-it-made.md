Got a Trade Week 2016 is being launched tomorrow by Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Louise Upston.

The week-long event is part of the Got a Trade? Got it Made! campaign which aims to raise awareness of on-the-job training and career opportunities in New Zealand’s trades and service industries.

“It’s important that young people see the trades as a first choice when planning their careers. People like parents, teachers and careers advisors should also encourage jobs, especially to Māori, pacific people, and women who are all under-represented in trades.” Ms Upston said.

“Strong employment growth is forecast in the construction, business services, hospitality and retail industries, a career in trades supports a move towards a more skilled and productive economy.”

Budget 2016 provided $24 million for Apprentices and Maori and Pasifika Trades Training. This will support a further 5,500 apprentices, and 2,500 young Māori and Pasifika learners in MPTT programmes this year, and 3,400 next year.

Last year 42,000 people undertook apprenticeships and recently the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO) reported it had 10,000 apprentices for the first time.

“This shows that we’re working hard to get more people into the trades, but there’s always more work that can be done.” 

As part of the week’s events, Ms Upston will be meeting 80 apprentices and trainees at the Future Business Leaders Awards in Auckland this Thursday.

“Got a Trade Week 2016 is also a great time to showcase the talents and achievements of young Kiwis making headway in their chosen vocation” said Ms Upston.

Got a Trade? Got it Made! is collectively owned by eight Industry Training Organisations. Launched in November 2014, the campaign to date has encompassed a range of activities from events, exhibitions, workplace tours and school visits.
