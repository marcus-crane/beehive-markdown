A new state highway has been created in Northland, creating a stronger link between the forestry industry and port, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

From today Te Pua Road, Mangakahia Road, Otaika Valley Road and Loop Road (North) will officially become State Highway 15 with the New Zealand Transport Agency taking over the operation and maintenance of the 96km of roads.

“These roads are an important link between Northland’s 50-thousand hectares of forestry and its ability to move timber products off-shore at the port,” says Mr Bridges.

“Changing the roads to a state highway will ensure there are three strong routes connecting Northland, making the network more resilient to unplanned incidents and weather events and balancing the needs of local communities, tourists, and light and heavy vehicles.”

The new State Highway 15 joins State Highway 1 at Loop Road (North), which is being upgraded as part of the Government’s Accelerated Regional Roading Package announced in 2014.

“Providing safe and resilient transport connections for freight, the local communities and visitors is key to the Government’s commitment to supporting Northland’s economic growth,” says Mr Bridges.

The Transport Agency will now begin work to bring these roads up to state highway standard which will include improvements to litter removal, drainage and vegetation clearance.

“In the longer term there’ll be better road maintenance, line markings and signage. Improvements to road safety will also form part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to managing this part of the network,” says Mr Bridges.
