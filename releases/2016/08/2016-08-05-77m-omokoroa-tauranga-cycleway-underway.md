Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the sod on the Omokoroa to Tauranga cycleway as part of a multi-million plan to connect the city with the Western Bay of Plenty.

The $7.7 million, 19km cycleway will link Omokoroa with Tauranga’s existing urban cycleway network.

“This new cycleway will play a vital part in a planned cycle network that will offer more cycling and walking connections between Tauranga and the Western Bay of Plenty, providing people with a range of transport options,” Mr Bridges says.

“Over the next three years about $15 million will be invested into cycling projects in the Western Bay through our Urban Cycleways Programme to help establish cycling as an integral part of the area’s transport network.”

The project includes a bridge over the Wairoa River and will provide an alternative way to access the urban communities in the area, schools, parks and reserves and Tauranga Harbour. It will also provide an alternative route to the State Highway 2 corridor that connects the area to Tauranga City. It is expected to be completed by June 2018.

Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a priority.

“Cycling is an important part of an effective integrated transport network, it creates more vibrant and connected communities, it’s good for tourism and it’s a fun, healthy way to get around.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme, central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”

In total 54 projects are being funded under the programme nationwide.
