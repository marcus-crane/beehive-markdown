New Zealand women’s contribution to the economy continues to grow, said Minister for Women Louise Upston.

“The latest Household Labour Force Survey shows women’s participation is now 64.6 percent (June 2016 quarter), continuing an upward trend.

“Women’s employment rate is also high at 61.1 percent.  Compared with June 2015, there were 8,000 fewer unemployed women, and their unemployment rate fell from 6.2 percent to 5.4 percent.

“More young women are staying in school or seeking training or higher qualifications, leading to a more educated labour force.

“New Zealand women are more qualified and more economically independent than ever before. This is great news for employers who are seeking skilled and qualified staff,” she said.

“We are encouraging more women into training and careers in high growth fields where there are good pay prospects, for example, trades, engineering, IT and primary industries.

“The Ministry for Women is working with several of these industries to see how they can continue to attract more women to meet their demand for skills.

“We are also encouraging greater use of flexible work as a way to attract and retain talented workers in the workforce.

“To continue growing our economy and meet the demand for skills in the workplace I encourage employers to consider more women in a wider range of roles,” said Ms Upston.
