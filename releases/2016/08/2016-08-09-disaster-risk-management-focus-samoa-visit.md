Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye is travelling to Samoa today for a three-day visit, focused on affirming the strong ties between New Zealand and Samoa around disaster risk management.

“The ever present risk of natural hazards is something that both New Zealand and Samoa understand very well,” says Ms Kaye.

“This risk is part and parcel of living in the Pacific. We’re surrounded by the Ring of Fire, which makes us susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while our geographies and climates also make us vulnerable to events such as cyclones, storms, floods and droughts.

“New Zealand and Samoa have a long and close relationship, and sharing expertise and experience on managing hazards and responding to disasters plays a central part in this relationship.

“During my three days in Samoa I will meet with the Prime Minister, Hon Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, and attend a range of meetings with senior government ministers and officials.

“These meetings will include a roundtable on disaster preparedness. Topics discussed at this will include lessons learned from previous disasters in Samoa, and New Zealand’s contribution towards strengthening Samoa’s risk management capabilities.

“I will also visit key disaster risk management facilities and initiatives, including the National Disaster Management Office operations centre, the meteorological monitoring station at Mulinuu and the emergency siren network on the south coast of Upolu.

“At Lalomanu I will view areas devastated by the 2009 tsunami, as well as work done since then to prevent future loss of life and property damage.

“While in Samoa, I will also hold meetings related to my other portfolios.

“These include a youth roundtable, where I’m looking forward to meeting some of Samoa’s upcoming young leaders and hearing their aspirations and thoughts on topical issues, including innovative approaches to disaster preparedness.

“I will also attend a meeting on Samoa’s accident compensation scheme, which will include discussion on building communication channels with ACC in New Zealand.

“Samoa is a close friend with whom we have a strong and affectionate bond, and I am looking forward to strengthening this relationship during my three-day visit.”
