Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says a new trial for beneficiaries with mental health conditions will start next month and will work with clients to support them into work.

“Just over half of all clients receiving a main benefit have a health condition, injury or disability so it’s important that we work effectively with them to find the right support so they can move into long term independence,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Work to Wellness is a contracted service which will work with clients who have a diagnosed mental health condition, providing coaching and mentoring, job search services and assistance to help clients into work.

“Providers will work with clients to identify their needs and any barriers they face to return to work. This may include referring them to services such as counselling, additional GP visits or skills training.

“The two year trial will be available in the Auckland, Waikato, Central, Canterbury and Southern regions and will be evaluated after each of the two years.

“Beneficiaries will be able to opt-in through Work and Income, a referral from their GP or self-referring directly to the provider, who will work with clients for six months.

“The trial is expected to cost $3.2 million and will be available to around 1000 people each year.

“We’ve seen success with targeted assistance like this already, for example, sole parents without work obligations dropped by more than 12 per cent in the year to March 2016,” Mrs Tolley says.
