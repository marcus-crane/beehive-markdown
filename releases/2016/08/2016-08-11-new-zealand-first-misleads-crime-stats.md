New Zealand First is misleading the public through its incorrect use of raw data which are not official statistics, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

“New Zealand First has used data from Police Communications Centres to paint a picture about crime trends that is incorrect.

“The data New Zealand First are using only represents calls for service to Police Communications Centres.

“These calls are coded as offences at the end of initial attendance by police and this point in the process often only marks the start of a Police investigation to determine what really happened.

“New Zealand First has made a ‘back of the envelope’ calculation using data with no quality assurance in place.  This has resulted in claims which are incorrect and misleading. 

“For example, its claim that Northland has a three per cent arrest rate for burglaries is wrong.  The figure it refers to only captures what happened at the scene when Police initially responded.

“In most cases burglars have already left the scene by the time the victim reports the burglary to Police. So, very few burglars will be detained during Police initial attendance at the scene.

“More often, subsequent enquires and collection of forensic evidence by Police leads to apprehension of the offenders.”

The official statistics for 2008 -2014 show 431,383 offences in 2008 falling to 380,389 in 2014.

These Tier-One official statistics, which are widely available on the Stats NZ website and which have been produced in line with standards created by Statistics NZ, are the official crime statistics generally used as a measure of crime trends.
