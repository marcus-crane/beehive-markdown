Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is welcoming the ‘Accelerate 25’ Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan, launched today, which aims to increase jobs opportunities, incomes and investment across the region.

Mr Flavell says he is pleased to see the collaborative efforts between iwi, businesses, and local and central government in finalising the plan.

“This is a plan that will help tāngata whenua realise their economic aspirations and enable better utilisation of their land,” he says.

“Māori have been heavily involved in the plan’s development and are well-represented in areas such as tourism, hill country sheep and beef farming, and mānuka honey.”

While in Whanganui today, Mr Flavell is also announcing an initial investment into the region of $193,500 from the Whenua Māori Fund. The funding will be used to support two large groups of Māori landowners to investigate how they can best use their land.

“The region will also benefit from a cross-regional investment through the Iwi Chairs Forum of $300,000 to address land-locked property issues. These investments will help Māori landowners realise the potential of their land and align with broader Te Ture Whenua reforms,” he says. 

“Given the interest in mānuka honey from Māori in this region, I look forward to seeing how learnings from the recent mānuka conference in Rotorua are used to help improve local businesses.”

A Regional Māori Economic Development Strategy, Te Pae Tawhiti, is also in the process of development.

“Te Pae Tawhiti will run concurrently alongside implementation of the action plan and will look to assess Māori aspirations for their own economic development - a strategy developed by Māori, for Māori,” Mr Flavell says.

Te Puni Kōkiri has supported the strategy’s development as part of its investment into Māori engagement in regional economic development and the action plan.

The Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan forms part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme. More information is available [here](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/regional-growth-programme/manawatu-whanganui).
