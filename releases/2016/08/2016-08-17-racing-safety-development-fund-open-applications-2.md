The next round of applications for the Racing Safety Development Fund is now open, says Racing Minister Nathan Guy.

A total of $1 million is available from the fund over two funding rounds this financial year.

“The fund supports projects around the country for improving racecourse health and safety standards. This has included improvements for safety running rails, irrigation and drainage, lighting upgrades, and grandstand repairs,” says Mr Guy.

“Many of these facilities are public places and widely used by the community, outside of racing events as well as at race days.”

All racing clubs and code bodies may apply for funding. New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses.

On-line applications must be submitted by 30 September 2016. Further information is available from: [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/)
