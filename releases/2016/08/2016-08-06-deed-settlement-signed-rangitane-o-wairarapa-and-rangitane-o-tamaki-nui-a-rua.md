The Crown has signed a Deed of Settlement with Rangitāne o Wairarapa and Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-ā-Rua (Rangitāne) settling the iwi’s historical Treaty claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Rangitāne has been working towards settlement with the Crown for almost 30 years,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today marks the beginning of a new relationship between Rangitāne and the Crown.

“As a result of Crown actions and omissions, Rangitāne was left virtually landless by the early twentieth century, and the iwi struggled to maintain its distinct identity, customary knowledge and language.”

The settlement provides an acknowledgement, apology and redress for the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Commercial and financial redress totalling $32.5 million includes the opportunity to purchase Crown properties and part of the Ngāumu Crown Forest Licensed land.

Cultural redress includes the vesting of eight sites of cultural significance and the vesting of Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre Reserve and Scenic Reserve which will be gifted back to the Crown and the people of New Zealand. A number of statutory acknowledgments and deeds of recognition over sites of historical, cultural and spiritual significance to Rangitāne are also included as part of the redress.

“The Crown can never fully compensate Rangitāne for the injustices of the past but this settlement provides the iwi with a solid foundation for its economic and cultural future,” Mr Finlayson said.

Rangitāne’s area of interest extends from north of Dannevirke to Mākaramu (near Porangahau), down to Cape Palliser and encompasses the wider Wairarapa and Tamaki nui-ā-Rua regions.
