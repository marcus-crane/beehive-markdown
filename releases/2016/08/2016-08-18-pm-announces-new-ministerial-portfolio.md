Prime Minister John Key has today announced the establishment of a new ministerial portfolio, Minister for Vulnerable Children.

The new portfolio will come into effect in April 2017 with the establishment of the new Ministry for Vulnerable Children, Oranga Tamariki.

“The care and protection of vulnerable children and young people is a priority for this Government and the establishment of a new stand-alone, child-centred ministry is a reflection of that,” Mr Key says.

“The new ministry will put the needs of children first so that they have the best possible chance of living happy and successful lives.”

Anne Tolley will be appointed as Minister for Vulnerable Children effective April 2017.
