Budget 2016 is investing $19m over four years in modernising and transforming Customs’ workforce model, Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says.

“Air passenger volumes are forecast to increase by 21% between 2015 and 2020. Trade volumes are forecast to grow by 30% for the same period. We need to ensure that Customs is ready for this growth.”

“That is why the government is supporting the reshaping of Customs’ workforce model and remuneration structure by investing $4.7m a year to increase its operational effectiveness and productivity,” Ms Wagner says.

“It will be the most significant change to the Customs workforce in 20 years, and the government’s investment supports the introduction of a more efficient and effective operating model and new flexible staff deployment model.

“The three unions, the Customs Officers’ Association, E tū, and PSA, have recently ratified a new multi-union collective agreement which supports the new operating structure.

“This will enable Customs to retain, upskill, and deploy staff across priority work areas in response to the current and emerging risks growing trade and travel volumes bring.

“Experienced officers will focus on border risks and law enforcement, and will be supported by technology that enables them to prioritise the risk.

“Customs works to protect and promote New Zealand trade and travel through world class border management. The government is committed to ensuring that legitimate travellers are welcomed and border security is maintained,” Ms Wagner says.
