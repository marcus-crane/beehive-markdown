Police Minister Judith Collins congratulates the 60 new Police officers who will graduate as Constables today.

“Today marks the start of a challenging and rewarding new career. Every day you will go to work with the knowledge that you are making New Zealand a better and safer place.”

Ms Collins said it’s great to see a number of new graduates with diverse backgrounds which will give them an advantage in their new role as a Constable.

“There are officers graduating today that have worked in Police in non-sworn roles, have been in the army and many have impressive sporting achievements representing our country.

The Wing 298 attestation parade today marks the completion of the second phase of the new Police training which involves an intensive 18-week course at The Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.
