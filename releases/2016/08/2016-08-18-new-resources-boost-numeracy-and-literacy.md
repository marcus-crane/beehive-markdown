Education Minister Hekia Parata today officially launched a new resource, including an app, to strengthen teaching and learning in reading, writing and maths.

“Being able to effectively evaluate a child’s rate of progress is essential for teachers, so they can identify where more support is required,” says Ms Parata.

“There has been a gap in our understanding of progress and achievement in years 9 and 10. The Learning Progression Frameworks (LPF) that I’m launching today fills that gap, supporting teachers’ understanding of how their students are progressing in those two years.”

The LPF acts as a guide, providing examples of student work to illustrate the significant steps that students need to take as they develop their skills in reading, writing and mathematics. Interactive modules are also provided to take teachers through how to use the LPF to support teaching and learning.

“When we trialled the LPF teachers and leaders who used it said it raised their expectations for literacy teaching and learning in years 9-10.

“That shows this tool will have a real impact, strengthening literacy and numeracy teaching and learning across the curriculum,” says Ms Parata.

The LPF is now available to all primary and secondary schools as an online resource. The frameworks build on those already developed for the Progress and Consistency Tool which covers curriculum levels 1 to 4. The new resources mean curriculum levels 1-5 are now covered.

As part of the LPF an app has also been developed. The app contains the Reading Writing and Maths illustrations for years 1-8 and years 9-10 will be added in term 4.

“I’m delighted the app is already proving popular, having been downloaded more than a thousand times since it was piloted earlier in the year,” says Ms Parata. 

“Every child is entitled to build their literacy and numeracy skills so they can engage in the rich learning opportunities at school and kura.

“The LPF is yet a further tool with which teachers can support them on their education journey.”
