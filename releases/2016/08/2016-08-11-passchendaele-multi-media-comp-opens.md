Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today launched the 2016 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition.

“The Battle of Passchendaele was one of New Zealand’s most deadly conflicts during the First World War. On just one day — 12 October 1917 — more than 845 New Zealanders were killed and more than 2700 wounded,” Mr Foss says. 

“This annual competition, open to all year 13 students enrolled in a New Zealand secondary school, helps ensure New Zealand’s sacrifice on the Western Front is not forgotten.”

The winner will receive a $2000 education contribution and, along with the runner up, attend the Battle of Passchendaele centenary commemorations in Belgium in October 2017.

Both students will travel with the New Zealand Defence Force as part of a larger group of Youth Ambassadors selected by NZDF, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Youth Development and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association. 

Entries close 26 September 2016.
