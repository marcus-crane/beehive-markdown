Local councils and tourism operators are on the right track installing ‘Drive on Left’ signs at campervan and rental car carparks, intersections and popular tourist spots, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Record numbers of tourists are travelling to New Zealand — 3.3 million in the year to June — and many are opting to self-drive,” Mr Foss says.

“The ‘Drive on Left’ signs will help visitors safely negotiate busy driveways and intersections.”

Tourism Holdings Ltd, which has the Maui, Britz and Mighty campervan brands, has installed signs at branches in Auckland, Christchurch and Queenstown and at its Waitomo Glowworm Caves facility. Southland District Council is also installing signs at key locations throughout the region.

“The Transport Agency is working with other organisations, including motels and tourism operators, to install even more signs around the country,” Mr Foss says.

“The latest overseas driver crash statistics released by the Ministry of Transport show overseas drivers were at fault in less than five per cent of fatal and injury crashes on our roads from 2011 to 2015.

“The number of overseas drivers involved in crashes has stayed relatively consistent at a time when international visitor numbers have increased by about 30 per cent.”

Since 2014, Visiting Drivers Signature Project partners from central and local government and the private sector have delivered a range of initiatives focused on road safety at every stage of a visitor’s holiday — planning, booking, in-flight, on arrival, and on our roads.

“While we still have some way to go, each new initiative builds on the last to create a safer system for all road users,” Mr Foss says.
