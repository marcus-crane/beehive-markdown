Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging those thinking about standing in this year’s local elections to get their nominations in on time.

Nominations close in 24 hours, at midday tomorrow.

“Councils manage more than $96 billion in fixed assets and contribute more than $8 billion to New Zealand’s GDP each year. Good local governance is at the heart of the prosperity of local communities and growth at a national level,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Nomination papers for local authorities must be received by midday Friday, so those wanting to stand should contact their local electoral officer urgently so they do not miss the deadline.”

“There are many people in our communities with the necessary leadership qualities of being a hard worker and a good listener, communicator, and collective decision-maker.”

“Our elected representatives on councils, boards and trusts should reflect the people they serve.  We need a good mix of men and women candidates of different ages, from diverse ethnic backgrounds and with various work and life experiences.”

Local elections are held once every three years and they cover elections for district, city and regional councils, local and community boards, licensing trusts, and district health boards.

Those wanting to find out more about how to stand as a candidate can visit [http://www.lgnz.co.nz/assets/Publications/making-a-stand-made-easy.pdf](http://www.lgnz.co.nz/assets/Publications/making-a-stand-made-easy.pdf) or contact their district or city council’s electoral officer.
