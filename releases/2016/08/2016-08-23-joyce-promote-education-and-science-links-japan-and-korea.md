Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce leaves for Japan and Korea today for a four-day trip to advance New Zealand’s business, innovation and education interests and promote New Zealand as an investment destination.

Mr Joyce will visit Tokyo, Seoul and Busan to meet with Japanese and Korean ministers, officials and business leaders. 

“Japan and Korea are huge economies and important partners for New Zealand – both feature in our top six export destinations,” Mr Joyce says.

“With the Korea-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement recently entering into force and Japan being an important member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, there are many opportunities to build on our existing trade relationships.

“Investment from both countries also makes a significant contribution to our economy – especially in regional New Zealand - and our exports. We need to grow those linkages further.”

In addition to trade and investment links, Mr Joyce will also focus on education and science.

“Japan and Korea are two of our largest origin countries for international students. I want to highlight that New Zealand is a safe, attractive, high-quality destination for Japanese and Korean students to come and study,” Mr Joyce says. 

“There is also scope to boost science and technology relationships, with both countries recognised as being world-leaders in research and development and innovation.

“We want to strengthen links in sectors like robotics and functional food, and geothermal energy is a particular focus for us in Japan.”

Mr Joyce will visit Japan on 23-24 August and Korea on 25-26 August.
