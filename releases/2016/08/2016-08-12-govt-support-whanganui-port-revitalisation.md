Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the Government will invest $500,000 in partnership with the Whanganui District Council to develop a comprehensive plan to revitalise the Whanganui Port Precinct.

The plan will form the blueprint for a new marine services centre, an expanded boat-building industry and visitor services and recreational area.

“Revitalising the Whanganui Port and port lands is a key priority identified in the Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan launched today,” Mr Joyce says.

“Initial work on the project indicates that a Port revamp will support more than 135 jobs in the boat building and marine services sectors, while the expansion of diversified businesses servicing recreational boating and visitor attractions will generate even more opportunities for industry growth and employment.

“This is also an excellent opportunity to strengthen specialised marine engineering trades training in the area as apprentices will be able to hone their skills on site, firmly establishing Whanganui as a centre of excellence in industry-led education.”

Government investment in the project will help the Whanganui Council develop the plan for the future of the Whanganui Port. Whanganui Council are working with iwi, key business leaders, Horizons Regional Council, UCOL and NGOs on the plan.

“This is an important time for the region and we are excited to see what opportunities come out of the Whanganui Port revitalisation plan,” Mr Joyce says.

The Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan has been developed by the region with central government support. It forms part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme.
