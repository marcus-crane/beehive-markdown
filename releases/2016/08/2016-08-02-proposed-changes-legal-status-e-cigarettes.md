Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-liga has released a consultation document today which proposes change to the legal status of e-cigarettes.

“Currently the sale and supply of e-cigarettes containing nicotine is prohibited in New Zealand. However people are buying them online and importing directly for personal use,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The proposal is to make the sale and supply of all e-cigarettes lawful in New Zealand with appropriate controls.”

“The proposals would mean restricting the sale of e-cigarettes to people aged 18 years and over. The changes would prevent e-cigarettes being advertised and ban their use in smoke-free areas.”

“We also have to consider various quality and safety issues which may pose health risks to users and non-users.  Ensuring e-liquids are sold in child proof containers to prevent accidental poisoning is one obvious safety measure,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“E-cigarettes are relatively new and evolving products. There is scientific consensus that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.”

“I welcome feedback from the public on the future regulation and control of E-cigarettes,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Consultation opens today with submissions closing 5pm on 12 September 2016.
