Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says Customs six-months drugs seizure statistics are tracking towards another record year, and show drug interception systems are working well.

“From January to June, Customs made 1634 seizures at the border of numerous types of class A, B and C drugs including almost 143 kilograms of methamphetamine, and 575 kilograms of its precursor ephedrine,” Ms Wagner says.

“Some of the seizures set new records. 200 kilograms of precursor ephedrine hidden in a consignment of paper; 35 kilograms of cocaine found stuffed in a diamante-encrusted horse, and 20 kilograms of methamphetamine hidden in the lining of two suitcases that marked the largest ever seizure at an airport.

“Drugs can be sourced cheaply in some countries and the high prices in New Zealand make us an attractive market. Criminals attempt to smuggle drugs into the country using any way they can think of.

“The fact that Customs is making drugs seizures of all sizes, on a daily basis, suggests the many systems that are in place to protect our border are working well.”

“Budget 2016 invested $8.6m to streamline and protect the border that will lead to better targeting of illicit goods and provide more detector dogs. Our government is committed to disrupting the importation of drugs while streamlining legitimate trade.

“Customs is constantly working to disrupt the supply chain, alongside local and international enforcement agencies, to crack down on criminal networks here and overseas.

“Whether it’s a suitcase of methamphetamine or an envelope of ecstasy, Customs is preventing the harmful effects of these drugs on our communities. I commend Customs officers for their work every single day,” Ms Wagner says.
