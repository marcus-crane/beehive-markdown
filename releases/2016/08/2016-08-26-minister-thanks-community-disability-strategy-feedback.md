Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner has thanked everyone who joined the conversation to create a better future for the one in four New Zealanders who have a physical, sensory, learning, mental health or other impairment.

“Over the past month more than 630 people attended workshops from Invercargill to Whangarei to provide feedback on the draft version of a new Disability Strategy for New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.

“In addition, around 170 submissions have been received on the draft strategy from individuals and organisations via the Join the Conversation website.

“I’m really pleased at the level of engagement in the second phase of this important conversation. The feedback has included some really good ideas on ways to improve the strategy to make sure it covers the things that are most important to disabled people.

“The draft strategy sets out a framework for government agencies to identify and remove the barriers that prevent disabled people from participating fully in New Zealand society.

“This will help ensure that we have a really strong strategy to guide the direction of government agencies on disability issues for the next decade.”

“Feedback is now being analysed and the draft strategy will be updated by the Office for Disability Issues with guidance from the expert reference group.  The Government plans to finalise and launch the new Disability Strategy later this year,” Ms Wagner says.
