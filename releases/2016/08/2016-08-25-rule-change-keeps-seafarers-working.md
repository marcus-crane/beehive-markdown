Seafarers with most older domestic certificates will be able to continue using them without the cost of moving to a new modern ticket, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

Maritime NZ’s new seafarer certification system, SeaCert, was introduced in 2014, creating a single cohesive framework with clear career pathways and internationally recognised certificates.

“Many seafarers with older tickets have said they simply want to carry on doing what they’ve been doing, without facing additional training and costs,” Mr Foss says.

“We’ve listened to that feedback and created a ‘ring-fencing’ option, so some old tickets can continue to be used as long as the seafarer maintains a current medical certificate.”

From 30 September 2016, more than 30 types of ticket can be ring-fenced, including the Master Small Home Trade Ship and Third Class Steam Engineer. Many are legacies from previous New Zealand maritime authorities, with some dating back to the middle of last century.

“SeaCert is working well but the holders of these older tickets are quite rightly proud of them and don’t want them to disappear,” Mr Foss says.

Seafarers wishing to ring-fence tickets must register with Maritime NZ by 1 September 2017. Registration is free.
