Official crime statistics for July 2016 released today by Statistics New Zealand today, show that Police recorded 11,171 more victimisations than the same period last year, which equates to a 2.3 per cent increase.

More than three quarters of this increase can be attributed to burglaries.  The national burglary rate in the 12-month period increased by 11.9 per cent compared to the same period last year. 

Auckland City was the only police district to record a reduction in its burglary rate (10 per cent).  

“There is no doubt in my mind that Police are taking this increase in the burglary rate very seriously,” says Police Minister Judith Collins. 

“Police announced recently that they were raising dwelling burglary from a volume crime to a priority offence and the Commissioner of Police has also made clear his expectation that Police will now attend all dwelling burglaries.”

“These changes show that Police recognise the significant impact that burglary has on individual, families and communities, and that they are committed to reducing this type of crime and increasing resolution rates.”
