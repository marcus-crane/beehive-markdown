Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest health targets results show the gains made in the previous quarter have again been largely maintained.

“The health targets are important as they drive performance across the health system, ensuring that New Zealanders get better access to key health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“The latest quarterly results for April to June 2016 show that the progress made in the previous quarter has largely been sustained.

“The improved access to elective surgery target has again been achieved, surpassed by eight per cent. Delivering more elective surgery remains a key Government priority – the answer to increased demand is to do more.

“This is the last quarter that the more heart and diabetes checks target will be reported as it’s been replaced by the new childhood obesity health target.

“The more heart and diabetes checks target, which was again met this quarter with 91 per cent, will remain an accountability measure for DHBs to ensure the gains made are not lost.

“These latest health target results are a credit to our health workforce throughout the country.”

The health target results for Quarter Four 2016 (April - June) show:

94 per cent of patients were admitted, discharged or transferred from the ED within six hours.

88 per cent of PHO enrolled patients were offered help to quit smoking, up two per cent.

Results for the faster cancer treatment target dropped slightly to 74 per cent.

Immunisation coverage for 8-month-olds remained at 93 per cent.
