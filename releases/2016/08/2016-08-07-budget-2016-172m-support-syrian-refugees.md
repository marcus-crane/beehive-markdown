Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says $17.2 million over four years in Budget 2016 will help to support the 500 Syrian refugees arriving in New Zealand over the next two years.

“The Government wants to support the Syrian refuges settling in New Zealand to successfully transition and adapt to the Kiwi lifestyle,” says Dr Coleman.

"Many of these refugees have suffered a great deal of trauma and they will require ongoing specialised support.

"While many of the refugees will need counselling and support services, others will need help to manage a range of disabilities and chronic health conditions.

“The right support for refugees from the outset gives them the best chance to succeed here in New Zealand.”

Last year the Government announced New Zealand would welcome 750 Syrian refugees over the next two and a half years in response to the ongoing conflict in Syria.

This funding boost will go towards health costs associated with the refugees first six weeks at the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre. This includes an initial GP assessment and immunisation, as well as access to mental health and disability services.

The funding will also go towards ongoing health costs - from primary care in the community to hospital level care.

Dr Coleman says the majority of Syrian refugees will be resettled in Wellington and Dunedin.
