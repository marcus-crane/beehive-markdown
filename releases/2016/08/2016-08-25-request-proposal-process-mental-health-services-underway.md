The Request for Proposals process is now underway for the provision of improved mental health services to offenders, says Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

This follows the allocation of $14 million from the Justice Sector Fund in June 2016 for Corrections to purchase mental health services for offenders in prison and in the community over the next two years.

“This is a significant increase in support for offenders suffering from mental illness. Offenders’ mental health needs can escalate quickly and tragically. We want to get them the help they need early, and reduce the likelihood of them harming themselves or those around them.”

Earlier this year, Corrections completed one of the most thorough and extensive reviews of substance use and mental health disorders ever undertaken among New Zealand prisoners.

The study found that prisoners have higher rates of mental health and substance use disorders compared to the general population, with 62 per cent of prisoners having some form of mental health or substance abuse disorder over a prior 12 month period, and 20 per cent had both these disorders. Often, the disorders went undetected or were not treated properly.

The proposed new services will enable Corrections to better support offenders with mental health issues by providing wider access to contracted mental health providers.

Corrections will be procuring services for improved mental health services in prisons, improved mental health services in the community, and wrap-around services to support whānau/families of offenders.
