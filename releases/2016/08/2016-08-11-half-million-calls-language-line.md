Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says Language Line has logged more than half a million calls to its telephone interpreting service.

“This is a significant milestone for the service.  Since it began in 2003 Language Line has helped more than half a million people with little or no english get access to essential services,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Language line is funded by the Immigration levy and costs just over $800,000 a year to operate.

“The interpreting service receives around 1,100 calls each week from people and organisations including Police, Ambulance, Work and Income, Housing New Zealand and Inland Revenue.”

“It plays a key role in responding to the needs of New Zealanders for who English is a second language. And it is one of a number of services which help them settle in to life in New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Language Line, the New Zealand Migrant and Integration Strategy and the Ethnic Communities Development Fund all help migrants feel they belong here,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The service has grown from 6 participating agencies to 108 and offers immediate access to interpreters speaking 44 languages, with Mandarin, Samoan and Korean requested most often.
