Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government supports the recommendations of the Health Select Committee’s report into surgical mesh.

“I have every sympathy for people who have experienced issues with surgical mesh products. I’d like to thank the petitioners for highlighting their concerns, as well the submitters and the Committee for their deliberations,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government accepts the Committee’s recommendations on surgical mesh. Legislative work is currently underway on a new comprehensive regime for all therapeutic products, this will include modernising medical device requirements.

“The Ministry of Health will consider and consult on options for a registry to record the use of surgical mesh.

“The Ministry will work with DHBs, health providers and professional colleges to ensure best practice is maintained and that patients receive the information they need to make informed decisions about their care.

“Medsafe will continue to review and assess the international evidence on surgical mesh. The product remains approved for use by regulators worldwide when used in appropriate cases and by trained healthcare professionals.”

The Health Select Committee recommended that the Government:

- Investigate options for establishing and maintaining a centralised surgical mesh registry, consistent with international recording of surgical mesh complications;
- Communicates with medical colleges to review best practice around informed consent for surgical mesh patients;
- Encourages health providers to ensure coding information is consistent and patients with mesh complications can be identified and monitored;
- Encourages utilisation of the adverse events reporting system as applicable;
- Endorses ongoing education for surgeons on the use of surgical mesh and mesh removal surgery;
- Considers expanding Medsafe’s role to assess the quality and safety of medical devices.

The Government’s response to the Health Select Committee’s report on Petition 2011/102 of Carmel Berry and Charlotte Korte was tabled in Parliament today.
