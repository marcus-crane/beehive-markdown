Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Suva tomorrow for the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.

“The Foreign Ministers’ Meeting is an important opportunity to discuss regional priorities such as climate change, fisheries, and economic integration,” Mr McCully says.

“The Ministerial level meeting will also help inform the agenda for the Pacific Forum Leaders Meeting which will take place in the Federated States of Micronesia later this year.”
