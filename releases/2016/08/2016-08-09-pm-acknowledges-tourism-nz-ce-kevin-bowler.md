Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has acknowledged Tourism New Zealand Chief Executive Kevin Bowler, who has today announced he is resigning after nearly seven years in the job.

“Kevin has done an outstanding job,” says Mr Key. “Kevin and his team have done a great job marketing New Zealand through different channels, which has seen the industry go from strength to strength and become our top export earner.

“Kevin was instrumental in leveraging off the Rugby World Cup and The Hobbit films, and introducing international ambassadors to promote New Zealand in new and emerging markets.

“This has helped see our international tourist numbers grow from 2.5 million in 2010 to 3.3 million last year and the amount they spend increase from $6.9 billion in 2010 to $10.2 billion last year.

“Kevin leaves Tourism New Zealand in very good shape. I wish him all the very best for the future.”

Mr Bowler leaves Tourism New Zealand on October 28 to join Frucor Beverages Limited as its New Zealand Chief Executive Officer.
