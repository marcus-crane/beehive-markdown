Police Minister Judith Collins has today congratulated New Zealand Police for their success in winning the Diversity Works New Zealand 2016 Empowerment Award, and the overall Supreme Award last night.

These awards recognize the work by New Zealand Police to improve gender balance in its workforce in the areas of recruitment, retention and progression of women in the organisation. 

“This year Police has marked the 75th anniversary of women in the organisation and I have been very proud to participate in these celebrations. 

“It was an inspiration to meet the first generation of women police officers and listen to the challenges they faced.

“Their work paved the way for women in New Zealand Police today, and it is pleasing to note that in 2015, women made up 35.9 per cent of graduates from the Royal New Zealand Police College – up from 24.2 per cent in 2012.

“I’m under no illusion that Police still have work to do on this front, and the Commissioner has been quite open about this.

“Last night’s award demonstrates however, that Police are committed to improving the appeal of Police as a career option and providing a more positive work environment for women.

“I look forward to seeing their progress on this, and meeting the next generation of women Police officers who will continue to keep our communities safe.”
