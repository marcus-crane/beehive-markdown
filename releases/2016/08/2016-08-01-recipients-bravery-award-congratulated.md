Police Minister Judith Collins has congratulated the 11 people, five of them police officers, who were named as recipients of New Zealand Bravery Awards today for putting their lives at immediate risk to save or attempt to save others.

Three New Zealand Bravery Decorations have been awarded for acts of exceptional bravery, and eight New Zealand Bravery Medals awarded for acts of bravery.

“These brave New Zealanders put themselves at risk without hesitation to save or help save the lives of others,” Ms Collins said. 

Ms Collins said she was especially proud that five police officers had been recognised for bravery.  The officers recognised were Senior Constable Blair Spalding, Constable Ben Turner, Sergeant Ryan Lilleby, Sergeant Chris McDowell and Senior Constable Deane Thomas.

Senior Constable Blair Spalding and Constable Ben Turner, both dog handlers from Waikato, receive a New Zealand Bravery Decoration for their actions in disarming a violent and armed gunman in Hamilton.

Sergeant Ryan Lilleby and Sergeant Chris McDowell from Counties Manukau who disarmed a violent and agitated man armed with knives at a Papatoetoe family violence incident. Both officers receive a New Zealand Bravery Medal.

Senior Constable Deane Thomas, recently retired, from Bay of Plenty, who was first on the scene at a vehicle crash near Mt Maunganui. A van went through a bridge railing into Tauranga Harbour trapping the two occupants.  Senior Constable Thomas receives a New Zealand Bravery Medal for his actions in plunging into the river and saving the passenger.  Sadly the driver died at the scene.

“New Zealand Bravery Awards are not given lightly and we should all be thankful for those who step up to help others without thought for themselves.”
