Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell today announces the appointment of Glenn Hawkins (Te Arawa, Ngāti Maniapoto) to the Māori Television Service Board.

 

Mr Flavell says Mr Hawkins has governance experience and accounting and finance acumen that will be invaluable to the board in meeting its statutory role and responsibilities.

 

“Mr Hawkins’ extensive community involvement and networks will be advantageous to progressing the promotion and revitalisation of te reo Māori through television broadcasting,” Mr Flavell says. 

 

Mr Hawkins is currently Chairman of the Life Skills for Life Trust and was previously Chairman of Ngāti Whakaue Farming Limited. He joins Hon Georgina te Heuheu QSO (Tūwharetoa, Te Arawa, Ngāti Awa, Tūhoe) who has also been reappointed as Chair of the Māori Television Service Board.

 

“In addition to her understanding of the public sector, Mrs te Heuheu has significant knowledge of the Māori broadcasting industry and her reappointment will provide much needed continuity to the Board,” Mr Flavell says.

 

Mr Flavell acknowledges and thanks outgoing Māori Television Service Board Director Donna Gardiner for her commitment and service over two consecutive terms.
