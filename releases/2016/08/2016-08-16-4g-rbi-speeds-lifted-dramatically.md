Faster speeds and higher data caps are ensured for many rural New Zealanders under a new agreement between the Government and Vodafone, says Communications Minister Amy Adams.

“The new agreement means minimum peak broadband connection speeds under the Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) increase to at least 30 Megabits per second – six times the current speeds of 5Mbps,” says Ms Adams.

“On-peak data caps on 4G will increase over 150 per cent, which means rural users can take advantage of video streaming and more data intensive apps.

“Prior to the RBI project, our rural communities were grappling with poor speeds. This agreement is great for rural New Zealanders, where reliable, fast internet is increasingly important for rural businesses, schools and lifestyles.”

Under the agreement between Vodafone and the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, Vodafone’s almost 313 rural 4G cell-towers (which provide mobile and broadband coverage) will now offer much higher minimum speeds, lower latency, and higher minimum data caps for rural users.

“Fast internet is as important on our farms and in our rural communities as it is in our cities. It’s excellent to see that Government’s investment in RBI, and its partnership with Vodafone, is continuing to increase the quality of rural connectivity.”

Vodafone has already upgraded 93 of the new RBI sites to 4G plus upgraded 220 existing sites that are providing 4G RBI services, covering around 172,000 homes, farms and businesses.

The new service specification for 4G based RBI services includes:

- Improved minimum speeds of 30/5 Mbps (up from 5/0.5 Mbps on 3G)
- Reduced latency of 100ms round trip (down from 2000ms on 3G)
- Increased minimum data caps of 80GB on-peak and 50GB off-peak (up from 30GB and 50GB on 3G)
