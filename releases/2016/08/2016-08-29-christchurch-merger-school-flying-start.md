Christchurch’s Waitākiri Primary School, one of the first post-earthquake merged schools to open, is congratulated by Education Minister Hekia Parata for an exceptional first Education Review Office (ERO) report.

“Despite the challenges involved in the merger and relocation, Waitākiri Primary School’s achievement rates have remained very positive which is recognised in their excellent report from ERO,” says Ms Parata.

According to the report most children at Waitākiri achieve highly in reading, writing and mathematics, and are at or above the National Standards. 

“This is a testament to the hard work and resilience of the teachers, principal, board, families and students. They all deserve to be commended for their outstanding efforts.”

Waitākiri Primary School opened in 2014, after the merger of Burwood and Windsor schools. It continued to operate over two sites until opening in brand new state-of-the-art facilities earlier this year.

“The flexible learning spaces are also having a positive impact. ERO commented on the positive way teaching teams are working together in the spaces, making high-quality teaching more visible.”

“Waitākiri Primary School is off to a flying start and is a great example of what can be achieved when everyone in the school community works together.”

Because of the positive findings in the report, ERO is likely to carry out the next review at Waitākiri Primary School in four-to-five years.
