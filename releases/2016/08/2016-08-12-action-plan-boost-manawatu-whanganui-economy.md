Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy have today announced a detailed action plan to boost the Manawatū-Whanganui regional economy.

The Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan is part of the Government’s Regional Growth Programme, which is increasing jobs, incomes and investment in regional New Zealand.

“The Manawatū-Whanganui region is now showing encouraging signs of job growth,” Mr Joyce says. “The latest Jobs Online report showed a 24.7 per cent increase in jobs advertised across the Manawatū/Whanganui/Taranaki region over the year to June 2016.

“The action plan looks to build on this growth and the region’s strengths in primary production and food innovation, while taking advantage of opportunities in fields such as tourism, aged care and business process outsourcing. These opportunities were identified in the Manawatū-Whanganui Growth Study released last year.

“The plan contains a set of tangible actions in these areas, underpinned by strategies to grow business and improve transport, digital connectivity and skills training.”

Mr Guy says other focus areas include sheep and beef, land and water use, manuka honey, realising Māori potential, fresh vegetables and poultry.

“There are significant economic gains to be made if the opportunities outlined in the plan are realised. Benefit modelling carried out by NZIER has estimated that the primary sector opportunities alone have the potential to increase regional GDP by around $580 million by 2025,” Mr Guy says. 

“The plan also offers Māori in the region an opportunity to leverage their strong presence in the primary industries to enhance the wellbeing of local iwi and promote sustainable land use.”

“This region has the largest number of sheep and beef cattle of any region in New Zealand and excellent soils, so there is great potential to lift productivity and on-farm profitability on land in the Manawatū-Whanganui region.

“As part of this action plan $465,000 is going towards the delivery of primary sector initiatives. The Ministry for Primary Industries will be leading this work to share knowledge and information amongst farmers to help lift productivity.”

Local and central government, businesses and iwi worked together to develop the plan. The implementation work programme, known as Accelerate 25, will be led by the Horizons Regional Council, with continued central government support. Individual actions will be coordinated and funded by various groups and government agencies.

The Manawatū-Whanganui Economic Action Plan aligns with He Kai Kei Aku Ringa – The Crown-Māori Economic Growth Partnership and complements the wider work of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda.
