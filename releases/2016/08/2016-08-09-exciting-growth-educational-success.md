Education Minister Hekia Parata has paid tribute to teachers, parents and students for the excellent rise in NCEA Level 2 achievement rates among 18-year-olds.

“The latest data shows that 51,299 18-year-olds (83.3 per cent) achieved NCEA Level 2 in 2015. That’s around 38,000 more young people achieving the minimum qualification for success than if the achievement rate had remained at the level it was when we came into Government in 2008,” says Ms Parata.

The information comes from 2015 Public Achievement Information (PAI) released today.

“It shows that between 2011 and 2015, the number of 18 year-olds with NCEA Level 2 rose in all regions by between 7.7 and 11 percentage points. Auckland results are especially pleasing, with an increase of 1258 students. Other regions showing good growth include Canterbury and Waikato.”

For the first time, PAI data also includes information on school leavers. These are students who have permanently left the compulsory schooling system.

“This information tells us that in 2015 more school leavers undertook tertiary study than those that didn’t, and 19,270 of those were enrolled in degrees. This is exciting news because it means that more young people are getting better qualifications and much brighter prospects.”

Ms Parata says the information also shows that participation in early childhood education has risen to record levels. 96.6 per cent of children now participate in early learning before starting school.

Ms Parata says that public information about how the education system is doing is vital for students, educators, parents and employers.

“Parents can use PAI to ask their children’s school what it is doing to raise achievement. It also helps teachers give the right support to the right students, and assists schools, employers and training providers to work out what skills are needed to boost local economic performance.”
