A safety service has helped 2637 victims of family violence and their families since it was introduced in October 2014, says Justice Minister Amy Adams.

“The Strengthening Safety Service provides immediate help in safety planning for victims of family violence who do not have a protection order,” says Ms Adams.

“When victims of family violence have a matter before the court they are likely to be at their most vulnerable. Access to safety services can help keep them and their children safe, and in the last 12 months alone, it has helped 1343 New Zealanders.

“This free service involves approved providers identifying victims’ needs via phone or face-to-face meetings, to help them plan how to deal with risks, while providing safety support, information, and connections to other services.”

Ms Adams says putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system reduces the impact domestic violence has on individuals, families and communities.

Other initiatives designed to better support victims of crime include the National Home Safety Service launched in July 2015, the Victims Code in September 2015, the enhanced Victims Information Service from October 2015, and the Chief Victims Advisor to Government in November 2015.

**About the Strengthening Safety Service**

The service is offered to:

- Adult victims of domestic violence where a domestic violence related charge has been laid in the criminal court
- Adult applicants for a protection order where the application has been made, but the order has not yet been granted (Family Court).
- The service has two parts - a needs identification and "first aid safety advice" and safety planning. The victim can access one or both parts of the service. The service includes a detailed risk assessment and support in preparing a safety plan for themselves and their children.

The Strengthening Safety Service is not intended to replace the benefits of protection orders under which the courts can hold perpetrators to account for their behaviours and which include access to a full safety programme.
