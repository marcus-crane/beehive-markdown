Two major motorway projects in Christchurch are a step closer following the New Zealand Transport Agency’s announcement today that the construction contracts have been let, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The new Christchurch Northern Corridor and stage two of the Christchurch Southern Motorway are the final two projects to be built under the Government’s Roads of National Significance programme.

“The awarding of contracts to build these two Christchurch motorways represent a combined $435 million investment by the Government in Christchurch’s transport network.

“These are critical for improving travel times for commuters, and to support growth and development in Christchurch.”

Once the second stage is built, the Southern Motorway will have double the existing traffic capacity, providing better access between Christchurch and Rolleston.

Combined with the new Western Belfast Bypass (SH1), which is due to open early 2018, the Christchurch Northern Corridor will provide better and more predictable travel times in and out of Christchurch and along the existing routes – Main North Road and Marshland Road.

“As home to New Zealand’s second largest airport and second busiest export port, Christchurch plays a critical role in the economic development of the whole South Island,” Mr Bridges says.

“It is the transport gateway for tourism and business, making access to the city, its freight hubs and export markets critical for the economic success of the whole country.”

Construction for both projects is expected to get underway in October.
