A highly skilled group of people from the private sector have been named as the CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) Establishment Advisory Board by Communications Minister Amy Adams.

The Board will provide advice to the Minister for Communications and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) on the establishment of the national CERT.

“The national CERT will sit at the centre of New Zealand’s cyber security response. It will be the first point of call for all cyber security incidents,” says Ms Adams.

“The CERT will receive cyber incident reports, track and monitor cyber security incidents, and provide advice and alerts on how to respond and prevent further events. The CERT will work closely with international counterparts to prevent and respond to global cybersecurity incidents.

“I am pleased to announce a group of such accomplished professionals have come together to provide advice in standing up the CERT. The combined expertise and experiences of the Board members will be instrumental in ensuring the CERT is established next year, with the key elements for success, security and credibility in place.”

The nine Board members have extensive careers in cyber security and related fields, in both the public and private sectors, and have been appointed for a term of 18 months.

“We received a number of applications from high-calibre New Zealanders, and I would like to thank them for their interest in this vital Board,” says Ms Adams.

The Board will enable private and non-government sector involvement to deliver a responsive, economy-wide service that supports businesses, organisations and individuals alike

New Zealand’s national CERT is expected to be in operation in the first quarter of 2017.
