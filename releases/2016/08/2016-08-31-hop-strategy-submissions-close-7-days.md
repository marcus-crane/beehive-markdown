Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says there are just 7 days left to help shape the new Health of Older People (HOP) Strategy.

“The first HOP Strategy was released 14 years ago and needs a refresh.   Workshops around the country have finished but there is still the opportunity to submit online,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I see older people ageing well and being healthy, connected, and respected.”

“There was a good attendance at the Ministry’s workshops and good input from older people and their families as well as the health and social sectors. An online forum is still running for people to have further input.”

The Strategy follows on from the New Zealand Health Strategy. They both aim to ensure all New Zealanders live well, stay well and get well.

“Through the refreshed Strategy we can add quality to lives through a focus on healthy ageing and empowering people to live well,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The consultation closes 7 September.
