Education Minister Hekia Parata visited Carmel College in Auckland today to announce funding for new or expanded Asian language programmes at 63 schools across the country.

“Languages are an important tool for our young people to have as they venture out into the world,” says Ms Parata.

“I’m pleased to say that even more students will now have the opportunity to learn an Asian language, thanks to the Asian Language Learning in Schools (ALLiS) fund. A further $2.36 million is being provided from the fund to 63 schools who applied.”

A total of $10 million was set aside by the Government in 2014 to provide two contestable funding rounds that would increase Asian language programmes in schools.

“Overall there are now 203 schools from Southland to Tai Tokerau receiving support for Mandarin, Japanese or Korean language programmes. The benefits that students get from these programmes will help them thrive in a global economy.

“I’m really impressed by the way schools are working together to share resources and teaching skills. Many are establishing links with language and cultural organisations helping them to get the most out of the programme.

“We also know that primary and secondary schools are working together to offer students the opportunity to learn languages earlier, and continue their learning right through to end of secondary school.

“Today’s announcement is part of our drive to encourage and support our young people to be truly global citizens.”
