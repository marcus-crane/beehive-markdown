A Christchurch based youth development provider, 24-7 Youthwork Trust (24-7YW) will receive around $108,000 under a new partnership aimed at providing more youth mentoring and leadership opportunities in South Island schools, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

The programme will be available to schools choosing to participate from Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago.

“The Government will contribute $27,000 to this initiative, along with equal contributions from schools, churches and community groups,” says Ms Kaye.

“This is the third partnership announced under a new approach to youth development in New Zealand.

“Under this new approach, the Government is coinvesting in youth development opportunities with philanthropic and business partners, to increase the number of opportunities available.

“As an established provider of youth mentoring and leadership training, 24-7YW is well placed to support more young people in the South Island to build confidence, develop leadership skills, make positive choices and build positive connections in their community.

“The funding provided to 24-7YW will help them deliver a variety of approaches over 2016-17, from one-on-one and group mentoring to targeted leadership training.

“The leadership training will include supporting young people to organise and lead their own events such as festivals, and mobilise and coordinate other students to attend these events.

“Schools will be involved in selecting participants for these youth development opportunities, which will be provided during lunch hours and after school. Some out-of-school events such as trips and sports will be part of the programme.

“We have many talented young people who with the right support, can take their aspirations to the next level. This programme is about developing the skills and qualities needed to help young people set new goals and accomplish them.

“Other partnerships announced as part of the new approach for youth development include a partnership with The Vodafone Foundation, to deliver around 1500 mentoring opportunities in Auckland and Waikato. A partnership with Te Aratika Trust will also provide over 700 creative sector opportunities for young people from disadvantaged communities in Rotorua, Hastings and Christchurch.

“I expect the new approach to increase the number of youth development opportunities from 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with the overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 to 30 per cent.”
