The Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has offered his condolences to the families and co-workers of five Tongan men killed in an accident near Katikati.

“This is a tragedy for everyone concerned. My prayers and sympathies are with the families and friends of these five men and we offer any support we can at this difficult time,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Four of these men were here in New Zealand as part of the Recognised Seasonal Workers (RSE) programme.  They were all here working hard to support their families back home.”

“They had been here only a few months and were travelling home from work with another Tongan co-worker.  This tragic accident will hit their families and the whole Tongan community extremely hard,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“My thoughts and prayers also go to their co-workers at Aongatete Coolstores, some of whom I understand saw the accident happen. The workers there are like an extended family and Aongatete Coolstores is closed today out of respect for the workers and their families.”
