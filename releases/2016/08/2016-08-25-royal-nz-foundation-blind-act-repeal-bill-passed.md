Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes the passing of the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind Act Repeal Bill.

“The Blind Foundation wanted the Act repealed because it caused confusion by incorrectly suggesting that the Foundation is a statutory body. This Bill emphasises the Foundation’s status as completely independent from Parliament,” Ms Wagner says.

“While the Bill is straightforward, it plays an important roll in the Blind Foundation’s ambition to modernise its structure by removing the redundant Royal New Zealand of the Blind Act, which is no longer required since the Foundation became an incorporated society in 2002.

“The repeal of the Act continues the Foundation’s rich history of adapting to the changing needs of society, from its beginnings over 125 years ago as a school for blind children, to today’s multi-faceted organisation which offers a range of services and support. One of the best known roles of the Blind Foundation is breeding and training guide dogs.

“I look forward to the Blind Foundation continuing its excellent work to empower and support people who are blind or have low vision to lead independent lives and reach their full potential. I also wish to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their unanimous support in passing this Bill,” Ms Wagner says.
