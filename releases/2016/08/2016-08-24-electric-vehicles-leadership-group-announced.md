Transport Minister Simon Bridges today announced the members of the Electric Vehicles (EVs) Leadership Group as part of the Government’s programme to accelerate the uptake of EVs in New Zealand.

In May the Government launched its Electric Vehicles Programme which aims to double the number of EVs on New Zealand roads each year to reach 64,000 by 2021.

“The Leadership Group will champion this programme and proactively promote the 14 wide-ranging initiatives we announced in May. It will share information between central and local government and industry, and provide feedback to test ideas and decisions before they are put into practice,” Mr Bridges says.

“The 10 members of the group were selected for leadership they’ve shown in relation to electric vehicles, their potential to contribute to programme activities, and their ability to influence and represent the views of their sector.

“I’m confident that this carefully selected group of corporate and government managers will bring their sectors together, and are ideally placed to carry out their role in this fast-moving programme.”

Mr Bridges says the benefits of increasing uptake of electric vehicles are far-reaching.

“They’re cheaper to run than petrol or diesel vehicles, they’re powered by our abundant renewable electricity supply, and they’ll reduce the amount of emissions that come from the country’s vehicle fleet.”

Government agencies are currently working intensively on the major initiatives across the EVs programme.

“I have just announced details of the first round of the Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund and expect to be rolling out other significant elements of the EV programme in the coming months,” Mr Bridges says.
