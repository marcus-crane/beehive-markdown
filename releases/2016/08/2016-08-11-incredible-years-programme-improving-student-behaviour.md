The Education Minister Hekia Parata has praised a programme that’s reducing challenging behaviour in ECEs and primary schools.

Speaking at the Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L) School-Wide Conference in Wellington, Ms Parata released the results of an evaluation of the Incredible Years Teacher Programme.

“More than 12,000 teachers, who work with children aged 3-8 years old, have completed the Incredible Years Programme since it was introduced in 2011.

The evaluation by the New Zealand Council for Education Research surveyed around 1,000 of those teachers.

They found that 90 percent of ECE teachers and 75 percent of primary teachers reported less disruptive behaviour in their class following this course. That’s really significant for those children, as well as for their teachers”, says Ms Parata.

The Incredible Years Teacher Programme focuses on strengthening classroom management strategies, promoting children’s positive social behaviour, reducing classroom aggression and increasing co-operation.

“Creating positive environments where children can learn enhances their achievement. This evaluation showed that for those children identified with the most challenging behaviour, by the end of 2014, 55 percent of them were achieving at a medium or high level compared to 35 percent at the start of the year.

85 percent of ECE teachers and 70 percent of primary teachers also reported that students were more focused on their learning following the course”, says Ms Parata.

The Incredible Years Teacher Programme is part of the PB4L initiative, which has been shown to have a positive impact on school environments and student behaviour. Nearly 700 schools are participating in PB4L School-Wide.

A total of $105.2 million has been invested in PB4L since 2010.
