Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the sod on the multi-million Western Rail Trail, another link in Hamilton’s walking and cycling network.

The $5.82 million, 2.7km path will link Hamilton’s south western suburbs with Hamilton Girls’ High School, the Wintec City Campus and city centre.

“This new pathway will give commuters, school children and tertiary students a vital off-road link with the central city and provide them with a range of transport options,” Mr Bridges says.

“Hamilton has already built over 150km of its cycling network. The completion of this new cycleway is the missing link that will make cycling to the CBD and other key locations a realistic transport choice for residents in Hamilton’s south western suburbs.”

It is one of ten major projects in Hamilton’s Biking Plan which aims to develop a fully connected cycle network linking schools and major employment areas with the city and suburbs.

The cycleway is estimated to increase the number of children cycling to school, with more than 1600 students within 500 meters of the route.  In five years it is expected to attract more than 300 users a day.

The project is expected to be completed by December 2016.

Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice is a Government priority.

“Through our Urban Cycleways Programme, central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”

In total 54 projects are being funded through the programme nationwide.
