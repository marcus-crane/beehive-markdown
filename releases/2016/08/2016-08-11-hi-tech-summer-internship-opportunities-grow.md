Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced 245 R&D Experience Grants have been approved for 116 businesses to employ students over the 2016/17 summer break.

The Student Experience Grants, administered by Callaghan Innovation provide New Zealand students in their final year studying science, technology, business, engineering or design the opportunity to gain valuable work experience.

“The central aim of the grants is to develop the technical skills of students in a professional, commercial R&D environment, while also providing businesses with expertise to further their work,” Mr Joyce says.Callaghan Innovation received its largest number of applications from companies in the 2016 application round since the programme’s inception – 364.

“This programme is an important initiative in our drive to develop more work-ready graduates,” Mr Joyce says. “I’m keen to see more internships offered to undergraduates and graduates across the tertiary sector, and it’s great we have Callaghan Innovation and the tech sector leading the charge in partnership with government.

“The results of this programme show the worth of injecting new talent into to commercial workplaces. Businesses surveyed about their 2015-16 experience, tell us that, 36 per cent of 2015-16 summer interns went on to be employed for longer by their sponsoring company.”   

The programme is available to businesses of all sizes that have a focus on research and development and to all science, technology, engineering, design or business undergraduate students studying at NZQA levels 7 to 8 or equivalent at a New Zealand tertiary institute.

The R&D Experience grant provides funding of $18 an hour for up to 400 hours of work upon proof of the company’s payment to the student (to a maximum of $7,200 excl. GST).
