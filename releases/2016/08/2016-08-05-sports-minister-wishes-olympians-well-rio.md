Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman wishes New Zealand’s top athletes the best of luck as the Rio Olympics get underway this weekend.

“I wish all our athletes, their coaches and support teams all the best over the next 16 days in Rio,” says Dr Coleman. 

“Like many New Zealanders, I’ll be following the team’s progress with great interest, and I look forward to seeing them taking on the world and winning.”

Dr Coleman will be attending the Rio Olympics from 10 to 16 August. The Olympics take place from 5 to 21 August and feature 28 sports in 41 disciplines in over 306 events. Rugby Sevens will be played for the first time and golf has been reinstated for the first time since 1904.

“The Olympics have provided some of our greatest sporting moments. Rio is shaping up to be our most successful Olympics yet,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand is sending its largest ever team, with 199 athletes who will compete in 21 sports. High Performance Sport NZ believe we’re on track to achieve our target of at least 14 medals.

“Success on the world sporting stage is important. Sport is part of our national identity, and when we see Kiwis winning we are inspired to get active.”
