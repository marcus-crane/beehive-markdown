Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston today expressed thanks to the more than 3000 people who made submissions on New Zealand’s dog control laws.

“This huge response shows how passionate Kiwis are about our dogs and the need to improve safety around dogs.”

Of the 3,096 people who responded to the survey, 84% were dog owners and 48% were particularly concerned about dog attacks.

Respondents overwhelmingly identified dog owners and poor education about dog behaviour as the two biggest contributing factors to dog attacks.

“Interestingly, despite being predominantly dog owners, respondents typically considered dog owners to be problematic because bad owners created dangerous dogs and dangerous situations.”

“Respondents typically saw education about dog behaviour and dog ownership as the best ways to reduce dog attacks.”

“Of particular interest given the disproportionate number of child victims were submissions highlighting that many people and especially children do not know how to safely interact with dogs and often misunderstand dogs’ behavioural signals.”

The Government will consider the feedback in detail as part of its wider assessment of New Zealand’s dog control regime.
