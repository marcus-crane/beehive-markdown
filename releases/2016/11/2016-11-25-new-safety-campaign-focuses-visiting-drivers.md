A major road safety campaign to help visitors understand and prepare for driving in New Zealand is now underway, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss announced today.

“Summer is on its way and so are many international visitors. New Zealand roads can be challenging, particularly in and around some of our most popular tourist spots,” Mr Foss says.

“The campaign focuses on the Visiting Drivers Project areas of Otago, Southland and the West Coast, and uses billboards, posters, digital advertising and social media to spread road safety messages.”

The messages include:

- NZ roads can be narrow, winding and steep. Allow extra time.
- Journeys may take longer than you think. Allow extra time.
- Save overtaking for long, clear, straight roads.
- Taking photos? Pull over somewhere safe.
- Remember to keep left.

The messages were tested in six target markets — Australia, Germany, China, United States of America, United Kingdom and India — with people planning to visit New Zealand.

Mr Foss, Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean and Queenstown Lakes Mayor Jim Boult met today to discuss road safety, including the $15 million road safety engineering programme for Visiting Drivers Project areas announced last month.

“The Government and its Project partners, including local councils, will continue to roll out initiatives to further reduce harm on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

“This road safety campaign is part of a wide range of education initiatives already improving safety at every stage of a visitor’s holiday — planning, booking, in-flight, on arrival and on our roads.

“It’s important to remember that while the Visiting Drivers Project focuses on three regions in the South Island, many of these initiatives benefit all visitors, domestic and international.”
