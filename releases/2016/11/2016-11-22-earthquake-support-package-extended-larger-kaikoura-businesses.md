Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley have today announced that the wage subsidy package for small businesses in and around Kaikoura will be extended to larger businesses in the district.

“After talking with the Mayor and businesses in the area, it’s clear that we need to include the larger affected businesses as well to achieve our aim of sustaining the district through the tough times still ahead,” Mr Joyce says.

“The really unique aspect in Kaikoura is the complete loss of the road access north and south. That has a particularly dramatic impact on the larger tourism businesses in Kaikoura.”

The employment subsidy will now be available for all companies in Kaikoura, Cheviot, Waiau, Rotherham, Mt Lyford and Ward that experience a sudden, large and sustained drop in revenue as a result of the earthquake.

“There will be those businesses, in retail for example, that recover reasonably quickly and continue to provide a strong service to the district. This subsidy is for those that simply can’t operate for an extended period and who don’t have business continuity insurance.”

Mr Joyce said the subsidy is complemented by other programmes, including the Government’s primary sector support package from Minister Guy and the tax relief measures announced this morning by Minister Woodhouse.

“The Government will continue to keep under review the time period for which the employment subsidy scheme applies, and the geographical coverage of the scheme,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This remains a fluid situation. We retain the flexibility to respond further if required.”
