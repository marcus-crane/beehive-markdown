The families of the Pike River victims and Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith met in Greymouth tonight to discuss work on decommissioning the mine and progressing the memorial track through Paparoa National Park.

“This is an emotional time for families, given Saturday’s sixth anniversary of the tragedy which claimed the lives of 29 men. That’s why Solid Energy agreed to defer work on decommissioning the mine this week,” Dr Smith says.

“I have confirmed to the families that Solid Energy has completed the first phase of work for the permanent seal 30m into the drift. Solid Energy has a legal obligation to comply with an improvement notice issued by the High Hazards Unit of WorkSafe New Zealand to complete a ‘Type C’ seal by the end of November. About a week of work is required to meet this legal requirement. The site needs to be made safe so it can be returned to the Department of Conservation for inclusion in the Paparoa National Park.

“I also discussed advice I’ve received that there’s no new information which changes Solid Energy’s view that safe re-entry of the mine is not possible. Monitored methane levels in the drift beyond the new seal have been rapidly increasing and are approaching the levels in the remainder of the drift of 95 per cent, as expected. 

“I remain doubtful of claims that the mine can be safely re-entered. The mine is full of methane and is likely to have residual heat sources capable of triggering an explosion if there was a source of oxygen. There is the added risk of rock falls.

“Pike River Mine has only one exit route and that remains a fundamental flaw for the safety of any re-entry. The Government has spent more than $5 million trying to find a safe way of re-entering the mine and we support the conclusion that it is not practically possible.

“I do appreciate the huge loss families have faced with the loss of loved ones at Pike and the added pain of not being able to recover their men. However, you cannot justify putting further lives at risk. We must also ensure mining companies like Solid Energy comply with safety requirements from WorkSafe New Zealand under the new Health and Safety at Work Act.”
