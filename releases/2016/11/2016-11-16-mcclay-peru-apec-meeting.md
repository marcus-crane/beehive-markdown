Trade Minister Todd McClay travels to Peru today to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting in Lima where he expects to hold talks on RCEP, FTAAP and TPP.

Mr McClay will join trade and foreign ministers from 20 other APEC economies which account for half of global trade and 60 per cent of world GDP.

“The Asia Pacific region remains a top trade focus for New Zealand. At this time it is important New Zealand continues to show leadership in defence of open markets and fair trade access,” says Mr McClay.

“This year’s meeting is an opportunity to discuss new ways to boost economic growth by increasing competitiveness and removing trade barriers for services.

“This is an area which aligns with the work we are doing in New Zealand to get the best deal for consumers and businesses through a refreshed approach to our trade policy strategy,” says Mr McClay.

Ministers will also discuss APEC’s objective of creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific; policies to support the future skilled workforce; and how to enhance the regional food market.

In the margins of the APEC meeting, Mr McClay will meet with some of his trade counterparts to discuss wider trade issues, including on RCEP and TPP.

The APEC Ministerial Meeting comes ahead of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting on 19 – 20 November, which the Prime Minister will attend.  Mr McClay will accompany the Prime Minister during the Leader’s meeting.

APEC brings together all the major economies in the Asia Pacific Region: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.
