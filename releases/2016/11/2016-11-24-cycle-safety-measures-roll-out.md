A range of regulatory changes combined with record investment will further improve cycle safety this summer, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Cycling is an increasingly popular mode of transport, past time and sport. It’s also a vital part of a safe, sustainable, connected and integrated transport system,” Mr Foss says.

“The Government is making a range of regulatory changes to help ensure cyclists stay safe on our roads, and that all road users are aware of their responsibilities.”

Changes to the Road User Rule, which come into force 1 December, will:

- Allow drivers to use flush medians when passing cyclists.
- Increase the minimum distance that cycle lights must be visible to others and extend the period of time when cycle lights must be used.
- Extend intersection give-way and stop sign rules to places where cycle paths or shared paths cross roads.
- Formally recognise shared lane — or ‘Sharrow’ — road markings, used to indicate where cyclists should ride to remain visible to others.

“The Government is committed to making cycling a safer and even more attractive transport choice,” Mr Foss says. 

“The $333 million Urban Cycleways Programme — New Zealand’s single biggest investment in cycling infrastructure — involves 54 projects across 22 local authorities.

“We’re also delivering a number of other major cycling projects through the National Land Transport Fund, including ‘clip-on’ cycle lanes on bridges.”

Mr Foss says the regulatory changes announced today are part of the Government’s broad package of work addressing the recommendations of the Cycling Safety Panel.

“Transport officials continue to explore the feasibility of minimum overtaking distances, rules around cycling on footpaths, and regulations for e-bikes and low-powered vehicles.

“Further changes are on the way to encourage trucks to use side cameras and close-proximity monitoring systems. These devices increase awareness of other road users, and can help improve the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.”
