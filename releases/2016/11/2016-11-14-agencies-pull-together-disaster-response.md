HMNZS Canterbury will support the ongoing response in the Kaikoura region, which has been hardest-hit by today’s events.

Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says viewing the region from the air revealed extensive damage to essential connections and basic infrastructure.

“The Prime Minister and I have now seen first-hand the numerous major slips, which have isolated Kaikoura from the north and south,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The widespread destruction caused by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks will take considerable time and resources to repair.

“The roads and railways are things that can be repaired in time but it’s important to think of those who lost their lives today or suffered injuries.

“Our immediate priority is ensuring delivery of clean water, food and other essentials to the residents of Kaikoura and the estimated 1000 tourists in the town.

“The New Zealand Defence Force has been tasked with delivering the essential items Civil Defence is asking for – first by NH90 helicopters, which have already made a number of runs, and also on board the Canterbury.

“Other areas affected by today’s earthquakes and consequential landslides, including Hanmer, Waiau and Marlborough, have adequate communication and supplies at this stage.

“The economic impact on earthquake-affected areas will also be assessed in the coming days.

“Any suggestions the Earthquake Commission will be financially stretched in meetings its obligations are ill-founded. EQC is guaranteed by the Crown.

“This has been a trying day for communities across many parts of the country, particularly those on the east coast of the South Island and Wellington region.

“Agencies will continue monitoring the situation closely. The public should be advised that aftershocks will continue to occur.

“It’s important that people look out for each other,” Mr Brownlee says.
