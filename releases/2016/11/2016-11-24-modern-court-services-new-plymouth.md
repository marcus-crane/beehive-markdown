Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams has welcomed the completion of New Plymouth Courthouse’s $3.9 million upgrade.

“The renovations are the largest upgrade to New Plymouth’s 50-year old court,” says Ms Adams.

“The upgraded courthouse includes a refreshed registry space bringing all court registry staff into the one building, and creating one contact point for court customers.

“We’ve also added a new duty solicitors interview room within the courtroom and a public waiting foyer within the existing building. This will make court services more easily accessible to those who use them.”

Further upgrades have been made to the holding cells and to fire safety, following existing audio-visual upgrades, to bring the Court up to modern standards.

Judges will now have access to new facilities including a new chamber, common room and an extra work area for Judges’ staff.

“I’d like to thank everyone who has been involved in this project and those who have demonstrated patience whilst the upgrade has been ongoing,” says Ms Adams. 

“Ensuring New Zealanders can access modern court services is a priority for the Government. This courthouse delivers that for the New Plymouth community.”

New Plymouth deals with more than 3000 cases a year. It houses 22 staff and three resident judges.
