The addition of 12 new eGates at Christchurch airport will improve international travellers’ airport experience says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“Eight new eGates are being installed in Customs’ arrivals area and four in the departures area,” Ms Wagner says.

“We are replacing the six older SmartGates with the next generation eGates, and adding six more, to provide travellers with a faster one-step process that takes around 25 seconds.”

“This additional border processing capacity will support the continued growth in international visitor arrivals through Christchurch airport. A record 6.31 million passengers travelled in and out of Christchurch Airport in the 2016 financial year, up from 5.9 million last year – the most passengers the airport has ever handled in a single year.

“Christchurch Airport estimates new and additional services will bring in an additional 50,000 international visitors over the next 12 months.

“The government’s $6.6 million investment in expanding and modernising automated passport processing supports the provision of border services that protect and promote New Zealand and advance our economy.

“Giving New Zealand, Australian, US, UK, and Canadian ePassport holders the option of completing Customs checks using the electronic process allows legitimate travellers to cross the border easily, and enables Customs officers to focus on those who are high risk,” Ms Wagner says.
