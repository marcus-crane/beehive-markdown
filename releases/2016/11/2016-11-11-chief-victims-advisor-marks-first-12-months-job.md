Justice Minister Amy Adams has congratulated Dr Kim McGregor on her first year as the inaugural Chief Victims Advisor to Government.

“Dr McGregor has quickly become a valuable and trusted source of independent advice to me as Justice Minister, and to senior officials across the justice sector,” says Ms Adams.

“Dr McGregor has contributed to a number of cross-agency initiatives, and is a visible presence across sector work as a member of senior government and governance boards working to improve outcomes for victims.

“The Government is committed to making positive changes in areas such as sexual and family violence, where the challenges are complex and victims’ voices can often get lost while they try to navigate the numerous government and social services available to them.”

Ms Adams says Dr McGregor has provided particularly useful advice relating to the support victims need to help them through the justice system and specialist restorative justice services in sexual violence cases.

“She is to be commended for her determination and energy in bringing victims' perspectives to the attention of Ministers and government agencies,” says Ms Adams.

“I look forward to our ongoing close working relationship as the Government continues to focus on reducing family and sexual violence and keeping victims safe.”

Dr McGregor was [appointed](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/inaugural-chief-victims-advisor-government-appointed) to the role on 12 November 2015.
