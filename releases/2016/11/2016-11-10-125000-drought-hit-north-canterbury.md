A funding boost of $125,000 will help North Canterbury farmers deal with ongoing drought conditions, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“North Canterbury has suffered through unusually dry conditions for nearly three years now. Recent rain has helped and been a morale boost, but there is still a way to go yet,” says Mr Guy, speaking at the Canterbury A&P Show today.

The funding will go to Hurunui Mayoral Fund and be used for:

- Technical workshops on re-grassing
- Financial management skills
- Ongoing community events
- Facilitating farmer peer groups to provide support and advice.

“The official medium scale adverse event declaration expires at the end of this year. It’s pleasing to see the rest of the South Island is in much better shape, but this extra support is still needed in North Canterbury.

“In total the Government has already provided around $610,000 for recovery measures in this region. This is made up of $430,000 from the Ministry for Primary Industries and $180,000 from Ministry for Social Development in Rural Assistance Payments (RAPs) which will be available for those in real hardship until 28 February 2017.

“I’m very proud of how the local community has rallied to support farmers, particularly the work done by Doug Archbold and the local Rural Support Trust and Hurunui Mayor Winton Dalley as Chair of the North Canterbury Drought Committee.

“Local agribusiness and industry groups have been generous in their support. They have provided sponsorship and speakers for technical events, helped get a group of 100 farmers to the National Fieldays, contributed to a Mystery Trip in North Canterbury, and held numerous events with celebrity guest speakers. They have also contributed to smaller gatherings, such as barbecues and morning teas, and made time for chats around the kitchen table.

“All of this has really helped to shore up morale and show farmers they are not alone.”

At Fieldays earlier this year the Government also announced a $600,000 funding boost for rural mental health services, on top of $500,000 announced last year.
