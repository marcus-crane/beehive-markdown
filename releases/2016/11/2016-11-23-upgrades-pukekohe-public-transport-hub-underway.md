Transport Minister Simon Bridges has marked the start of work on the second stage of an upgrade to Pukekohe Station in Auckland.

The $16 million project will integrate bus and rail services into one station.

Six new bus bays will connect to the existing rail platform via a new overbridge. There will be 87 park and ride spaces, passenger waiting areas, better bike storage and improved security to make the area safer.

“Public transport across Pukekohe will be much more accessible and efficient once the new station is complete,” Mr Bridges says.

“The south is the largest future urban growth area in Auckland. Public transport will play a key role in ensuring communities like Pukekohe continue to thrive, giving people easy access to jobs, education and services.”

Mr Bridges says the upgrade is part of the Government’s support for public transport to serve and encourage growth.

“The new station will work alongside the newly launched bus network to give more frequent and direct services across South Auckland so that bus and train timetables can be aligned to work together.

“It will also cater for active modes with new facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.”

The first stage of the project, which began in July, has included the installation of traffic lights at the Custom Street and Manukau Road intersection to help buses and pedestrians travel more safely across Manukau Road.

The station upgrade is expected to be completed next year.
