The final inscribed marble panel on the front of Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial is being placed today, says Associate Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner.

“The Memorial Wall consists of 517 panels of Italian marble, which have been placed on a concrete base wall over the past two months. The names of those who lost their lives in the earthquakes and supporting text have been carefully inscribed using a sandblaster onto 21 panels,” Ms Wagner says.

“The memorial is significant because it gives us a chance to honour those who lost their lives during the earthquakes, the courage of the first responders, and remember the events that changed Canterbury forever.

“Ōtākaro Limited, Christchurch City Council, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and the Ministry of Culture of Heritage have worked closely with families, those who were severely injured and first responders through the development of the design for the memorial.

“The Crown has contributed $10 million to the project and $1 million has come from the Christchurch Earthquake Mayoral Relief Fund.

“I look forward to the completion of the wall in time for the sixth anniversary of the February 22, 2011, earthquake next year,” Ms Wagner says.
