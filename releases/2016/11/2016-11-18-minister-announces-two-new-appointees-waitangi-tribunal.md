Minister for Māori Development, Te Ururoa Flavell has appointed two prominent Māori academics to the Waitangi Tribunal.

Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith (Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Porou) and Dr Thomas Roa (Ngāti Maniapoto, Waikato Tainui) will join the Tribunal.

Minister Flavell says the new appointees are a great addition to the Tribunal.

“Professor Smith and Dr Roa are highly regarded for their expertise and extensive background in research and in historical knowledge,” Minister Flavell says.

“Members of the Tribunal investigate and report on claims made against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, which includes assessing large quantities of historical, traditional and legal evidence. Both members possess these imperative skills.”

Professor Smith and Dr Roa join Dr Aroha Harris, Basil Morrison, Dr Robyn Anderson and Dr Ann Parsonson who have all been reappointed to the Tribunal for three-year terms.

Minister Flavell acknowledged the outstanding service of Sir Tamati Reedy and Sir Douglas Kidd who have been members of the Tribunal since 2010 and 2004 respectively.
