Trade Minister Todd McClay and opposition MPs will travel to Europe and Iran over the next week to take part in a number of trade-related events.  

 

Mr McClay says New Zealand needs to engage more broadly in trade-related activities in Europe and this mission would offer a valuable opportunity to promote New Zealand goods and services in these lucrative markets.  

"Italy, France and the United Kingdom are collectively worth more than $9.2 billion of two-way trade and are home to 190 million consumers.  That is significant.

“The mission will engage directly with New Zealand businesses and their counterparts in these three countries and we will look to open doors to further enhance our high quality reputation and trade presence.  

“I am grateful to New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP, the Right Honourable Winston Peters for agreeing to participate in the business-focused legs of the Europe visit,” says Mr McClay.

 

The Trade Minister will then travel to Iran with a delegation of 17 New Zealand companies.

“Iran has traditionally been a very important market for our sheep meat and butter. Earlier this year the visiting Iranian Foreign Minister said Iran presented a $1 billion prospect for New Zealand. This mission will be an important first step towards delivering on this exciting opportunity,” says Mr McClay.  

Labour has designated their Trade spokesman David Clark to join the Iran delegation.

Mr McClay will also visit Warsaw to lobby the Polish government for an EU-NZ FTA.
