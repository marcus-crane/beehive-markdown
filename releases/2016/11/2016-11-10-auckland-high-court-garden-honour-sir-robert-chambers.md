Justice Minister Amy Adams today announced the garden at the Auckland High Court would be developed as a memorial garden in memory of former High Court Judge, Sir Robert Chambers.

“This is a fitting tribute to someone who served the law with distinction and was highly regarded among New Zealand’s legal fraternity,” says Ms Adams.

Sir Robert began practice as a barrister in 1981 and was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1992. He was made a High Court judge in 1999 and an Appeal Court judge in 2004. He was appointed to the Supreme Court at the end of 2011.

“He cultivated a reputation as one of New Zealand’s great legal minds and will be remembered by the legal fraternity for his sharp intellect and great wit.”

Sir Robert’s family requested that any memorial to him be in Auckland, where he practiced.

“This memorial garden will be a fitting tribute to the late Justice Chambers.”

Construction on the garden will begin in December and is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.

Ms Adams made the announcement in Auckland today alongside Lady Chambers.
