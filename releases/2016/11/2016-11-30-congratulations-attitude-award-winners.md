Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner have congratulated the winners of the Attitude Awards, which recognise the exceptional contributions made by disabled New Zealanders.

“This year the Ministry of Health sponsored the Making a Difference Award, which is given to an individual who has made a significant contribution to improving the lives of disabled people,” says Dr Coleman.

“By providing more opportunities for disabled people to participate in sports, recreation, employment and the arts, the individuals nominated for this award are helping to improve the health and wellbeing of disabled people.”

Ms Wagner says that the awards show the significant contribution disabled people and others are making to our communities.

“The people recognised at the awards last night are individuals who are motivated and determined to do great things for others and for their communities,” says Ms Wagner.

“The awardees are showing us what true leadership looks like. This includes the courage to put yourself and your ideas forward, the perseverance to pursue your dreams in the face of obstacles and the desire to make things better for others.

“I would like to congratulate the winners, the finalists, the nominees and all the dedicated people who support others to achieve great things,” says Ms Wagner.
