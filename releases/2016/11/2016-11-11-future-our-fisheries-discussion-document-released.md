Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is encouraging people to have their say on new proposals to modernise and future-proof New Zealand’s fisheries management system.

‘The Future of our Fisheries’ is a major programme of work to improve the sustainable benefits enjoyed by all New Zealanders,” says Mr Guy.

“Our fisheries management system has been recognised as one of the world’s best. However, we need to keep looking at ways to improve the system, especially as the Quota Management System (QMS) is now 30 years old and the Fisheries Act 20 years old.”   

Three strategic proposals are outlined in the discussion document released today:

- **Maximising Value from our Fisheries**: including potential new rules on discarding, building our market position, and delivering value from new or underdeveloped fisheries.
  
  **Better Fisheries Information:** including the use of cameras and electronic monitoring on boats, research at finer geographic scales, and using externally commissioned research.
- **Agile and Responsive Decision-Making:** including more flexible decision making and a possible new National Fisheries Advisory Council.

There are also two proposed regulatory changes outlined. The first is to roll out the Integrated Electronic Monitoring and Reporting System (IERMS), which includes cameras, geospatial monitoring and electronic reporting. The second is to provide more flexibility for developing new trawl technologies.

“These are detailed documents with practical proposals to improve our fisheries. I encourage anyone with an interest in fisheries management to read it and have your say.

“A new Technical Advisory Group is also being formed to give expert, independent advice on these proposals. The members cover all sectors and are Sir Rob Fenwick as the Chair, along with Harry Burkhardt, Graeme Sinclair, Lesley Campbell and Graham Stuart.”

A review of fisheries management was first announced in August 2015 and initial engagement was held from October to December 2015, which included stakeholder and public meetings across New Zealand.

For the Future of our Fisheries programme, public consultation meetings including hui and workshops will be held over the next two months across the country. Submissions close Friday 23 December.

A full copy of the document and information on where public meetings will be held is available at [http://mpi.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations/future-of-our-fisheries](http://mpi.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations/future-of-our-fisheries).
