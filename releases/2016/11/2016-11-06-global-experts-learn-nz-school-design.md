New Zealand’s innovative and student-centred approach to designing schools will be showcased for international education experts visiting Auckland and Christchurch this week, Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

A delegation of representatives from OECD countries including Ireland, Greece, Japan, Turkey and Mexico are holding their annual meeting in New Zealand this year, to share information on effective learning environments.

“New Zealand’s schools are of great interest in the international community,” Ms Parata says. “Our curriculum puts the students at the centre of learning, and each school has a unique vision for how it delivers quality teaching and learning.

“Decisions about learning environments are made with a clear focus on what best supports students to learn. Flexible learning spaces are popular in New Zealand as they allow a wide range of teaching and learning approaches.”

The delegates will visit successful schools in Auckland and Christchurch, where spaces are designed to support students’ learning.

“These delegates are highly respected experts on effective learning environments, and they come from very different cultures and contexts,” Ms Parata says.

In Auckland, the delegation will visit Ormiston Primary School, which includes a satellite unit of Kelston Deaf Education Centre, Ormiston Junior College, Ellerslie Primary School and Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Puau Te Moananui-a-Kiwa.

In Christchurch, they will visit Halswell School, Waitakiri Primary School and Marshland School, which have all been completely rebuilt since the Canterbury earthquakes.

The five-day visit starts with a welcome in Auckland on Sunday 6 November, and ends with the Christchurch school visits on Thursday 10 November.
