Transport Minister Simon Bridges turned the sod on a long awaited transport project in Queenstown today along with recently elected Mayor of the Queenstown Lakes District, Jim Boult.

The Eastern Access Road, to be known as Hawthorne Drive, will allow traffic not needing to travel into central Queenstown to bypass the busy BP roundabout at the junction of SH6 and 6A.

The $21.8 million project is being jointly funded by Queenstown Lakes District Council and the Government through the New Zealand Transport Agency. It will be completed by the end of 2017.

“Hawthorne Drive is a key part of the arterial network for the Frankton Flats area that will provide considerable relief for motorists. By 2026, traffic modelling data shows the new road will be used by 6000 vehicles a day and that number will double to 12,000 by 2041,” Mr Bridges says.

The Minister also announced work will begin in early 2017 to build a second lane on the western side of the roundabout heading into Queenstown.

“These two much needed projects will together reduce congestion and improve access to Queenstown. They are part of the Government’s programme of investment to respond to growth in the area.”

Work is also continuing on the new two-lane Kawarau Falls Bridge which is under construction and due for completion later next year.
