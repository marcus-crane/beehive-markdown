Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat David Nicholson as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Samoa.

“Samoa is a close and long-standing friend, and an important partner for New Zealand in the Pacific,” Mr McCully says.

“Our relationship is founded on the Treaty of Friendship and strong ongoing economic, political and cultural links. We also work closely together on a range of regional initiatives and through the Pacific Forum.”

Mr Nicholson has worked on Pacific development issues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade since 2012 and is currently Divisional Manager - Melanesia and Micronesia. He will also be accredited to American Samoa.
