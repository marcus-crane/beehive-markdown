The 0800 779 997 Government Helpline has been activated to assist people needing financial and other support following the November 14 earthquake, Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley say.

The 0800 779 997 number will operate seven days a week from 7am to 9pm until further notice.

“The Helpline provides a one-stop source of information on the services and assistance available to people affected by the emergency,” Mr Brownlee says.

The service will link people to the appropriate government and non-government agencies.

“The 0800 779 997 Government Helpline is being co-ordinated and operated by MSD.

“Staff are authorised to grant civil defence payments for those directly affected by the earthquake, for items such as food, bedding and clothing as well as for accommodation and loss of income,” says Mrs Tolley.

Call volumes will be monitored by the Ministry and the helpline will be staffed according to demand.
