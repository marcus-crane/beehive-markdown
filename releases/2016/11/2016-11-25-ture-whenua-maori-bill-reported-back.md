“I thank the committee for its deliberation on the Bill and I will take the time to fully consider their recommendations,” says Minister Flavell.

“I would also like to thank the many Māori land owners, trustees, organisations and others for their considered and constructive feedback on the Bill that contributed to further strengthening the Bill.”

“This Bill is another milestone in our journey to recognise and enhance the mana and tino rangatiratanga Māori have always exercised over their whenua, resources and taonga.

“The Bill will provide a clearer and more empowering legal framework for Māori land owners and governors, giving them more ability to make decisions about how their land is governed and how it is used.

As part of the wider Māori land reforms, Mr Flavell says work is continuing on key matters such as providing better solutions for landlocked Māori land, improving the way the rating system works for Māori land, addressing issues with the Public Works Act and designing the Māori Land Service.
