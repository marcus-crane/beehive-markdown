Prime Minister John Key departs for Peru this afternoon to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ meeting from November 19-20.

“This year’s APEC is focused on improving growth and living standards through initiatives such as more effective trade in services and trade liberalisation,” Mr Key says.

In Lima, Mr Key will meet bilaterally with a number of political leaders, and will attend both the APEC Leaders’ and TPP Leaders’ meetings. He will also speak at the APEC CEO Summit on ‘Redesigning Trade’.

“The Asia Pacific region accounts for almost three quarters of our total trade and is home to some of our most important international partners.

“APEC provides a valuable opportunity to promote New Zealand as a good place to do business and invest in, and I look forward to my discussions there.”

Mr Key will return on November 22.
