A $4.9 million network of new cycling and walking paths across Mt Roskill is complete.

The Mt Roskill Safe Routes project is a series of widened footpaths and road designs to help slow traffic down and provide a low traffic, low speed environment for pedestrians and cyclists.

Transport Minister Simon Bridges and Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff officially opened the new network in Mt Roskill today, alongside local list MP Parmjeet Parmar.

“These footpaths create a safer route for local children to walk or cycle to school as well as better connections for those wanting to commute or access the educational facilities at UNITEC in neighbouring Mt Albert,” Mr Bridges says.

The network connects to existing shared paths alongside Dominion Road and State Highway 20 which has created a link to Onehunga, Mangere and the Airport.

“These new routes will play an important role in West Auckland’s cycling network, together with the Waterview Shared Path, the Northwestern Cycleway and the upcoming route from New Lynn to Avondale.

“By creating this network we’re encouraging people to walk and cycle to access local open spaces, community facilities and places of interest, which will help us achieve our goal of Auckland becoming a cycle-friendly city.”
