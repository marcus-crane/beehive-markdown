Around $1.5 million will be invested to deliver a total of five new classrooms at schools in Blenheim and Nelson, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The schools are:

- Whitney Street School, Blenheim – two new classrooms
- Birchwood School, Nelson – one new classroom
- Stoke School, Nelson – two new classrooms.

“Across New Zealand, regions such as Blenheim and Nelson are experiencing population growth, and this is having a flow-on effect on school rolls,” says Ms Parata.

“We’re committed to providing new classrooms for schools that need extra capacity.”

Today’s announcement is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 classrooms nationwide to meet roll growth.

“Under the first round of funding announced in June, Motueka High School will receive around $1 million for three new classrooms,” says Ms Parata.

A third round of investments is expected in February next year.

“As with all new classrooms, the focus of these latest investments will be on providing flexible learning spaces that support an innovative learning environment.

“We want to support students to achieve to the very best of their potential, and providing the right physical learning environment is an important part of this.”

Birchwood and Stoke Schools are both members of the Akonga Whakatu (Stoke) Community of Learning (CoL), while Whitney Street School belongs to the Blenheim CoL. Communities of Learning encourage schools to work together to lift student achievement.
