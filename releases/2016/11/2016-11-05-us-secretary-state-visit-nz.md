Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the announcement that US Secretary of State John Kerry will visit New Zealand next week.

“The upcoming visit by Secretary Kerry is a valuable opportunity to canvass the many positive developments in the New Zealand – US relationship this year, including the recent visit by Vice President Biden in July,” Mr McCully says.

“Our two countries are natural partners on a range of issues including the protection of the world’s oceans. This was on display last week when a joint NZ-US proposal was adopted, creating the world’s largest marine protected area in the Ross Sea.

“We will also discuss matters currently before the United Nations Security Council, in particular the plight of civilians in besieged areas of Syria.”

Secretary Kerry will travel to Wellington for meetings with the Prime Minister and Minister McCully, and to lay a wreath at New Zealand’s National War Memorial.
