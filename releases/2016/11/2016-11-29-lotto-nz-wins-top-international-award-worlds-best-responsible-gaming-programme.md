Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne is delighted to announce that Lotto New Zealand has received the highest possible accolade for its responsible gaming programme.

Lotto NZ has recently been awarded the grand prize in the World Lottery Association’s biennial Responsible Gaming Awards – the ‘Best Overall Responsible Gaming Programme’.

The World Lottery Association (WLA) sets the international benchmark for responsible gaming and presented this award at its annual World Lottery Summit, in Singapore earlier this month.

The ‘Best Overall Responsible Gaming Programme’ award recognises excellence, showcases best practice and innovation in corporate social responsibility, and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the lottery industry.

“Lotto NZ has set high standards for providing a safe and trustworthy environment for its players.

“This award acknowledges the importance Lotto NZ places on operating in a socially responsible manner by delivering a world-beating gaming programme of the highest integrity”, said Mr Dunne.

Lotto NZ’s responsible gaming programme puts emphasis on education for staff and retailers, providing information and support to customers in-store and online, as well as unique and innovative design and marketing of its games. It is accredited to Level 4 (out of four possible levels) under the WLA’s Responsible Gaming Framework.

In receiving this award, Lotto NZ’s is considered to have the best overall programme of all international lotteries that also share the highest level of accreditation by the World Lottery Association.

“Lotto NZ exists to provide safe gaming that allows New Zealanders to play and win, while contributing money back to New Zealand communities.

“To be recognised as the most socially responsible organisation in a very competitive international gaming market makes this award all the more satisfying because it underscores the integrity of the Lotto gaming model and the confidence New Zealanders can enjoy in playing the range of games offered by Lotto.

“The Board and Management of Lotto NZ are to be congratulated in achieving this outstanding Award”, Mr Dunne said.

Last year, Lotto NZ transferred $204 million to the NZ Lottery Grants Board for funding of community causes. Lottery funding is a major source of funding for Sport New Zealand, Creative New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission and over 3,000 community organisations and projects every year.
