Around 40 South Island young people and people working in the youth sector are being supported to attend the SingularityU New Zealand Summit, which kicked off in Christchurch yesterday, says Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley.

Organised by Singularity University, a Silicon Valley based think tank, the three day summit aims to inspire and educate participants in how technology can be harnessed to create change and build a positive future.

“Technology is developing at an incredible rate and will be pivotal to how tomorrow’s leaders solve business and social challenges,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This is why we’re supporting enterprising young people and people working with youth to attend the summit, where they can be inspired by internationally renowned experts and learn more about the technological advances that are transforming our world.

“Total funding of $40,000 to support these attendees is being provided by the Government and philanthropic organisation the Rata Foundation, via the newly established Ministry of Youth Development Partnership Fund.

“This fund is about the Government coinvesting with business and philanthropic partners to increase the number of youth development opportunities available in New Zealand.”
