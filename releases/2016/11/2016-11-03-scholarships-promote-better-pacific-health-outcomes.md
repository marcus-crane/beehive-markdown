Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging Pacific students interested in any aspects of health studies to apply for the 2017 Pacific Health Scholarships.

“The scholarships are open to Pacific students committed to improving Pacific health across a range of disciplines. It is not just medicine and nursing. I want to see more Pacific students qualifying in related health specialties such as physical science, nutrition, dental hygiene, physiotherapy, midwifery or psychology for example,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Government has a number of programmes targeted at improving the health and wellbeing of Pacific people in New Zealand. Having specialist Pacific practitioners is an important part of promoting better health outcomes for Pacific peoples. ”

“These scholarships help boost the number of Pacific people across the health workforce. This workforce is better able to cater for the diverse needs of Pacific peoples,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Scholarships have been awarded to 540 pacific students since 2013.

“With a total budget of $1.4 million, the Ministry of Health run scholarships can pay the course fees for students. In 2016 168 scholarships were awarded,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
