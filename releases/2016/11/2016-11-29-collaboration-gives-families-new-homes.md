The first of 14 families have begun moving into a new block of apartments in Auckland which are the result of a partnership between government agencies and community housing providers, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

“I am delighted that Housing New Zealand, the Ministry of Social Development and three providers have worked together to ensure that 14 vulnerable families have somewhere safe and secure to live and where they will receive the help they need to address issues that may be holding them back,” Mrs Bennett says.

The Glen Eden apartments were bought by Housing New Zealand (HNZ) from a developer. Community provider VisionWest has leased the block and is sub-leasing some units to Monte Cecilia and Airedale Properties with support from LifeWise. They will provide wraparound services for tenants with funding from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).

“A stable home is important in helping people get back on their feet. Providing these families with intensive support and social services is good for the parents, their children and their communities,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Government is growing the community provider sector in social housing through partnerships such as this and through social housing transfers such as in Tauranga and the newly announced Christchurch transfer.

“Community providers play an incredibly important role in our communities and have the expertise and experience to make a real difference in the lives of social housing tenants.

“Partnerships such as this one in Glen Eden are just one part of our Government’s comprehensive housing plan. Our focus is on delivering safe, warm, permanent housing while also responding to the need for short- to medium-term social housing.”

In April 2014 the Government made community housing providers (CHPs) eligible to house new tenants as part of its Social Housing Reform Programme.

Additional support for providers includes:

- Allowing MSD to negotiate contracts for the Income Related Rent Subsidy, giving CHPs a long-term Government-backed income stream.
- $33 million in Budget 2016 for CHPs to provide emergency housing.
- $304 million invested in emergency housing over the next four years including $71 million in rental subsidies and $102 million for providers to support, stabilise and help tenants into longer-term housing.
- $144 million for CHPs to increase the supply of social housing in Auckland, including upfront development grants and rental subsidies.
- $9 million over two years to assist CHPs to support tenants into housing independence.
- Establishment of a panel of CHPs to deliver additional emergency and transitional housing.
