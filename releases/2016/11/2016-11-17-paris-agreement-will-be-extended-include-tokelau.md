Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett has announced New Zealand’s intention to extend ratification of both the Climate Change Convention and the Paris Agreement to include Tokelau.

Minister Bennett was speaking from Marrakech where countries who signed up to the Paris Agreement have just convened the historic first meeting of Parties to the Agreement. 

“This is a significant step, not only for Tokelau, but also for New Zealand and for the Pacific,” Minister Bennett says.

“New Zealand and Pacific countries are serious about addressing climate change at home and in the world, particularly in the Pacific where we can really help to make a difference.

“We are providing up to $200 million for climate-related support over four years, the majority of which will benefit the Pacific. We’ll be building stronger public infrastructure, supporting clean and affordable energy, strengthening disaster preparedness, and supporting low-carbon economic growth.

“I have seen for myself the projects New Zealand already has under way. Tuvalu is on course to generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and in Tokelau, all three atolls are now effectively 100 percent renewable energy from solar generation.

“New Zealand and Pacific countries are aligned in pushing for a strong global response to climate change and I look forward to working with all Pacific countries to further the work we have started in Marrakech.”
