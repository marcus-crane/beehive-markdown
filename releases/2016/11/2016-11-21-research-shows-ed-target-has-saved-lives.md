Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes new research which shows that the shorter stays in Emergency Departments (ED) target has contributed to a 50 per cent reduction in the number of patient deaths.

“The Government introduced a national target in 2009 to shorten the length of stay by patients in ED to help reduce overcrowding, improve health outcomes for patients, and improve acute hospital services,” says Dr Coleman.

“New research by a team of researchers at Auckland University shows the target has provided a strong impetus for DHBs to focus on improving their acute services.

“This is the first time a comprehensive study of EDs across the country has been carried out. It found a significant decrease in mortality rates among ED patients, with around 700 fewer deaths than predicted in 2012 if pre-target trends had continued.

“The research also found the target has led to an overall reduction in hospital stays by an average of about seven hours, and an increase in available beds, creating capacity for more acute admissions.

“ED stays for all patients have reduced by over an hour, and for patients needing admission to hospital, by about three hours.

“DHBs have invested considerable resources to achieve the ED target. It has required a strong commitment by staff, and major changes to processes.

“We know that when ED and wider hospital teams work collaboratively towards achieving the target then real improvements in patient care can be achieved.”

Dr Coleman today opened the 33rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine in Queenstown.

The latest quarterly results for Quarter One 2016/17 which will be released tomorrow show that 93 per cent of ED patients were admitted, discharged or transferred within six hours.

The research was led by Dr Peter Jones, Director of Emergency Medicine Research at Auckland Hospital and Dr Linda Chalmers from Auckland University. The study included 18 DHBs over seven years, and an in-depth investigation of four case site hospitals.

The research was supported by a $1.1 million project grant from the Health Research Council of New Zealand.
