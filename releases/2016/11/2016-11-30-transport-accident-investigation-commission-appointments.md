Former Chief Legal Advisor for Treasury Jane Meares has been appointed as Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC).

Long serving barrister Richard Marchant has been appointed as a Commissioner.

The appointments are made by the Governor General on the recommendation of Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

“Ms Meares has extensive legal and governance experience and sound leadership skills,” Mr Bridges says.

“Mr Marchant also brings governance expertise with 30 years’ experience in the legal sector.

“Together, these appointments will ensure TAIC continues to have the skills and experience it requires.”

Ms Meares’ term expires in October 2021, and Mr Marchant’s in April 2019.

The role of the TAIC is to determine the circumstances and causes of accidents, to help avoid similar occurrences in the future.
