A special Lotto draw will be held on Saturday 10 December to raise funds for the Kaikoura/Hurunui earthquake relief efforts, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne announced today. The draw will include the Lotto family of games, *Lotto, Powerball* and *Strike*.

“Raising money for the community is the fundamental purpose of Lotto New Zealand, with over $3.5 million in community funding being raised each week.

“It is only fitting therefore, that profits from next Saturday’s special draw go towards relief efforts in Kaikoura/Hurunui and surrounding regions affected by the earthquake.

“Profits from the Lotto draw will help support the affected communities to recover and following the magnitude 7.8 November 14 earthquake”, said Mr Dunne.  

A similar special Lotto draw was held in March 2011 in the wake of the devastating Canterbury earthquake, resulting in over $8 million in lottery funding being allocated to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“The generosity of New Zealanders in 2011 was heartening and provided much needed support to the Canterbury community.  

“Sadly, it’s now our Kaikoura/Hurunui communities that have been the worst affected following the latest earthquakes.  All profits from this special draw will go a long way to help Kaikoura/Hurunui rebuild so I encourage all New Zealanders to support this event.

“I want to thank Lotto NZ and the Lotteries Commission and Grants Board for enabling this to happen”, Mr Dunne said.

The Lottery Grants Board distributes the profits of games run by New Zealand Lotteries to a range of regional, national and statutory bodies, and lottery funding is important funding in building strong, sustainable communities in New Zealand.
