The New Zealand Defence Force will host two large multilateral naval exercises in the Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty from November 13 - 16 in the lead up to the International Naval Review.

Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says the exercises, Nga Tahi and Mahi Tangaroa, have been designed to maximise the training opportunity provided by the presence of ships and personnel from at least 15 international navies.

“Exercise Mahi Tangaroa is the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) Experts’ Working Group on Maritime Security Field Training Exercise, which will see the participating navies intercept fictitious threats to New Zealand’s borders,” Mr Brownlee says.

The exercise comes at the end of New Zealand’s three-year term as co-chair of the Experts Working Group on Maritime Security with Brunei Darussalam.

“Exercise Nga Tahi will provide tailored training for the International Naval Review participants who are not a part of ADMM-Plus, as well as the assets from ASEAN navies that are not participating in Exercise Mahi Tangaroa.

“These exercises are an example of the New Zealand Defence Force’s excellent work in enhancing cooperation throughout our region and international engagement,” Mr Brownlee says.
