Around $650,000 will be invested to build two new classrooms at Paparore School in Northland, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“Paparore School has an increasing roll so we’re investing in extra classrooms to expand the school’s capacity,” says Ms Parata.

“The school is at the heart of the local community, so this investment reinforces our strong commitment to families in the Kaitaia area.”

Today’s announcement is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property nationwide, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth.

“The first round of investments was announced in May and June this year. That saw around $7 million announced for a total of 16 additional classrooms for schools in Northland, including Whangarei Girls’ High School, Parua Bay School and Bay of Islands International Academy,” says Ms Parata.

“At the same time, we also announced around $12 million for a new site and buildings for Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Tonga o Hokianga.”

In 2015, around $20 million was announced for the redevelopment of Northland College and the expansion of Hora Hora School.

“Having the right physical environment is an important contributor to educational success. We want students in Northland to learn in facilities that support and inspire them to achieve to the very best of their potential.”

Paparore School is a member of the Far North Kaitaia Community of Learning. Communities of Learning are about schools working together to help students achieve their full potential.
