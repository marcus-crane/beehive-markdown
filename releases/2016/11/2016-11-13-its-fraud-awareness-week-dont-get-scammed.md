As Fraud Awareness Week kicks off today, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith encourages all New Zealanders to remain vigilant with their personal information.

“Each year, thousands of New Zealanders are contacted by scammers via phone, post or email. For scammers it’s a numbers game – the more people they contact, the better their chance of making a profit,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Scammers often use the names of well-known people or organisations to gain a person’s trust.

“We have several New Zealand agencies working together to stop scams at the source, which is often overseas. But the best way for consumers to protect themselves is to know the warning signs.

“Be wary of phone calls or letters that come out of the blue, or unsolicited emails that ask you to enter personal information such as your pin number or IRD information,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Fraud Awareness Week runs from 13th to 19th November. This year’s theme is “It won’t happen to me”. The awareness campaign in New Zealand is coordinated by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment’s Consumer Protection team.
