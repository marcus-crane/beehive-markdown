Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced the appointment of two new members to the Veterans’ Advisory Board.

Mr Foss last month directed the Board to consider and provide advice on New Zealand’s repatriation policy.

The two new members, Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd) Sir Wira Gardiner KNZM and Kevin Brady CNZM, will serve on the Board for the duration of the repatriation project.

“Sir Wira and Mr Brady bring a wealth of public sector and governance experience to the Board,” Mr Foss says.

Sir Wira was the founding director of the Waitangi Tribunal and founding Chief Executive of the Ministry of Maori Development Te Puni Kokiri. He was made a Knight of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2008 for services to Maori.

Mr Brady served as the 17th Auditor-General of New Zealand, undertaking a number of high profile investigations during his term. He is a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to Public Services.

“I’m confident Sir Wira and Mr Brady will serve the Board well during its consideration of this complex issue,” Mr Foss says.

“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all members for their time and commitment to the Board’s work, particularly on repatriation.”
