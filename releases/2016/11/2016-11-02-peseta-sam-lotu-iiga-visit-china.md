Local Government and Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga leaves for China today to discuss issues across both portfolios.

“This is an opportunity to further strengthen New Zealand’s relationship with China and reinforce the important ties between the peoples of China and New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Chinese municipal authorities are at the forefront of innovation in many areas of infrastructure development. Transport and water control are significant issues. There is much to share around innovative approaches to local government.”

“China is also at the leading edge of international “Smart City” projects.  These provide new evolving opportunities for future community development by leveraging the use of technology.”

The Minister will meet senior Chinese official State Councillor Yang Jiechi and other government officials in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hong Kong between 3 November and 10 November.

“As Minister responsible for Ethnic Communities, I will also be meeting officials from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The office oversees and co-ordinates relationships with Chinese communities internationally.”

“I will be reinforcing the importance of our Chinese communities in New Zealand and will take the opportunity to share New Zealand’s approach to promoting social cohesion and the benefits of ethnic diversity,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“With the increased flow of trade and investment our people to people and cultural relationships become increasingly important,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

**Background:**

Chinese people have been part of New Zealand society since the arrival of Chinese gold miners in the 1850s.

The Chinese community is New Zealand’s third largest ethnic group comprising 171,411 people or 4% of people living in New Zealand.

About 6000 people arrive from China to live in New Zealand every year.

The Free Trade Agreement signed in 2008 has created mutually beneficial conditions for trade and investment. Between 2009 and 2014, total goods trade between New Zealand and China doubled to NZ$20 billion.
