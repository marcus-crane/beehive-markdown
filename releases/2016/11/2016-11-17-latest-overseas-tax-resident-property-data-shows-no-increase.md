Latest figures released by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) again show overseas tax resident buyers are involved in just three percent of New Zealand property transfers, Land Information Minister Louise Upston says.

LINZ released its quarterly report on tax residency and property transfers covering July to September 2016 today which shows transfers involving overseas tax residents are at similar levels to previous quarters on record this year.

“This latest report, although based solely on tax data, does not support the opposition rhetoric of mass purchases by foreigners. The data for both buyers and sellers showed overseas tax residents involved in just three percent of both types of transfer,” Ms Upston says.

“I would stress again that this data is not a register of foreign ownership but is collected as a result of government property tax measures in legislative requirements, to help Inland Revenue follow up on those people who have tax obligations.

“LINZ is also gathering data on transfers involving a home on the land, and the citizenship or visa status of buyers. This shows that approximately two percent of transfers of a home involved buyers who were not New Zealand citizens, residents or visa holders.”

The report on property transfer and tax residency statistics is available on the LINZ website [http://www.linz.govt.nz/land/land-registration/prepare-and-submit-your-dealing/property-tax-compliance-requirements/property-transfers-and-tax-residency-0](http://www.linz.govt.nz/land/land-registration/prepare-and-submit-your-dealing/property-tax-compliance-requirements/property-transfers-and-tax-residency-0)
