The New Zealand Defence Force has accepted offers of help from the United States and Japan militaries as part of the ongoing response to the November 14 earthquake.

Defence Minister and Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says providing essential supplies to Kaikoura and getting tourists out of the region remains the priority while work to assess the scale of the damage continues.

“The district is completely isolated after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent landslides,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The New Zealand Defence Force has mobilised four NH90 helicopters, as well as a New Zealand P-3 Orion.

“The first of the NH90s has retrieved 12 people from Kaikoura this morning and the other three aircraft will continue rotational flights.

“Depending on weather conditions, the goal today is to evacuate about 140 people on a priority list out of Kaikoura. These include tourists whose travel plans have been affected.

“The US Navy has offered two MH60 helicopters, on board its destroyer the USS Sampson, which is currently off the Hauraki Gulf for this week’s International Naval Review.

“The US has also offered the NZDF the use of one of its P-3 Orions to help with surveillance flights.

“NZDF’s offshore patrol vessel, the HMNZS Wellington, is currently on its way to the Kaikoura coast, where it will conduct seabed surveillance to determine whether the HMNZS Canterbury docks at Kaikoura or anchors offshore.

“If the Canterbury anchors offshore, the ship has the capability to use its landing craft to reach affected people in Kaikoura.

“The Canterbury will provide essential supplies – including water, food and chemical toilets – as well as uplifting the bulk of people stranded in Kaikoura.

“Another priority is clearing the inland route to Kaikoura from the south.

“Once reopened, this important access link will help with the delivery of supplies and building materials to Kaikoura,” Mr Brownlee says.
