Prime Minister John Key has today announced the President of the Republic of Hungary, János Áder, will visit New Zealand from November 13-16.

“I am delighted to welcome the President in his first official visit to New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

“His visit comes on the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. This is a significant occasion in our shared history as New Zealand welcomed 1,100 refugees from Hungary at the time who then went on to contribute so much to New Zealand life.

"Hungary is an important partner in New Zealand's efforts to develop even closer relations with the European Union, our second largest trading partner.”

The President will be accompanied to New Zealand by his wife, Ms Anita Herczegh. They will visit Wellington, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty.
