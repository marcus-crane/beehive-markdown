Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has announced that Auckland’s three DHBs will have a single chairperson to increase collaboration across the region to further improve the delivery of health services.

“Between them, Auckland, Waitemata and Counties Manukau DHBs care for a population of almost 1.6 million, around a third of New Zealand’s population,” says Dr Coleman.

“The three DHBs have an operating budget of $4.2 billion for 2016/2017. Since 2009 the Government has increased the DHBs funding by around $1.2 billion.

“As the region grows it’s important to optimise the delivery of health services, manage infrastructure investment and streamline back office functions. 

“Cohesive planning will be key to making this happen and it makes sense to bring the three greater Auckland DHBs under one chair to facilitate a more integrated approach to Auckland’s health services planning and delivery.

“This change will help ensure Aucklanders, now and into the future, will have access to the best possible care no matter where they live in the region.”

Currently Dr Lester Levy chairs Auckland and Waitemata DHB. He will continue with those roles, but will now also chair Counties Manukau DHB.

“Dr Levy has has a strong track record of improving DHB performance and encouraging closer working relationships and streamlining services,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman is finalising DHB appointments across the country. The new boards will start on Monday 5 December.

**Dr Lester Levy bio**

Dr Lester Levy is a medical doctor and the current Chief Executive of the New Zealand Leadership Institute. He is the Chair of the Health Research Council and Chairperson of Auckland Transport.

Dr Levy has strong health sector governance experience. For instance, when Dr Levy was appointed to Waitemata DHB in June 2009, the DHB was the worst performer in the country for the national emergency department health target and ranked as average in most others. Waitemata DHB now consistently performs well across most of the health targets.

Dr Levy has also driven greater financial discipline at both Auckland and Waitemata DHBs. For example, Waitemata DHB had a $4.8 million deficit at the time of Dr Levy’s appointment, in recent years the DHB has consistently performed well financially. Similarly, Auckland DHB has recorded either breakeven or a surplus during Dr Levy’s time as Chair.
