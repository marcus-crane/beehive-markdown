The company which will be a key player in achieving New Zealand’s Predator Free 2050 ambition is now up and running, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

“Today marks the official establishment of Predator Free 2050 Ltd and the appointment of a skilled board of nine directors,” Ms Barry says.

“This company, and its leadership, will be absolutely integral to the success of the Predator Free 2050 programme. Their role will be to direct investment into regionally significant predator eradication projects and the breakthrough science solutions we need to achieve predator free status.”

Formation of the company was signalled in July, when the Government committed to the ambitious goal of eradicating rats, stoats and possums from New Zealand by 2050.

PF2050 Ltd will receive $6 million per year of new Government funding to invest in regionally significant predator eradication projects and break-through science. It is expected to leverage additional contributions from business, local government and philanthropists of approximately $10 million per year.

Combining the current $70 million a year spent on predator control with the additional central and leveraged funding will result in result in a programme of investment estimated at more than $3 billion through to 2050.

Since the announcement in July, DOC and councils have identified 90 current and potential regional-scale projects across public and private land.

“To achieve this goal we all need to work together – we back New Zealanders’ ingenuity, know-how and commitment to achieve the vision.”

Jane Taylor has been appointed as chair of the nine-member Board.  Ms Taylor is also the chair of Landcare Research and NZ Post.

The other eight directors will be Sir Rob Fenwick, Chris Liddell, Jeff Grant, Gary Lane, Traci Houpapa, Warren Parker, David MacLeod and Arihia Bennett. The board is expected to hold its first formal meeting in January.

“The directors have been chosen for their wide range of skills and cross-sector experience. I have absolute confidence they are the right people for the job
