“The American people have spoken and I congratulate Mr Trump on his victory after a long campaign,” Mr Key says.

“I will be writing to Mr Trump to offer my personal congratulations shortly. 

“Our two countries share a strong relationship and I look forward to that continuing. Over the coming months we will be looking to build close ties with the incoming Trump Administration.”
