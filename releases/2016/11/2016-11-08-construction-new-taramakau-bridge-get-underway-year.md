Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the NZ Transport Agency’s announcement that it has awarded the contract for construction of the West Coast’s new $25.8 million Taramakau Bridge to Fulton Hogan.

Work on the new bridge, between Greymouth and Kumara Junction on State Highway 6, will begin before Christmas. The project is part of the Government’s [Accelerated Regional Roading Package](http://www.transport.govt.nz/land/accelerated-regional-roading-package/), announced in 2014 to speed up the delivery of transport projects considered important to regions.

The new two-lane bridge will be constructed 30 metres downstream of the existing single-lane bridge, which was built in the 1880s and also carries rail traffic.

“This has been a long awaited project for the West Coast community and I’m pleased we are delivering on our commitment to bring it forward,” Mr Bridges says.

“With the growing tourism opportunities developing in this region like the Wilderness Trail for cyclists and walkers, a safer, more reliable bridge is imperative.

“The new two lane bridge also means local business operators and residents will no longer have to wait at each end on their daily commutes,” Mr Bridges says.

The new bridge will include a separated off-road, shared facility for pedestrians and cyclists. The rail traffic will remain on the existing bridge, and this separation of road, rail and cycling/ pedestrian traffic will improve both safety and efficiency. The realigned road will pass over the existing rail line south of the river via an overpass. 

The bridge is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
