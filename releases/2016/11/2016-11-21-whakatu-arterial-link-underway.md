Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the start of construction on the Whakatu Arterial Link, a $20.17 million project to improve connections around the key business and employment area of Whakatu.

The Link extends between Pakowhai Road and State Highway 2 to the north-east of Hastings township.

"The Whakatu Arterial Link will improve the safety of key intersections and provide a more efficient and safer alternative route for heavy commercial freight traffic between Whakatu and the Port of Napier," says Mr Bridges.

“Whakatu is one of the region’s key business and employment areas. The improved connections provided by this project will enhance productivity and growth.

“It will also provide a more efficient route between Havelock North, Hawke’s Bay Airport, and Napier's north-western employment and residential areas via the Expressway."

The route is approximately 3.5 kilometres long and roughly follows the course of the Karamu Stream.

The Link is expected to be complete by early 2019.
