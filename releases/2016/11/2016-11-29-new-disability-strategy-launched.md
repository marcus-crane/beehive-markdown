A new Disability Strategy will help disabled New Zealanders to participate and contribute to our communities on an equal basis as others, say Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The vision of the Strategy is to help make New Zealand ‘a non-disabling society, a place where disabled people have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals and aspiration, and all of New Zealand works together to achieve this’,” Ms Wagner says.

“It was developed after a nationwide consultation with disabled people, their families, whānau and supporters. During the two-stage consultation process, more than 1130 people attended workshops held throughout the country and around 770 submissions were received.

“This Disability Strategy has eight outcomes that will guide the direction of government agencies on disability issues for the next 10 years.

“While the Strategy is a stand-alone document, it will work in conjunction with an Outcomes Framework, which will develop specific targets and indicators to measure the success of the strategy.

“A Disability Data and Evidence Plan is also being developed to make sure that the right information is being collected in a useful way to ensure that government decisions are based on the best possible evidence.

“New Zealand has been an international leader on the rights of disabled people and this new Strategy will keep New Zealand right up at the forefront of efforts to uphold the rights of disabled people.

“Our Government is committed to continuing to improve the lives of disabled people and the New Zealand Disability Strategy will ensure we are all working together towards achieving the same vision.”

“I like to thank all of you who have been involved in the creation of this Strategy. Your work will help to shape the lives of disabled people in the future,” Ms Wagner says.

The Strategy is available in a range of accessible formats – large print, EasyRead, Braille, New Zealand Sign Language and audio. Further details are available on the Office for Disability Issues website [www.odi.govt.nz](http://www.odi.govt.nz).
