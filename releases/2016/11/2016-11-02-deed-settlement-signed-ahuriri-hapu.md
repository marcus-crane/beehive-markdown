The Crown has signed a Deed of Settlement with Ahuriri Hapū settling their historical Treaty claims, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Ahuriri Hapū have overcome considerable obstacles to reach this milestone,” Mr Finlayson said. “Historical grievances against the Crown relate to land loss, military actions and adverse Crown polices. Crown actions and omissions left Ahuriri Hapū virtually landless by the beginning of the 20th century.”

The settlement provides an acknowledgement, apology and redress for the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Financial and commercial redress includes $19.5 million and the right to buy shares in the Kaweka and Gwavas Crown Forest Licensed lands. Pakake, Heipipi Pa Historic Reserve and Conservation House in Napier will be vested in Ahuriri Hapū as part of their cultural redress.

The settlement will also establish a permanent statutory committee called Te Komiti Muriwai o Te Whanga to protect and enhance the environmental, economic, social, spiritual, historical and cultural values of Te Muriwai o Te Whanga (Ahuriri Estuary) for present and future generations.

“We can never fully compensate Ahuriri Hapū for the loss and prejudice they have suffered but this settlement provides the foundation for a stronger economic and culture future for their people.

“This is the 81st deed of settlement signed by the Crown and is an important step towards settling all historical grievances in the Hawke’s Bay and New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said.

Ahuriri Hapū are based in and around Napier. The seven Ahuriri Hapū are Ngāti Hinepare, Ngāti Māhu, Ngāti Matepū, Ngāti Paarau (which includes Ngāi Tahu Ahi), Ngāi Tāwhao, Ngāti Tū and Ngāi Te Ruruku.
