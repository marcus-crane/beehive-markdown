Nine communities around New Zealand will receive funding of $10,000 each to deliver the Youth in Emergency Services (YES) programme in 2017, Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

“This programme aims to foster an ongoing, sustainable relationship between young people and the volunteer emergency services,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Young people involved get to build their knowledge and skills, and it’s also a boost for communities which can sometimes find it difficult to attract emergency services volunteers.

“The communities that will deliver the programme in 2017 are in Dargaville, Whangamata, Katikati, Maketu, Blenheim, Nelson, Murchison, Waimakariri and Hokitika.”

Up to 15 young people in each community will have the opportunity to take part.

Participants spend the first phase of the programme familiarising themselves with the work of local participating emergency services, before undertaking a two-month volunteering opportunity with their chosen service.

“This is about growing the capabilities and confidence of young people, and at the same time reinforcing the preparedness and resilience of our communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

To date, twenty-five communities from Kaikohe to Alexandra have been funded to deliver the YES programme, which was piloted in 2013.
