Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand has joined with Egypt and Spain to put forward a UN Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire in the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo.

“The tabling of the joint resolution today follows negotiations between Security Council members over the last two weeks and builds on New Zealand’s efforts during our Presidency of the Security Council in September,” Mr McCully says.

“We have long been of the view that the Security Council needs to live up to its responsibilities and the resolution we have put forward spells out the requirements for a ceasefire, humanitarian access, and a resumption of negotiations in Syria.

“Ultimately a resolution is not going to fix everything in Aleppo, but we need to try and put some pressure on those perpetuating the current violence to change their behaviour. If they are not willing to change their behaviour they need to accept the international condemnation and isolation that results from their actions.

“The presence of a few hundred Al-Nusra terrorists in Eastern Aleppo does not justify an all-out attack on more than 250,000 civilians, the bombing of every hospital in the city, and cutting off the population from aid and outside assistance.

“The resolution has been circulated to Security Council members today and we would like to see it put to a vote as soon as possible,” Mr McCully says.
