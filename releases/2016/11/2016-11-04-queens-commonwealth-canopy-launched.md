Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says the official launch of the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy (QCC) initiative in New Zealand adds impetus to efforts to protect the nation’s native forest.

Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy and Ms Barry celebrated the registration of the first QCC covenant established in New Zealand at Mt Lyford Lodge in Canterbury today.

In partnership with the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust, farmers Sue and Peter Turnbull have covenanted 392 hectares of high-value land at Mt Terako, in the Seaward Kaikoura range.

“Expanding protection of our native forests and their unique trees, plants and animals is essential,” Ms Barry says. “Covenants offer private landowners the opportunity to set aside land with high conservation values for the nation.

“Sue and Peter are to be commended for their foresight and determination to protecting such a special place for future generations to enjoy. On its own, the Mt Terako covenant is significant, but as the first of many QCC registrations to come it takes on even more importance.”

Announced by Prime Minister John Key at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta last November, the QCC is a partnership between The Palace, the Royal Commonwealth Society and conservation charity Cool Earth.

It seeks to create a lasting environmental legacy of Her Majesty the Queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth through a network of conservation programmes focused on rainforest and forest protection.

New Zealand has committed $1 million in additional funding over the next three years for the QEII National Trust to support the QCC.

“I am very pleased our nation has been able to make a contribution to this worthy and far-sighted initiative which will be of great benefit to conservation across the 53 nations of the Commonwealth,” Ms Barry says

The Turnbull’s Mt Terako covenant contains untouched beech forest and high-altitude shrublands and rockfields. It is a habitat for native birds including kea, kaka and eastern falcon.

The covenant and today’s launch event will feature at an event being held at Buckingham Palace later this month to showcase the progress of the QCC initiative throughout the Commonwealth for Her Majesty.
