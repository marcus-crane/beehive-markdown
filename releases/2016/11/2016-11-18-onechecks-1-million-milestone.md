An online tool enabling business owners to quickly and easily search their company name, domain name and trademark has been used more than one million times, Small Business Minister Craig Foss says.

“[ONECheck](https://onecheck.business.govt.nz/onecheck), available at [business.govt.nz](http://business.govt.nz/), helps Kiwi business owners make informed decisions about their name and branding by gathering all the relevant information into one free, easily accessible tool,” Mr Foss says.

“Over the past year, 57,738 companies have registered in New Zealand — that’s a 26 per cent increase on four years ago.

“New Zealand was recently rated the top country in the world for doing business in the World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Report, up one place from last year and up from third in 2014.

“It’s well recognised that New Zealand has a fantastic business environment.  The Government continuously works to support and further strengthen this environment by making it easier for businesses to start, grow and thrive.”

OneCheck was built by [business.govt.nz](http://business.govt.nz/) with help from the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ), the Companies Office and Domain Name Commission.

Since launching in November 2012, a OneCheck search is made every two minutes on average, totalling 700 searches per day.
