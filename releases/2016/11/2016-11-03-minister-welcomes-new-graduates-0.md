Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed 19 new Corrections Officers who graduated today.

The new staff will be based at Northland Region Corrections Facility, Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Waikeria Prison, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison, Manawatu Prison, Arohata Prison, Rimutaka Prison, and Christchurch Men’s Prison.

Jeff Petrie, who will work at Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison, was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award.

Before joining Corrections, Jeff worked in the health sector and television industry in New Zealand and the Middle East.  He moved back to the Hawke’s Bay three years ago, with his young family, in search of a more simple life.  

“Jeff’s life experiences, strong leadership skills, discipline and desire to better serve his community has brought him to the stage where he believes he can make a real difference to the lives of our men and women in New Zealand prisons.

“Jeff is looking forward to his new role and says he is proud to be working with some of the top Corrections staff in the country,” says Ms Collins.
