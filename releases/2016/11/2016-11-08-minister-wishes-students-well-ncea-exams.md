Education Minister Hekia Parata has sent her best wishes to students on the eve of their NCEA examinations.

“This is an exciting time for students because it’s the culmination of many months of hard work and study. I congratulate students for their efforts so far and wish them the very best for their exams,” Ms Parata says.

Around 146,000 students will participate in this year’s exams which begin tomorrow and continue until 2 December.

“I know that exam time can be stressful and I also know parents will be doing everything they can to support their children through this important time,” Ms Parata says

“Furthermore I want to acknowledge teachers and principals who do a fantastic job preparing our students and I thank them for their continued devotion, which is helping to produce some fantastic results.”

2015 was a record year for student achievement in NCEA levels 1,2 and 3 according to roll based data going back to 2008. Additionally the proportion of students gaining University Entrance also increased on the previous year.

A team of approximately 1,750 markers will mark all papers by Christmas, with NCEA results expected to be released online from mid-January.
