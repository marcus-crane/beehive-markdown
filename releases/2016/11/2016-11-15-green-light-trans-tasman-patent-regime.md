Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has welcomed the passing of the Patents (Trans-Tasman Patent Attorneys and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, which will implement a joint trans-Tasman licensing regime for New Zealand and Australian patent attorneys.

Patent attorneys make up a small profession providing specialist advice to innovative businesses on the protection and exploitation of intellectual property. 

“The two countries share over 500 trans-Tasman patent attorneys. With many of them already registered in both jurisdictions it makes sense to take advantage of economies of scale and save the profession time, money and effort.

“A modern regime for regulating patent attorneys ensures New Zealand businesses have optimal access to high quality, reliable advice,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Key changes in the legislation include:

- Creation of a single trans-Tasman register;
- A trans-Tasman code of conduct;
- Creation of a patent attorneys disciplinary tribunal; and
- Consistent qualifications for registration.

The trans-Tasman regime will commence on 24 February 2017.
