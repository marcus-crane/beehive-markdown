Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced extra support for the clean-up in Kaikoura and surrounding areas following the recent earthquake and subsequent aftershocks.

The Minister has activated Enhanced Taskforce Green (ETFG), a temporary employment programme which helps councils to employ local jobseekers to support the clean-up operation.

Initial funding of $500,000 will be available to cover the wages of workers and supervisors, help hire or purchase personal safety or light equipment and hire transport for work crews.

MSD will now work with regional and local councils and local iwi on an implementation plan, as assessments are made and the scale of the work needed becomes clear.

“Local people will know where best to target this extra support as they recover from the effects of the earthquake,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Beneficiaries in the area will be able to help in cleaning debris and repairing damaged property and the local infrastructure.

“MSD will monitor the needs in the area as ETFG is rolled out, and report back to me if any additional support is required.”

Anyone requiring information and financial and other support following the 14 November earthquake should call the Government Helpline on 0800 779 997.
