Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced that over 5.5 million new seedlings will be planted during winter 2017, as a result of the latest funding round for the Government’s Afforestation Grant Scheme (AGS).

“The approval of 4,818 hectares to be planted across the country next winter means that an estimated 5,533,200 seedlings will go in the ground, which is a fantastic result for forestry in New Zealand,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The AGS is now in the second year of a five year programme, with the goal of planting 15,000ha of trees by 2020.

“It is pleasing to see 81 approved applications for this year’s funding round, the same as last year, but with an additional 1,918ha of land. This shows how the AGS is becoming better utilised by land owners.

“The purpose of the fund is to achieve a better environment through planting new forests. Whether it be carbon absorption or reducing land erosion, the scheme will make a real contribution.

“Now more than ever, forests are a vital part of our economy and our environment. I am pleased to see the AGS playing a part.

“To celebrate our achievements to date, I have today presented three Christchurch schools with Cypress and Larch trees to symbolise the future benefits of the AGS,” Mrs Goodhew says.
