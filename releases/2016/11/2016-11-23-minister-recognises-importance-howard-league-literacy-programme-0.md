Corrections Minister Judith Collins has congratulated seven prisoners and two prisoner peer mentors who graduated from the Howard League Literacy programme at Kohuora Auckland South Corrections Facility today.

Ms Collins presented the graduates with certificates, marking their achievement in completing the 12 week literacy course. She congratulated the men for taking an important step to living a better life when they leave prison.

The Howard League programme is run by volunteers who provide one to one tutoring with each prisoner. At Kohuora, the prisoners learning to read are supported by other prisoners who act as peer mentors.

The Minister encouraged the graduates to apply for training and employment opportunities within the prison, which will stand them in good stead after their release.

“I understand that every job placement in this prison starts with a written CV, just as it does outside prison. You now have the skills to write about the positive achievements in your life,” Ms Collins said.

Howard League Patron Dame Cath Tizard, Howard League President Tony Gibbs and Chief Executive mike Williams also attended the graduation.
