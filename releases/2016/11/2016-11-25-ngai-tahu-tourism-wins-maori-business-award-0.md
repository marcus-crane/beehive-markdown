One of New Zealand’s largest tourism operators, Ngāi Tahu Tourism, has won the Māori Excellence in Export award *He kai kei aku ringa* at the 2016 New Zealand International Business Awards.

The Māori Development Minister and the Associate Minister for Economic Development, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, presented Ngāi Tahu Tourism with the award in Auckland last night.

Mr Flavell says it is great to celebrate Māori businesses making a significant contribution to the Māori and national economy.

“Ngai Tahu Tourism owns and operates some of the most iconic experiences in New Zealand and has proven that having Māori values embedded in business is a successful strategy,” says Mr Flavell.

Ngāi Tahu Tourism is one of New Zealand’s largest tourism operators, connecting over one million visitors a year to Aotearoa, to the Ngāi Tahu team and to the Ngāi Tahu Iwi.

The whānau-owned company has more than 400 staff working across its nine businesses, delivering more than 20 of New Zealand’s most iconic experiences.

From Rainbow Springs in the North Island to Queenstown’s Shotover Jet, Ngāi Tahu Tourism’s attractions include experiences such as jet boating, astro-tourism, guided walks, helicopter tours and soaks in glacier hot pools.

The other finalists for the Māori Excellence in Export were Kiwa Digital and Straker Translations.

Kiwa Digital is the world’s leading production house for experiential digital books, and a market leader in systemised software for post-production.

Straker Translations’ cloud software platform provides translations for more than 10,000 clients around the world.

The *He kai kei aku ringa* award is supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Te Puni Kōkiri and The Treasury.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the New Zealand International Business Awards, which celebrate the success of New Zealand businesses on the world stage. The awards are run by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) with strategic partner ANZ.
