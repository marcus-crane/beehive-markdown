Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that the Japanese whaling fleet’s departure for the Southern Ocean defies international opinion and serves no legitimate scientific purpose.

“New Zealand has long-standing and deep-seated concerns about whaling in the Southern Ocean and we urge Japan to reconsider this year’s hunt,” Mr McCully says.

“It is clear that Japan’s research objectives can be met using non-lethal means and at the recent International Whaling Commission meeting the majority of members present agreed that Japan had not demonstrated the scientific justification for lethal whaling.

“The Southern Ocean is one of the world’s last great pristine wilderness areas. Japan’s decision to continue whaling there, at a time when we are celebrating conservation efforts in the region, puts Japan well out of step with international opinion on this issue,” Mr McCully says.
