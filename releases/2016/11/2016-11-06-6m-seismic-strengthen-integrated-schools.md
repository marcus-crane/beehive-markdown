The Government will invest $6 million on the seismic strengthening of state-integrated schools in greater Christchurch, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“Eight state-integrated schools will receive funding to help them meet the cost of seismic strengthening their buildings,” says Ms Parata.

“This funding was made available in Budget 2016 to ensure that schools in greater Christchurch are able to provide safe and comfortable learning environments for their students.”

The schools receiving funding are:

- St Thomas of Canterbury College, Sockburn ($1.8 million)
- St James School, Aranui ($1.6 million)
- St Joseph’s School, Papanui ($1.3 million)
- St Francis of Assisi School, St Albans ($600,000)
- Rangiora New Life School, Rangiora ($311,000)
- St Mary’s School, Christchurch ($217,000)
- Middleton Grange School, Upper Riccarton ($150,000)
- Christchurch Rudolf Steiner School, Opawa ($22,000)

“The projects include the strengthening of existing spaces and complete rebuilds, and replacement of classrooms that had to be demolished following the earthquakes,” says Ms Parata.

This investment is on top of the $1.137 billion committed to the Christchurch Schools Rebuild programme, a 10-year programme now in its third year.

“Once complete the greater Christchurch schooling network will be the most modern in the country.”

Work on the eight projects that have received funding for seismic strengthening is expected to begin in 2017.
