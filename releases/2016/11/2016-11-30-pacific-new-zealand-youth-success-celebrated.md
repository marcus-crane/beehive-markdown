The success of young Pacific New Zealanders has been celebrated at the 2016 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards held at Parliament this evening.

Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the awards recognise excellence and achievement in commerce, the arts, sports, community and leadership.

“The nine inspiring winners have been recognised for their impressive contributions to New Zealand’s economic, social and cultural life, “ Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The government is committed to ensuring more Pacific people tread the pathway to success.  We want young Pacific New Zealanders to realise their dreams, whether that’s to be an entrepreneur, sports star or business leader.”

“These inspiring young people are role models for all New Zealanders.  They are excelling academically, making significant contributions to their community, or demonstrating a skill in business,” says Mr Lotu-liga.

“The awards will open new doors for the winners, offering new opportunities for their careers and lives.”

“Congratulations to all the winners and their families. We are all incredibly proud of what you have achieved.  Thank you to our sponsors, who are helping making dreams come true for these young people.”
