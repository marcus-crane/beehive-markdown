Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of diplomat Mary Thurston as Ambassador to Poland, with accreditation to the Ukraine.

“Poland and New Zealand share a long history and warm relationship based around migration, common values, and international cooperation,” Mr McCully says.

“Poland is an increasingly important member of the EU and Poland’s expanding economy offers opportunities for New Zealand business, particularly in education services and agri-business.”

Ms Thurston is currently Deputy High Commissioner at the New Zealand High Commission Singapore, and has been previously posted as Deputy High Commissioner at the New Zealand High Commission Honiara and as Deputy Special Coordinator of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).
