The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass the Ngāruahine, Te Atiawa and Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bills through their third readings.

“I am pleased this day has finally arrived,” Mr Finlayson said. “It is an historic day and testament to the determination and hard work of Ngāruahine, Te Atiawa and Taranaki Iwi.

“The iwi of Taranaki suffered some of the worst Treaty breaches by the Crown in our history, including large-scale land confiscations and imprisonment without trial. These settlements mark the beginning of a new relationship with the Crown and provide the iwi of Taranaki with a foundation to build a stronger future for their people.”

The three settlements include financial and commercial redress totalling $224.5m and the vesting of cultural sites including Ngā Motu / Sugar Loaf Islands.

Redress also provides for iwi participation in local government decision making through representation on two standing committees of the Taranaki Regional Council (the Policy and Planning Committee and Regulatory and Consents Committee).

“Historical Treaty settlements in the Taranaki region are nearly complete,” Mr Finlayson said. “Of the eight iwi in the Taranaki region, seven have finalised Treaty settlements and Ngāti Maru is currently working towards an agreement in principle.”

Further information about these settlements can be found in the settlement summary documents:
