New detector dog teams have completed their three-month training programme and begin working at the border from tomorrow, says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The four Labrador’s, Casey, Flo, Latte and Que and their handlers were put through their paces during their training using tasks and exercises that simulate the airport and cargo operational environments,” Ms Wagner says.

“Three teams will be based in Auckland and one in Christchurch.

“These dogs passed Police testing to become certified detector dogs, and will formally graduate alongside their handlers in early December at Trentham Police Collage.

“The Detector Dog Graduation in December gives the teams a chance to celebrate and reflect on the dedication and hard work they have put into preparation for protecting our border.

“Budget 2016 invested over $500,000 to boost the total number of detector dog teams across the country from to provide an extra layer of enforcement at the border.

“Detector dog teams play a vital role at the border, stopping drugs, illicit items and large amounts of cash being smuggled into the country and harming to our communities,” Ms Wagner says.
