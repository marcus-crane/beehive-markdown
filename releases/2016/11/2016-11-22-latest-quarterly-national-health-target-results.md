Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest health target results show that DHBs continue to perform well and remain close to achieving a number of targets.

“The health targets drive performance across the health system, ensuring that New Zealanders get better access to key health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“The latest health target results for July to September 2016 are a credit to our hardworking health workforce across the country.

“The improved access to elective surgery target has again been achieved, surpassed by five per cent. Delivering more elective surgery remains a key Government priority – the answer to increased demand is to do more.

“This is the first time that the new raising healthy kids target has been reported – the national result was 49 per cent.

“DHB results are expected to improve considerably each quarter as referral processes are fully implemented.

“The target is a key part of the Government’s Childhood Obesity Plan. Obesity is a serious issue threatening the health of young Kiwis, which means some of our kids could end up living shorter lives than their parents.”

Under the target, the aim is that by December 2017, 95 per cent of children identified as obese in the B4 School Check are offered a referral to an appropriate health professional for follow-up and family based nutrition, activity and lifestyle interventions.

The health target results for Quarter One 2016/17 (July-September) show:

Results for the faster cancer treatment target increased four per cent to 78 per cent.

93 per cent of patients were admitted, discharged or transferred from the ED within six hours, down one per cent on the previous quarter.

87 per cent of PHO enrolled patients were offered help to quit smoking, down one per cent on the previous quarter.

Immunisation coverage for 8-month-olds remained at 93 per cent.
