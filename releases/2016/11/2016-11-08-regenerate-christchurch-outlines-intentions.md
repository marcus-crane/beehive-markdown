Regenerate Christchurch’s Statement of Intent has been tabled in Parliament today.

Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee says the Statement of Intent outlines the agency’s strategic objectives, as well as its vision, role and approach.

“Regenerate Christchurch is jointly owned and funded by the Crown and the Christchurch City Council,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The agency will develop Regeneration Plans for Christchurch’s central city, residential red zones, New Brighton and potentially other areas.

“This Statement of Intent lays out the purpose of Regenerate Christchurch and provides both guidance and accountability for the agency as it goes about its work leading the regeneration of Christchurch.

“The work programme is also included and lists both the activities Regenerate Christchurch has under way and plans to begin over the next six months.

“Regenerate Christchurch will begin assessing the feasibility of an open water course in the flat-land red zone before the end of the year.

“Early next year will see it lead a strategy to regenerate Cathedral Square and complete its first Regeneration Plan for a section of the Avon River corridor red zone,” Mr Brownlee says.
