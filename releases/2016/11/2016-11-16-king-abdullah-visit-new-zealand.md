His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan will make an official visit to New Zealand from November 28-30, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“I am pleased to welcome King Abdullah’s reciprocal visit to New Zealand, which follows the 2013 visit to Jordan by our previous Governor General,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand and Jordan have a strong bilateral relationship, one which has grown even closer through our time serving together on the Security Council last year.

“King Abdullah’s visit will be an opportunity to hear Jordan’s important perspectives on Middle East issues, including Syria, the Middle East Peace Process, Iraq and broader efforts to counter ISIL.”

King Abdullah and his delegation arrive in Wellington on November 28 for a series of events, including an official welcome at Government House, a State dinner hosted by the Governor General, a wreath laying at Pukeahu National War Memorial and talks with the Governor General, Prime Minister and Ministers.

King Abdullah, a former military helicopter pilot and commander of Jordan’s Special Forces, will also visit the New Zealand Defence Force’s Battle Training Facility in Ardmore.
