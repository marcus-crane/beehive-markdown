Sharp Corporation’s efforts to responsibly manage the environmental effects of its products have been recognised with accreditation to the Product Stewardship Scheme, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“Sharp aims to be recycling 100 per cent of all packaging materials, electrical and electronic products and equipment, and obsolete and used parts by April 2018,” Dr Smith says.

“This accredited scheme shows that it is achievable for global electronic corporates to voluntarily take responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products.”

The Sharp programme is the 14th scheme to receive accreditation since the Waste Minimisation Act came into effect in 2009. Under the Act, the Minister for the Environment can accredit product stewardship schemes which meet waste and environmental harm reduction criteria.

“Sharp’s scheme has robust benefits for the environment, while also stacking up commercially. It’s a great example of how forward thinking businesses can manage products’ environmental effects through proactive product stewardship,” Dr Smith says.

“I encourage other organisations and industries to seek accreditation so they can also receive the economic and environmental benefits of product stewardship.”
