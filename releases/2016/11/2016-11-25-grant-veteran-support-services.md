Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced a $175,000 grant for the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association’s (RNZRSA) support services programme.

“Staff and volunteers at RSAs all over the country work tirelessly to support our veterans,” Mr Foss says.

“In particular, RSA Support Advisors help ensure veterans are aware of and have easy access to support services from a variety of providers, including Veterans’ Affairs.

“The RNZRSA continues to be a strong advocate for New Zealand’s veterans and their families. I value my relationship with the organisation and its input on issues affecting both traditional and contemporary veterans.  This grant will help ensure its important work continues.”
