Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has welcomed the passing of a bill which will enable New Zealand wine and spirit makers to register the geographical origins of their products.

“The value of our wine exports has now reached $1.6 billion. We must jealously guard the reputation of New Zealand wines if we are to continue growing our wine exports,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Bill amends the Geographical Indications (Wines and Spirits) Registration Act (the Act) to ensure the process for registering geographical indicators runs smoothly.

Mr Goldsmith says being able to register geographical indications for wines and spirits will make it easier for their users to enforce them in New Zealand. It will also make it easier for our exporters to promote and protect their wine and spirits in some overseas markets.

“As a regional reputation grows, a name adds value. New Zealand wines already attract a premium in foreign markets: we want to preserve and build on that,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Act is expected to enter into force early next year. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) will administer the Act and has completed preparation for implementation. The next step is finalising the regulations.
