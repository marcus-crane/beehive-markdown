Communications Minister Amy Adams has today announced the establishment of a Cyber Security Skills Taskforce to address the shortage of cyber professionals in New Zealand.

The Taskforce will focus on practical actions to increase the number of cyber professionals the industry needs to help defend against cyber-attacks, which cost the New Zealand economy $257 million last year.

“We know there is a lack of New Zealanders entering the profession at a sub-degree level, so the taskforce will focus on working with academia and industry to develop a level 6 course, with industry supported internships,” says Ms Adams.

Many New Zealand universities have developed specialist cybersecurity degrees and postgraduate courses or are in the process of developing them.

The Cyber Security Skills Taskforce will establish a pathway for junior analysts, including a level 6 qualification and industry-supported internships to be developed in 2017.

“There is a growing global shortage of cyber security professionals. It’s estimated that there will be a global workforce shortfall of between one to two million positions by 2019,” says Ms Adams.

“This shortage is limiting the ability of organisations to protect themselves from the increasing threat of cyberattacks. New Zealand is competing for talent in a global market and it’s important that the Taskforce looks at ways in which New Zealand can grow its own talent.”

The eight-person Taskforce will be led by David Eaton and include representatives from academia and industry to ensure training meets the needs of industry.
