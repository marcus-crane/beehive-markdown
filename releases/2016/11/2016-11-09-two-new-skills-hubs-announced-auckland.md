Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley have today announced two new Auckland jobs and skills hubs as part of the latest update of the Skilled and Safe Workplaces chapter of the Business Growth Agenda.

“I am pleased to announce new jobs and skills hubs at both the Wynyard Quarter and Tamaki, which will give young people a pathway to employment in the construction sector, as well as on-site numeracy, literacy and practical skills training,” Mr Joyce says.

“The New Zealand economy is growing strongly, unemployment is down and we have the opportunity now to bring more people who have been long-term unemployed into work. These hubs are a key way to provide intensive support and encouragement to those who aren’t yet in work to get them into a meaningful career as the economy grows.” 

The Auckland CBD Jobs and Skills Hub, based at Wynyard Quarter will revolve around the extensive commercial development and construction activity in the area, with the Tamaki Hub supporting the housing developments at the Tamaki Regeneration Programme.

“These new hubs are part of the Government’s plan to improve outcomes for our young job seekers, and have a focus on achieving both economic and social outcomes,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The redevelopment of 7,500 new houses in Tamaki will generate sizeable job opportunities. The Tamaki Hub will support residents to gain the skills, knowledge and opportunities to progress their lives, as well as strengthen the local economy and unlock the potential of the Tamaki area.”

The CBD Jobs and Skills Hub will centre on significant development in the area, including the Madden and Packenham Street upgrades, the Halsey and Gaunt Street upgrades, construction of the Park Hyatt Hotel, the expansion of Grid Auckland, construction of apartment complexes and a bus depot.”

The hubs are a partnership between central and local government, businesses, tertiary providers, ATEED, and ITOs. They’re modelled on the successful Ara Skills Exchange at Auckland Airport. The Hubs set up training facilities and wrap-around services at the centre of areas where there are sizeable projects which create jobs and opportunities.

“Building these job and skills hubs are just one of many projects in the Skilled and Safe Workplaces report where government and industry are collaborating to grow the skilled workforce in industries critical to New Zealand. By focusing on getting more people into skilled employment, we will equip New Zealand to succeed in the modern economy,” says Mr Joyce.
