A refreshed membership of the New Zealand Geographic Board will ensure that New Zealand’s process for deciding official place names continues to reflect the interests of Kiwis, Land Information Minister Louise Upston says.

The newcomers are Paulette Tamati-Elliffe, nominated by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, and former South Wairarapa District Council Mayor, Adrienne Staples, nominated by Local Government New Zealand.

“Ms Tamati-Elliffe has a detailed knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and tikanga, so she’s well-qualified to represent them,” says Ms Upston.

“Ms Staples will bring her expertise in local government to the table, offering experience in community perspectives when it comes to making decisions about local place names.

“Current NZGB members who have been re-appointed are Jenni Vernon, Merata Kawharu, David Barnes, Michael Roche, Matanuku Mahuika, and Rikirangi Gage.

“Between them all members have the skills, knowledge and experience to do a very thorough job so that the NZGB’s decisions continue to take account of our values, heritage and all the other factors to consider when deciding on place names”.

The new appointees have replaced outgoing members Garrick Murfitt and Te Maire Tau.

“They have been valuable members. I wish them the best for the future, and thank them for their contribution”.
