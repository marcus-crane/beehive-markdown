Auckland’s new Kumeu Primary School will open on Gilbransen Road, Kumeu in early 2019, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“More than a third of the country’s population now lives in the Auckland region and Kumeu is a growing area. This new school will have capacity to meet the population growth demands in the area, in particular from the proposed Special Housing Areas and other private developments.

“The Government is committed to investing in our largest city to ensure we have the right number of schools with the capacity to deal with future growth,” says Ms Parata.

Kumeu Primary School will be constructed and maintained under the Ministry of Education’s third Public Private Partnership.

It will have capacity for 560 years one to eight students once it opens and a satellite of the Arohanui Special School will be part of the new school.

“Kumeu Primary School will provide innovative and inclusive learning environments that reflect the Kumeu community and meet the needs of children and young people in the 21st century,” says Ms Parata.

“The new school will have the option of joining a Community of Learning | Kāhui Ako. Based on the proposed location and likely pathway of students it would be well placed to join the Whiria Te Tangata Community of Learning.”

Whiria Te Tangata Community of Learning is currently comprised of eight primary schools and one secondary school with a combined roll of around 3900 students. With the eventual planned roll of 700 students for Kumeu Primary School, this would bring the combined roll of Whiria Te Tangata Community of Learning up to around 4600 learners across ten schools.

An Establishment Board of Trustees will be appointed to Kumeu Primary School shortly. It will have responsibility for appointing a foundation principal, determining school policy and governance practices, as well as ensuring the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the community.
