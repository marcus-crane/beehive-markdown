Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced funding of just over $200,000 to be shared by eight community groups under the Community Internship Programme (CIP), which provides community organisations with a paid intern with specialist knowledge.

“The internship programme focusses on skill-sharing and the exchange of knowledge between sectors, and builds ongoing relationships that continue long after the internship ends,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The eight successful applicants are:

- Arthritis Foundation of New Zealand Inc
- Bishop’s Action Foundation
- Buller Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) Incorporated
- Dunedin Community Care Trust
- Macular Degeneration New Zealand
- Wesley Wellington Mission Incorporated
- Whangarei Youth Space Trust
- Youth Search and Rescue Tauranga Trust

“A variety of interns will work in different ways with the community organisations they are hosted by. This will enable those organisations to develop their organisations in a way which would otherwise be difficult to achieve.

“A media and marketing intern will be assisting Macular Degeneration NZ to develop a communications strategy, while an experienced educator will be helping the Tauranga Youth Search and Rescue to develop NZQA aligned training resources.

“These interns will be able to bring knowledge and experience to the eight organisations which will benefit their work in our communities, and enhance their organisational capabilities into the future,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Applications to the CIP Fund are open annually and the grants are usually for placements for three to six months. Part-time internships of up to 12 months may also be considered.
