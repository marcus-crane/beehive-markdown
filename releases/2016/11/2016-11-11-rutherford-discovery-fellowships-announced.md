Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the recipients for this year’s Rutherford Discovery Fellowships.

“This programme provides great opportunities to further develop the skills of our most talented young scientists to be the future leaders of our growing science community,” Mr Joyce says.

The Rutherford Discovery Fellowships receive Government funding of $8 million per annum, and award up to $800,000 over five years to each Research Fellow. There are at least 50 Rutherford Discovery Fellows supported at any one time.

“Ten of New Zealand’s most talented early to mid-career researchers have been awarded Rutherford Discovery Fellowships,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Fellowships seek to attract, retain and grow New Zealand’s up-and-coming talent by helping highly-promising researchers establish a track record for future research leadership.

“These researchers are of the highest quality and are working on projects that are of real benefit to New Zealand – from novel antibiotic treatment to seismic hazards to communication systems.”

**Dr Baptiste Auguie,** Victoria University of Wellington, for research entitled: Light and chirality at the nanoscale.
