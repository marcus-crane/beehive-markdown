Minister of Energy and Resources Simon Bridges has thanked departing EECA chief executive Mike Underhill for decades of service to New Zealand’s energy sector.

Mr Underhill retires after 10 years at the helm of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

“Mr Underhill has made a huge contribution to New Zealand’s energy sector through both the private and public sector,” Minister Bridges says.

“He is well known as a thought-leader and change-maker in the energy sector – particularly for his passionate advocacy for energy efficiency.

“During his time leading EECA, Mr Underhill successfully implemented the Government’s *Warm Up New Zealand* programme which has insulated nearly 300,000 homes.

“I would like to thank Mr Underhill for his contribution to New Zealand’s energy sector and I wish him well for the future.”
