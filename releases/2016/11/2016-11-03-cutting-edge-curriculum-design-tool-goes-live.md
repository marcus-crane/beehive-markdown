Education Minister Hekia Parata today launched a new online curriculum design tool to improve learning experiences for children and young people in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako around the country.

“The tool will enable each Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako to collaboratively design a quality ‘Kiwi’ curriculum that supports the unique learning pathway of every child and young person in that community,” Ms Parata says.

The Ministry’s recent work with the sector indicated a need for more support around curriculum design. In response, the Minister has initiated this work as a way of supporting Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako to design locally-relevant and engaging learning opportunities to meet the developing needs of their students.

“In just a few months, this tool has gone from an idea to a viable model, which is outstanding. The model has been developed with several Communities of Learning and will continue to evolve in partnership with the sector,” Ms Parata says.

The model will be trialled in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako early next year, with further testing and refining throughout 2017 in response to feedback.

“It’s important that this tool meets the emerging needs of Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako both now and in the future - so they need to be closely involved in its further development. Ultimately I want every child and young person to have access to great local learning experiences that help them to reach their full potential,” Ms Parata says.

More than half of New Zealand schools are currently working together in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako and collaborating to support learners’ transitions through early learning to senior-secondary education and beyond.
