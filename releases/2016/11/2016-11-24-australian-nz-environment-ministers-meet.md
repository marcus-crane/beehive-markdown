Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith leaves today for Sydney to attend the annual meeting of Australasian Environment Ministers, with Ministers from each State, Territory and New Zealand.

“This is the first opportunity to engage with new Australia Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg since the July Federal election. The New Zealand and Australian economies are so integrated that we need to maximise the alignment of our environmental regulation,” Dr Smith says.

“The meeting provides a valuable opportunity to be updated on the latest policy work in Australia and identify where we need to be working closely.

“The interaction with Australia on issues such as water management, air quality, waste management and hazardous substances is complicated by the mix of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and State Governments. The strength of this meeting is that it includes both and maximises the opportunities for Trans-Tasman co-operation.

“I am also taking the opportunity to explore Australia’s approach to urban growth and development planning. Australia faces similar issues to New Zealand, with high house prices in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. It will be useful to compare different approaches to how we can increase housing supply and affordability, better ensure infrastructure keeps up with growth pressures and better support more intensive living.”

Dr Smith returns to New Zealand on Saturday.
