Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has today announced three reappointments to the Copyright Tribunal.

Current member Jane Glover has been appointed as Deputy of the Chairperson of the Copyright Tribunal for a five-year term.

“Ms Glover has a breadth of experience in copyright, moral rights and other intellectual property matters. Her practical experience in commercial and intellectual property litigation provides her with a strong background to join the leadership of the Tribunal,” Mr Goldsmith says.  

The Minister has also reappointed Sarah Bacon and Sarah-Jane Weir as Tribunal members for further terms of two years.

“Ms Bacon and Ms Weir are acknowledged as experts in the field and their experience will continue to be of great value to the Tribunal,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Copyright Tribunal hears disputes between licensing bodies and those who hold or seek to hold licenses in respect of copyright works. The Tribunal also hears applications and make awards in respect of claims for breach of copyright as a result of file sharing over the internet.
