Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the opening of the third round of bids for the $18 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund (TLIF).

The TLIF supports and resources teachers to collaboratively explore new ways and ideas to improve learning outcomes.

“We know the quality of teaching has the single biggest in-school impact on learners and this fund is giving our excellent teachers the opportunity to investigate and then inspire best practice. This project is for the benefit of every child and young person in this country,” Ms Parata says.

The TLIF is part of the government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative.

“This fund supports teachers to develop excellent practice and share what works across schools so that it becomes common practice,” Ms Parata says.

The TLIF has funded 86 teacher-led inquiry projects over the last two years and is available until 2020. Funding criteria have a particular focus on improving learning outcomes for children and young people who are Māori, Pasifika, have additional learning support needs and/or come from low socio-economic backgrounds.

“Research shows that teaching and learning improve when education providers work with each other, and with their community. So I encourage more teachers working in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako to collaboratively develop TLIF project proposals this time around.” Minister Parata says.

Applications for the third round close on 16 March 2017 with projects starting in July 2017. Teachers can find resources to help them plan TLIF projects, and apply via the Ministry of Education website.
