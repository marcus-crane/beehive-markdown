New Zealand has joined countries at the 2016 UN climate change conference, COP22, in fast-tracking the implementation of the historic Paris Agreement.

Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett gave support to the Marrakech Proclamation, which highlights the global momentum on tackling climate change.

“The COP22 global meeting has reaffirmed New Zealand’s absolute commitment to playing our part in the global action to reduce climate change,” says Mrs Bennett.

“At COP I had meetings with my climate change counter parts from several countries who all said they remained committed to the Paris agreement. It was also an opportunity to have fruitful discussions on issues important to New Zealand such as how to reduce emissions from agriculture and how to create high integrity international carbon markets.

“New Zealand has a fair and ambitious target of reducing emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. I have several work streams in place which will help form an effective plan to meet that target.”
