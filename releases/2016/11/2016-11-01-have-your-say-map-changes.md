Land Information Minister Louise Upston wants paper map users to have their say on proposed changes to the way Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) prints and charges for its maps.

“The trusty paper topographic or topo map has long had a place in Kiwi culture, but increasingly people are using digital versions from LINZ’s website,” says Ms Upston.

“While paper maps are still an essential tool for navigation – after all they don’t run out of batteries – the greater use of digital maps means there has been a reduction in demand.

“This means the price of LINZ’s maps no longer reflects the costs of producing them, especially as wholesale prices were last changed in 2009.

“LINZ is proposing to raise the wholesale cost of paper maps, to ensure prices reflect costs. The potential increases range from $3.30 to $6.80.

“LINZ also proposes to make greater use of other printing methods and print fewer maps at a time so that they are more up to date. However before any changes are made, it is important that map users have their say on these proposals.”

LINZ produces topographic maps of New Zealand, offshore islands and Pacific and Antarctic regions. These are available from map retailers and for download from the LINZ website. The data used to produce maps is also freely available online from the [LINZ Data Service.](https://data.linz.govt.nz/)

Information on the proposed changes and making a submission is available at [www.linz.govt.nz/ptmc](http://www.linz.govt.nz/ptmc)
