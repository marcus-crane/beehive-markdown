New Zealand and Australia are working together on practical initiatives to boost trans-Tasman cyber security, Communications Minister Amy Adams says.

Ms Adams recently returned from Australia, where she met with her counterpart, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security, Dan Tehan.

During a meeting in Sydney, Ministers agreed to work together on a range of initiatives that will benefit both countries. Areas of interest include boosting cyber skills, building the cyber capability of small and medium-sized businesses, and co-operating on joint awareness raising campaigns.

“Australia and New Zealand enjoy a productive relationship on cyber issues. Working together means we can better respond to challenges and be prepared to deal with serious cyber security threats that could affect both our nations,” says Ms Adams.

“Many New Zealand businesses operate in Australia and vice versa, and our citizens travel regularly between the two countries. We’re committed to cooperating at a practical level to help our communities be safe online and ensure they’re making the most of the digital economy.

“Collaboration and close international partnerships are a key part of implementing New Zealand’s 2015 Cyber Security Strategy. Working alongside like-minded countries, such as Australia, is important to ensure we are cyber secure.”

Ms Adams and Mr Tehan have asked officials to provide an update on the progress of these commitments in early 2017.

The initiatives agreed to will bolster the Government’s approach to cyber security issues, and further align Australia and New Zealand’s public-private awareness initiatives and workforce readiness to reduce the cyber threat in the Asia-Pacific region.
