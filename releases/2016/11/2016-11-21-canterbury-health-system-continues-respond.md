Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the health system continues to respond well and is prepared to meet the expected rise in mental health and well-being issues following the recent earthquake in Kaikoura.

“The Government is committed to ensuring the people of Kaikoura and the wider Canterbury and Nelson Marlborough regions can access the health services that they need,” says Dr Coleman.

“I’d like to acknowledge all the health staff who are doing a great job responding to local health needs at a difficult time.

“We know that after a serious earthquake, people can start feeling stressed and anxious. Health professionals are encouraging people who are experiencing issues to seek help sooner rather than later.

“Kaikoura Health Te Ha o Te Ora has rostered on extra nurses, doctors and mental health workers. Kaikoura Health is currently offering to see patients free of charge.

“Two psychologists from Canterbury’s specialist mental health services are in Kaikoura and two brief intervention counsellors are on the way to support the psychosocial recovery and assist vulnerable people in the community.

“Door to door welfare checks by the Red Cross continue to be carried out.

“Canterbury DHB has worked with Spark to send texts to over 3,500 customers in North Canterbury to emphasise that it’s ok to ask for help.

“The public health focus is on preventing any illness related to the lack of sewerage and water. Public health messages are being reinforced.

“The Ministry of Health continues to work closely with the DHB to provide support. The Government will assess whether further support is required.”

The Earthquake Support Line has been extended nationally, and it has reported a number of calls from the Wellington region.

While calls to the national telehealth service have stabilised, the Earthquake Support Line is seeing increased volumes.

As of this morning, the Earthquake Support Line (0800 777 846) and national telehealth service have answered 14,365 calls since the earthquake.

Earlier this year in March, the Government announced an additional $20 million package of initiatives to increase mental health support for Cantabrians over the next three years.
