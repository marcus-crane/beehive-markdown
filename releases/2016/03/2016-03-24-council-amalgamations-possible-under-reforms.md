Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says council amalgamations are still possible under new local government reforms. 

The Wellington City Council last night stepped away from starting to evaluate a merger with Porirua city because it believed the new legislation would remove the requirement for a public poll on council-led amalgamations.

“Any amalgamation that is proposed by the Local Government Commission would go to a public poll before it is implemented. If councils themselves are proposing an amalgamation, they can still choose to put the proposal to binding public referenda,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Better Local Services package is about enabling councils to deliver better services to ratepayers,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Better Local Services reform package, announced last week, gives councils significant new powers to lead reorganisations in consultation with their local communities.

“The package gives local councils new options to work together and jointly provide services and infrastructure without having to resort to amalgamation. But there will still be occasions when amalgamations are a good solution where they have local community support,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The reforms also mean local authorities can set up council controlled organisations to run shared services and deliver improved value for ratepayers.
