Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell reconfirms today that Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill strengthens the retention of Māori land in Māori hands.            

Following questions in the House today Mr Flavell says, “Te Ture Whenua Māori goes further to strengthen the protection of Māori land”. 

“Currently Māori land can be transferred into general title with 75 percent support from all shareholders. In the new Bill this is the minimum requirement, but owners can also choose to increase that threshold up to 100 percent.”

Mr Flavell says the strengthening of the protection around the ownership of whenua Māori is in direct response to feedback from Māori land owners.

“It is one of the many significant improvements in the Bill from the current Act.”

As a result, owners will have the option to convert the interests from individual ownership to collective ownership, which adds further protection to Māori land.

“Under the new Bill no one can sell collectively-owned Māori freehold land, land reserved as whenua tāpui or Māori customary land. This level of protection is the same or greater than the current Act and extends it to collectively-owned land.”

Mr Flavell reiterated that the reform of Te Ture Whenua Māori has always been about two things – retaining ownership of whenua Māori for future generations and making it easier for land owners to make decisions about their land.
