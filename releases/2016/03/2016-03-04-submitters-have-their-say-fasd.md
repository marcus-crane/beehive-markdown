Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the strong level of interest shown by people in a proposed action plan for Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.

Around 150 submissions have been received from across the country regarding a discussion document on the plan.

“This is a complex issue and I am delighted that people have been taking the time to share their insight and experience.

“I wanted to test if work in this area currently being undertaken is heading in the right direction and the positive response to this proposed action plan is very encouraging. We have had significant support for this initiative and the high level direction we have proposed, as well as very constructive feedback around priorities and improvements”, Mr Dunne said.

The action plan is a key deliverable under the government’s National Drug Policy, launched in August last year and has recently received a $1 million boost through the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act.

Submitters have included parents, caregivers and family members of people affected by FASD, health, education, social and justice sector professionals, community organisations, Māori organisations, researchers, industry groups and members of the public.
