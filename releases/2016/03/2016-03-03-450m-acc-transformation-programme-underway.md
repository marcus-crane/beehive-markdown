ACC Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed ACC’s announcement today that work is underway rolling out customer services initiatives, following approval of an updated business case on ACC’s $450 million transformation programme.

“ACC’s Board presented its final business case for the programme last year and I took a paper on this through Cabinet,” says Ms Kaye.

“With a programme of this scale and complexity, it was important for Cabinet to have oversight of it.

“This programme is about transforming ACC’s people, processes, technology and information over a five-year period to deliver a more modern, integrated, high-quality and customer-focused service.

“Funding for the programme is coming from ACC’s operating budget, and is broadly in line with ACC’s usual spend on strategic change initiatives over a comparable period. This means it will not impact on levies.

“This next step in ACC’s transformation comes on the back of significant legislative changes I announced last year, such as a more robust framework for funding ACC, greater transparency around the levy setting process, and the removal of residual levies which collected historic claims costs.

“The transformation programme has undergone extensive scrutiny and been in front of Cabinet twice. Lessons learned from other major IT projects have been taken on board, and robust mitigations put in place to minimise risks.

“The mitigations include extending the duration of the programme from three to five years, independent quality assurance and oversight by the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) and Treasury.

“Enhanced technology is a key part of the programme. Digital transformation will enable the replacement of cumbersome paper-based processes and provide the basis for faster, more transparent decisions, and better sharing of and access to information for clients, health professionals and businesses alike.

“Importantly, the transformation programme is not just about more customer-centric services and reduced complexity, it’s also about ACC refocusing its attention to our most vulnerable.

“Too much of ACC’s time and energy has been consumed on managing claims for relatively minor injuries.

“By freeing up staff to spend more time with people with complex injuries, ACC will be able to focus on those with the greatest needs, where it can make a real difference.

“The Board and Chief Executive have advised me and it’s been noted by Cabinet that while there will be some structural changes, staff levels should remain relatively stable.

“Today I will attend a function hosted by the Employers and Manufacturers Association and ACC, where I will speak about improved services ACC is rolling out for businesses, as well as upcoming improvements that businesses can expect as part of the transformation programme.

“The programme is about improving services for injured people, health providers and levy payers, but is being delivered in stages, with the first stage focusing on solutions that can be delivered in a relatively short timeframe. This includes service improvements for business customers.

“The ACC scheme is unique in the world. During its 42-year history, it has helped millions of Kiwis recover from injury, and helped thousands learn how to prevent injury at work, home, on the road and during sport and recreation.

“These changes are about taking ACC to a higher level of service, and ensuring it’s well placed to continue to serve upcoming generations of New Zealanders in a more modern world.”

**Notes:**

**Why is ACC doing this?**

Feedback from over 5,500 staff and customers in 2013 showed that despite improvements in recent years, ACC has remained ineffective in delivering core services to customers. As ACC has grown, its processes have become more complex, and it’s operated in a way that suited ACC rather than its customers. It relies too heavily on manual and paper-based work, which increases the risk of privacy breaches; it doesn’t offer people enough options when it comes to exchanging information; and it is not always available when and how its customers want, ie 24/7.

**What are the major benefits?**

There are six key benefits for New Zealand:

- improving customer trust and confidence
- improving the processing of claims
- reducing the number of days lost to injury
- empowering staff to deliver core services more effectively
- reducing the number of data issues by better supporting core systems
- reducing business customer levy debt

Clients will:

- only need to provide their information to ACC once
- have certainty around their financial security during their recovery
- feel empowered and supported to manage their long-term injury needs and maintain independence in their lives

Providers will:

- be able to deal with their patients’ needs, rather than spend time filling in forms and paperwork
- be better informed about the estimated rehabilitation pathway for their patients and how unique factors can impact recovery
- have a single point of contact with ACC

Business customers will:

- have choice and control over how they pay their levies to suit their business needs - they’ll also have visibility over and can plan for the likely levy amount and timing
- have a clear understanding of how their levies have been calculated and what value their levy provides within their industry
- be supported to plan for any business impacts with quick and easy access to ACC information
