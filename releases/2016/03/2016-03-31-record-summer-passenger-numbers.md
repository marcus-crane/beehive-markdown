Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says the 2015-2016 summer season was the busiest so far for Customs, with a record number of travellers crossing the border and a record number of them using SmartGate.

“Passenger numbers reached record highs with almost 3.38 million passengers passing through international airports over summer, an increase of around 10 per cent on last summer,” Ms Wagner says.

“SmartGate use also increased with 1.15 million passengers using the gates between December and February – a 15 per cent increase on the previous year.

“The Government’s $6.6 million investment to more than double the number of SmartGates is already paying off. SmartGate capacity at Auckland Airport has been doubled with nine new next generation gates in departures, with more gates being rolled out around the country this year. Border checks at the new integrated gates take on average around 20 seconds.

“Making travel to New Zealand a better experience helps boost economic growth, with international tourist spending increasing by an outstanding 31 per cent, to $9.7 billion, in the year to December 2015.

“Not only is travel easier, Customs officers are also better able to keep the border safe by focusing on high-risk travellers. This approach has seen more drugs seized at the border during the summer period than ever before.

“Customs seized 855 drug packages compared to 771 last summer. A total of 74kg of meth was seized, plus a quarter tonne of precursors – almost double the amount seized last year.

“These drug seizures work hand in hand with the efforts of other law enforcement agencies, which has seen the street price of P remain stable, use rates remain below one percent, and the average age of users increase.

“The successful summer showcases the fantastic work of Customs officers at the frontline and behind the scenes who are keeping our border safe while making travel and trade hassle-free,” Ms Wagner says.
