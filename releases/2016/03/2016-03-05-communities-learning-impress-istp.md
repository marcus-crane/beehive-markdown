International education experts at the sixth International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP) in Berlin are impressed with our fledgling Communities of Learning, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The annual Summit brings together education ministers, teachers, leaders and experts from countries with the top-performing education systems in the world to discuss best teaching practice.

“Many delegations at last year’s Summit indicated they were interested in our Communities of Learning, and it was great to be able to update them on the significant progress we have made since then,” says Ms Parata.

“They were extremely impressed to learn that about a third of New Zealand schools are now part of Communities of Learning and are in the process of sharing data in order to lift the quality of teaching and learning.”

Ms Parata led New Zealand’s delegation comprising Whangaparaoa College Principal James Thomas, Fairburn School Principal Frances Nelson, PPTA President Angela Roberts and NZEI President Louise Green.

“New Zealand is recognised around the world as having one of the best education systems, and international commentators are impressed with our efforts to improve and further strengthen teaching practice and raise student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“Our delegation agreed to take away from this Summit further commitments to continue systematically embedding professional collaboration and career pathways to grow student learning and outcomes through Communities of Learning, and explore opportunities for career pathways between ECE, schools, and government to strengthen both the system and professional learning and development.

At the Summit Ms Parata also met with several education leaders including Acting United States Secretary of Education, John King Jr.; United Kingdom Minister of State for Schools Nick Gibb and Cabinet Secretary for Education Angela Constance; and Singapore Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary.

“ISTP has again been a great source of inspiration on how we can further improve education policy, support teaching practice to lift ever higher, and raise achievement of Kiwi kids.”
