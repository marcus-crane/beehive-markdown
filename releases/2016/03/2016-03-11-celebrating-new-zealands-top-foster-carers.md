Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says 10 of the country’s foster care families have been celebrated at an awards ceremony at Government House.

“Foster carers do an exceptional job, taking children and young people into their homes, often in the middle of the night, and giving them a safe and loving family,” Mrs Tolley says.

“The Excellence in Foster Care Awards acknowledges caregivers who go above and beyond for the children and young people who come into their families.”

There are currently around 3,600 Child, Youth and Family approved caregivers providing care for more than 4,200 children and young people in out-of-home placements.

The awards are hosted by the Governor General, Lt Gen Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae and Lady Janine Mateparae. Child, Youth and Family and Fostering Kids New Zealand partner to present the awards.

“Children who come into care have experienced horrible abuse and neglect and it’s vital our caregivers are supported to help these children and young people begin to heal,” Mrs Tolley says.

“As part of the CYF overhaul we are looking at how we can increase the pool of high quality caregivers and offer more support for these extraordinary New Zealanders.

“I will be taking a paper to Cabinet on the next steps in the CYF overhaul in the next few weeks. We need a system that works for children and caregivers and that allows social workers to do their job to the very best of their abilities.”
