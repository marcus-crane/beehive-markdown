Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the adoption of a United Nations Security Council resolution imposing new strengthened sanctions on North Korea.

“New Zealand has already condemned North Korea’s recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch,” Mr McCully says.

“North Korea’s actions blatantly contravene previous Security Council resolutions and stand in direct opposition to international opinion. 

“New Zealand supports the new sanctions which have been adopted and we hope they will convince North Korea to cease its provocative behaviour and return to talks on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.

“The Security Council Resolution strengthens existing sanctions on North Korea covering weapons of mass destruction, arms and luxury goods, and imposes new economic measures affecting transport, banking, and trade.

“New Zealand will continue to urge North Korea to refrain from actions which undermine stability in the region and we will be undertaking steps to implement the resolution,” Mr McCully says.
