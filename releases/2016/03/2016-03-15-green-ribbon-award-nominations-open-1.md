New Zealanders have the chance to honour the nation’s inspirational environmental leaders at the Green Ribbon Awards, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry say, with nominations for the 26th annual awards opening yesterday.

“People across the country have an important role to play in protecting and enhancing our unique environment, whether you are a large business taking steps to improve environmental management or a small community group making a difference on the ground. We are looking forward to this year’s nominations across a range of important environmental issues, with categories recognising leadership in areas like protecting biodiversity, waste reduction and education,” Dr Smith says.

“Each year we get nominations from an impressive range of inspirational people and projects, and it’s always difficult to choose the final winners. The Green Ribbons are the Government’s foremost environment and conservation awards and winning one is a significant achievement,” Ms Barry says.

This year’s categories are:

**Environmental projects**

- Protecting our biodiversity
- Caring for our water
- Protecting our coasts and oceans
- Resilience to climate change
- Minimising our waste

**Leadership**

- Business leadership
- Community leadership
- Kaitiaki leadership
- Philanthropy and partnership
- Leadership in communication and education

Past winners include projects carrying out large scale pest control, inspiring children to care for the environment, eco-friendly businesses and collaborative marine management groups.

“We look forward to welcoming the finalists to Parliament on June 7 for the awards evening during the week of World Environment Day,” Dr Smith says.

“At this year’s ceremony we will also be presenting the Loder Cup, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious flora conservation award,” Ms Barry says.

“It’s fitting that we are able to recognise substantial achievements of conservationists at such a well-attended and high-profile event.”
