Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the ASB Polyfest, now underway in Auckland, is a wonderful reflection of New Zealand’s growing diversity.

Polyfest celebrates its 41st anniversary this week and is expected to attract around 9000 students and up to 100,000 spectators from around New Zealand.

“It is a highlight in the Pacific events calendar. This festival means a lot to Pacific families.  Families return each year to watch their young ones perform, just as they did when they were at high school,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand’s Pacific Peoples are the country’s fastest growing youth population, with almost half (46.1%) of the population under 20-years-old.

“Hundreds of young performers are on stage at Polyfest cheered on by their families and peers and this helps encourage young people to hold onto their culture. This kind of cultural legacy instils mana, pride and belonging for Pacific young people,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I wish all the performers and their families the very best for Polyfest,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Polyfest runs until Saturday 19 March, at the Manukau Sports Bowl, Auckland.
