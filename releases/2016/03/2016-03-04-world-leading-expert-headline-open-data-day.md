For the first time ever, New Zealanders will have the chance to talk open data and innovation with world-renowned US expert on open government Beth Noveck, Land Information Minister Louise Upston said today.

Named one of the “13 Influential Women in Technology” by the Huffington Post, Ms Noveck will talk to a New Zealand audience online to mark International Open Data Day on 5 March.

“This day is a chance for people around the world to support and encourage the adoption of open data policies by local, regional and central governments,” Ms Upston says.

A pioneer of open government, Ms Noveck has a vision of collaborative democracy that uses the power of open data to improve collaboration between government and people.

“New Zealand has a strong and internationally-recognised history of open data, and events like this – run online and free to attend – will help us further spread the open data message.

“I want to see New Zealand continue to be a world leader in open data. Hearing from inspiring, international leaders who have helped drive global open data awareness can only help us to do better,” Ms Upston says.
