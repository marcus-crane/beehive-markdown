Prime Minister John Key will attend the fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit in Washington next week.

“The Nuclear Security Summit is an opportunity to address nuclear terrorism threats at the global level,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand is committed to the goal of securing vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide.  This meeting will be a chance to press for greater international cooperation in this area.”

New Zealand has attended the previous three Nuclear Security Summits, which were held in Washington in 2010, in Seoul in 2012 and the Hague in 2014.

“Since the first Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, New Zealand has contributed more than $4 million to international projects to strengthen nuclear security.

“We have also taken action to secure material in New Zealand through the Radiation Safety Act 2016, which was passed earlier this month, and provides new regulations for people who use or manage radioactive or nuclear material.

“Even as a small country, we are not immune to the risks posed by nuclear terrorism.”

Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, Mr Key will meet with senior members of President Obama’s Cabinet on trade and economic issues and will give a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce.

“The US is a key economic partner for New Zealand and I look forward to discussing ways of increasing trade between our two countries, including under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”

Mr Key will be in Washington from March 29 to April 1.
