Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne today announced that Lotto New Zealand has received the highest possible international recognition for its continued focus on providing a safe gaming environment.

Lotto New Zealand’s responsible gaming programme has been officially certified as best practice by the World Lottery Association under its Responsible Gaming Framework.

“Lotto New Zealand provides safe lottery and gaming products that allow New Zealanders to play and win while contributing money back to the community. In doing so, Lotto New Zealand provides a gaming environment that encourages responsible play and continues to improve the information, support and services provided to players,” says Mr Dunne.

Under the World Lottery Association’s Responsible Gaming Framework there are four possible levels of accreditation, with Level 4 being the highest level and denoting international best practice.

Lotto New Zealand is one of just four lotteries in the Asia Pacific region to receive the highest level of certification for its responsible gaming programme. On-going work to continuously improve its practice has elevated Lotto NZ’s responsible gaming programme from Level 2 in 2009, and Level 3 in 2014.

“In 2015, Lotto New Zealand transferred almost $200 million to the Lottery Grants Board for community purposes. Lottery funding is a major source of funding for Sport New Zealand, Creative New Zealand, and the New Zealand Film Commission, as well as more than 3,000 community organisations every year.

“Millions of New Zealanders play Lotto every week, while at the same time making a valuable contribution to community groups that help foster and sustain the New Zealand way of life through a wide array of sporting, cultural and heritage activities in our communities. Lotto NZ is to be congratulated for receiving this international recognition that endorses its operations as best practice”, says Mr Dunne.  

**Background information:**

**About the World Lottery Association (WLA):** The WLA is a member-based organisation that sets the international benchmark for responsible gaming. The WLA represents over 300 members and associate members from over 90 countries on five continents. WLA membership is exclusive and requires adherence to a responsible gaming code of conduct.

**The WLA’s Responsible Gaming Framework:** To obtain certification, member lotteries submit their responsible gaming programmes for review by an Independent Assessment Panel made up of international experts from the field of corporate social responsibility.

Each programme is assessed on 10 core elements: research, employee education, retailer training and support, game design, online gaming, advertising and marketing, player education, treatment referral, stakeholder engagement, and reporting and measurement.

Level 4 certification demonstrates accepted international best practice with robust evidence of Lotto NZ’s commitment to continuous improvement.
