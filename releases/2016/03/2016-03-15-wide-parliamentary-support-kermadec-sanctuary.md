Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith has welcomed the first reading of the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary Bill in Parliament today with the unanimous support of the National, Labour, Greens, NZ First, Maori, United Future and Act Parties.

“This unanimous support from all parties in the Parliament reflects New Zealand’s strong connection to the marine environment and a cross-Parliament commitment to us leading an international effort to improve the management of the oceans,” Dr Smith says.

“The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary is twice the land area of New Zealand and is a significant global commitment to improved protection of the ocean environment. It is one of the most pristine and dramatic areas of ocean, with the largest arc of underwater volcanoes anywhere in the world and going to a depth of over 10 kilometres. The six million birds, 35 species of whale and dolphins, three species of turtle, and 150 species of fish, as well as many other unique marine species of corals, shellfish and crabs will benefit from this new sanctuary.

“This Bill reflects the Government’s ambition for New Zealand to be a world leader in the responsible management and protection of the ocean. It builds on our work of introducing proper environmental regulation of our Exclusive Economic Zone, creating 11 new marine reserves in the territorial sea, our advocacy for a marine protected area (MPA) in the Ross Sea, and our discussion paper on reforming the Marine Reserves Act. The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary is New Zealand’s contribution to a network of MPAs in the Pacific that we are working with other countries on building.”

The Bill has been referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee for public submissions with a report back to Parliament by 2 August 2016. The Government’s ambition is to have the new sanctuary in place by November.
