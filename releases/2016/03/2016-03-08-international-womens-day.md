New Zealand can be proud of its reputation as a nation that empowers women to lead independent and self-determining lives, said Minister for Women Louise Upston, but we can’t be complacent in our progress towards gender equality.

The Minister made the comments in response to International Women’s Day – a global celebration of the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.

“International Women’s Day is an opportunity for everyone to reflect on how far we’ve come, and where we need to focus our efforts to ensure we continue to improve the lives of all women, now and into the future.”

Minister Upston said there were many indicators that showed New Zealand was on its way to gender equality.

“More women are working, gaining tertiary qualifications and are studying or working in high growth sectors than ever before,” she said.

“However, we need to ensure our successes translate into better outcomes, particularly when thinking about the gender pay gap and women in leadership.”

She said the Government’s legislation to make it easier for employees to work flexibly is a step in the right direction.

“We know that having more work arrangements with flexibility for everyone helps advance women’s careers.”

And more women would pursue leadership roles if they’re well supported to take the next step in their careers. 

“Until women have equal rights, equal choice, equal opportunities, equal expectations and are valued equally, there is still work to be done and International Women’s Day reminds us of this."
