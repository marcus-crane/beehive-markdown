More efficient use of office space and the sharing of facilities by government agencies has saved taxpayers $57 million over the past financial year, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

The fifth Crown Office Estate Report, released by the Property Management Centre of Expertise (PMCoE), shows the government is continuing to reduce the Crown’s property footprint while ensuring its employees are in modern, safe and healthy work environments.

“In the year to 30 June 2015, the Crown estate footprint was reduced by 30,997sq m. This takes the total reduction to 152,293sq m since 2011, a saving of $132 million to taxpayers,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Christchurch Integrated Government Property programme also delivered its first building. This is not only supporting the revitalisation of Christchurch’s business centre but is also creating a more collaborative relationship between government agencies.”

The PMCoE’s focus on helping agencies work together more closely is an important part of delivering Better Public Services, Mrs Bennett says.

“This collaboration and the modernisation of workplaces also supports greater productivity, resulting in better services for the public.

“By reducing the office space the Crown uses and using the spaces it has more efficiently, our government is on track to save about $110 million annually by 2023,” Mrs Bennett says.
