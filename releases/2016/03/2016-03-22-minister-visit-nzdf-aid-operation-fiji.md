Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for Fiji to meet and thank New Zealand Defence Force personnel helping with the relief effort in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston.

“I am visiting Fiji to support and thank our military people who have worked hard to assist the Fijians following last month’s cyclone,” Mr Brownlee says.

The cyclone killed at least 42 people, and damaged or destroyed many thousands of homes and other buildings.

The NZDF has mainly been conducting relief operations in the Lau group of islands.

As well as visiting Vanua Balavu accompanied by Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, the Minister will call on the Fijian Minister for Defence, Hon Timoci Natuva, and Minister of Agriculture and National Disaster Management, Hon Inia Seruiratu.

“New Zealanders can be proud of the achievements of our Defence Force during this extensive aid operation,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It has been one of the NZDF’s largest peacetime deployments to the Pacific.”

The NZDF has had at its peak just over 470 personnel in Fiji working on recovery and reconstruction work, operating from two ships and a number of aircraft including two NH-90 helicopters, a SH-2G Seasprite helicopter and a Hercules aircraft.

The two Royal New Zealand Navy vessels deployed were the Offshore Patrol Vessel HMNZS Wellington, and the multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury, which transported the NZDF helicopters to Fiji.
