Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says that this Sunday is a chance to celebrate children and young people in care and the caregivers who look after them, with Children’s Day and the start of Foster Care Awareness week.

“Children’s Day is a chance to celebrate the young people in our lives and across the country – particularly those children who through no fault of their own are in care,” Mrs Tolley says.

“It’s also an appropriate day to mark the beginning of Foster Care Awareness week and to acknowledge the work of the more than 3,600 Child, Youth and Family (CYF) caregivers who look after over 4,200 children and young people who aren’t able to live at home.”

CYF will be hosting special events around the country to thank and acknowledge their foster carers, including family fun days and morning teas.

“Children tell us that more than anything they want a loving, stable home and our foster carers do a fantastic job providing a safe family that supports them to be their best,” Mrs Tolley says.

“These young people have often had a difficult start in life and it’s important we have the right caregivers who can give them the understanding and encouragement to heal and recover from the trauma and abuse they have experienced.

“The expert panel leading a complete overhaul of CYF is working on a plan to engage all New Zealanders on what they can do for vulnerable children in their communities.

“The panel’s interim report also points out that we need to provide better support for caregivers so they can provide the long-term, safe environments that allow children to thrive.

“These issues will be addressed as part of the overhaul.”

A paper will be going to Cabinet on the next steps for CYF in the next few weeks.
