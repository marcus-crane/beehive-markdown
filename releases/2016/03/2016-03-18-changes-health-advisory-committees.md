Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has announced changes to the current health advisory committees and entities.

The National Health Board and National Health Committee will be disestablished and their functions streamlined into the Ministry of Health.

“We need a strengthened and streamlined Ministry which is empowered to lead the health system. I want to see clearer roles and accountabilities, and duplication reduced,” says Dr Coleman.

“When the National Health Board and National Health Committee were established their input was necessary, however the health sector has evolved considerably.

“The role of these committees was reviewed last year during the refresh of the New Zealand Health Strategy. Consultation feedback indicated support for clarifying health sector roles and responsibilities.

“It’s important to retain the functions of the National Health IT Board, the Capital Investment Committee and Health Workforce New Zealand. They bring wide views and advice from across the sector.

“I would like to thank the National Health Board and National Health Committee members for their contribution.”

The National Health Board was established as part of the 2009 Ministerial Review Group reforms to plan and fund national services, fund and monitor DHBs, oversee capacity planning for IT, workforce and capital works.

The National Health Committee has existed in various forms since 1992. Since 2011 it has focused on new health technologies and interventions.

Health Workforce New Zealand, the Health Quality and Safety Commission and the Health Promotion Agency remain unchanged.

The National Health Board has two sub-committees which will be retained - the National Health IT Board will be accountable to the Director-General of Health, and the Capital Investment Committee will be reconstituted as a Section 11 Committee under the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000.
