Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has acknowledged the time, effort and work by all parties in Parliament to reach a consensus position for the second reading of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill.

All parties supported the Bill at first reading, and subsequent to the select committee process, have continued discussions to ensure there was as broad as possible agreement on a structure that would be best suited for Christchurch’s ongoing regeneration.  

“It has always been my preference to have broad Parliamentary support for what is a very important piece of legislation,” Mr Brownlee says.

“There has been give and take in this process, as we’ve further developed the legislative back-up needed for Christchurch’s regeneration.

“Maintaining momentum in greater Christchurch is necessary for the success of the city, and the country.

“Over the past 10 days I’ve hosted meetings in my office with representatives of Labour, New Zealand First, the Green Party, the Maori Party, United Future and Act to understand and address their reservations about the Bill reported back from select committee.

“I also had the Mayor of Christchurch join parties to give Christchurch City Council’s perspective on how new legislation might work in practice.

“All these discussions have been constructive, in a good faith environment, and common ground wasn’t too difficult to reach.

“As a result we have been able to agree on a Supplementary Order Paper that will strengthen the position of Regenerate Christchurch; preserve public input to Regeneration Plans; and more closely prescribes the powers of the Minister.

“The unwavering support the whole Parliament has given to Canterbury through the difficulty of the past five years is set to continue as Christchurch and its communities enter the regeneration phase,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill is scheduled to be read a second time this week.
