ACC Minister Nikki Kaye will travel to Canada this evening for two days’ of portfolio-related meetings and discussions in Toronto and Vancouver.

“A key aim of this trip is to identify learnings that could be applied to ACC as it enters a significant chapter in its 42-year history. I will also have meetings related to my other portfolios of Civil Defence and Youth, and in my capacity as Associate Minister of Education,” says Ms Kaye.

“ACC has come a long way recently. It’s reached the goal of being a fully funded scheme, and this has paved the way for $2 billion of levy cuts. The Government has also introduced greater transparency to the levy setting process.

“As ACC now embarks on a five-year transformation programme to modernise systems and processes and improve customer service, it’s timely to see how it compares against similar schemes overseas.

“In Canada I will meet senior representatives of two workplace injury compensation schemes, the Ontario Work Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), and Worksafe British Columbia (Worksafe BC).

“Unlike ACC, these Canadian schemes only provide work-related injury cover. However, there are considerable synergies with ACC when it comes to their overall goals and approach, including a shared commitment to injury prevention as well as rehabilitation.

“Worksafe BC has achieved very high levels of client satisfaction and reduced injury rates. The WSIB, which has implemented a change programme with similarities to that being undertaken by ACC, has also achieved reduced injuries and a very strong rehabilitation performance, so I look forward to seeing what insights can be gained from their experience.

Other meetings over the two days in Canada will include:

- Hon Naomi Yamamoto, Minister for State Emergency Preparedness, and senior emergency management officials re emergency management systems and other Civil Defence related issues
- Giles Gherson, Deputy Minister Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, re Ontario’s investment in school infrastructure and future-focused, digitally-based learning
- Hon Shirley Bond, Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training and Minister Responsible for Labour, to discuss a range of topics, from injury prevention to dispute resolution and innovation in service provision
- Sky T Losier, Leader of the Opposition, British Columbia Youth Parliament.

“This is an opportunity to share similarities and challenges across my portfolios and to gain insights from both a legislative and policy perspective that could be beneficial to the New Zealand context.”
