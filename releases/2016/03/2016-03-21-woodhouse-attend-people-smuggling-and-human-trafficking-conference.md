Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse will today travel to Indonesia to attend the sixth Bali Process Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime.

The Conference brings together 43 countries to find practical measures to deter and disrupt the irregular movement of people.

“The Bali Process is an opportunity for New Zealand to confirm our support and commitment to tackling the problem of people smuggling and human trafficking,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“New Zealand continues to make a significant contribution in this area and this conference is integral to that.

“It is about working together effectively to deter and disrupt these dangerous and undesirable activities and improve our own border security as a result.”

Mr Woodhouse departs for Indonesia this evening and returns on Thursday 24 March.
