Education Minister Hekia Parata says public consultation over the Education Act shows New Zealanders want their kids to receive a well-rounded education that equips them to play a full part in the modern world.

Ms Parata today released a summary of public submissions on the proposed update of the 27-year-old Act.

“The summary shows New Zealanders want their kids to succeed academically, to be prepared for work and future life and to be helped to become good citizens. They also want their cultural heritage to be recognised and valued.

“The submissions also show that the public believe some changes are necessary to ensure education legislation remains fit for purpose.”

More than 1800 submissions were received during the six-week consultation period. Teachers comprised the single biggest group of submitters, but significant numbers of submissions were also made by parents, business groups, community organisations and students themselves.

“‘Student progress’ was seen by many as the most important indicator of school performance,” says Ms Parata.

“Proposals to write the goals of education and the roles and responsibilities of Boards of Trustees into the Education Act also received significant support as did proposals to make cohort entry easier, simplify school planning and reporting cycles and make attendance compulsory once a child under the age of six starts school.”

The submissions will help to shape new education legislation that is likely to be introduced to Parliament before the end of the year.
