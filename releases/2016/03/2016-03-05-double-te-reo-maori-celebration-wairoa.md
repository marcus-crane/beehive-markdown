Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell congratulates the Wairoa community on a double celebration: Te Kura Motuhake o Te Ataarangi marks its 20th anniversary, and Te Ataarangi o Te Wairoa marks its 30th.

Te Kura Motuhake is an educational arm of Te Rūnanga o Te Ataarangi.  It is a total immersion Māori language provider based on the principles and methods of Te Ataarangi.

“The contribution of Te Kura Motuhake to the preservation, promotion and advancement of te reo and tikanga Māori is exemplary for its size and context,” says Mr Flavell.

Minister Flavell also acknowledged Mana Elizabeth Hunkin – better known as Whaea Liz – sought regionally and nationally for her educational skills and knowledge of te reo Māori.  Whaea Liz is Tumuaki at Te Kura Motuhake, and has received awards for sustained excellence in tertiary teaching and also winner of the 2015 Māori Language Leadership Award.

“Our celebrations are a testament to the value bestowed on her by the community she has served and the quality and commitment she continues to provide to te reo Māori,” he says.

Mr Flavell says Te Kura Motuhake provides an opportunity for ākonga and whānau who are seeking to reclaim their language and identity as Māori in a safe, nurturing and inclusive way.

“Graduates enhance the mana of their whānau, hapū and marae by contributing back their skills and knowledge on the paepae, as ringawera or workers, as kaikaranga, and as kaiako in kura and kōhanga reo.”
