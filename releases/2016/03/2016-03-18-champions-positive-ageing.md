Outstanding advocates for an age-friendly society will become SuperSeniors Champions under a new programme launched today by Seniors Minister Maggie Barry.

“This is about seniors talking about issues that matter to seniors,” Ms Barry says. “Our Champions will be inspirational role models who embody the idea of positive ageing.

“They will raise awareness of our ageing population, how we can make our towns and cities better places to be old, and advocate for the voices of seniors to be heard in their communities.”

At the New Plymouth Positive Ageing Seminar, Ms Barry announced Lance Girling-Butcher will be the first Champion.

A former editor of the Taranaki Daily News and New Plymouth District Councillor, Mr Girling-Butcher is a committed campaigner for older and disabled people in the region. He is currently working with the Office for Seniors to introduce the Community Connects model to New Plymouth.

“Lance lost his sight almost a decade ago and has not only continued his work but redoubled his efforts to help seniors and people with disabilities in his community,” Ms Barry says.

“This is a privilege and an honour,” Mr Girling-Butcher says. “It’s important for the whole community to get on top of our ageing population and it’s also an opportunity to respect and recognise older people.”

Other champions will be recruited over the next few months and announced on World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 15 June

Through Community Connects, the Office for Seniors is encouraging more New Zealand towns and cities to work towards Age-Friendly City status, under guidelines from the World Health Organisation.

Like many other parts of New Zealand, New Plymouth is ageing. Around 17 per cent of residents are aged over 65, with this forecast to rise to 26 per cent by 2036.

Nationally, in the next two decades there will be around 1.3 million people aged over 65. 

“Planning ahead to meet the challenge of an ageing society is important for the long-term social and economic health of the country,” Ms Barry says.

“The increased demand for older people’s services and an ageing workforce should not be seen as a problem – it’s an opportunity for our country, and one we need to embrace.”
