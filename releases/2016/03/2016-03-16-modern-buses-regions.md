Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says changes to a transport rule will encourage modern, safer buses, able to carry more passengers between regions.

The *Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass* amendments expand on changes that came into force in urban areas on 1 October 2015.

“Transport operators will now have more choices when purchasing vehicles, and high-capacity buses already operating between our towns and cities will be able to increase their capacity,” Mr Foss says.

“These changes open the door to new tourism opportunities in the regions, and may also enable a greater uptake of hybrid and electric buses, which are generally heavier than diesel vehicles.

“In Auckland, higher axle mass limits have already enabled double-decker buses to operate on key public transport routes, offering more seats at peak times. The changes announced today will enable people travelling between towns and cities to also ride on more modern, safer and environmentally-friendly vehicles.

“Safety has been a key consideration — vehicles will not be issued with permits in excess of their design limits, or beyond their Certificate of Loading, and road controlling authorities will be able to specify routes to ensure heavier vehicles travel on roads that are suitable and safe.

“Heavier vehicles will also be subject to higher road user charges to cover the extra maintenance costs.”

Mr Foss says these changes are an intermediate step as the Government is considering additional increases in axle mass and size limits for heavy vehicles through the broader Vehicle Dimensions and Mass Review.

“I anticipate receiving further advice from the Ministry of Transport and New Zealand Transport Agency on this review in the coming weeks,” Mr Foss says.
