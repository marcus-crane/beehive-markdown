Education Minister Hekia Parata acknowledges that a settlement has been reached between the Ministry of Education, Teach First NZ, The University of Auckland and the PPTA in relation to the Teach First NZ programme.

“This means that Teach First NZ can continue getting some of the best and brightest graduates into the schools that need them most,” says Ms Parata.

Teach First NZ recruits high-achieving graduates and places them in low-decile secondary schools for an initial two-year commitment. 

“This ground-breaking programme has been producing teachers who have been making a real difference for young people in schools with some of the biggest educational challenges. The feedback from those schools has been overwhelmingly positive.

“Reaching this settlement quickly allows Teach First NZ to focus on recruiting more outstanding graduates into teaching so that we can raise achievement.”
