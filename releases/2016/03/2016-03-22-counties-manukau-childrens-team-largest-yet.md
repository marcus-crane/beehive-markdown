Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the country’s largest Children’s Team has been launched in Counties Manukau and will work with 1,400 children and young people in the first two years.

“The Counties Manukau Children’s Team is the tenth Team to be launched and will initially work with children from Papakura, Manurewa and Clendon,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Children’s Teams work with at-risk children and their families by appointing a single Lead Professional to coordinate one plan to support the family so they don’t require state intervention.

“This will mean a change in the way professionals work to support a child and their family. It will mean working together, sharing information and coordinating services.

“At-risk children have multiple and interconnected needs that one agency or NGO alone cannot fix. By working together and coordinating a plan around the child we can make a significant difference in the lives of the whole family.

“Instead of adding new services, a Children’s Team ensures a family is accessing the right services to address their needs and is supported to make positive changes in their lives so they can thrive.”

The Counties Manukau Team will be supported by the Vulnerable Kids Information System (ViKI) pilot which is already operating in the Hamilton and Canterbury Teams, and the Hub, a contact point for professionals with concerns about a child.

Children’s Teams are accepting referrals in Rotorua, Whangarei, Marlborough, Horowhenua/Ōtaki, Hamilton, Tairawhiti, Eastern Bay of Plenty, Whanganui and Canterbury.
