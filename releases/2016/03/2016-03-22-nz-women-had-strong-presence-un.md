New Zealand had a strong voice in discussions on gender equality and the empowerment of women at the United Nations in New York last week.

“New Zealand has an international reputation for working towards gender equality. We value this opportunity to share our work and learn from others, to improve the lives of women,” said Ms Upston.

New Zealand’s National Statement at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women was presented by Ministry for Women Chief Executive Dr Jo Cribb on 18 March.

The [Commission on the Status of Women](http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw) is the global policy-making body dedicated to gender equality and the advancement of women.

This year’s theme is women’s empowerment and its link to sustainable development. The national statement highlights New Zealand’s involvement in sustainable development efforts, particularly as it relates to gender equality.

“Sustainable development requires action on an economic, environmental and social level,” Ms Upston said. “This is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, which call for a wide range of actions including equitable education, gender equality, combatting climate change, and eliminating poverty.”

“A country cannot advance, and advance sustainably, if half its population is left behind.”

Every year, representatives of UN Member States gather in New York to evaluate progress on gender equality, identify challenges, set global standards, and formulate concrete policies to promote gender equality and the advancement of women worldwide.
