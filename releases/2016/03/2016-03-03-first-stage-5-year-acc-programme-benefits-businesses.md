Improved services for businesses will be a key focus of the first stage of the ACC transformation programme announced today, says ACC Minister Nikki Kaye.

“ACC has come a long way since 2008/09 when it posted a yearly deficit of $4.8 billion. Since then, the scheme’s assets have grown from $10 billion to $33 billion, thanks to its world class investment team, which has consistently exceeded market benchmarks,” says Ms Kaye.

“An 11 per cent reduction to average work levies paid by employers will be part of a further $450 million of ACC levy cuts which take effect on 1 April, taking the total work levy cuts since 2012 to $690 million, and the total levy cuts overall to $2 billion.

“This year will also see the removal of residual levies, which were used to collect historic claims costs, and this will see businesses pay fairer work levies based on more recent injury trends.

“Despite this good news for businesses, research carried out last year showed that just 26 per cent of businesses believe ACC understands their needs, and just 24 per cent believe ACC provides good value for money.

“I can confirm today that the first stage of the five-year transformation programme will begin to address longstanding issues affecting businesses’ trust and confidence in ACC.

“One of the first changes will be improved levy invoices, which have long been a source of dissatisfaction for the more than 500,000 businesses invoiced each year by ACC.

“When I have talked with businesses and self-employed people around New Zealand, many have told me how confusing and frustrating the ACC levy and payment system can be for them.

“ACC has worked with businesses on ways to simplify the invoices, and from 1 July this year they will be easier to understand and have fewer pages.

“The average self-employed invoice will reduce from eight pages to two; the average small employer invoice will reduce from ten pages to four, and the average large employer invoice will reduce from 12 pages to six.

“ACC is also aligning its system with Inland Revenue and Statistics New Zealand, to make it easier for businesses to advise ACC of the particular work they do. A new Business Industry Classification Code website is ensuring businesses have the right classification and are not overcharged levies.

“ACC is looking at using the New Zealand Business Number tool to gather correct and up-to-date information about new businesses. This will reduce the number of times business customers have to provide the same information to government departments or agencies.

“ACC will also move to introduce online payments for businesses within the next year. At the moment, businesses complain about how hard it is to pay their levies and how long it takes, and this is contributing to the debt of over $182 million for unpaid levies.

“All of these changes will help ensure that levies are calculated more accurately and processed in a more timely and convenient way. However, the biggest gains for businesses lie further ahead.

“New digital services will provide businesses with real-time information on injury rates and trends in their workplaces, giving them a clearer picture of what’s driving levies and supporting them to develop more effective injury prevention initiatives.

“This is about putting businesses in the driver’s seat when it comes to creating safer workplaces and helping to reduce industry levy rates.

“Last year, work-related injuries cost $665 million in ACC claims costs alone, not to mention the personal costs and business impacts such as disrupted services and lost productivity.

“The changes ACC is making will potentially reduce costs and injuries, ensuring less productive time is lost to injury. They will also help people with more complex injuries get back to work sooner.

“The changes are among the biggest in the 42-year history of the ACC scheme, and demonstrate that ACC is on the right track to improve trust and confidence amongst businesses and all New Zealanders.”
