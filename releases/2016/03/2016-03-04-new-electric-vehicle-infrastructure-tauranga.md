Transport and Energy Minister and Tauranga MP Simon Bridges today opened two new electric vehicle charging stations at Bayfair Shopping Centre.

“As Minister of both Transport and Energy & Resources, I’ve long been a proponent of electric vehicles so it’s great to see local businesses getting on board and providing this infrastructure free to the Tauranga community,” Mr Bridges says.

“While most charging will likely take place at the home or workplace, a network of charging infrastructure is necessary to support the increased uptake of electric vehicles. This will help facilitate longer distance travel and enhance the value of electric vehicles.”

Mr Bridges says the benefits of increasing uptake of electric vehicles are far-reaching.

“Electric vehicles reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, reduce fuel cost and enhance the efficiency of our renewable electricity networks.

“Across their life cycle — from resource extraction and manufacturing to driving and disposal — electric vehicles have 60% fewer CO2 emissions than petrol vehicles.

“In addition, because of New Zealand’s high renewable electricity generation, they have 80% fewer CO2 emissions when driven here.  If we start to replace our fleet with electric vehicles, we can begin to significantly reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.”
