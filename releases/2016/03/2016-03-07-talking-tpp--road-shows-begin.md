The first roadshow on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was held in Auckland today to an audience of around 300 people. 

Trade Minister Todd McClay says this is the first of 16 roadshows and hui throughout New Zealand.

“TPP has been the most widely-consulted Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in New Zealand’s history, and this conversation will continue throughout 2016.

“While we believe this FTA is of undeniable and significant benefit to New Zealanders, we want to give every Kiwi who has interests an opportunity to ask questions. 

“This includes exporters seeking new opportunities under TPP, and anyone who has questions or concerns.”

“The roadshows and hui are designed to allow open debate, informed discussion, and a clear path forward for businesses that can recognise the benefits of a market that comprises 36 per cent of the world’s GDP.

“This is New Zealand’s largest free trade agreement. The TPP economies are worth US$28 trillion and open New Zealand exporters up to a customer base of 800 million people.

“It is a document that has the potential to seriously enhance both the national and regional economies and is estimated to add at least $2.7 billion to New Zealand’s economy every year from 2030.

“This FTA is important. It could be the difference between job gains and job losses in regions around New Zealand.

“We have huge wins in horticulture, forestry, fishing, wine, meat and dairy – and many other sectors.

“Over the next few months we have 50 engagements booked to talk to regions about TPP.

“We look forward to seeing you there.”
