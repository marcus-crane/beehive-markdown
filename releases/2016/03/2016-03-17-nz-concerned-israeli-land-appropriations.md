Foreign Minister Murray McCully has described the most recent Israeli appropriation of land in the occupied Palestinian territories as deeply unhelpful. 

“Israel’s settlement activity continues to threaten the viability of a two-state solution,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand would like to see both sides return to the negotiating table and this latest announcement will only serve to push the two parties further apart.

“We will be talking with fellow UN Security Council members about an appropriate response,” Mr McCully says.
