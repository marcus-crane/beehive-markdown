Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed unanimous support for the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill during its third and final reading in Parliament today.

“Five years on from the February 22 earthquake, the Parliament of New Zealand continues its full support for the people of Canterbury as they go from strength to strength,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The passing of this bill ensures momentum in greater Christchurch is maintained and sees the Government working in a unique collaboration with local leadership organisations to ensure regeneration of the region, with a clear future focus.”

The Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill:

- establishes Regenerate Christchurch, an entity jointly controlled by the Crown and Christchurch City Council;
- sets the path for a return to local leadership;
- has the key objective of moving on from the earthquake recovery phase and into the regeneration phase;
- sets out the process for Regeneration Plans, which replace Recovery Plans;
- and sets out the powers available to the Minister and Chief Executive, particularly in relation to land use and planning.

“The bill reflects the draft Transition Recovery Plan released in July last year, which set out proposals for the new legislation and invited public comment,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I would like to thank members of the Advisory Board on Transition, central government agencies, CERA’s strategic partners and officials for their hard work and sound advice in developing this legislation.

“The bill incorporates written comments made by the public and work undertaken by all parties in Parliament, and I thank everyone for their carefully considered input.

“We have achieved a significant amount of progress in Christchurch and its outlying areas, which would have been impossible without the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.

“The passing of this bill heralds a new opportunity for Christchurch and its communities as we work to create a vibrant, regenerated greater Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.
