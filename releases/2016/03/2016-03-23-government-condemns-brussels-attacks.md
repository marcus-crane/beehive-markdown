Prime Minister John Key has condemned the attacks in Brussels and says New Zealanders are thinking about the people and the government of Belgium.

“We utterly condemn these appalling acts which have killed and wounded so many,” Mr Key says.

“No innocent person should have to worry about such violence when going about their daily lives and New Zealand stands with Belgium in the fight against terrorism.

“Atrocities like this and the recent attacks in Turkey are a stark reminder of why the international community must stand together in the global fight against terrorism.

“Our thoughts are with Belgians in the aftermath of this shocking attack.”

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade are working to ascertain whether any New Zealanders have been caught up in the attacks and any who are in Brussels are urged to make contact with their families. At this stage there are no reports of any New Zealanders being affected.
