Nominations are now open for the 2016 Youth Awards, which celebrate young people who’ve achieved outstanding results, and those who’ve made a significant contribution to supporting young people, says Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

“The awards, now in their third year, will recognise up to 45 people and organisations across seven different award categories,” says Ms Kaye.

“If you know someone who deserves recognition for their achievements, then please put their name forward. Anyone can make a nomination, and I encourage nominations from community leaders and teachers, to youth workers and young people themselves.”

Last year, recipients of Youth Awards included:

- a student who captured on video the stories of remaining World War Two veterans
- a college group who developed a virtual landscape of the Gallipoli battlefield for use as an educational resource
- the founder of a non-profit performing arts company which delivers free leadership workshops to young people, to strengthen cultural identity and address social issues which impact them.

“The award categories in 2016 celebrate qualities such as leadership, being a change maker and giving back, as well as young people who’ve supported youth activities in areas such as the arts, culture, sport and environment.

“There are also awards for youth groups, individual young people and organisations that have supported or championed young people in any type of activity.

“This year, three awards have been introduced under the change maker category, to recognise the wide variety of initiatives that young people are active in.

“I continue to be amazed by the talented and committed young people who I meet across New Zealand.

“With the right support, young people are leading change in New Zealand and internationally, and this is something I want to continue to encourage as Minister for Youth.

“The Youth Awards are an opportunity to not only recognise young people’s achievements, but to also highlight the positive contribution that they are making to their communities and to New Zealand.”

Nominations for the 2016 Youth Awards close on 18 April. The winners will be formally recognised at a celebratory event at Parliament on 24 May 2016.
