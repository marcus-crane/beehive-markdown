Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell welcomes the release of the Waitangi Tribunal’s report on the reform of Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.

“I have received the Tribunal’s final report and will now consider it in its entirety”, says Mr Flavell.

“I welcomed the release of the Tribunal’s draft chapter in February and agree with its comments about the importance of retaining whenua Māori in Māori hands for future generations.

“A primary focus of these reforms is to ensure that our whenua is retained as taonga tuku iho,” he says.

The draft Ture Whenua Māori Bill retains and strengthens the protections around Māori land.

“This principle sits at the heart of the reform alongside the greater ability of Māori land owners to have more autonomy over managing and using their land.”

Mr Flavell also agrees with the Tribunal’s comments about the importance of consultation with Māori land owners over the reform.

The Tribunal heard an urgent claim on the reform of Māori land law and the consultation in November and December 2015.  

Since the Tribunal hearings there have been a further 21 information hui nationwide, ongoing hui with stakeholder groups and workshops with Māori land owners.

“We are constantly receiving feedback from Māori land owners and representative groups. Following on from the public release of the exposure Ture Whenua Māori Bill and feedback last year we made 109 changes to the draft.

At recent hui Mr Flavell gave an undertaking to consider the Waitangi Tribunal’s final report before introducing the Ture Whenua Māori Bill into Parliament.

“I will honour my commitment to give the Tribunal’s report my full consideration”, says Mr Flavell.
