The new Toyota Kiwi Guardians programme launched today will help families have fun while they enjoy the great outdoors, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Developed by the Department of Conservation as part of its five-year partnership with Toyota, Kiwi Guardians will promote family-friendly activities at 20 different sites across the country.

“Kiwi Guardians is all about having fun, getting out into New Zealand’s natural world and learning more about it,” Ms Barry says.

“We want to see young people cherishing their land and wildlife. This programme is designed to engage kids with the natural world with enjoyable, accessible activities, and give them a chance to earn a special medal for their efforts.”

The programme will help promote DOC’s *Healthy Nature Healthy People* message, focused on encouraging people to use New Zealand's natural spaces to maintain and improve their health and wellbeing.

Kiwi Guardians activities are available in Auckland, Napier, Palmerston North, New Plymouth, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“More activities will be available soon – DOC plans to have 50 on offer by the end of this year,” Ms Barry says.

“DOC is always looking to build partnerships with business, community groups and philanthropists. From multi-nationals like Toyota to the local hardware store, partners enable DOC to expand the range of its work and reach more New Zealanders than ever before.”
