Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is urging drivers, motorcyclists and cyclists to be extra vigilant on the roads this Easter long weekend as heavy traffic is expected.

“Every death or serious injury on our roads is one too many. So far this year 83 people have needlessly lost their lives on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

“This number is a stark reminder that we must remain focused on road safety at all times, and remember not only the victims, but the families, friends and communities left behind.

“Preliminary statistics from 2015 show alcohol, drugs, speed, distraction, fatigue — or a combination of these — contributed to more than two thirds of fatal crashes.

“Eighty people killed on our roads last year were not wearing a seatbelt — this year that number is already 23. For most New Zealanders, buckling up is second nature, but a disappointingly large number are still not getting the message about a simple action that can, quite literally, be life-saving.”

Six simple steps can help drivers keep themselves and other road users safe:

- Drive sober
- Stick within the speed limit
- Pull over for a short rest when tired
- Keep focused on the road
- Be patient with other road users
- Wear a seatbelt and make sure passengers do too.

“There are some major road works going on around the country which may contribute to delays. Factoring extra time into your journey will reduce stress and the likelihood of making silly mistakes,” Mr Foss says.

The official Easter holiday period for 2016 will begin at 4pm Thursday 24 March and end at 6am Tuesday 29 March.
