The Department of Corrections’ new Timaru Community Corrections site was officially opened today, said Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

“The new site redevelopment, which cost $2.4 million, is part of a $70 million nationwide renewal programme to make Community Corrections sites more secure and better equipped to support offenders to turn their lives around.

“The new site will enable Corrections to provide more rehabilitation and educational programmes and it offers improved security and working conditions for staff.

“The site manages around 300 offenders on community-based sentences and orders including home detention and community work sentences.

“Corrections staff provide a very important service in the community. They work at a very personal level with some of our country’s most challenging offenders.

“Community Corrections manages offenders to hold them to account, to comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of reoffending, help them become productive members of society and keep local communities safe.

Rangitata MP Jo Goodhew represented the Crown at the opening of the building at 55 North Street, Timaru.
