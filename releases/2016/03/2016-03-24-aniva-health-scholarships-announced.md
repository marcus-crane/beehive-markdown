Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says more than 160 Pacific tertiary students will benefit this year from the Aniva Scholarships for health-related qualifications.

The Ministry of Health’s Aniva Scholarships aim is to strengthen the Pacific health workforce by providing financial assistance to Pacific students committed to improving the health of their communities.

"We know pacific peoples are under-represented in the health workforce. Pacific communities also have poorer health status in a number of areas, including child and youth health," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"Boosting the number of pacific people working across the range of health professions can only benefit our pacific communities and the wider health sector."

“Yesterday I visited Onehunga High School’s Health Science Academy and talked with students about their future career plans in the health area.  Many of these students go on to apply for the Aniva scholarships, already having a background studying health sciences,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The 168 scholarships, totalling one million dollars this year, are awarded based on academic achievement, community involvement, leadership qualities and commitment to Pacific communities.

For the first time this year current Pacific health professionals wanting to upskill were also able to apply, along with first year nursing and midwifery students.

Scholarships for medicine and dentistry have been capped at $5,000 this year. Scholarships to students in other specialties are not capped.

The Ministry of Health Aniva Scholarships are funded annually through the Pacific Provider Workforce Development Fund.
