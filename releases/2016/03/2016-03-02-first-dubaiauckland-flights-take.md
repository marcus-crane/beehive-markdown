The start of Emirates Airline’s new Dubai / Auckland service increases New Zealand’s connectivity with the rest of the world, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

The airline completed its first non-stop service from Dubai to Auckland today.

“New Zealand has one of the most liberal air transport policies in the world.  It is encouraging to see Emirates taking advantage of this with a direct connection between Auckland and Dubai,” Mr Bridges says.\`

“The Government’s success in negotiating Air Services Agreements is providing New Zealand access to a large wealth of benefits including tourism and trade,” Mr Bridges says.

“Most of the major airlines in the world are now able to operate services to New Zealand without restriction. More than 70 air services agreements are in place with 16 new air routes announced in the past year including direct flights to Los Angeles, Beijing and Buenos Aires.

“This is an unprecedented flourishing of air services in and out of New Zealand in terms of services starting, connecting us to more and more of the world.

Mr Bridges says Emirates has been an important part of New Zealand’s linkages to the rest of the world since it started services via Australia in 2003.

“The United Arab Emirates is our primary entry point to the Middle East, and one of New Zealand’s top 15 trading partners. Being a trading country, we rely on effective air services  to create much needed connections with the rest of the world.

“Direct flights will encourage even more trade and tourism between our two countries, by offering more choice to passengers and freight customers.”

The new service will also improve New Zealand’s links to countries in Emirates’ extensive network in Europe and Africa.
