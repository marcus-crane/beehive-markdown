A five-year report on progress towards improving Waikato and Waipa Rivers’ environmental management has been welcomed by Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith, who says it strongly illustrates how the Government, iwi, councils and the community could achieve results by working together.

“The Waikato River is New Zealand's longest at 442 kilometres and poses one of our greatest national challenges in improving freshwater quality. The progress that has been achieved in the first five years of the Waikato River Authority is impressive, although we have decades of ongoing work to achieve the required gains in freshwater and river quality,” Dr Smith says.

"The cap and trade nutrient scheme on Lake Taupō is world leading and three years ahead of schedule in reducing nitrate leaking by 170 tonnes per year from the headwaters of the Waikato. The Waikato River Authority's achievements of 1.1 million native trees and shrubs planted, 85 kilometres of waterways fenced and $22.4 million spent of 137 projects is part of the long-term progress needed to better protect the rivers. The next key step will be notification of the Waikato Regional Council's Healthy Rivers Plan later this year in response to the Government's national policy requirements that will set limits on nutrients within the Waikato River’s 11,000 square kilometre catchment.”

Dr Smith was in Hamilton for a hui and public meeting on the Government's Next Steps on Freshwater Management policy proposals and to receive the Waikato River Authority's first five-yearly report.

“We have a huge national challenge in upping the way we manage freshwater that is going to require tighter regulation, significant investment and a change in culture in how we treat our rivers and lakes. The long hydrological cycle of catchments like the Waikato mean that we have nutrients from practices decades ago continuing to flow into the river. This should not detract us from the need for action today but we need to be in for the long haul to turn around the quality of water in the river. That is why the Government has committed $220 million over 30 years to this critical national project.

“I am encouraged by the achievements to date but also want to ensure we have the structure and plan to continue this progress. The Waikato River Authority, as part of the Crown’s Treaty settlement with Waikato-Tainui is an important innovation, and as part of the settlement we will be reviewing the co-governance and co-management arrangements later this year.”
