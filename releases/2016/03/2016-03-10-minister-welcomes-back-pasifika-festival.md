Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed back the Pasifika Festival to its spiritual home at Auckland’s Western Springs this year.

The Pasifika Festival, which drew 80,000 people in 2014, had to move to South Auckland last year because of the Queensland fruit fly scare. It is back at Western Springs this weekend.

“Pasifika is a celebration of New Zealand’s vibrant Pacific cultures. It is an increasingly popular event that all Aucklanders can look forward to. New Zealand is a Pacific nation and our Pacific people have had a major influence on our nation’s culture, heritage and ethnic make-up,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The festival, one of the largest Pacific festivals in the southern hemisphere, is also an opportunity for people to donate money for those affected by Cyclone Winston, with collectors onsite.

“New Zealanders have already shown overwhelming generosity but more help is needed to help our Pacific neighbours,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The festival and its Wellington counterpart Creekfest, which is also being held this weekend, are a platform for Pacific communities to showcase their culture, food and language.

“It is a big weekend for Pacific people and I encourage anyone in Auckland or Wellington to take part in these celebrations,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
