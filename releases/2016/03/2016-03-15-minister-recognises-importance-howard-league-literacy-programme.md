Corrections Minister Judith Collins today recognised the importance of the Howard League’s Literacy programme in Hawke's Bay Regional Prison.

Speaking at the graduation of three prisoners from the programme, Ms Collins expressed the significance of being able to read and write.

“Nearly 65 per cent of the men and women in prison are below NCEA level one literacy and numeracy. Without basic literacy and numeracy skills, prisoners are limited in their ability to gain qualifications and secure employment.

“Lifting the literacy rates of prisoners not only gives them practical, everyday skills, it also boosts their communication skills and confidence. 

“The Howard League courses complement Corrections’ other education and training programmes,” Ms Collins says.

The Howard League Literacy programme is delivered by volunteers and aims to improve the literacy levels of prisoners.

More than 90 men have completed the programme since it started in Hawke's Bay Regional Prison in March 2012.

The graduation was also attended by Dame Catherine Tizard, Howard League patron, Tony Gibbs, NZ Howard League for Penal Reform president and Mike Williams, the organisation’s CEO.
