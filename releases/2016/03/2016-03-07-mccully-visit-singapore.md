Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Singapore this week to meet Singapore’s Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.

“This will be my first visit to Singapore since the country’s general elections in September last year and it is an opportunity to discuss trade and security issues with the new Government,” Mr McCully says.

“Singapore is one of our top export markets with two way trade reaching $2.8 billion in 2015.

“New Zealand and Singapore share a warm friendship based on trade and economic links, extensive defence ties, and regional cooperation,” Mr McCully says.

While in Singapore Minister McCully will also meet Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister, K Shanmugam, the CEO of Singapore Airlines, and address the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
