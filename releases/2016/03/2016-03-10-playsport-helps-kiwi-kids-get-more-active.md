Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today launched Sport New Zealand’s Play.sport initiative.

Silver Fern, Casey Kopua, and Hurricane and Maori All Black, Otere Black also took part in today’s launch at Pinehaven School, Upper Hutt, Wellington.

“Being overweight or obese is expected to overtake tobacco as the leading preventable risk to health in New Zealand within the next 12 months,” says Dr Coleman.

“Play.sport is one of the 22 initiatives in the Government’s Childhood Obesity Plan which was launched in October 2015. We’re now one of the first OECD countries to have a target and a comprehensive plan on childhood obesity.

“The Government is investing over $8 million over four years in Play.sport. It’s a community based initiative to improve the quality and quantity of physical education and sport in schools and communities. 

“34 schools and local communities in Waitakere, Auckland and Upper Hutt, Wellington will receive hands on support, training and practical assistance to deliver quality sport and physical education opportunities to young people.”

Play.sport is supported by the Ministry of Education and ACC and represents a step-change in the way physical education and sport is delivered in schools.

**Notes:**

Play.sport is a community based programme that aligns with the UNESCO global best practice for quality physical education and activity.

Programme facilitators and mentors will work directly with teachers to further develop their confidence and ability to deliver physical education. They will also help to connect the sport sector more effectively to schools.

Through Play.sport, Sport NZ will:

- Provide professional development support to teachers of physical education;
- Help schools and the wider local community to deliver quality sport and physical activity opportunities;
- Develop guidance for schools on the selection of outside providers of sport;
- Raise the understanding and profile of PE and sport in schools;
- Develop more collaborative partnerships between sport, health and education.
