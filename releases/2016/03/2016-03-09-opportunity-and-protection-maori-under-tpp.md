Trade Minister Todd McClay told participants at the first Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hui in Christchurch today that Māori have much to gain from the agreement.

“There are enormous opportunities for Māori exporters.

“The Māori asset base is now over NZ$40 billion. Māori businesses are big exporters and have significant ownership in key sectors such as forestry, fishing, red meat, and dairy. 

“The tariff savings under TPP on current exports across these sectors are significant, amounting to an estimated $200 million a year once the tariff commitments are fully phased in. 

“New Zealand’s approach in its free trade agreements reflects the constitutional significance of the Treaty of Waitangi to New Zealand.

“Being part of TPP, which covers 36 per cent of global GDP, and takes 40 per cent of our exports, is strongly in New Zealand’s national interest.”

Mr McClay says there is also special protection in regard to the Treaty of Waitangi.

“TPP specifically recognises the Treaty of Waitangi, so nothing will prevent the Crown from meeting its obligations to Māori. 

“Every free trade agreement signed by a New Zealand government since 2001 has included a specific provision preserving the pre-eminence of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand. 

“The Treaty of Waitangi exception is in addition to the fact that the obligations in TPP have been designed so as not to impair the ability of governments to make legitimate public policy, including in health, education, and protecting the environment.”

Registrations for the Hui are open now at [www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/events](http://www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/events). A factsheet covering issues of interest for Māori in TPP is also available on this website.
