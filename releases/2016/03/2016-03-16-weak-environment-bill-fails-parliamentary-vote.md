The failure of Labour’s Environmental Protection Authority Amendment Bill to secure a parliamentary majority at its second reading today is an appropriate end to a weak Bill that would have undermined sound environmental decision making, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“This Bill has rightly been rejected by Parliament because it did nothing to improve our environmental laws. The idea that repeating the words ‘environmental protection’ multiple times in law would somehow fix our environmental problems is naïve. It’s like pretending that we could magically solve our health and employment problems by simply repeating multiple times in the Health Act that ‘people’s health must be protected’ or into the Employment Act that ‘jobs must be protected,’” Dr Smith says.

“Officials advised that this Bill would undermine quality decision-making by the Environment Protection Authority by creating legal confusion. The Resource Management, Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects), and Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Acts each have carefully crafted purpose statements. Creating an alternative purpose would leave the EPA and the courts in a legal quagmire on what to base their decision-making. If Labour really believes the balance in these substantial Acts is incorrect they should amend the purpose statements of these three core environment Acts.

“The fundamental flaw in this Labour Bill is the idea that you can solve New Zealand’s complex environmental problems by simply repeating the words ‘environmental protection’ multiple times in our law. The Bill is shallow sloganeering and exposes how poorly advanced Labour’s thinking is on environmental issues after eight years in Opposition.”
