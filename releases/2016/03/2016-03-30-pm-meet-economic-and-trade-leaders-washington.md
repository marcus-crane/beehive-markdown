Prime Minister John Key will spend the next two days in Washington meeting with key economic and trade leaders.

Mr Key will meet with the Federal Reserve Chair Dr Janet Yellen, US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, and US Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew. He will also address the US Chamber of Commerce.

“These meetings are a good opportunity to seek their perspective on the global and US economies,” says Mr Key.

“The US is a key economic partner for New Zealand so I am looking forward to discussing ways of increasing trade between our two countries, including under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

“The TPP will be New Zealand’s first free trade agreement with the US – the world’s largest economy and our third largest trading partner.

“It not only provides the foundation for a significant growth in trade between New Zealand and the United States, but it will also enhance trade and economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific countries.”

Mr Key is in Washington to attend the fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit on April 1.
