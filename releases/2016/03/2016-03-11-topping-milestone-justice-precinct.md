Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams placed the last bit of cement on the Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct’s rooftop as part of today’s topping off ceremony.

“This marks an important milestone in the Precinct’s development as well as a chance to recognise the significant progress we have made since construction began 15 months ago,” Ms Adams says.

“There’s now just over a year to go until we deliver on our commitment to provide Cantabrians with modern and effective justice and emergency services.

“The project is running to schedule and on budget.”

The topping off marked the end of the construction of the major structural steelwork and roof and the beginning of the next phase, which is completing the enclosing of the buildings and beginning work on the interior.

Ms Adams joined representatives from the eight different justice and emergency services to be housed in the Precinct, as well as members of the project team, to commemorate the topping off ceremony.

Currently, Christchurch court services are available from four different locations. The $300 million Precinct will bring these court services and all justice and emergency services together into one modern building, right at the heart of the city.

“With its 19 court rooms, dedicated Emergency Operations Centre, and its capacity to continue operations during national emergencies such as floods or earthquakes, the building is well equipped to serve Cantabrians into the future,” says Ms Adams.

The largest multi-agency project in New Zealand’s history, and an important part of the Canterbury rebuild, the Precinct is scheduled for completion by early 2017 and to be in use by mid-2017.
