Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced a $10 million package to help Fiji repair public infrastructure following Cyclone Winston.

“The impact of Cyclone Winston was widespread and Fiji now faces the long and expensive task of restoring infrastructure,” Mr McCully says.

“Of the funding announced today, $500,000 will used to supply building materials for projects being undertaken by the New Zealand Defence Force in the Lau Islands.

“HMNZS Canterbury’s original deployment has been extended and it will now remain in the area until mid-April to support these construction tasks.

“The remaining funding will be used to rebuild schools, evacuation centres and medical facilities on Vanua Balavu and elsewhere in Fiji. This builds on the work we are already doing to help Fiji restore electricity infrastructure.

“We will also be working, through our wider aid programme in Fiji, to help stimulate the local economy by providing targeted support to the dairy sector and agricultural exporters,” Mr McCully says.

This latest package brings total New Zealand aid to Fiji following Cyclone Winston to more than $15 million.
