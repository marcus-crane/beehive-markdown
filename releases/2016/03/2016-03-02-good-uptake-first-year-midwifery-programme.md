Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says there’s been a good uptake of an enhanced programme designed to strengthen the clinical expertise of midwifery graduates.

“We want to ensure that all new midwives receive the best clinical support possible to enable them to provide the highest level of care to mothers and their babies,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why the sector came together to develop an enhanced one-on-one mentoring and education programmes for new midwives.”

The enhanced Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme is the result of a collaboration between the Midwifery Council and the New Zealand College of Midwives, with the support of Health Workforce New Zealand.

161 new midwifery graduates enrolled in the programme in 2015. The enhanced programme is compulsory for all new midwifery graduates wishing to practise in New Zealand.

"This programme is giving new graduates the chance to consolidate their knowledge and skills,” says Dr Coleman.

“It provides newly qualified midwives greater confidence and helps to assure families about the quality of care they receive.”

Graduate midwives can also access experienced midwives to attend complex births when their regular mentor is unavailable.

Health Workforce New Zealand has committed $2.77 million to support the programme.

In addition to the First Year of Practice Programme, the Ministry of Health continues to support rural midwives.

The support includes a locum service, professional support through a mentoring programme, and relocation and establishment grants.

In 2015, 2,407 locum days were provided for rural midwives, six midwives were supported into rural practices and 94 midwives were accredited as mentors for rural midwives.

The Ministry also provides funding for postgraduate education. In 2015 funding was provided for 175 midwives to complete postgraduate education and for 18 midwives to participate in the tailored complex care programme.

There were 3,068 midwives with annual practising certificates on the Midwifery Council of New Zealand’s register in 2014, up from 2,823 in 2009.
