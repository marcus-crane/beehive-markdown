Foreign Minister Murray McCully is in the Cook Islands this week for the annual Cook Islands-New Zealand Joint Ministerial Forum.

“My discussions with Prime Minister Puna and members of his Cabinet will cover a range of matters including New Zealand’s development assistance to the Cook Islands as well as a number of regional issues,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand and the Cook Islands have a special relationship based on our constitutional links and our shared history. New Zealand has a substantial aid programme in place with the Cook Islands, which focuses on sustainable economic development, and the education and health sectors.

“The visit will provide an opportunity to visit the redevelopment site of Tereora College, New Zealand’s 50th anniversary gift to the Cook Islands,” Mr McCully says.  

While in the Cook Islands, Minister McCully will also meet with the Leader of the Opposition and the local Chamber of Commerce.
