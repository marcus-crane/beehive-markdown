Minister for Women Hon Louise Upston congratulates Co.OfWomen for inspiring, developing and encouraging the next generation of entrepreneurial women leaders through Women Entrepreneurs Week, March 7-11.

“I’d also like to congratulate new chair Theresa Gattung, who will add her extraordinary skills and experiences to the already impressive pool of talented women running the organisation.”

“Successful entrepreneurs are inspired by other successful entrepreneurs. It’s a huge advantage for women to have great role models and an opportunity to learn from each other, especially for those at the start of their journey,” Minister Upston said.

Women Entrepreneurs Week creates awareness of success and stimulates discussion about what it takes to be successful, with events in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

This year’s signature event, inc!te, features women from both ends of the entrepreneurial journey sharing their stories, and offering advice and wisdom from their extensive experience.

“I’d like to acknowledge all the women taking part in this week and their significant contribution to the New Zealand and global economies.”

Initiatives like Women Entrepreneurs Week help kick-start conversations with leaders in business, in the community and in government to think about what more they could be doing to ensure women’s skills are fully utilised.

“Co.OfWomen has a great track record as champions of female entrepreneurship. I wish them every success for the week ahead.”
