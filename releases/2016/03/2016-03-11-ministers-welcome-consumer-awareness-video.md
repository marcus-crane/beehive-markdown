Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga along with Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith welcome the Commerce Commission’s new series of animations that attempt to bring greater awareness around consumer rights and explain key law changes.

The series, called It’s All Good, stars New Zealand’s sharpest legal advisor Aunty and her good intentioned nephew Herman Faleafa.

“The characters reflect contemporary New Zealand Pasifika, meaning viewers can associate with them and therefore be more likely to take on the messages about consumer rights when getting a loan, being a guarantor or facing repossession”

“It’s critical Pacific peoples know how to protect themselves if they take out a loan and the It’s All Good series is an effective way of sharing that message,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

The Government amended the Credits Contract and Consumer Finance Act in June last year. Changes to the Act help protect consumers when they are borrowing money.

The trailer and primary three episodes have had more than 140,000 views in its first week.

The animated series will be promoted at this weekend’s Pasifika Festival in Auckland.
