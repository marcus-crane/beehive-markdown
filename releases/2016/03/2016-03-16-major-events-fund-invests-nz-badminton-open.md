Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the government is investing $185,000 from the Major Events Development Fund into the 2016 and 2017 SkyCity New Zealand Badminton Open, which will be held in Auckland.

“The New Zealand Badminton Open has experienced strong growth and greater international status in recent years. Government investment will help to boost the profile of the event and also reflects the sport’s popularity in key trade and tourism markets,” Mr Joyce says.

The SkyCity New Zealand Badminton Open is a Badminton World Federation Grand Prix Gold event. Two hundred and fifty top international players from around 26 countries will descend on Auckland’s North Shore Events Centre for six days of fierce competition from 22 to 27 March 2016 and similar dates in 2017.

Fifty-two players or player combinations ranked in the top 50 in the world will be in attendance, including singles, doubles and mixed. Athletes will compete for points to put toward their world ranking ahead of selection for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

“The Badminton Open presents a number of opportunities to showcase New Zealand. For instance Japan’s J Sports channel, which has a reach of more than seven million households, will broadcast the event,” Mr Joyce says.

“We also look forward to welcoming visitors from around the world who will come here for the event, and stay on to experience all our country has to offer.”

Badminton New Zealand has experienced a growing local membership. It is an event that will appeal to Auckland’s culturally diverse population and it is expected there will be a large turnout of local supporters for the many countries attending. 

The Government invests, through the Major Events Development Fund, in major events that generate significant immediate and long-term economic benefits to New Zealand.
