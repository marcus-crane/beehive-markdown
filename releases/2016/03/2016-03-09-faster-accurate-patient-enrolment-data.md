Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new digital enrolment service is being introduced at general practices, benefiting both practices and patients.

“The new National Enrolment Service will provide faster and more accurate information on patient enrolment and identity,” says Dr Coleman.

“Across the country up to 22,000 patients change practices each month, in addition to patients enrolling for the first time.

“The current manual enrolment process is time consuming, and can lead to duplication. Data is submitted to the Ministry of Health quarterly which can mean new enrolled patients are charged higher casual rates in the interim.

“The National Enrolment Service is a significant step forward. It allows practices to update their enrolment data to a national database in real time, resulting in greater efficiency and accuracy.

“The new service will also benefit patients as funding will be processed on a monthly basis from next year, enabling newly enrolled patients earlier access to subsidised care.”

The National Enrolment Service, which is hosted within the Ministry of Health’s secure Connected Health Network, is being made available to all general practices with the assistance of PHOs and vendors from March.

The New Zealand ePrescription Service is being implemented in parallel for over 960 general practices with Medtech software.

“The National Enrolment Service and the ePrescription Service are important parts of the Health IT Programme,” says Dr Coleman.

“Digital health solutions are crucial to making the health system more sustainable and efficient, as well as delivering better health outcomes for New Zealanders. They are also are an important enabler of new models of care and providing care closer to home.”
