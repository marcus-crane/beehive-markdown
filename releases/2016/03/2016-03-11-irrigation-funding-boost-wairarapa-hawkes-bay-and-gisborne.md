Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed three new investments totalling $1.6 million into irrigation projects coming from the Ministry for Primary Industries’ Irrigation Acceleration Fund (IAF).

The three irrigation projects receiving funding are in the Wairarapa ($804,000), Hawke’s Bay ($575,000), and Gisborne ($250,000).

“This funding helps support the development of irrigation proposals to the stage where they are investment ready,” says Mr Guy.

“Providing a reliable water supply for farmers and growers has major potential to boost growth, creating jobs and exports in these regions.

“There is major unrealised potential across the country for further irrigation development, and these three projects will help unlock that.

“Regular droughts over previous few years show how important it is to better store and manage water.

“As a Government we are strong supporters of irrigation and water storage, and have signalled up to $400 million in total towards irrigation over time.

“A recent report by NZIER found that irrigation contributes $2.2 billion to the national economy and this has the potential to increase further.

“Water storage also has real environmental benefits to offer, with more consistent river flows in summer and reduced pressure on ground water sources.”

The three projects receiving the extra funding are:
