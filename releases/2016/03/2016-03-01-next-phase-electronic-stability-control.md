The overall safety of New Zealand’s vehicle fleet will improve from today as Electronic Stability Control (ESC) becomes mandatory for a range of imported used vehicles, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Used class MC vehicles — four-wheel drives, off-road and sports utility vehicles — imported into the country from today will need to have ESC,” Mr Foss says.

“ESC can reduce the risk of crashing due to loss of control by about 30 per cent. The Government is always looking for vehicle technologies, such as ESC, that will help keep drivers, passengers and all other road users safe.”

ESC is a crash prevention system that intervenes if it detects a vehicle is about to skid or lose traction.

From 1 July 2015, ESC became mandatory for all new cars, vans, four-wheel drives and goods vehicles imported into New Zealand.

ESC requirements for other vehicles coming into New Zealand will be phased in as follows:

- Used class MA vehicles (passenger cars) with engine capacity greater than two litres from 1 March 2018
- All other used class MA, MB and NA light passenger and goods vehicles inspected at the border from 1 March 2020.
