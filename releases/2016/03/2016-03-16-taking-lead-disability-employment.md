Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner has launched the ‘LEAD toolkit’ – a toolkit providing resources and advice to help public sector agencies take the lead on employing and retaining disabled people.

“Since I have been Minister for Disability Issues, the most common message I have heard from disabled people is that they want the opportunity to get a job,” Ms Wagner says.

“In many cases, disabled people don’t need anything different to perform their jobs. Evidence shows that disabled employees also have fewer health and safety issues and make a great contribution to their workplace. Employing disabled people is a win-win.

“Despite this, disabled people are far less likely to be employed than their non-disabled peers. Only half of all disabled adults are in the labour force compared to almost three-quarters of their non-disabled peers.

“The public sector is a large employer and is well positioned to take a lead in employing disabled people and people with health conditions. It requires committed leaders, inclusive recruitment processes and effective managers who understand how to get the best out of people.

“The LEAD toolkit provides resources and advice to assist in all three of the above areas and will be available online through the State Services Commission.

“The toolkit is one of several initiatives aimed at supporting more disabled people into work. For example, the *Project 300* employment pilot is harnessing the economic activity of the Canterbury rebuild to get an extra 300 disabled people in the region into work. The project is on track with more than 250 disabled people supported into full-time work and more than 60 into part-time work so far.

“The government is also ensuring public sector internships are inclusive for disabled people, to help them gain valuable work experience, and rewarding success with the ‘Diversity in employment’ public sector award. Disability employment is one of the actions of the Disability Action Plan 2014-2018.

“This toolkit is a great step forward, but it will only be effective if people use it. I encourage public sector leaders to create inclusive workplaces, make the most of the talent available and in doing so add real value and productivity to their workplaces,” Ms Wagner says.
