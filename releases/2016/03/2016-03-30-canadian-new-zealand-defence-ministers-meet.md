Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will host the Canadian Defence Minister, Hon Harjit S. Sajjan, in Wellington tomorrow.

The Ministers will discuss a range of regional and international security issues, including international efforts to counter Da’esh and deployments such as the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai.

“I welcome Minister Sajjan to New Zealand,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This is my second meeting with Minister Sajjan and will provide a timely opportunity to discuss mutual defence and security issues on a bilateral basis.  

“Canada is one of New Zealand’s strongest international partners, and it is important that we stay closely in touch on key issues that impact us both.”

Minister Sajjan will be formally welcomed at Wellington’s Pukeahu National War Memorial Park on Thursday morning.
