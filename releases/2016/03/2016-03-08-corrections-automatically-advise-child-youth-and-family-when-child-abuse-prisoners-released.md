A new process for Corrections to notify Child Youth and Family about released prisoners who may pose a risk to children has begun, Corrections Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“In January it was revealed that Corrections did not have an automatic procedure for advising Child, Youth and Family when a convicted child abuser is released from prison. This has now been rectified.

“Existing information sharing policies meant Corrections already notified CYF about many prisoners with offences against children.  However, in January, some gaps in the process were identified and these have now been closed.

“Corrections advises CYF when prisoners serving current sentences for offending against children are released. CYF is also informed when prisoners with historic offending against children are released, where there is a concern.

“The process change particularly affects short-serving prisoners (that is, those with sentences of less than two years).

“Offenders released on parole with convictions for offending against children were already subject to information sharing where a concern for child safety existed, under an existing agreement between the two agencies,” Ms Collins says.
