Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says over 100,000 Kiwis are now signed up to patient portals.

“Patient portals are secure online sites which give New Zealanders access to their health information at any time of the day,” says Dr Coleman.

“The portal site enables patients to manage aspects of their own healthcare, such as booking appointments, requesting repeat prescriptions and messaging clinical staff directly.

“In addition to giving patients more control over their own healthcare, patient portals reduce the time general practice staff spend on administrative tasks.

“Both the patients and health workforce using the portals describe them as being convenient, user friendly and a real time saver.”

In the last quarter of 2015, the number of registered portal users jumped from 93,000 in September to 107,034 in December.

More general practices are now offering a patient portal service, with 277 practices with a portal service, up from 271 in September 2015.

Last year Dr Coleman approved a $3 million funding boost to give more New Zealanders access to patient portals, including $500,000 for an awareness campaign.
