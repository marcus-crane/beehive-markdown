Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner says the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Board Action Plan, released today, outlines the Board’s priorities for the promotion and maintenance of NZSL.

“NZSL is not only an official language of New Zealand, it is an integral part of Deaf people’s cultural identity,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Action Plan provides tools to enhance the vitality of the language and improve the lives of Deaf people by supporting their ability to communicate and fully participate in society.

“Today’s release of the plan is also an excellent way to mark the upcoming 10th anniversary of New Zealand Sign Language becoming an official language, a milestone which falls on 6 April this year.

“Achieving official language status in 2006 was a watershed moment for the Deaf community. The Action Plan complements the language’s official status with a clear commitment to sustaining and growing NZSL,” Ms Wagner says.

The NZSL Board’s 10 members, appointed in 2015, represent the full diversity of NZSL users, and the Action Plan is the result of extensive consultation with the Deaf community.

The NZSL Board will review the Action Plan annually and will report publicly on progress against its priorities.
