Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the start of an official visit to New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

“The UAE is an important partner for New Zealand in the Gulf region and our 10th largest export destination,” Mr McCully says.

“Our talks will focus on expanding two way trade, regional security issues, and the UAE’s support for renewable energy initiatives in the Pacific.

“During the visit a number of arrangements will be signed, designed to facilitate trade in primary produce between New Zealand and the UAE.

“We recently welcomed the first non-stop flight between Dubai and Auckland, which we hope will lead to increased tourism between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

Sheikh Abdullah will also be meeting with the Prime Minister, the Defence Minister, the Trade Minister, the Transport Minister, and the Attorney General while in New Zealand.
