Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened the Mangati Pathway in New Plymouth, completing another part of the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme.

The 680 metre pathway provides the missing link from rural New Plymouth to the CBD, and links to the Coastal Walkway and the Forgotten World Highway Cycle Trail.

“New Plymouth is now widely regarded as one of New Zealand’s leading cities for getting around on foot or by bike,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Mangati Pathway provides a safer off-road route for more than 250 primary school students to cycle to school, and for Bell Block and rural New Plymouth residents to cycle to the CBD.

“The links to the Coastal Walkway and Forgotten World Highway Cycle Trail will also encourage recreational cycling in the area.”

The Mangati Pathway is an extension of the Let’s Go programme, a collaboration between Government and local council focused on making walking and cycling safer and more attractive options.

“I’d also like to recognise New Plymouth MP Jonathan Young for his work in bringing this project to fruition. He has been a strong advocate in ensuring New Plymouth is a part of the Government’s cycleways programme,” Mr Bridges says.

The Coronation Avenue Cycleway will also get underway in New Plymouth later this year.

“Wider cycling investment in New Plymouth over the next three years will concentrate on encouragement and education, with the aim of maintaining the city’s high rates of active transport in schools, which is currently at 69 per cent in some,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a top priority.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”

Over the next three years 54 projects are scheduled to be completed through the programme. This is the eighth of the projects to be completed, with seven other cycleways already complete in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch.
