Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has today welcomed the launch of a new product recall web tool, a first-stop-shop for consumer product recall information.

Currently product safety recall information is distributed by four different government agencies in New Zealand, dependant on the type of product.

“The new portal streamlines information availability, allowing consumers and businesses to react more swiftly when products are recalled,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“By keeping information up to date on a centralised portal, consumers will be at less risk of harm from unsafe products. The portal also allows businesses to distribute recall information more effectively which can reduce the cost of undertaking a recall.”

“The portal also aligns with the Government’s Better Public Services programme aimed at making it easier for businesses and New Zealanders’ to interact with government online,” Mr Goldsmith says.

The product recall web tool can be accessed here: [www.recalls.govt.nz](http://www.recalls.govt.nz/).
