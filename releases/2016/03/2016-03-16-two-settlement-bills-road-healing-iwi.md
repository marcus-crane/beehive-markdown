Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says the deep wounds inflicted on Taranaki and Te Ātiawa iwi can start to heal today as their Treaty Settlement Claims Bills starts their passage through Parliament.

“The settlements are only small when compared with the sustained attacks on their property and persons, the loss of their land, their leadership, their means of livelihood, their personal freedom, and their civil rights,” he says.

Mr Flavell is praising the principles of passive resistance - forbearance, patience and stout heartedness - embraced by the Taranaki Iwi and Te Ātiawa negotiators involved in the settlements.

“It's taken several generations, a lot of courage and many hard won battles for justice to get to this point.”

Although not a part of settlement redress, Mr Flavell also referred to the work of Kawe Tūtaki, the working group established by Ministers, Taranaki Iwi and Parihaka, in recognition of the serious historical grievances suffered at Parihaka.

Ministers are currently considering ways the Crown can help the Parihaka community, based on the report by Kawe Tūtaki.

Mr Flavell also pays tribute to the kaumātua of the two tribes who initiated these Treaty claims but are not here today to witness this milestone.
