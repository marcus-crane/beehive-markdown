Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett has today opened the Centennial Community Centre, which she hopes will become the heart of Berhampore as well as the refurbished Centennial Flats it is located in.

The Housing New Zealand (HNZ) Centennial Flats have undergone a $7 million upgrade to make them safer, warmer and healthier for the people who live in them. The community centre is the final part of the complex to be completed.

“The Berhampore community was really clear that as a part of this rejuvenation they wanted a focal point for activities to be held and services to be offered,” Mrs Bennett.  

“I am delighted that HNZ, in partnership with Wellington City Council and Berhampore School, have delivered what the residents asked for.

“Having the local community centre in the Centennial Flats complex means that residents of the flats and their neighbours can interact in a new and positive way,” Mrs Bennett says.
