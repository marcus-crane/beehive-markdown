Another link in the Western Bay of Plenty’s cycling network is now complete with further projects about to get underway, Transport Minister Simon Bridges has announced.

The Minister today opened the final $600,000 section of the Papamoa to Paengaroa Trail, a 10 kilometre cycleway that runs from Te Tumu Road and follows the Te Puke Highway into Paengaroa Village.

Work will also soon begin on a $1.8 million bridge that will take pedestrians and cyclists over State Highway 29A Poike Road.

“The new walking and cycling overbridge will connect Ohauiti with Windemere Polytech campus, creating a safe way for people to cross this busy intersection,” Mr Bridges says.

“There are plans to extend this project towards Welcome Bay Road to connect with walking and cycling upgrades that will be built as part of the Maungatapu Underpass project.” 

Mr Bridges says the two projects are part of a central and local government plan to create a cycle network that will better connect the Western Bay.

“Approximately $17 million is set to be injected into cycling and walking projects in the region over the next three years.

“Other projects in the pipeline include the $8.7 million Omokoroa to Tauranga cycleway and a $6.9 million spend to connect cycle links around Tauranga.”

Mr Bridges said making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice was a top priority.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.

“We’re investing to give more New Zealanders more opportunities to choose cycling – whether to commute to and from work and school, to run errands, or get some exercise.”

Over the next three years 54 projects are scheduled to be completed through the Urban Cycleways Programme. Four cycleways are already complete in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch.
