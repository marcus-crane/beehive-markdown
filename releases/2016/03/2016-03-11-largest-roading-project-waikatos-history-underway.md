Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the sod on the $973 million Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway, signalling the start of the largest roading project in the Waikato’s history.

The project is one of the final of seven sections of the 102 kilometre long Waikato Expressway, a Road of National Significance identified by the Government as key to unlocking New Zealand’s economic growth.

Mr Bridges says work on the 21.8 kilometre long Hamilton section would start this month.

“This project will be transformational for both Hamilton city and the Waikato region,” Mr Bridges says.

“It will pass to the south and east of Hamilton and includes 17 new bridges, walking and cycling links and five interchanges, making it easier for freight, business and tourism to travel through the region.”

The Hamilton section will connect to the Ngaruawahia section of the expressway in the north and to the existing Tamahere section in the south.

“Once finished the Waikato Expressway will be a game changer for this country. It will create jobs, boost industry and improve safety for all motorists travelling on this section of State Highway 1.

“It will reduce congestion and unlock economic potential by providing stronger links between the business and agricultural centres of Auckland and the Waikato, as well as the Bay of Plenty.”

The start of the Hamilton section follows the completion of the Cambridge section in December last year.

“That road continues to exceed expectations by improving safety, delivering travel time savings for commuters of up to 23 minutes per journey and removing congestion through Cambridge.

“The Government is committed to seeing the expressway completed as part of our focus on providing lead infrastructure that drives economic and social success for the Waikato region and our country,” Mr Bridges says.

The project is expected to be complete in 2020.
