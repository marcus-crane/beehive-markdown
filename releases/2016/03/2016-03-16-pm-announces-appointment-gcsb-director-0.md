Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Andrew Hampton as the Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Mr Hampton has been appointed for a five year term commencing 26 April 2016.

“Mr Hampton is a respected senior public servant with experience in senior leadership roles across the public service,” says Mr Key. 

“His leadership skills and public service experience will help strengthen the GCSB and ensure it fulfils its important role in protecting our national security and wellbeing within the constraints of the law.  

“His broad experience will also help continue the process of more closely connecting and integrating the security and intelligence agencies with the wider public service.” 

Mr Hampton has previously been Deputy Secretary Courts for the Ministry of Justice, Deputy Chief Executive of Crown Law, Deputy Secretary for Education and Director of the Office of Treaty Settlements. 

He is currently the Government Chief Talent Officer at the State Services Commission, where he is leading major cross-government leadership and employment relations programmes, and is the Head of Profession for Human Resources in the state services.

Andrew Hampton has a BA (Hons) and MA (Dist) from the University of Canterbury and has attended the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme.

Current Acting Director Lisa Fong will continue until Mr Hampton takes up the role.
