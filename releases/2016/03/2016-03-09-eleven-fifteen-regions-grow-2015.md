Eleven of New Zealand’s fifteen regions grew in the year to March 2015 according to Statistics New Zealand, while all fifteen have grown to varying degrees over the last five years, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

Strongest growing regions in the year to last March were Canterbury, Auckland and Wellington, while Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Nelson/Tasman, Marlborough and Otago all grew more than 2 per cent.

“This was partially offset by GDP declines in some of the areas more affected by the dairy downturn, like Waikato, Taranaki, the West Coast and Southland,” Mr Joyce says.

“Overall we have seen a strong economic performance across the country over the last five years with growth averaging 24.2 per cent. The strongest performers over that period are Canterbury, Auckland, Marlborough, Bay Of Plenty, Otago, Waikato and Northland.”

The wealthiest region on a GDP per capita basis continues to be Taranaki, followed by Wellington, Auckland, Canterbury and Marlborough.

“Regional fortunes across New Zealand continue to fluctuate with the fortunes of their major industries” Mr Joyce says

“The Government will continue working through the Business Growth Agenda and the new Regional Growth Programmes to help build on each region’s strengths, attract new investment, and diversify their economies.

“We are committed to working with the business, community and iwi leadership in every region to remove regulatory blockages and encourage new investment.

“For New Zealand to build a more productive and competitive economy, we need all our regions to be able to capitalise on their economic opportunities.”
