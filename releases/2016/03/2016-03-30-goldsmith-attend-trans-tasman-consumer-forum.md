Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith will travel to Australia today to attend the Trans-Tasman Consumer Affairs Forum in Canberra.

“This forum is a key opportunity to discuss a range of consumer protection and fair trading matters,” Mr Goldsmith says. 

“New Zealand and Australia’s consumer and competition laws are closely aligned. The visit is a further opportunity to foster greater Trans-Tasman cooperation, which will benefit many New Zealand businesses currently operating on both sides of the Tasman.”

“As Australia is about to embark on a wide-ranging review of its consumer law, as well as consider changes to its competition laws and regulation of financial advisers, I am interested to see the scope these changes will take and hearing the rationale for reform,” Mr Goldsmith says.

While in Australia, Mr Goldsmith will also meet with Australian government agencies and a number of industry experts to discuss recent developments in Australia’s financial markets.
