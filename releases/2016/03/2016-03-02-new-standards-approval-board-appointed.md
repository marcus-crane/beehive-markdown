Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has announced the appointment of New Zealand’s first Standards Approval Board, an independent statutory board set up under the Standards and Accreditation Act 2015.

The newly appointed Board comprises six members, with Vaughan Renner as Chair, along with Dr Peter Stevens, Faye Sumner, Peter Gilbert, Samantha Sharif and John Boshier. A seventh member is expected to be appointed shortly.

The new Standards Approvals Board is one of the changes resulting from the Act, which came into force yesterday.

“The Act gives New Zealand a good basis for continuing to produce high quality standards, which is something we’ve been doing for over eighty years now and something we intend to keep doing,” Mr Goldsmith says.

Standards themselves will continue to be developed by committees of industry experts and approved by the new independent Standards Approval Board.

“Our standards development committees remain one of the most important factors of New Zealand’s ability to develop and deliver high quality standards,” Mr Goldsmith says.
