Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says nominations are now open for the 2016 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards.

“These awards help to recognise the thousands of unsung heroes who support New Zealand’s health and disability services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Last year’s award recipients ranged from helping people to navigate their way around hospitals and health services, to visiting isolated older people in their homes.

“Health volunteers make life better for New Zealanders in many ways, often without seeking any recognition.

“If you know an individual or team of volunteers who deserve to be recognised, I encourage you to nominate them.”

Last year the overall winner of the Health Volunteer Awards was Cancer Core, a group of Otago University students.

Their inaugural University Relay for Life, the first run by any New Zealand university, attracted more than 1,000 students and raised over $60,000 for the Cancer Society’s Otago and Southland Division.

Nominations close on 8 April. The Awards will be presented during National Volunteer Week, 19 to 25 June.
