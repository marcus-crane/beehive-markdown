The Te Atiawa Claims Settlement Bill, the Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bill and the Rangitāne o Manawatu Claims Settlement Bill passed their first readings today in Parliament during extended sitting hours, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

When enacted, the bills will give effect to the deeds of settlement signed between Te Atiawa and the Crown on 9 August 2014, Taranaki Iwi and the Crown on 5 September 2015, and Rangitāne o Manawatū and the Crown on 14 November 2015.

The three settlements all include an agreed historical account, Crown acknowledgements and apology as well as cultural, financial and commercial redress in recognition of the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“The unanimous support for the bills shows how important the House of Representatives regards these settlements as being for iwi, the Crown and all New Zealanders.

“While the Crown can never fully compensate for the wrongs of the past, these settlements will enable Te Atiawa, Taranaki Iwi and  Rangitāne o Manawatū  to focus on developing a strong cultural and economic future for their people,” Mr Finlayson said.

The bills have been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.
