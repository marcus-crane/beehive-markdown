Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says a more comprehensive approach is being put in place to meet the growing demand for land for schools.

“With an additional 107,000 school students expected in Auckland alone by 2040, the Ministry of Education is ensuring it has greater flexibility to obtain land for schools,” says Ms Kaye.

“The Ministry looks to expand an existing school or establish a new one when there’s a growing school age population, but in a lot of urban areas there are real pressures on land availability.

“Following a review of how it acquires land for schools, the Ministry is now looking even further ahead with its planning and identifying earlier where it may need land.

“In some areas, where land is scarce, it makes sense for the Ministry to be looking ahead 20 to 30 years into the future.

“It’s also important that the Ministry has its place at the table when local authorities and infrastructure providers carry out planning for high-growth areas.

“Regional long-term plans, for instance, haven’t always included planning for schools. The Ministry will seek to work more closely with local councils and other agencies to share forecast and planning data, so they get an earlier picture of where new schools and other infrastructure might be needed.

“In addition to extending the planning horizon for land purchases, the Ministry has identified other improvements to current practice. These include the need to consider Communities of Learning and Year 1–13 campuses when assessing future network needs and site purchasing.

“The new policy will enable greater flexibility in the acquisition of land for changing education provision.

“The government is committed to being ahead of growth in Auckland and elsewhere, and this is another demonstration of this. In the last three budgets we have committed funding for six new schools in Auckland and we are looking at more new schools over the next 10 years.”

Other areas that are experiencing sustained growth are Hamilton, Bay of Plenty and Queenstown.

**Notes**

**What are Communities of Learning?**

Communities of Learning are groups of schools that come together to share expertise in teaching and learning, and to support each other. They could also help the Ministry with options on how best to use and develop facilities to meet future, changing demands within their Community of Learning.

**What are the benefits of Year 1-13 campuses?**

Year 1-13 campuses offer the benefit of providing a seamless education experience with no formal transitions between schools. With the inclusion of early childhood centres on-site, a Year 1-13 campus can service children from 0 to 18 years of age, and provide other social services to the community.

**What investment has the government made in managing growth?**

There has been investment in roll growth classrooms, new schools have been built, land has been purchased and planning is underway for further new schools.

Nearly $240 million has been invested in roll growth classrooms over the last five calendar years (figures for 2015 are not finalised yet):

2014                       $   50,687,903

2013                       $   42,055,286

2012                       $   42,506,985

2011                       $   38,404,702

2010                       $   65,891,288

**Total**                      $  239,546,164
