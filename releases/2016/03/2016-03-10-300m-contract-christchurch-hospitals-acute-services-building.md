Health Minister Jonathan Coleman attended today’s signing of the construction contract for Christchurch Hospital’s new Acute Services Building.

“The signing of the $300 million Acute Services Building construction contract is a major milestone,” says Dr Coleman.

“At a total cost of $445 million, the Acute Services Building is the single biggest Government project in the Canterbury rebuild.

“When it opens in 2018, the Acute Services Building will have 12 new operating theatres and procedure rooms, an expanded intensive care unit, state-of-the-art radiology, acute medical assessment, expanded emergency department, and a rooftop helipad.

“Its new theatres will allow Canterbury DHB to perform an additional 6,000 surgeries a year, and inpatient ward blocks over six floors will provide 413 beds. Combined with the extra beds at Burwood Hospital, over 100 new beds are expected to be provided.

“The Acute Services Building is in addition to the $215 million redevelopment of Burwood Hospital and the new $72 million Outpatients facility. Close to $1 billion is being invested into redeveloping Canterbury’s health facilities.

“Canterbury’s health workforce has demonstrated incredible resilience and determination in recent year. This massive redevelopment programme has involved significant additional hours of staff time on top of their busy day jobs.” 

CPB, formerly Leighton Contractors, was selected to build the new Acute Services Building following a tender process which evaluated applicants on quality of previous work, skill and experience of staff, and cost effectiveness.

Canterbury DHB has a $1.36 billion budget, up $254 million in seven years. The Government has also provided the DHB with $86 million of additional support, including a one-off $16 million funding boost for 2015/16.

**Notes to Editor:**

The enabling works and foundations for the Acute Services Building have already been completed under a separate contract.

The redevelopment project is overseen by a Hospital Partnership Redevelopment Group. The group is responsible for providing governance and overseeing construction of the project.
