An international mountain biking event backed by the Government is underway and expected to inject millions into the Rotorua economy.

Crankworx, visited by Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett today, is the world’s biggest mountain biking festival and last year added $3.68 million to Rotorua’s economy.

Rotorua was able to attract the Crankworx festival after a $225,000 Tourism Growth Partnership grant helped Skyline Rotorua to upgrade its facilities.

“The downhill mountain bike park needed to be upgraded to international standards to attract major events like Crankworx. I’m thrilled to see for myself how it’s boosting Rotorua’s economy,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Last year over 8,200 people attended Crankworx and similar numbers are expected this year.

“Tourism in Rotorua is growing as a result of the unique experience offered there by Skyline and other providers. Rotorua is building on its already proud reputation as a ‘must visit’ destination.

“This Government is committed to backing great regional centres like Rotorua develop more unique offerings and further grow local economies.”

International visitor expenditure in Rotorua was $295 million for the year ended March 2015, 26 per cent more than the previous year. International visitor nights were up almost 12 per cent in 2015.
