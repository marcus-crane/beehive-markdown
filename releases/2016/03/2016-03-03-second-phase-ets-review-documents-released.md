Two technical documents are being released to help New Zealanders engage with the second phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) review, Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Forestry technical note seeks feedback on the way the ETS and forestry sector interacts and how it will contribute to New Zealand meeting its future. international targets

The second report covers administrative issues including compliance requirements, exemptions under the Climate Change Response Act 2002, and the public’s access to information.

“If New Zealand is going to take the next steps to tackle climate change, we’re going to have to see more investment in tree planting and big emitters making a greater contribution to our efforts,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The ETS is a key tool to drive these changes, and this second phase of the review will ensure it is fit for purpose to help New Zealand achieve its ambitious 2030 target.”
