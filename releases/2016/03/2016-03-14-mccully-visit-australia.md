Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Australia this week to meet with his Australian counterpart, Julie Bishop. 

“These twice-yearly Foreign Ministers’ Consultations are an opportunity to exchange views across a range of foreign policy issues,” Mr McCully says. 

“As well as taking stock of the Trans-Tasman relationship, we will discuss developments in the Pacific, including the post Cyclone Winston recovery effort, and how New Zealand and Australia best assist Fiji. 

“We will look at our shared interests in Asia and the Middle East, and I plan to provide Minister Bishop with an update on developments in the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

While in Australia, Minister McCully will also meet with other Australian Ministers, the Opposition Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, and deliver an address to the Lowy Institute.
