An unprecedented number of New Zealand’s smallest kiwi species will be on the move next week, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Thirty little spotted kiwi will be flown to new homes in the largest-ever translocation effort attempted by the Department of Conservation to increase the genetic diversity of the birds’ population.

“DOC has worked with iwi from five different rohe \[areas], the Kiwis for Kiwi Trust, Cape Sanctuary and Air New Zealand to make this translocation possible,” Ms Barry says.

“Kiwis for Kiwi have made a $25,000 contribution towards the cost, while Air New Zealand has generously allowed DOC to use its flights to transport the kiwi to their new homes.”

10 female birds will be flown from Kapiti Island to Red Mercury Island in Coromandel, while 10 females from Red Mercury and 10 males from Kapiti will be transferred to Cape Sanctuary in Hawke’s Bay, where they will supplement a new population.

“All the 1700 little spotted kiwi alive today trace their descent to just five birds taken to Kapiti Island from Ngai Tahu’s rohe in Jackson Bay, South Westland, more than 100 years ago,” Ms Barry says.

“The population on Red Mercury Island went through a further bottleneck, as it descends from just 12 birds first released there in 1983.”

Lack of genetic diversity causes issues such as low breeding success rates.

Introducing Kapiti birds to Red Mercury will strengthen genetic stock and ensure the population remains viable for long-term growth, while mixing the Red Mercury and Kapiti bloodlines at Cape Sanctuary will give the new colony a robust genetic base.

All the birds being moved will be caught at night by hand, or during the day with assistance from trained kiwi detection dogs.

“They will then be transferred in specially-built boxes by helicopter from Kapiti to the mainland, flown by Air New Zealand from Paraparaumu to Auckland and helicoptered to and from Red Mercury Island. The Red Mercury birds will be flown by Air NZ from Auckland to Napier,” Ms Barry says.

“In Budget 2015 we committed $11.2 million to save the kiwi from extinction in the wild. This translocation is a superb example of DOC working in partnership with iwi, community groups and business to save our national bird and ensure it survives for our grandchildren to experience.”
