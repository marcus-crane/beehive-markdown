Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says Lead Maternity Carers (LMCs) will receive a backdated pay increase of $2.1 million.

“This fee increase for LMCs is an acknowledgement of the important role they play in maternity care," says Dr Coleman.

"We know that midwifery continuity of care contributes to improved outcomes for women and their babies. Postnatal care is also vital for all new mothers and babies.

“There are close to 60,000 new births annually in New Zealand. It’s important that these mums and babies receive the best possible care.”

The pay increase comes in the form of a two per cent fee increase paid to LMCs for maternity services. This fee increase, which is from 1 March 2016, will be backdated to July 2015.

For LMCs this fee is their only source of income to meet all costs associated with service provision, including travel costs.

LMCs are predominately community midwives, but some specialists and GPs can also claim the increase.

“The Government recognises the importance of delivering high quality maternity care,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why we invested an extra $103 million over four years in Budget 2012 to improve maternity services.”

This programme is supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year, taking the health budget to a record $15.9 billion.

In 2014, there were 3,068 midwives with annual practising certificates on the Midwifery Council of New Zealand’s register, up from 2,823 in 2009.
