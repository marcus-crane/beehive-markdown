The Government is providing $80,000 towards a project looking at the values of stock water reticulation in hill country farms, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced.

“The study is in partnership with Beef + Lamb New Zealand and will look at the economic and environmental benefits of reticulating stock water supply in hill country farm systems. This will be based on case studies of farmers who have recently installed stock water systems,” says Mr Guy.  

The funding was announced at the official opening of New Zealand Agri Investment Week in Palmerston North tonight.

“This flows on from the *Manawatu Whanganui Regional Growth Study* launched last year. This is now the number one region in the country for sheep and beef in New Zealand so improving the productivity of farms, particularly hill country farms, is a priority.

“The opportunity to fully utilise pasture on many hill country farms is often limited because of lack of access to good stock water.

“This was highlighted in the 2008 drought, when dams and some smaller creeks and streams dried up and farmers were restricted as to where they could graze stock.”

11 farms will be included in the study – four from the Manawatu- Whanganui, two from Northland, one in the Bay of Plenty, two in the east Coast, one in Marlborough and one in Canterbury

“We know that the top 20% of red meat farmers achieve returns approximately four times more than those of the average red meat farmer, irrespective of land class and location. This shows the potential on offer, and the importance of sharing innovative ideas and good practice.”
