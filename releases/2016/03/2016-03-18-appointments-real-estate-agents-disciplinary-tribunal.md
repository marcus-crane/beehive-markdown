Former High Court Judge Pamela Andrews has been appointed chairperson of the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal, Associate Justice Minister Simon Bridges has announced.

Catherine Sandelin, an Auckland based lawyer, has been reappointed as a member of the Tribunal. Both appointments are for three years.

Ms Andrews’ appointment follows the recent resignation of former District Court Judge Paul Barber for health reasons.

“I am delighted that Justice Andrews has taken up this appointment. Her extensive experience on the Bench equips her well for this challenging role,” Mr Bridges says.

Ms Andrews retired as a High Court Judge in September 2015 following nine years on the Bench in Auckland. Prior to her appointment to the Bench she had been a member of the Refugee Status Appeals Authority.

Ms Andrews’ term on the Tribunal will commence in May.

“I would also like to express my gratitude to Judge Paul Barber for the excellent work he has done, not only in the past five years as chairperson but for the 34 years of service to the public of New Zealand as a District Court Judge and chairperson of various tribunals,” Mr Bridges says.

The Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal was established under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008 and hears charges, applications and appeals relating to the conduct of real estate agents.
