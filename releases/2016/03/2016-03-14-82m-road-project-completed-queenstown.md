The completion of the $8.2 million Glenda Drive Intersection project in Queenstown means there are now safer, more effective local road connections to State Highway 6, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Officially opened today, the joint project by Government, Queenstown Lakes District Council and commercial developers features new roundabouts at Glenda Drive and on the new arterial road.

The existing two-lane highway between the new Grant Road roundabout to the start of the planned Eastern Access Road has been increased from two to four lanes.

“Safety on this road is now significantly improved with a new roundabout eliminating what was a high-crash risk intersection at Glenda Drive and improved road markings providing greater separation of opposing traffic flows.

“Increased road capacity will work to manage rising traffic growth in this area, much of which stems from commercial developments on Queenstown’s Frankton Flats which is expected to continue for some time,” Mr Bridges says.

The new roundabout will connect with the Council’s planned Eastern Access Road which is expected to begin construction by the end of the third quarter this year.

“This project also caters for cyclists, with people able to bike through the new highway roundabout, safely separated from vehicles. There is also the option of an off-road shared path for both cyclists and pedestrians.”

Bus stops will also be provided on both the highway and local road components of this project in anticipation of a future expansion of bus services to this area to service further commercial developments.

“This is an important project for Queenstown that will make a strong contribution to the economic growth and prosperity of the wider Wakatipu Basin.

“This project, in combination with the new Kawarau Falls Bridge and other planned projects on the Frankton Flats, means Queenstown is increasingly well positioned for future growth,” Mr Bridges says.
