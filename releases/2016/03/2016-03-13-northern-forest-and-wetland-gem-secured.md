Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner has today announced a Nature Heritage Fund (NHF) purchase of an important area of native forest, wetland and river flats near Dargaville, Northland. The $655,000 NHF grant is supported by a contribution of $55,000 from the Northland Fish and Game Council.

The 342 hectare site, 5 km east of Dargaville, is alongside the Manganui and Wairoa Rivers. Three hundred hectares is remnant kauri, podocarp, hardwood forest and wetland, with the balance being drained river flats containing remnant areas of kahikatea.

“The Department of Conservation and the Northland Fish and Game Council have worked together with the Nature Heritage Fund to secure permanent protection of this land for its outstanding scenic and ecological qualities,” Ms Wagner says.

“A survey completed 18 months ago confirmed the outstanding conservation features and habitat values of the area.

“The remnant forest and wetland area will be classified as scenic reserve for ongoing management by DOC, while the river flats will be classified a local purpose (wildlife management) reserve and vested in the Northland Fish and Game Council.

“By working hand-in-hand with local organisations, like Northland Fish & Game, we can achieve better conservation outcomes for communities,” Ms Wagner says.

Northland Fish and Game Council Regional Manager Rudi Hoetjes says the 40-hectare river flat area will be re-established as wetland habitat.

“As soon as I saw this area, I was struck by its environmental importance and conservation value. Fish & Game is pleased to have the support of the Minister and DOC in our plans to protect and return it to its former glory for future generations,” Mr Hoetjes says.

Once restoration is complete, waterfowl game bird hunting will be allowed. The area will also provide top quality habitat for native species such as mudfish, bittern, herons and pied stilts. Ponding of adjacent river margins will also eventually provide important habitat for spawning whitebait and threatened eel populations.

Since 1990 the Nature Heritage Fund has protected over 340,000 hectares of indigenous ecosystem through legal and physical protection (for example direct purchase, covenanting or fencing).
