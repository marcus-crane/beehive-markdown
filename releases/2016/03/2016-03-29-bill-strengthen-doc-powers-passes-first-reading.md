Conservation Minister Maggie Barry has welcomed the first reading of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill in Parliament this evening.

A modernisation and upgrade of existing legislation, the bill will give Department of Conservation rangers new powers to intervene and prevent offences against native wildlife such as poaching, hunting protected species and smuggling.

“Under the Wildlife Act 1953, DOC is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of these crimes,” Ms Barry says.

“This amendment bill is a small but important change to our legislation which will make it easier for DOC staff to do their job protecting our native wildlife. It brings the Wildlife Act more into line with the existing provisions of the Conservation Act and ensures it is fit for purpose in today’s environment.”

It will give full-time rangers four new powers:

- The ability to take action to prevent an offence about to occur or in progress.
- Temporarily stop persons suspected of an offence to allow investigation.
- Seize a broader range of evidence such as laptops, cameras and mobile phones.
- Require proof of identification details from suspected offenders.

Under the reform, DOC’s small specialist team of enforcement officers will also be given the power to arrest in cases of serious offending against protected wildlife or obstruction of investigation into such offences.

“The enforcement team are highly-trained specialists, often ex-police officers, who lead DOC’s work targeting poachers and other wildlife crimes,” Ms Barry says.

The amendments also modernise the language of the Act, removing anachronistic references such as a requirement for DOC rangers to only ask adult male members of the public for help if needed.

“I am pleased that the bill attracted broad support across the House and will now go forward to the Local Government & Environment Select Committee for consideration.”
