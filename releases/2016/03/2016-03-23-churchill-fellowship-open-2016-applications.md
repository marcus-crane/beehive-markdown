Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is welcoming the opening of applications for Churchill Fellowships for 2016. 

“I would encourage those who would like to test ideas with their counterparts overseas or observe new and emerging practices to get in and apply

“Churchill Fellowships enable recipients to travel overseas and connect with people in other places, share ideas and gain insights that lead to innovation and enhancement in New Zealand.

“They are an exciting way to learn more about topics that will benefit New Zealand communities as well as the individual,” Mrs Goodhew says. 

Several Fellowship opportunities are available this year including two additional types of Fellowship: the Winston Churchill Hawke’s Bay Design Trust Fellowship, and for the first time, the Winston Churchill New Zealand China Friendship Society Fellowship.

“The Fellowships are aimed at those interested and with expertise in industrial design, and/or product design, or in building understanding of New Zealand-China relations.

“The traditional Churchill Fellowships are open to all New Zealanders at all stages of their career, in all professions, industries, occupations and trades,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Recent Churchill Fellowships have supported the investigation of topics such as the examination of Māori musical instruments held in museum collections overseas, and how overseas food system initiatives that are creating opportunities to improve the environment, could be applied in New Zealand.

Applications must be submitted by 31 July 2016.
