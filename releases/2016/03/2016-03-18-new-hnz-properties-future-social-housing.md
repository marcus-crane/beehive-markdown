Modern and healthy new Housing New Zealand homes in Tāmaki are a stark contrast to the old and cold state houses of the past, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett.

Opened by Mrs Bennett today, the 21 new homes at Sunnymead Road in Glen Innes, Auckland have been built on large sections that formerly had only six properties.

“These new homes are a fantastic example of what modern social housing looks like in New Zealand, so I’m thrilled to be here to open them today,” Mrs Bennett says.

One old home remains on a section next to the new homes, showing the stark differences between them.

“The government is committed to improving the quality of social housing for vulnerable New Zealanders. This means creating safe and healthy homes that suit tenants’ needs,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We know when social housing tenants have appropriate well-maintained housing, it’s easier for them to get and retain a job or training, keep their kids healthy and be more likely to get back on their own feet and lead more independent lives.”

The partnership between Housing New Zealand and the Tāmaki Regeneration Company for the Fenchurch and Overlea regeneration neighbourhoods will ultimately see the redevelopment of 144 existing properties into about 550 new homes.    

“Housing New Zealand has had a long association with this area and it is well served by local MP Simon O’Connor. Our government recognises housing needs have changed. With this partnership we are making the most of the resources we have in Auckland’s tight housing landscape.”
