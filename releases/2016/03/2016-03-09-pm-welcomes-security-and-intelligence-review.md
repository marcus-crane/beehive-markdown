Prime Minister and Minister of National Security and Intelligence John Key today welcomed the report of the Independent Review of Intelligence and Security.

“The report contains an extensive range of recommendations which aim to improve the clarity and consistency of the legislative framework governing the security and intelligence agencies,” says Mr Key.

“The central recommendation is that there should be a single, comprehensive Act covering both the agencies and their oversight regime.

“The Government must now carefully consider its response to these recommendations and it will do so with the intention of reaching as broad a political consensus as possible,” says Mr Key.
