Education Minister Hekia Parata today congratulated the Wellington region on becoming one of the first three in the country to achieve the Government’s Early Childhood Education (ECE) participation target.

Speaking at an early learning provider hui in Porirua, Ms Parata said the Wellington region had already achieved the 98 per cent participation target the Government set for the end of this year.

“Research shows that participation in quality ECE not only equips kids to do better educationally but is also linked to better health, social and employment outcomes. Wellington parents and ECE providers are to be congratulated for ensuring kids in the region are getting the best possible start.

“However, there is still more work to be done,” says Ms Parata. “Māori and Pasifika participation rates for the region are sitting at 96.3 per cent and 96.0 per cent respectively.

“We want to get these rates up to or beyond 98 per cent as well. All children deserve the opportunity for the best possible start to their education.”

Nationally the proportion of children starting school who have previously participated in ECE has increased from 93.6 per cent to 96.4 per cent since 2008.

The other regions which have already achieved the 98 per cent participation rate are Canterbury (98.3 per cent) and Otago/Southland (98.1 per cent).
