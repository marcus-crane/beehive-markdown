Wellington barrister and solicitor James Johnston has been appointed an Acting District Court Judge with a jury warrant to be based in Wellington, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

Mr Johnston is Chairman of Partners at Rainey Collins Lawyers. He joined the firm in 1989 and has been a partner since 1994. Prior to becoming a commercial lawyer, Mr Johnston was a litigator dealing mainly with Treaty of Waitangi claims. He has also appeared in the District Court and High Court on a variety of criminal and Family Court matters. He is of Ngati Porou descent.

Mr Johnston will be involved in the Rangatahi Courts. These courts are a judicial initiative which operate within the existing Youth Court framework but use a marae-based environment to help young Māori and their whānau engage with the justice system.

Judge Johnston will be sworn in on 10 June 2016 in Wellington.
