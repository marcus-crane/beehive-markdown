Associate Minister for Primary Industries, Hon Jo Goodhew, is welcoming the International Day of Forests 2016 as a chance to highlight the vital role that New Zealand’s forests play in both protecting the environment and contributing to economic growth and prosperity.

“Our forests contribute to a number of important environmental and climate outcomes, by absorbing carbon, increasing biodiversity, and reducing erosion,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The government is supporting these outcomes through initiatives such as the Afforestation Grant Scheme, which aims to plant an additional 15,000 hectares of new forests, and the East Coast Erosion scheme, supporting planting on marginal land.

“The government is also working to complete the National Environmental Standard for Plantation Forestry. This initiative will streamline processes and increase efficiencies by providing forest growers with a consistent set of planning rules. It will also align with the goals outlined in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Forests make a significant contribution to regional communities and the economy; with exports earning us around $5 billion every year, while employing roughly 20,000 people.

“With increasing global demand for timber and timber products, and forests around the globe under threat from a number of environmental factors, New Zealand is uniquely positioned to offer a sustainably managed plantation resource that can be transformed into a range of high value products.

“Forestry is already New Zealand’s third largest primary industry export earner, and is set to increase returns further in coming years. The government is working with the sector as it refines its priorities for increasing the value of forestry exports, through more processing in New Zealand,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The International Day of Forests is celebrated around the world to raise awareness of the importance of forests and trees in ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems, providing valuable goods and services, and supporting livelihoods.
