Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, is proud to have opened a new papakāinga that will provide affordable housing options for whānau of Te Aro Pā in Wellington today.

A total of 14 homes have been built at the complex in Evans Bay, with 10 three-bedroom apartments and four single bedroom kaumātua/disability properties.

“I’m pleased to see the opening of Wellington’s first urban papakāinga which is an investment towards the health and wellbeing of Te Aro Pā descendants,” says Mr Flavell.

The project also provides a further six units to be built at the site.

“The papakāinga showcases the success of whānau and their wider community coming together and combining expertise and resources to build homes to shelter whānau,” he says.

The development has become a reality for Te Aro Pā Trust thanks to support from the Māori Housing Network, Wellington City Council, Homestead Homes and Dwell Housing.

“This Wellington papakāinga development is a great example of the excellent mahi being undertaken by whānau across the motu to create better housing solutions for themselves.”
