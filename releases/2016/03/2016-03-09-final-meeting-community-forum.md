Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Gerry Brownlee says the Community Forum has met for the last time, signalling the end of an era for the group that has significantly influenced the recovery of greater Christchurch.

The Forum was established in 2011 under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act to provide information and advice to the Minister and Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery. In June that year, the Minister invited local community groups across Christchurch to nominate members to represent them at the Forum.

Since then the Forum has met more than 80 times, keeping earthquake recovery leaders informed of experiences and views at the community level. It has positively influenced the outcomes of a number of initiatives, and regularly provided advice to the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery.

“The Community Forum has played a key role in making recovery agencies accountable and ensuring the needs and desires of the community are kept central to the vision of a revitalised Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says. 

“I’ve really valued the advice the Forum has given me, and the discussions we’ve had.

“Membership to the Forum has been voluntary, and attendance has taken up a considerable amount of time.

“Balancing the need for confidentially with public engagement has been one of the challenges, but all members have done a superb job and have represented the community to a high standard,” Mr Brownlee says.
