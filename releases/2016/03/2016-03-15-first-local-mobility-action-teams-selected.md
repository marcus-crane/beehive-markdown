Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the first of seven Local Mobility Action Teams will be up and running in the next few months.

Dr Coleman today met with providers of the first tranche of the Local Mobility Action Teams at a workshop in Wellington.

“The Government invested $6 million in Budget 2015 to create community based multi-disciplinary early intervention teams for the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions like arthritis,” says Dr Coleman.

“It was good to hear from the teams today why they want to get involved in this initiative, and how they can make a real difference to patients.”

Seven Local Mobility Action Team projects have been selected by the Ministry of Health from nearly 50 proposals.

Once final contracting has been successfully completed, the first seven teams will be based in Northland, Counties Manukau, Tauranga, Hutt Valley/ MidCentral, Canterbury and South Canterbury.

“There are many people with arthritis where early intervention in a community setting is appropriate,” says Dr Coleman.

“These Mobility Action Teams will provide a range of services in the community such as physiotherapy, exercise programmes, dietary advice, and self-management support.

“The strength of this approach is that it draws professionals together from across the sector, including DHBs, physiotherapy practices and public/private collaborations.

“This is also about delivering to local communities to meet their specific needs, so we expect to see a variety of solutions across the country.”

The Ministry of Health is considering proposals for the next tranche of teams.
