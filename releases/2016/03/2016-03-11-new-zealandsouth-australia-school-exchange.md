A new exchange programme will give New Zealand principals the chance to lead schools in South Australia, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today at this year’s first National Cross-Sector Forum in Wellington.

The South Australia/New Zealand Principal Exchange, established by the Ministry of Education and the South Australian Department for Education and Child Development, will see one primary principal and one secondary principal exchange schools in term three with principals of schools in South Australia that have similar student rolls to their own.

“This is an exciting opportunity for accomplished leaders in state and state-integrated schools to gain practical experience from a different jurisdiction,” says Ms Parata.

“New Zealand principals are some of the best in the world and it’s important that we continue to foster their professional development. This exchange will enable principals to build leadership capability and strengthen 21st century practice.

“The schools involved will also learn and benefit from the exchange.”

Applications are open from now until 18 April 2016. Further information about the selection process can be found [here](http://www.education.govt.nz/school/working-in-a-school/).
