The threat of losing the right to drive has seen an extra $43.5 million in unpaid fines collected in the last two years, Justice Minister Amy Adams has announced.

A Driver Licence Stop Order (DLSO) can be imposed on anyone who fails to pay traffic-related fines imposed by a Court, Police or local government authority – or reparations imposed by a Court for traffic-related offences.

“This initiative has been highly successful in getting those who were deliberately avoiding or refusing to pay their fines, to contact District Courts to resolve their fines,” Ms Adams says.

“Over the two years to 30 January 2016, some 30,000 warning letters have been sent out, resulting in almost 26,000 people who would have been eligible for suspension paying their fines or making payments towards them through a payment plan.

“While the aim is to collect fines rather than take away people’s drivers licences, some 400 licences have been suspended over the last two years and about 100 of those are still in place.”

Ms Adams says the DLSO initiative has resulted in an extra $43.5 million in unpaid fines being paid. 

“Stop Orders are an effective tool this Government has introduced to enforce fines and reparation. In addition, fines can be reported to credit agencies, defaulters can be arrested if trying to travel overseas, and the District Courts have full enforcement powers to ensure people pay their fines.

“It is encouraging that the total fines balance now owing is $585 million, down from over $800 million in 2009,” Ms Adams says.

**About Driver Licence Stop Orders (DLSOs):**

The Courts and Criminal Matters Bill, passed by Parliament in July 2011, gave the Ministry of Justice wider powers to collect fines – including the ability to issue Driver Licence Stop Orders (DLSOs).

DLSOs are initiated with a warning letter giving people 14 days’ notice to either pay up or set up a payment plan. Those notified will get one more reminder, and if they ignore that, a bailiff will be sent to serve the suspension, and take their driver licence. Licences will remain suspended until the fine is paid in full, or payment arrangements are in place. 

People who have their licence suspended due to unpaid fines or reparation will not be able to apply for a limited licence. And if a person flouts the law by driving while suspended, they risk being charged with that offence, and having the vehicle they were driving impounded for 28 days.
