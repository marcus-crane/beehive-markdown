The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has been asked by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith to investigate and prepare a report on the collapse of a balcony at a Castle Street townhouse complex on Friday night at a Six60 gig in which 18 Otago University students were injured.

“We need to establish whether the balcony that collapsed was up to the standards required by law under the Building Code. Structural failure of buildings are rare in New Zealand but every incident of this sort needs to be thoroughly investigated to establish whether there were failings and whether our building systems are working as they should,” Dr Smith says.

“The investigation needs to look into whether the design, construction and maintenance of the balcony was up to the required standard, and to establish why it collapsed. It is possible that the balcony did meet standards but that the loading from the large number of students on it was in excess of what the Building Code requires. I am open to all possibilities but want to ensure we do everything possible to avoid these sorts of building accidents.”

The Ministry will be working with the Dunedin City Council in its investigations and the Minister expects to receive a preliminary report on the balcony collapse by the end of March.
