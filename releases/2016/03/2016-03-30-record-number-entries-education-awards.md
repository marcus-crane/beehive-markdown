Education Minister Hekia Parata says she is delighted by the record number of entries for the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“It’s fantastic that so much of the excellent work being done every day has been put forward, so it can be recognised, celebrated and showcased,” says Ms Parata.

Entries have more than doubled this year to over 200 and have come from 91 early childhood services and schools.

“These awards are part of a wider programme to raise the status of the teaching profession and lift outcomes for children and young people, and we’ve seen amazing examples of this over the past two years,” says Ms Parata.

“I’m expecting to see more examples of stunning teaching and leadership this year.”

The entries will initially be reviewed by a panel of education experts which will select up to four finalists in each of the four categories as well as the special focus prize which this year is devoted to student health and wellbeing.

The final decisions will be made by a 10-person judging panel whose members include former All Black coach Sir Graham Henry and well-known businessman John Bongard. To assist in their deliberations, representatives from the judging panel will visit each of the finalists.

A ceremony to announce the winners will be held in Auckland on 13 June.
