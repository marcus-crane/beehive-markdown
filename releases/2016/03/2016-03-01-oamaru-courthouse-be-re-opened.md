Courts Minister Amy Adams has today welcomed an agreement with Waitaki District Council that will see the restoration and re-opening of the historic courthouse in Oamaru.

“Having seen and heard firsthand the concern that many members of the Oamaru community have for this building, I tasked officials to work constructively alongside Waitaki Council to find a lasting solution for the Oamaru Courthouse,” says Ms Adams.

“I am pleased to announce that they have reached a solution that will see the historic courthouse re-opened and put back into use.”

Ownership of the court will be transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Waitaki District Council, who will seismically strengthen the building and carry out other minor refurbishments. The Ministry of Justice will then lease it from the Council.

“Once seismic strengthening is complete, court services will be transferred to the courthouse and the temporary court in the Licensing Trust’s carpark will be removed,” says Ms Adams.

As part of the agreement, the Council will also be able to use the building outside court sitting hours for council-related activities.

“This sharing arrangement will be done in a way that satisfies the confidentiality and security requirements of the court,” says Ms Adams. 

“The agreement will make effective use of the building’s facilities and ensure the people of Oamaru get maximum value out of the building.”

Waitaki District Council will be able to use the historic building when court is not in operation for activities, such as community meetings, civil defence and emergency situations, and other community purposes.

The Council has decided to strengthen the courthouse to at least 67 per cent of the New Building Standard - the minimum is 34 per cent.

“I would like to acknowledge local Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean’s advocacy in safeguarding this important, historical building for the future,” says Ms Adams.

**Background:**

The Oamaru Courthouse was closed in December 2011 after being found to not meet minimum strength and safety standards in case of an earthquake. All parties involved are now working through the final details of the agreement. The strengthening work is expected to take 9-12 months and it is anticipated the court will be ready for use by the end of 2016.
