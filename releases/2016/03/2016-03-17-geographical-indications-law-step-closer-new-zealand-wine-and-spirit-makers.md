A proposed new law that will enable wine and spirit makers to register the geographical origins of their products is a step closer says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

The Geographical Indications (Wines and Spirits) Amendment Bill was debated for the first time today and will now go through the select committee process, including public submissions.

The Bill amends the Geographical Indications (Wines and Spirits) Registration Act which was passed in 2006 but never brought into force.

“Giving New Zealand wine and spirit makers the ability to register regional names as geographical indications for their product will help protect their reputation and build value.

“Geographical indications will give consumers confidence in a product’s authenticity, assuring them of its value for money,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“The Bill also makes it easier for wine and spirit makers to take action if someone falsely claims a product comes from a certain region.

“It is important we guard the reputation of New Zealand wines and spirits. Being able to register geographical indications makes it easier for New Zealand exporters to promote and protect their product in competitive overseas markets,” says Mr Goldsmith.
