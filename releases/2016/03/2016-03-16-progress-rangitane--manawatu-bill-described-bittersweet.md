Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has described the Rangitāne o Manawatū Claims Settlement Bill as bittersweet, as it begins its passage through Parliament today.

“The people of Rangitāne o Manawatū were subjected to legislative prejudice which made their land more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This was enacted in the hope that Māori would abandon their tribal and communal structures of traditional land holdings.”

By the end of 1880, Rangitāne o Manawatū held about 20,000 acres of land.  Much of this whenua was further partitioned by the Native Land Court into blocks which were subsequently purchased by non-Māori private interests.

Five decades later, Rangitāne o Manawatū landholdings had reduced to 2903 acres. This remaining land was eventually eroded by further sales and as an iwi, Rangitāne o Manawatū became virtually landless. 

“The direct loss of whenua had a semi-permanent flow-on effect to members of Rangitāne o Manawatu - to the loss of the traditional tribal structures, their customary traditions, language and their tribal mana. This has hindered their participation in social, cultural, environmental and economic life in Aotearoa.

Mr Flavell describes the losses as a huge tragedy. 

“This is why today is bittersweet. It is a day that on reflection has shown a past that is tinged with inordinate injustice dating back 175 years.”

“But, it is a step toward the future for Rangitāne o Manawatū, and towards reclaiming its traditional tribal structures, and customary traditions.”
