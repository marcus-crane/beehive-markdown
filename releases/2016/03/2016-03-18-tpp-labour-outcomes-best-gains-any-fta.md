The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement outcomes for labour matters are the most comprehensive New Zealand has ever achieved in a free trade agreement (FTA).

The agreement will strengthen labour standards and conditions of work, and address issues such as child and forced labour.

Trade Minister Todd McClay addressed almost 300 people at today’s Wellington TPP road show and says all 12 TPP countries are bound by the declarations that protect rights around;

- Collective bargaining
- Freedom of association
- Abolition of child labour
- Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

“Under TPP, all countries must also adopt and maintain laws governing acceptable work conditions, minimum wages, and occupational safety and health,” says Mr McClay.

“They must also discourage the import of goods produced by forced or compulsory labour and encourage corporate social responsibility on labour issues.”

The TPP chapter on labour also establishes a Labour Council.

“This will be made up of several senior government representatives. The council will consider matters relating to TPP and review decisions made by TPP parties. It is also required to review the chapter on labour five years after the agreement enters into force.

“This is an important chapter in TPP. It reinforces New Zealand labour laws and protects Kiwi workers. “However, at the same time it promotes trade and the benefits this will bring to all New Zealanders, including new jobs,” says Mr McClay.
