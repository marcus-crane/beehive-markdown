The $934 million operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) surplus for the seven months to 31 January reflects an ongoing focus on careful financial management, but also highlights the volatility in the monthly accounts, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The surplus is $724 million higher than forecast in the 2015 Half Year Update and $857 million higher than at the same time last year.

Mr English says the result was driven by fluctuations in tax revenue, which was $446 million higher than forecast, and lower than expected core Crown expenses.

“Having the books back around surplus demonstrates the benefits of the prudent financial approach this Government is taking.

“But it’s important to remember monthly results fluctuate greatly - core Crown expenses are $403 million lower than expected in part because Treaty settlements forecast in December are now likely to be finalised later in the year.

“We don’t read too much into any particular month’s result. We will continue to focus on keeping a tight rein on spending and paying down debt - we’re working hard to reduce net Government debt to around 20 per cent of GDP in 2020,” he says.
