Prime Minister John Key has expressed his condolences to the family of Martin Crowe, following the passing of one of New Zealand’s greatest sportsmen.

“Martin was a truly great sportsman - one of our finest-ever batsmen and sharpest cricketing minds,” Mr Key says.

“He was a world-class athlete whose exploits on the pitch endeared him to cricket fans around the world, whose leadership helped propel our Black Caps to the 1992 Cricket World Cup semi-final and whose tutelage has helped the next generation to excel.”

Mr Crowe’s achievements saw him recognised in a number of significant ways, being named New Zealand Sportsman of the Year and awarded an MBE in 1991 as well as inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame last year.

He still holds the New Zealand record for most test centuries, 17, and his test average remains one of our highest.

“No one will forget his magnificent 299 against Sri Lanka in 1991, or his contribution to the game of cricket after his retirement in 1996,” Mr Key says.

“My thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.”
