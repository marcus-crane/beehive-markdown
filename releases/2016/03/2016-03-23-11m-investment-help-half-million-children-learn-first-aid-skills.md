Teaching Kiwi kids how to prevent injuries and ensuring they have the skills and confidence to take action in an emergency are the goals of the St John in Schools programme, officially launched today by ACC Minister Nikki Kaye at Clendon Park School in South Auckland.

“ACC has invested $1.15 million to support this programme and help it reach almost 500,000 children over five years,” says Ms Kaye.

The programme provides learning experiences for pre-school through to intermediate school aged children.

“ACC began supporting the programme last year, and so far around 77,000 children have participated.

“ACC’s support has enabled St John in Schools to more than double, to 14, the number of community educators teaching fundamental skills and first aid basics in schools to young people.

“This is about showing our children how to identify hazardous situations, and empowering them to respond appropriately if they’re at the scene when someone gets injured. It’s also about growing the emergency preparedness and resilience of the next generation.”

Around 349,000 injury claims involving children under 14 are received by ACC every year.

“Giving our kids the confidence to call 111 and provide first aid could be the difference that saves a life or reduces the impact of the injury. The programme will also help ensure children have increased safety and injury prevention awareness, to reduce the number of preventable injuries in our community.

“This initiative is another example of the extra emphasis ACC is putting on working in partnership with others to prevent injuries and make our communities safer. By teaming up with St John, it ensures the safety message gets to a wider audience.”

In 2016, the programme will also be aligned to the New Zealand School curriculum and Te Whariki, New Zealand’s early childhood curriculum framework.

“We want our children to be adventurous and healthy, but we also want them to stay safe.

“This programme will help kids see that they can play an important part in keeping themselves and others out of trouble, and also do their bit to assist if accidents do happen.”
