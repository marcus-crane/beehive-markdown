Former All Blacks coach Sir Graham Henry and prominent businessman John Bongard will be among the judges for this year’s Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“These awards celebrate the best of what is happening in education and I am delighted that Sir Graham, Mr Bongard and the other judges have agreed to give up their time to judge this year’s awards.

“As a World Cup winning coach, former headmaster and former physical education teacher, Sir Graham is ideally placed to assess the quality of teamwork and adjudicate on this year’s special prize which focuses on the health and wellbeing of students.

“Mr Bongard, a former chief executive of Fisher and Paykel, also has a strong association with sport as chairman of Netball New Zealand and I am delighted he will add his business skill to the education and professional expertise of the other judges.

“Education is a partnership between students, parents, teachers and the wider community and this year’s panel exemplifies that partnership.”

There are four categories and a focus prize in this year’s awards and a supreme award winner will be chosen from the four category finalists. The finalists will be chosen by a separate panel of education experts and then, as part of the judging process, be visited by members of the judging panel.

Category winners will receive $20,000 and a professional development opportunity. The supreme award winner will receive an additional $30,000 and an opportunity to represent New Zealand education.

Entries close on March 18 and the awards will be presented at an awards dinner in Auckland on June 13.
