The Support for Volunteering Fund is now open, and Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is encouraging volunteer groups to get in and apply.

“The Fund seeks to support, promote and strengthen volunteering in the community, and last year made more than $500,000 available for Volunteering New Zealand, volunteer centres and organisations that have a volunteering project,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Volunteers are the lifeblood of our communities, so it is critical that we support people to make the most of the skills they have, and also enable them to build their capability,” says Mrs Goodhew.

In 2015, in addition to Volunteering New Zealand and regional volunteer organisations receiving funding, eleven organisations received grants for volunteering projects that strengthened their communities.  Previous support from the Fund has led to:

- training and support for three marae-based volunteer Māori budget advisors in Hawera;
- the launch of a Friendship Project in Auckland, where volunteers visit isolated older people  of Indian and South Asian origin at their homes;
- the launch of an Information Hub in Wellington, which delivers regular workshops for voluntary leaders of refugee communities to build their capacity and offers them professional development;
- retaining a Eco Community Facilitator in Greenhithe, who directs the placement of volunteers from multiple ethnicities into neighbourhood environmental improvement projects and programmes;
- the building of capacity and capability amongst Māori volunteers in the Dannevirke district, focussing on supporting local marae roles such as treasurers, secretaries, chairpersons and fundraisers.

Applications can now be made online via [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) or by calling 0800 824 824, and must be submitted by 20 April 2016.
