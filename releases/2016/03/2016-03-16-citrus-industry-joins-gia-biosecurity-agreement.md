The citrus industry has become the eight industry partner to join the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) biosecurity partnership, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.  

“It’s very pleasing to have New Zealand Citrus Growers Incorporated (NZCGI) on-board, working with the Ministry for Primary Industries and other industry  partners,” says Mr Guy.

“This means we can work together on managing and responding to the most important biosecurity risks.”

The fresh citrus sector produces fruit worth approximately $60 million annually, of which around $6 million is exported.

Prior to signing the GIA Deed NZCGI has been actively involved in the interim Fruit Fly Council to develop an Operational Agreement for fruit fly.  NZCGI representatives have also taken part in technical and partnership workgroups during the development of GIA and associated policy.

NZCGI joins Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand, New Zealand Pork, New Zealand Equine Health Association, Onions New Zealand, the Forestry Owners Association, The New Zealand Avocado Growers’ Association and the Ministry for Primary Industries under GIA.
