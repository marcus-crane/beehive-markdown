Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says a new co-production agreement with Israel will have significant benefits for New Zealand’s screen sector.

Ms Barry and Israeli Ambassador Yosef Livne signed the agreement at a ceremony in Wellington last night.

The agreement covers film, television, animation and digital productions. It provides official New Zealand-Israel co-productions with access to distribution rights and screen finance in both countries, including the New Zealand Screen Production Grant.

“The New Zealand Film Commission has developed a close working relationship with its counterpart agency in Israel, and both Israeli and New Zealand films are known for their dry sense of humour,” Ms Barry says.

“This agreement will bring revenue to both our countries and foster stronger relationships between our screen sectors, as we share our creative expertise and technical resources.

“I’m sure it will spur producers and directors to work together and break new cinematic ground.”

Ambassador Livne says the agreement will “see the opening of a new door, through which the world-renowned talent and successful film industry of New Zealand and the effervescent film industry in Israel will begin a joint march.”

New Zealand has previously signed 16 co-production agreements, with Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom.
