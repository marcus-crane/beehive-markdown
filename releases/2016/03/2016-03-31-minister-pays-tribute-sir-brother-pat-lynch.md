Education Minister Hekia Parata has paid tribute to Sir Brother Patrick Lynch KNZM for his service to education as he steps down from his role as CEO of the Association of Proprietors’ of Integrated Schools (APIS) after 22 years.

Sir Brother Patrick is also stepping down from his role as CEO of the New Zealand Catholic Education Office (NZCEO) having announced his retirement in January 2015.

Ms Parata says he has made an immense contribution to education in New Zealand and internationally throughout his long and distinguished career.

“Sir Brother Patrick has been a strong voice for the integrated schools community for over two decades.

“His work on behalf of state-integrated schools saw him involved in policy changes that have strengthened the quality of education for so many of our students in New Zealand,” says Ms Parata.

He has held various roles in education, first as a teacher then as Principal of De La Salle College. He became President of the Secondary Principals’ Association of New Zealand in 1992 and CEO of NZCEO and APIS in 1994.

“I thank Sir Brother Patrick for his many years of dedicated service, which was formally recognised last year when he was made a Knight Companion of the Order of Merit. I wish him all the best for the future.”
