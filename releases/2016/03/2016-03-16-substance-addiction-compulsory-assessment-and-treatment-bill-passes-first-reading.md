Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne welcomed Parliament’s universal support at the First Reading of the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Bill as it represents a significant step in reform of the law around severe addictions.

The Bill, which replaces the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act of 1966, provides for the compulsory treatment of people with severe substance addiction who cannot engage in treatment of their own accord.

"This Bill provides support for the management of a small group of New Zealanders who, because of the severity of their addiction and their lack of capacity to engage in treatment, are at significant risk.

"Unlike the existing legislation, the new Bill focuses on only a short period of compulsory treatment, and aims to move individuals into voluntary treatment.  It also provides better protections for the rights of patients.

"This reflects our improved understanding around compulsory residential treatment of  addictions. Over the last century, we have moved from incarceration and isolation, to recognising that people do better when they receive treatment close to their homes and families.  The existing  Act has been infrequently used and poorly understood. It does not protect the rights of people subject to committal, and can also cause significant distress for families and whanau.

"The new Bill will support people with severe addictions to engage in voluntary treatment once their period of compulsion is over, and also includes the requirement for a continuing care plan in the community. It represents long overdue reform", Mr Dunne said

The Bill, which is based on extensive work undertaken by the Law Commission in 2010,  will now be considered by the Health Committee before being reported back for a second reading.

It is the last outstanding item from the Prime Minister’s Tackling Methamphetamine action plan.
