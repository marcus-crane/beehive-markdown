Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says that more services will soon be required to adopt child protection policies.

Under the Vulnerable Children Act 2014, state-funded organisations that deal directly with children are already required to have child protection policies.

From 18 April, organisations that deliver family violence, addiction, mental health, disability and victims of crimes services to adults living in households with children, and which receive government funding, will also be required to have policies in place.

“These services often have significant contact with vulnerable children and their families,” says Mrs Tolley.  

“A good child protection policy helps them to know what to look for and what to do about it if child abuse or neglect is suspected.

“Adding services that support vulnerable parents widens the net for identifying and protecting vulnerable children. The government’s Children’s Action Plan is committed to having a safe and competent workforce supported by high quality child protection policies.

“Children have a fundamental right to be safe from abuse and neglect so they can thrive.”

The five additional service types which will be required to have child protection policies in place are:

- adult alcohol, drug and gambling addiction services
- adult disability services
- adult mental health services
- family violence services, and
- services to support adult victims of crime

Government departments and district health boards will ensure these service types have child protection policies as part of their contractual or funding arrangements with the providers.
