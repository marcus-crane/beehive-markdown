Today’s launch of the Forest Industry Safety Council (FISC) Charter is an important milestone for improved health and safety outcomes and operational excellence in the forestry industry, says Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse.

The Charter publicly commits the industry to a mission of ‘*Together Towards Zero*’ as the driver for achieving safe outcomes for all forestry industry workers.

“This is a demonstration of a connected, collaborative approach to drive effective health and safety initiatives in the forestry industry, which will help contribute to the Government’s goal of at least a 25 per cent reduction in workplace fatalities and injuries by 2020,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“It highlights the practical principle that those who operate the businesses are best placed to reduce or manage risk in our workplaces.

“However, health and safety is everyone’s responsibility and the forestry industry has demonstrated that with commitment from the entire supply chain, it is possible to significantly improve health and safety outcomes.

“2013 was the industry’s annus horribilis with 10 deaths. Now it is an industry taking responsibility and control for ensuring their workers return home safely at the end of each day.”

The Charter was launched this morning and was signed by both the Government and WorkSafe New Zealand, as supporters of its principles.
