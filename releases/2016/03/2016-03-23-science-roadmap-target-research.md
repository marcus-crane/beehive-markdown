A new “roadmap” for scientific research will look for answers to important questions about how we care for New Zealand’s natural world, Environment Minister Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry say.

Development of the Conservation and Environment Science Roadmap will set out 20-year targets for conservation and environmental research.

“A unified approach to the science will help us make research more efficient, targeted at tangible goals,” Dr Smith says.

The Ministry for the Environment and Department of Conservation science teams are working together on the proposal, with a draft document for public consultation due in mid-year.

“Our officials will be talking to stakeholders and the science community about what they think the big science questions will be, and where research efforts should be focused over the next two decades,” Ms Barry says.

An independent Strategic Advisory Group led by the Prime Minister’s chief science advisor, Sir Peter Gluckman, and including representatives from conservation groups, Crown Research Institutes and academia will assist with the draft.

It will set out where there are gaps in our knowledge, unanswered questions and gains to be made, not only for the environment but also for responsible development of the economy.

“Everything is on the table for consideration – including how we care for our land, freshwater and marine environments and protect New Zealand’s biodiversity,” Dr Smith says.

“We would like the public to get involved in this process and look forward to reading the final roadmap once it is completed.”

“New Zealand leads the world in many areas of environmental science, not least in conservation,” Ms Barry says. “Through the roadmap we can take a fresh look at some of the big issues which confront us, look for innovative solutions and make a significant difference to the country.”
