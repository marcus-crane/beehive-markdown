Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has announced an appointment to the New Zealand Standards Approval Board, an independent statutory body which approves standards developed by committees of industry experts.

Building company owner Richard Merrifield has been appointed as the seventh member of the Board.

“I am pleased to announce Mr Merrifield’s appointment to the Board,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Mr Merrifield has extensive practical experience in the building and construction industry, an important user and developer of standards.”

The Standards Approval Board was set up under the Standards and Accreditation Act 2015 and plays a key role in delivering high quality standards for New Zealanders.
