Volunteer work to support trampers, hunters, climbers and everyone who enjoys New Zealand’s great outdoors has received a significant grant from the DOC Community Fund, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

“The Outdoor Recreation Consortium will receive $347,000 this year to assist with its work to improve, upgrade and maintain huts and tracks.”

Formed in 2014, the Consortium is a collaboration between the Federated Mountain Clubs of New Zealand, the NZ Deerstalker’s Association and Trail Fund NZ.

Supported primarily through the DOC Community Fund, it encourages more volunteers to get involved with looking after backcountry huts, tracks and trails across the country.

The latest grant will mean it can deliver 64 different projects involving more than 16,000 hours of volunteer work.

“Since 2014 the Consortium has funded more than 120 different projects, doing up 60 huts with new paint jobs, fireplaces, roofs and other improvements,” Ms Barry says.

“It has also helped maintain or improve 500 kilometres of track with new boardwalks, repairs and weeding.

“By supporting the Consortium DOC is helping it to achieve its goal of ‘200 huts and 200 tracks’ announced in 2014.”

Federated Mountain Clubs President Peter Wilson welcomed the funding on behalf of the Consortium.

“We’d like to pass on our thanks for this funding. It means the excellent work of volunteers in our backcountry can continue and we can maintain our tracks and huts. The DOC Community Fund has changed the face of recreation in the backcountry.”

The funding is the first national grant from this year’s round of the Community Fund to be announced.

In total, the DOCCF will distribute more than $4 million in 2016-17 to organisations ranging from small community groups to national partnerships like the Outdoor Recreation Consortium.
