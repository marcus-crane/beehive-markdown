It’s now easier for young girls and women to pursue career opportunities in science, technology engineering and maths, Womens’ Minister Louise Upston says.

The ‘STEM Directory’ is a new online tool launched by the Ministry for Women and identifies initiatives, programmes and associations through which young girls and women can connect, discover and learn about science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).

“A huge focus of this Government has been helping New Zealanders prepare and adapt to an economy that is an increasingly becoming more reliant on STEM-related skills,” Ms Upston says.

“Women are particularly under-represented in the highest growth areas such as digital technology and engineering, so I have made it a priority to find new ways of sparking their interest.”

In New Zealand, women make up about 23 percent of people employed in IT and about 13 percent of people employed as engineers.

“This tool is a small but significant way we can work to turn this around, ensuring women aren’t left behind in a constantly changing workforce and young girls can more easily find clear ways in STEM fields,” Ms Upston says.

“I want to encourage all young girls and women, schools, businesses - and men who want to encourage the important women in their life – to make use of this tool and become the next leader in these fields that are so crucial to New Zealand’s future.”
