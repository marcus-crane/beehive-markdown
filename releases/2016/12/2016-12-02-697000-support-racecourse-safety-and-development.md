Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced new funding of $697,193 from the latest round of the Racing Safety Development Fund today, along with reappointing Penny Mudford as Chair of the group.

The grants are made available from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety across two funding rounds. Funding is matched dollar-for-dollar with contributions from racing clubs.

This year’s first funding round has supported a wide range of infrastructure projects including replacement running rails, an equine ambulance, a replacement stable block, and a greyhound starting box canopy.

“The fund plays an important role in improving the safety of the racing industry for animals, staff and the wider public. In many areas these facilities are widely used by the community throughout the year.”

Mr Guy also announced the reappointment of Penny Mudford as Chair of the Racing Safety Development Fund industry working group.

“Penny has extensive governance experience in the public and private sectors as well as strong mediation skills.”

Since its inception in 2007/08, the Racing Safety Development Fund has provided around $9 million to projects which improve safety and upgrade facilities in the racing industry. 

There are around 140 active racing clubs and nearly 70 racecourses around the country.

The next funding round for the Racing Safety Development Fund opens for applications on 15 February 2017 and closes on 31 March 2017.
