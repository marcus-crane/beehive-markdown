A $1 million upgrade of Whangarei Airport is now complete, allowing the airport to host more passengers and accommodate larger aircraft, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Inside the terminal, upgrades include additional seating space for passengers, new bathrooms, and a larger internal baggage claim area.

Outside, there are more taxi ranks and footpaths, and the pathways have been upgraded to ensure pedestrians and motorists stay safe. There is also a second airport entry and a car park extension.

On the tarmac, aircraft taxiways have been resurfaced in order to better accommodate the larger aircraft now operating at the airport.

“New Zealand has one of the best domestic air networks in the world, and a quick look around the country shows several regional airports are investing in new and improved facilities,” Mr Bridges says.

“Investing on the regions is a core Government priority and this project is just one of a number of important projects underway in Whangarei this year as part of our Tai Tokerau Northland Economic Action Plan.

“These upgrades mean Whangarei Airport can accommodate more passengers and larger aircraft which ultimately has a positive flow on effect for the local economy.”

The upgrades were completed as part of a partnership between the Crown and local Government, with the Crown contributing half of the cost.
