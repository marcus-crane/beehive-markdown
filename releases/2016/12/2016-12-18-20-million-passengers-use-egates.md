Customs Minister Nicky Wagner announced today that over 20 million people have used Customs’ eGates since their introduction in 2009.

“Each week approximately 105,000 passengers self-process when crossing our border and this number is expected to continue to grow with the increasing volume of visitors to New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.

“Visitor arrivals to New Zealand are expected to grow 5.4 per cent a year, reaching 4.5 million visitors in 2022 from 3.1 million in 2015.

“To meet forecast growth in traveller volumes Customs received 2015 Budget funding of $6.6 million to modernise and expand its eGates from 22 to 51 gates nation-wide.

“This expansion is well underway with the final phase to be completed in Auckland arrivals in 2017.

“The next generation eGates provide a faster, simpler, one-step process for travellers taking around 25 seconds, and provide improved security using enhanced facial biometric matching that has a greater degree of accuracy.

“Offering an automated self-service option to low risk travellers at the border enables Customs officers to focus on high risk areas – providing high assurance with a light touch,” Ms Wagner says.
