Know your consumer rights this holiday season reminds Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has launched the *Twelve Consumer Tips for Christmas* campaign today.

“As we make our shopping lists, and check them twice, the campaign is a timely reminder of how to shop smart this festive season.

“MBIE’s Consumer Protection and Trading Standards teams have a sleigh full of tips to ensure you have a safe and hassle-free holiday period,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The main message of the campaign is know your rights when buying gift vouchers, returning unwanted gifts, or faulty products. Safe gift giving and Christmas decorating will feature, as will tips to avoid issues that come with other summer activities such as DIY and pool safety.

“Avoid unwrapping a consumer danger these holidays and check [www.consumerprotection.govt.nz](http://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/) for more information,” says Mr Goldsmith.
