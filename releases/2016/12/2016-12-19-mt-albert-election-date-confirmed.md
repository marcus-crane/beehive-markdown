The Mt Albert by-election will be held on Saturday 25 February, Prime Minister Bill English has confirmed.

“Following the resignation of MP David Shearer, which takes effect from 31 December, a by-election now needs to take place to fill the Mt Albert seat,” Mr English says.

“Today I’m announcing that the National Party will not be standing a candidate.

“The National Government is focussed on winning the 2017 General Election later in the year.

“To achieve that goal, we don’t intend to participate in a by-election in the new year that is in a safe Labour seat.”

The by-election Writ Day will be 25 January. The deadline for candidate nominations to be received will be midday 1 February, and the last day for the return of the Writ will be 16 March.
