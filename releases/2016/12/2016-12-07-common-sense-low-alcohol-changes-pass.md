Supermarkets will be able to sell low and non-alcohol beer alongside regular beer under changes passed by Parliament.

The Sale and Supply of Alcohol (Display of Low-alcohol Beverages and Other Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill makes three minor technical changes to alcohol legislation.

The Bill permits supermarkets and grocery stores to display low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer and wine in the same area of the store as regular alcohol. It also clarifies that a company can hold an alcohol licence.

“Under the 2013 law changes, supermarkets and grocery stores were not allowed to place low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages in the same area as regular strength alcohol. With our changes, these products can be placed where most people would expect them to be,” says Ms Adams.

“This is a win-win for consumers and supermarkets. It’s a common-sense solution that provides clarity for the stores, for responsible drinkers, and for the general public.”

The changes will come into force shortly and will strengthen the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.
