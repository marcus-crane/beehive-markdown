An extra $20.7 million will be invested in the redevelopment of Macleans College in Bucklands Beach, Auckland, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This additional funding will increase the Government’s total investment in the college’s makeover to more than $38 million,” says Ms Parata.

As part of redevelopment work that began in 2010, twelve blocks comprising 55 teaching spaces and a gymnasium have been remediated.

“The investment I’ve announced today will fund new technical, technology, science and general teaching blocks, as well as upgrading of the auditorium and administration area,” says Ms Parata.

“This additional investment is needed because property issues that have affected the school, such as lack of weathertightness, have proved broader in scope than originally identified.

“I’d like to acknowledge the Board of Trustees for working closely with the Ministry of Education to address issues and develop plans for the school’s future.

“Macleans College is an important school in the local education network, and this significant investment will ensure it provides modern facilities that inspire students to succeed to the best of their abilities.”

Macleans College is currently in discussions about their potential involvement in a local Community of Learning (CoL). CoLs are about increasing student achievement by schools working together to share expertise and lift the quality of teaching and learning.
