Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today opened public consultation on a new national renewable energy strategy.

The draft replacement of the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy proposes actions that will help New Zealand make the most of its clean, renewable energy sources.

“Energy efficiency and increased use of our renewables are critical for our environment and our economy,” Mr Bridges says.

“This strategy will aim to steer businesses, individuals and the Government towards taking actions that enable our transition towards a smarter, lower-carbon and more productive economy.”

The strategy covers the period 2017-2022. Its actions and targets focus on three priority areas: transport; the heat used in industrial and manufacturing processes; and innovative and efficient use of electricity.

“These areas offer the greatest potential for emissions and efficiency savings, which can improve economic growth, energy security and affordability, and help New Zealand meet its climate change commitments,” Mr Bridges says.

”It also complements Government initiatives already underway such as the Electric Vehicles Programme, which will take advantage of New Zealand’s renewable electricity and reduce transport emissions by accelerating the uptake of electric vehicles.”

The strategy was developed in consultation with a range of targeted stakeholder groups with the public consultation process seeking views to inform the development of the final strategy, for release in 2017.
