Transport Minister Simon Bridges has made some appointments to the Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) Board.

Commercial law partner, Kylie van Heerden, has been appointed as a new member.

“Ms van Heerden has experience advising clients on corporate and commercial matters, including company compliance and governance. Her appointment will bring commercial legal skills and an injection of fresh energy to this Board,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Bridges has also reappointed Belinda Vernon who has been a member since May 2013 and chairs its Audit and Risk Committee.

“Ms Vernon’s reappointment will provide continuity, and she brings financial and business skills in addition to her shipping industry experience,” Mr Bridges says.

Maritime New Zealand is a Crown entity established under the Maritime Transport Act 1994 for the safety, security and environmental protection of New Zealand’s coastal and inland waterways.

Its Board has five members appointed by the Minister of Transport.
