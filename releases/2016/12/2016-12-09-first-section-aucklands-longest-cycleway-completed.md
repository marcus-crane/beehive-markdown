Transport Minister Simon Bridges has officially opened the first section of Auckland’s largest cycling and walking route. 

The Glen Innes to Tamaki Drive cycleway is a four-metre-wide, shared path that provides a safe and convenient route between Glen Innes and St Heliers and connects the community to different public transport options.

“Auckland’s network of cycling infrastructure is growing exponentially. Today we’re opening the first link in a 7km series of paths that will connect the city’s eastern suburbs to the city centre,” Mr Bridges says.

“Building this infrastructure now means we’re able to support future growth and development in the area and give Aucklanders more choice about how they get around which helps reduce road congestion.”

The $46 million cycleway was delivered through a partnership between the Government and Auckland Council as part of a $200 million programme of cycle improvements in Auckland over three years.

“Through the Urban Cycleways Programme central and local government are working together to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects throughout the country over the next three years - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history,” Mr Bridges says.
