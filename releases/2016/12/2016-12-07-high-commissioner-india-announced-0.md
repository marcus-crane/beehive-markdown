Foreign Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Joanna Kempkers as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to India. Ms Kempkers will be based in New Delhi and cross-accredited to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.

“As members of the Asia-Pacific region, New Zealand and India have a close relationship,” Mr McCully says.

“India is our second largest source of skilled migrants and international students.

“Two-way goods and services trade exceeds $2 billion, and the Government has high expectations for the further development of India as a key economic and political partner for New Zealand.

Ms Kempkers is currently the Director of Protocol Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has previously served as High Commissioner to the Cook Islands.
