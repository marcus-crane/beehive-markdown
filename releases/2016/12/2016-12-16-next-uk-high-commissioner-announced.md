Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that Lieutenant General Sir Jerry Mateparae will be New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

“The appointment of Sir Jerry Mateparae as our High Commissioner in London underlines the significance New Zealand places on our relationship with the UK,” Mr McCully says.

“Sir Jerry has been Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force and Chief of Army, and until recently he was New Zealand’s Governor-General.

“He will be replacing Sir Lockwood Smith as High Commissioner and I would like to acknowledge Sir Lockwood’s service and the work he has done to further the relationship between New Zealand and the UK.

“New Zealand is currently working with the UK on the shape of our post-Brexit relationship and the new High Commissioner will be responsible for leading this effort,” Mr McCully says.

The High Commission also conducts the government’s business with Ireland. It is New Zealand’s official contact with the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Foundation, as well as a range of international organisations with headquarters in London.
