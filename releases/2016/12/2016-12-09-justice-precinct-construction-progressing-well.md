Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams says the $300 million Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct build is well advanced and on track to be fully operational in mid-2017.

The anchor project brings together all justice and emergency services in one purpose-built precinct in central Christchurch.

“The new Precinct is designed to provide Cantabrians and those who work in our courts with modern and effective justice and emergency services,” says Ms Adams.

“The installation of 19 new courtrooms is well underway. A room that one day might be used by a District Court jury trial could be used by an Environment Court fixture the next day.”

There will be specialist facilities for youth justice sector agencies to work from and interview spaces for young people and their families who need to engage with the Youth Court.

The increase in capacity also means that case-loads can be managed better and resources allocated more efficiently.

“I’m pleased with the progress that has been made so far. The Precinct demonstrates the Government’s commitment to the rebuilding of Christchurch, and making it a liveable city with easy access to key justice and emergency services.”

The building also contains dedicated work spaces for support services such as Aviva (Christchurch Women’s Refuge) and Work and Income, which will help with earlier intervention, better information sharing, and more efficient support for victims and defendants as they enter the court system.

The Precinct is being built by Fletcher Construction Company, and there are about 500 people working on the site.  It encompasses 42,000 square metres over five floors in the area bordered by Colombo, Tuam, Durham and Lichfield streets.

It is expected that Fletcher Construction Company will hand over the Precinct in late March 2017. This will be followed by a substantial and complex fit-out by the eight occupying agencies, who are expected to move in from mid-2017.
