Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne today announced that the $2.7 million profit from the 10 December 2016 Special Lotto draw has been allocated to a Lottery Grants Board Subcommittee set up especially to provide immediate assistance with earthquake recovery activity that is not business and/or employment support.

The Lottery Hurunui Kaikoura Marlborough Earthquake Relief Subcommittee has been established to receive requests for assistance for earthquake recovery community well-being activity in the Hurunui, Kaikoura and Marlborough Territorial Local Authority areas. 

“The Subcommittee’s policy and process has been designed to enable community organisations to submit requests for earthquake recovery support and to minimise compliance costs”, says Mr Dunne.

Requests for assistance to improve the lives and well-being of people living within affected areas and/or capital works up to $30,000 required for well-being and health and safety may be made through the Department of Internal Affairs online grant management system from 9 January 20177.

“The Subcommittee will consider requests until all of the $2.7 million has been distributed and I urge those who in the earthquake affected that can benefit from receiving a grant to apply as soon as they are able. 

“The Subcommittee will be working closely with others, such as the Rata Foundation and regional councils, to ensure a coordinated approach to earthquake recovery assistance”, Mr Dunne said.

More information about the purpose and priorities of the Lottery Hurunui Kaikoura Marlborough Earthquake Relief Fund, and how organisations can apply, is available on the community matters website [www.communitymatters.dia.govt](http://www.communitymatters.dia.govt/).
