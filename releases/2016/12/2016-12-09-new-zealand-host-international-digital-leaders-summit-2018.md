Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne is delighted to announce that New Zealand is the new chair of the D5 group of nations and will host the next international leaders’ summit in New Zealand in early 2018. Mr Dunne has recently returned from the D5 Summit in South Korea.

D5 is a group of five nations – New Zealand, United Kingdom, South Korea, Estonia and Israel – considered amongst the most advanced in the provision of online government services.

“I think it is very fitting that New Zealand will be chairing the D5 and hosting the next summit. We are seen as a leading nation in terms of digital government and have a lot to offer other D5 nations,” says Mr Dunne.

“As a small country we are early adopters of technology and can develop, test and innovate more quickly than most. Our digital journey is progressing well in New Zealand. I am really proud of our partnerships with the private sector to deliver high quality and cost effective solutions in an agile manner.

“We are transforming government services so they are designed and delivered with the citizen in mind, not around how government is structured. This means the public sector will deliver integrated services that are based on what our citizens need.

“Over the next year New Zealand will be leading a digital identity work stream for the D5 nations, which will help build on our success with using RealMe.”

More than 226,000 New Zealanders are now using RealMe identity verification service to order online birth, death and marriage certificates, apply for and renew passports online, enrol to vote, or apply for student allowances and loans.

Mr Dunne says New Zealand’s achievements in digital transformation in government include the world’s first fully [online passport renewal service](https://www.passports.govt.nz/), and the new [SmartStart](https://smartstart.services.govt.nz/) initiative for new parents which is personalised for each customer. 

“Currently 52% of New Zealanders’ most common transactions with government are completed in a digital environment and we are on track to meet the Better Public Services Result 10 target of 70% by December 2017,” says Mr Dunne.

At the conclusion of the D5 Summit in South Korea last month, Mr Dunne signed on behalf of New Zealand the ‘Busan Declaration’, reaffirming the efforts of the D5 countries to strengthen cooperation in the field of digital government among members and with the international community.
