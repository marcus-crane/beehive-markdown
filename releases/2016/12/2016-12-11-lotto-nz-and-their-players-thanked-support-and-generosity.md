Internal Affairs Minister, Peter Dunne, has warmly thanked Lotto players for their generosity in helping to raise over $2.7 million for the special Lotto draw that the Minister initiated with Lotto NZ to raise funds for  Kaikoura/Hurunui and Marlborough regions following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 14 November 2016.

“Christmas is a time of giving, and it was encouraging to see so many New Zealanders support this draw for a truly special cause.

“I want to thank Lotto NZ and the NZ Lottery Grants Board for enabling this to happen and, of course the people from all around New Zealand who expressed so much generosity and community spirit in the face of this adversity”, Mr Dunne said.

“As Minister of Internal Affairs I directed Lotto NZ to hold a special draw under section 245 of the Gambling Act 2003. This special draw fits with the core purpose of Lotto, which is to raise money for the community.

“Everyone appreciates the enormity of the job ahead for those impacted by this 7.8 magnitude quake, and I am very pleased that this contribution will make a real difference to those affected and their communities.”

All profits from last night’s draw will be transferred to the NZ Lottery Grants Board, who will administer the distribution of funding to support earthquake relief in Kaikoura/Hurunui and Marlborough regions.
