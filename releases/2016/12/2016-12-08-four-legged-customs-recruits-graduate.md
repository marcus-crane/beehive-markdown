Customs Minister Nicky Wagner has today congratulated Customs’ five new detector dog teams at a graduation ceremony in Trentham.

“Customs received over $500,000 from Budget 2016 to boost the total number of detector dog teams across the country from 15 to 20, adding to its multi-layered enforcement at the border,” Ms Wagner says.  

“The five new teams are a welcome addition, especially as we head into the peak summer season when more people cross our border.”

“The Labradors, Flo, Que, Casey, Latte, and Percy were selected from Australian Border Force’s dog breeding and training facility in Melbourne last August. They undertook an extensive three-month training programme with their new handlers.

“All of the new teams were certified as fully operational last month and have been working in their new locations at both Auckland and Christchurch International Airports.

“Today’s graduation recognises not only the achievement of the detector dog teams but also the hard work and dedication of Customs’ specialist trainers.

“Detector dog teams play a vital role at New Zealand’s border. They help to stop drugs being smuggled into the country and bringing harm to our communities,” Ms Wagner says.
