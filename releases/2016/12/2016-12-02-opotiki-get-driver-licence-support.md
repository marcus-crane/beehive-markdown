A new community-based driving programme in Eastern Bay of Plenty will help young people take advantage of employment opportunities in the region, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

The NZ Transport Agency is investing $116,000 in the Ōpōtiki Community Driver Mentor Programme to help more teens and young adults gain their restricted licence. 

“This programme will help open up the world for young disadvantaged drivers — providing more freedom, mobility and employment opportunities,” Mr Foss says.

“With a licence, young people in Ōpōtiki will have the best possible chance of benefiting from the Harbour Development Project and other economic development initiatives, which are expected to generate more than 450 new jobs.”

The Community Driver Mentor Programme will be co-ordinated and managed by the Ōpōtiki District Council.

“This initiative is part of the Government’s commitment to supporting driver licensing programmes in Eastern Bay of Plenty, as outlined in the recently-released Building Skilled and Safe Workplaces chapter of the Business Growth Agenda,” Mr Foss says.

The Community Driver Mentor Programme is underway in six other communities across New Zealand, from Whangarei to Christchurch.
