Trade Minister Todd McClay will meet Brunei’s Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade tomorrow.

The Minister, Pehin Lim Jock Seng is visiting New Zealand along with Brunei’s Industry Minister, Pehin Yasmin Umar.

“Brunei is a good friend of New Zealand, working cooperatively with us within ASEAN and beyond,” says Mr McClay.

“Brunei and New Zealand cooperate in trade, defence, and education – and Brunei is also a strong supporter of trade liberalisation.

“Two-way trade is worth NZ$506 million and is dominated by oil. Of our more modest exports, butter accounts for 30 per cent.

“I look forward to talking to the Minister about our bilateral relationship and the agreements we have in common, such as TPP and RCEP.”

Mr McClay will also host the Brunei delegation in his Rotorua electorate at the weekend.
