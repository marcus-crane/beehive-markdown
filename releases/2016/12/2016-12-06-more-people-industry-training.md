Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed news that more people are succeeding in industry training programmes.

The new report *New Zealand’s Workplace-Based Learners,* released today by the Ministry of Education, shows that the industry trainees grew by 11 per cent in 2015. The credit completion rate rose from 69 per cent to 74 per cent, and qualification completion rates are higher than they have ever been, at 53 per cent.

“Industry training helps workers to keep their skills up to date and provides employers with the skilled staff they need to grow their businesses,” says Mr Joyce. “This new report shows that trainees are making progress through their training more quickly than in previous years.  This is a big change from 2009, when 59 per cent of trainees gained no credits at all. It shows that the changes we made to the industry training system between 2010 and 2013 are working.”

“The New Zealand Apprenticeships scheme continues to grow after it was introduced by the Government in 2014. The number of people in apprenticeships grew by 12 per cent between 2013 and 2015, to over 42,000.

“Last month we announced a $10 million investment to increase the number of apprentices to 50,000 by 2020. These trends show we’re well on our way to achieving that. Five year qualification completion rates for apprentices increased significantly in 2015, to 57 per cent, and credit completion rates were steady at 89 per cent.

“The reforms to industry training ensure the system provides New Zealanders with the skills they need for their work, and New Zealand has the skills it needs to grow key industries.”
