Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today welcomed the KiwiSaver findings of the Retirement Commissioner’s three-yearly review of retirement income policies.

“I have received the KiwiSaver recommendations made by the Commissioner and will give them considerable thought.

“A number of the recommendations made by the Commissioner have previously been brought to my attention by the public. Work is already underway to implement recommendation 1.7 requiring KiwiSaver providers to disclose the total dollar cost of all fees on annual statements.

“Other recommendations, such as increasing the range of employee KiwiSaver contribution rates from the three currently available, and allowing those above the age of 65 years to join, will be looked at closely and considered,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The Retirement Commissioner is an independent statutory body and is required to conduct a three-yearly review of retirement income policies in New Zealand.
