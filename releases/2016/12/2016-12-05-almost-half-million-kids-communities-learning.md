Almost half a million kids are now benefitting from their school being part of Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“Another 32 Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako have now been approved, taking the total to 180 across every region of the country,” says Ms Parata.

“This is great news because it means that just two years into the four-year roll-out of this ground-breaking programme, 1503 schools are involved in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako. That’s 60 per cent of all New Zealand schools working together to raise student achievement.

“In addition, we now have 95 early childhood education services involved in Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako, and, for the first time, three tertiary education providers have joined.

“It is tremendous to see Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako growing, not just in numbers but in providing a full pathway for students from early childhood through to senior secondary and tertiary education. This is about every child and young person getting a great education, every day.”

Of the Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako that have already been established, 46 have had their achievement challenges endorsed and more than 50 have appointed principals to the new leadership role. In addition over 460 teachers have been appointed to new teaching roles, but Ms Parata says she is keen to see more.

To help people find Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako in their area and find out more about them, a new online tool has been launched.

“The new *Know Your CoL* tool profiles each Community of Learning | Kāhui Ako and has useful information such as achievement data for the specific Communities,” says Ms Parata.

Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako are funded through the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative which is aimed at lifting student achievement as well as offering new career opportunities for teachers and principals.

The *Know Your CoL* tool is available on the Ministry of Education’s Education Counts [website](https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/home).
