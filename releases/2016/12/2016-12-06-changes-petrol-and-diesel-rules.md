Changes to petrol and diesel specifications will support the growth of lower-emission fuels, Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says.

Amendments are being made to the Engine Fuel Specifications Regulations 2011, which set out minimum standards for fuel performance.

The changes include reducing the sulphur level allowed in petrol from 50 to 10 parts per million; introducing a total oxygen limit, which potentially allows a wider range of fuel blends; and raising the biodiesel blend limit in diesel from five to seven per cent.

“These changes will benefit New Zealand motorists and our environment,” Mr Bridges says.

“Reducing sulphur levels in petrol will result in less wear and tear on engines and improved fuel efficiency, meaning there will be less/fewer harmful vehicle emissions.

“Both the introduction of a total oxygen limit and the increase in biodiesel blend limits allow for fuel mixes that have less harmful emissions; while adjusting other limits also helps cars run more efficiently.” 

Mr Bridges says fuel regulations change incrementally over time to keep up with new technology and international best practice.

“The changes allow greater flexibility, will allow suppliers to offer lower emission fuels and could reduce costs at the pump over the long term.”

Regulations to bring these changes into effect are now being drafted and will take effect from 1 July 2018.
