Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Simon Bridges have helped celebrate the start of construction on a long sought intersection upgrade in Auckland’s Northwest.

A new roundabout in the township of Waimauku will replace the current intersection on State Highway 16 and Muriwai Road, making it a safer environment for all road users including pedestrians and cyclists.

“This is a busy intersection that serves the local community with a primary school, several sports and recreation clubs, a petrol station, shops and bus stops, while also being a main route to Muriwai Beach and popular track for cyclists, “Mr Bridges says.

“For some time locals have lobbied for an upgrade to address concerns such as safety, efficiency and growth in the area and it’s great that we are able to deliver a project that will make a real difference to this community’s transport network.”

The $6 million upgrade will include walking and cycling facilities, improved crossing points and pedestrian refuge islands.  It will also install fences and wider median strips and relocate bus stops to increase safety.

“The design of the roundabout will encourage vehicles to slow down as they approach the intersection and increase visibility to improve safety for the community, particularly children crossing the road from nearby Waimauku School,” Mr Bridges says.

“Other safety and efficiency improvement projects along State Highway 16 are also being investigated with local communities, as part of a wider programme of work responding to the growing population in the north west of Auckland.”

Safety upgrades under consideration include realigning road curves, adding turning lanes, wider centre median strips and shoulders, improving road markings, signage and intersection upgrades.

Construction of the SH16 Muriwai Roundabout will start this summer. The main works will begin early in the New Year after the summer holiday period, to reduce the impact on traffic heading to and from Muriwai Beach.
