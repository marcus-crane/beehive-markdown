The winners of a prestigious tertiary scholarship awarded annually in honour of the 28th (Māori) Battalion have been announced by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“The eight winners of the 2016/17 Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships exemplify excellence in education as well as service and commitment to the community,” says Ms Parata, who chairs the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund Board.

Since 1948, the Board has supported Māori achievers to succeed in education and to contribute as leaders both at home and overseas.

Among the winners are a former teacher who is now aspiring to become a documentary filmmaker specialising in kaupapa Māori and the arts; a Stanford University student of environmental law and policy; and a business student who was chosen as a New Zealand representative at the White House Tribal Leaders Gathering hosted by President Obama.

“The scholarships recognise the exciting futures these eight exceptional winners have. They have already demonstrated what young Māori can achieve with hard work and dedication and I look forward to seeing what more they can achieve,” says Ms Parata.

The three winners of the master’s scholarship will receive $15,000 per year for up to two years. The five undergraduate scholarship winners will receive $10,000 per year for up to five years.

All winners of the 2016/17 Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships will be recognised at an awards ceremony in April 2017.
