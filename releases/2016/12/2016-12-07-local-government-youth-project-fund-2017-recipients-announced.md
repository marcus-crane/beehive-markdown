Sixteen councils up and down New Zealand will share $231,400 of funding under the Local Government Youth Project Fund 2017, Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

“This fund supports city, district and regional councils to deliver projects that provide young people with leadership, mentoring and volunteering skills, and help them make a difference in their communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“At the same time, this is about recognising that young people are a significant group in the community, and it’s important their voice is heard by local decision makers.”

Funding of between $10,000 and $30,000 per project will support a range of initiatives in 2017, from the expansion of local youth councils to the delivery of a community cultural night and food market.

Councils receiving funding include the Ashburton District Council, Buller District Council, Central Otago District Council, Environment Canterbury, Far North District Council, Hauraki District Council, Hutt City Council, Kawerau District Council, Matamata-Piako District Council, Tauranga City Council, Upper Hutt City Council, Waikato District Council, Waimakariri District Council, Waitaki District Council, Westland District Council and Wellington City Council.

“By being innovative and inclusive in the way they work with young people, councils can help inspire tomorrow’s leaders and also build more vibrant and cohesive communities.”
