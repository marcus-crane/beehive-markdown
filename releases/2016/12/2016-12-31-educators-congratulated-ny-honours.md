Education Minister Hekia Parata and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Paul Goldsmith have congratulated the 17 New Zealanders who have received New Year Honours for services to education.

“There are passionate and committed people working hard every day to help ensure that young New Zealanders get a world-class education and it’s great to see some of the very best being honoured,” says Ms Parata.

Those named include Georgina Kingi, QSO, who received the highest honour – Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

She has been principal of St Joseph’s Māori Girls College since 1987, having taught at the school since 1969. She has also been a member of the Education Expert Panel for the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“Dame Georgina has worked tirelessly in education for over 40 years and has played a pivotal role in the education of generations of young Māori women. This honour is truly deserved,” says Ms Parata.

Mr Goldsmith says the 17 honours are a reflection of the extremely high value New Zealand places on education.

“These 17 New Zealanders are fine examples of the dedicated people working in education to make a real and positive difference for young people.

“I congratulate them for the valuable contribution they’ve made to education in New Zealand and internationally,” says Mr Goldsmith.
