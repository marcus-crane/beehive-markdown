The Crown has signed an agreement in principle with Te Ākitai Waiohua to settle its historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Te Ākitai Waiohua is an iwi with an area of interest centred around South Auckland and customary interests claims across greater Auckland.

“The signing of the Agreement in Principle is a significant step towards Te Ākitai Waiohua settling its historical Treaty claims against the Crown,” Mr Finlayson said. “This agreement provides a firm basis from which to develop a detailed deed of settlement.”

The Agreement in Principle outlines a broad settlement package which includes provisional Crown acknowledgements of Treaty of Waitangi breaches as well as cultural, financial and commercial redress.

The total value of the financial and commercial redress outlined in the agreement is $9 million. This includes the opportunity to purchase over ten hectares of land in Manukau and enter into an agreement with the Crown to develop it for housing through the Crown Land Programme.

“Te Ākitai Waiohua looks forward to strengthening associations within its historical rohe. The proposed cultural and commercial redress in this agreement delivers on the iwi’s aspirations,” Mr Finlayson said.
