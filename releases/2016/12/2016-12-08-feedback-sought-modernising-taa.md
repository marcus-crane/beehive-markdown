Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse today released proposals to simplify and modernise the Tax Administration Act (TAA), as part of the Government’s major transformation of the revenue system.

“The Government is committed to ensuring our tax administration is fit for purpose and meets the needs of modern New Zealand,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Today’s release of the discussion document, *Making tax simpler – proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act*, includes detailed proposals developed following the first round of consultation in November last year.

“A key feature of this consultation is a focus on moving Inland Revenue resources to help taxpayers get it right from the start by providing more advice.”

Submissions received in November 2015 showed support for greater flexibility in how Inland Revenue works with taxpayers and intermediaries. They also recognised a desire to balance taxpayers’ confidentiality with the need for broader information sharing within government.

“A lot has changed in the way individuals and businesses engage with the tax system since the last comprehensive review of our tax administration settings in the early 90s,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“That is why we are undertaking extensive consultation to ensure the TAA is simple and workable for all New Zealanders.”

Submissions close on 24 February 2017. More information is available at [www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz](http://www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz).
