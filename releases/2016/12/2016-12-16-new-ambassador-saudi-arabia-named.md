Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat James Munro as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He will also be accredited to Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman.

“New Zealand has a strong and growing bilateral relationship with the Gulf states,” Mr McCully says.

“Our exports to the Gulf Cooperation council were worth $1.7 billion in 2015 and Saudi Arabia is one of New Zealand’s top 20 trading partners.

“A priority for Mr Munro will be to progress these trade and economic relationships, including the New Zealand/GCC FTA.”

Mr Munro is currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to Iraq. He is an Arabic speaker and former military officer, and has previously been posted to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. He will take up his position in mid-2017.
