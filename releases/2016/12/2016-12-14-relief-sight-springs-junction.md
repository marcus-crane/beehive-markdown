Acting Tourism Minister Paula Bennett today announced $199,500 in funding for public restroom facilities at Springs Junction following the Kaikoura quakes.

“This popular rest stop is facing increased pressure from re-routed traffic,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Following the Kaikoura earthquakes, traffic on State Highway 65 south of Murchison and State Highway 7 between Reefton and Waipara has increased significantly.

“Located where these two highways meet and with only a service station and tearooms, Springs Junction is not set up to cope with so many extra people.

“The Government is providing $199,500 to help Buller District Council construct public toilets and a waste disposal system at the site.

“This section of road is likely to experience heavier traffic and longer travel times for several months yet, as repairs are made to State Highway 1 between Picton and Christchurch.

“Buller District Council have committed to having the toilets up and running as soon as possible, early in the New Year,” Mrs Bennett says.

This funding will be drawn from Tourism Facilities Development Grants fund, which enables Ministers to respond quickly to emerging visitor needs for amenities and services.
