Trade Minister Todd McClay leads a senior-level business delegation on New Zealand’s first trade mission to Tehran in twelve years, today. 

Iran and New Zealand have a long-standing trade relationship, dating back to 1975 when New Zealand established an Embassy in Tehran, its first in the Middle East.

“There is enormous opportunity for Iran and New Zealand to work together to boost two-way trade,” says Mr McClay.

“Iran has traditionally been a very important market for our sheep meat and butter however exports have diminished over a number of years. Since the lifting of UN sanctions there are now renewed opportunities to re-establish this trade as well as new opportunities in the education, construction, food and beverage, energy, forestry, specialised manufacturing and services sectors.

“Earlier this year the visiting Iranian Foreign Minister said Iran presented a $1 billion prospect for New Zealand. This mission will be an important first step towards delivering on this exciting opportunity,” says Mr McClay.  

The eighteen New Zealand companies joining Mr McClay on this visit to Iran are: NIG Nutritionals, Tait Communications, Enatel Limited, Sealord, Silver Fern Farms, Westland Milk Products, Fonterra, FrameCAD, Flight Coffee, Switchfloat, University of Canterbury, University of Auckland, ANZCO, Auckland University of Technology, Pacific Helmets, Pelco NZ, NZ Bankers Association, and Pultron Composites.

Mr McClay has invited Labour trade spokesman, David Clark, to join him on this visit in the interests of promoting a bipartisan approach to trade, which is critical to New Zealand’s prosperity.
