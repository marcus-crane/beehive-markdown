Associate Minister of Conservation, Peter Dunne, has released a public consultation document on the proposal to establish a game trophy levy under the Game Animal Council Act 2013. 

The proposed levy would apply to game trophies being exported from New Zealand and the revenue would be used to fund the operations of the Game Animal Council as per the Game Animal Council Act 2013. 

"This public consultation begins an opportunity to collaborate with the sector on a proposal that seeks to secure funding for the Game Animal Council, an organisation that is pivotal for supporting and advocating for key issues alongside commercial and recreational hunting stakeholders,” Mr Dunne said. 

Under section 35 of the Game Animal Council Act the Minister must undertake a consultation process that considers the required funding for the Game Animal Council and the impact of the proposed levy on affected people, goods and industries.

"This consultation is about ensuring that we can collect the views of all the people and industries who engage in the hunting community, listen to what they have to say and work collaboratively with everyone involved to find the optimal path forward that will strengthen the recreational hunting sector's ability to advocate for key issues into the future.

"Any individual or group is encouraged to provide feedback to this consultation document," said Mr Dunne. 

Consultation on the proposed export levy will open at 12pm 13 December 2016 and close at 5pm 13 February 2017.
