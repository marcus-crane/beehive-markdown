The expansion of Wakatipu High School in Queenstown to accommodate a roll of up to 1800 will be considered under next year’s Budget, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“A relocated and expanded Wakatipu High School is already on track to open at the start of 2018,” says Ms Parata.

“The project underway will see the school’s capacity increased to 1200 students, up from 1060 at the current site.

“However, we know that Queenstown is one of New Zealand’s most popular and fastest growing regions.

“The current plans were designed to allow for future expansion, so it makes sense to look at bringing this forward to get ahead of growth trends. Upscaling the project would also be more cost-effective, since construction contractors will already be on site.

“I’d like to acknowledge MP for Clutha-Southland Todd Barclay, who is a passionate advocate for Queenstown and the importance of ensuring that the local school network has sufficient capacity to support future growth.”

Wakatipu High School is one of four new schools to be built and maintained under the Ministry of Education’s second public private partnership (PPP).

The new facilities at the school will include a multipurpose theatre space, gymnasium, specialist learning facilities, a dance studio and music rehearsal and recording studios.

Wakatipu High School is part of the Wakatipu Basin Community of Learning (CoL). CoLs are about increasing student achievement by schools working together to share expertise and lift the quality of teaching and learning.
