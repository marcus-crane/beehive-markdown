Transport Minister Simon Bridges has officially opened Coda’s new Intermodal Freight Hub in Otahuhu, one of the largest of its type in New Zealand.

The new facility will take containers of Fonterra products from plants in Whareroa and Pahiatua, and in return, send general freight from the Auckland region to Palmerston North.

“This new hub will help manage import, export and domestic freight in an efficient, safe and sustainable way,” Mr Bridges says.

“The new south-bound rail service from this facility will also provide freight owners with a more economic and environmentally friendly option for transporting their goods.

“As an exporting nation, efficient freight corridors are vital to our economy. Intermodal freight hubs allow goods to be transferred between road and rail services, allowing these two transport modes to work together effectively.

“Freight hubs also have a valuable role in helping our transport system adjust to the increasing size of cargo ships. Larger ships are potentially transformative for exporters, but mean road, rail and coastal shipping need to work together to deliver freight to and from a smaller number of ports.

“Hubs such as this one help ensure we are ready and able to effectively deliver freight to where it is needed,” Mr Bridges says.
