Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne is applauding a campaign by St John to reduce assaults on ambulance officers. The campaign has been launched because of the high and increasing number of cases of verbal and physical assaults on staff.

“Ambulance staff arrive at a scene to provide care, so it is distressing that they become a target for violence and abuse,” says Mr Dunne.

“The campaign is to raise awareness of this issue, and I hope all New Zealanders take on board that this a problem. Ambulance officers cannot save a life if they are trying to save their own.”

Mr Dunne says he is pleased that St John is also working with its staff to ensure they feel safer in their work environment.

“A similar campaign in South Australia has seen a 16 per cent decrease in abuse and violence incidents against its ambulance officers.

“That campaign used the phrase ‘hands off our ambos’. It is time for New Zealanders to take that to heart,” says Mr Dunne.

**Further background**

St John says nearly 3000 crew abuse incidents were reported in the past year and cases continue to rise.

70 per cent or 2000 crew abuse incidents were verbal.

Nearly 30 per cent of incidents involved some form of physical and verbal abuse (while six per cent of incidents involved just physical abuse).
