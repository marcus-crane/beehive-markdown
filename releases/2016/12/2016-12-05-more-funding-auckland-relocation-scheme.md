More than 150 households have taken up the offer of financial help to move from Auckland to other regions, improving their own living arrangements and freeing up valuable social housing for others.

In June, the Government introduced the grant of up to $5000 for relocation costs to help people who wanted to move from Auckland but otherwise could not afford to.

Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says the uptake of the relocation grant has been so successful that more funds would be allocated to the scheme.

“I’m very pleased to be able to extend funding of $1.95 million to the Relocation from Auckland initiative. This will enable a further 250 households to relocate,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Demand for the grant has been strong so we have increased the number of families who will be able to move into sustainable and affordable housing in other regions where they may have strong support networks.

“What’s most pleasing is that 65 households have relocated out of emergency or insecure accommodation into improved living arrangements. These aren’t just numbers, they’re real families we are supporting into more stable housing.

“The programme has also potentially freed up more than 100 homes for people in urgent need in Auckland. Along with the close to $2.6 million spent on housing support such as letting fees, bonds and moving assistance, we’re helping people overcome the barriers to housing independence,” Mrs Bennett says.
