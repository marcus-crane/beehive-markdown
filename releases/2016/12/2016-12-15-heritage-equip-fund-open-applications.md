A new $12 million support fund for earthquake strengthening work on heritage buildings is now open for applications, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced.

Launched in September, the Heritage Earthquake Upgrade Incentive Programme (Heritage EQUIP) offers support for privately-owned heritage buildings needing seismic upgrades.

“Heritage buildings are an important part of the economic, cultural and social life and character of our towns and cities, and the Government is committed to working with local authorities to make sure they can be retained,” Ms Barry says.

Applications are welcome from owners of all privately-owned Category 1 Heritage New Zealand listed buildings across the country and for Category 2 listed heritage buildings in areas of high to medium seismic risk.

Unlisted buildings with heritage values may be eligible for funding at the discretion of the expert panel which will assess the applications.

“Heritage building owners face challenges around seismic work, such as accessing technical advice, skilled labour and other funding sources. Heritage EQUIP is designed to help address these issues,” Ms Barry says.

“Grants are available for minor works under the Retrofit component of the fund, as well as for larger projects.

“For this first round, particular consideration will be given to projects in areas affected by the recent earthquakes.

“Building owners can also submit Expressions of Interest for larger projects for funding consideration, and I’d encourage interested owners to submit one so we can identify priorities for future funding rounds.”

Owners also need to demonstrate they can match the Heritage EQUIP fund component with local Government, philanthropic, community and their own contributions.

The expert advisory panel will be chaired by senior construction project manager Matthew Kidson.

Other panel members are structural engineers Winston Clark and Lara Simmons, conservation architects Chris Cochran and Bruce Dickson and heritage property developer Maurice Clark.

Applications will close on February 10. For more information about Heritage EQUIP and how to apply go to: [www.heritageequip.nz](http://www.heritageequip.nz/).
