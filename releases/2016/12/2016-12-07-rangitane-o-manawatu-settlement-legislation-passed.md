The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass the Rangitāne o Manawatū Claims Settlement Bill through its third and final reading.

When enacted this bill will give effect to the Deed of Settlement signed by Rangitāne o Manawatū and the Crown on 14 November 2015.

“Rangitāne o Manawatū has waited a long time for this day,” Mr Finlayson said. “Settlement marks a turning point in the iwi’s history and the beginning of a new relationship with the Crown.”

Rangitāne o Manawatū will receive financial and commercial redress totalling $13.5 million. Settlement also provides for the formation of an advisory board to the Horizons Regional Council in relation to management of the Manawatu River.

“The Crown can never fully compensate Rangitāne o Manawatū for the wrongs of the past but this settlement provides a solid foundation for a stronger cultural and economic future for the iwi.

“This settlement has passed through the legislative process in under a year. I acknowledge the Māori Affairs Committee whose diligence has once again brought a Treaty settlement to conclusion in a timely manner,” Mr Finlayson said.

Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Bill will be read a second time during extended sitting hours today.
