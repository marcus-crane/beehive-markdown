Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that the use of the veto in response to a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Syria is cynical and disappointing.

“New Zealand co-sponsored a resolution with Egypt and Spain calling for a halt to the violence in Syria, humanitarian access to Aleppo, and the resumption of negotiations,” Mr McCully says.

“Despite broad support from other members of the Security Council, Russia, supported by China, has used its veto to block the resolution. This is particularly disappointing as we consulted intensively and worked hard to achieve consensus.

“There is no justification for the continued bombardment of more than 250,000 civilians trapped in Aleppo and this is yet another example of the urgent need for Security Council reform.

“This was opportunity for the Security Council to come together and make a practical difference for the people of Syria. History will judge harshly those who have chosen to put power politics and technical excuses ahead of human life.

“New Zealand will continue to work with Council members, and the full UN membership, to bring pressure to bear on those perpetuating violence against civilians in Syria,” Mr McCully says.

The final results of the vote were 11 in favour; three against (Russia, China and Venezuela) and one abstention (Angola).
