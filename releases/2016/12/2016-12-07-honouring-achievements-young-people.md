Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated the young people who have been recognised at today’s tenth annual William Wallace Awards ceremony in Wellington.

The awards celebrate the outstanding achievements of young people in care or with experience in care, and provide scholarships of up to $3,000 to help them pursue tertiary study, vocational training, leadership programmes or an Outward Bound course.

“I am incredibly proud of our 17 young recipients who have overcome tough experiences, made the most of every opportunity and worked hard to succeed in their chosen field,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These young people have displayed real strength of character to get to where they are today – the awards are a chance to acknowledge this and support them in reaching their goals.”

 Youth Advisory Panel members from the 2015 expert panel who advised the Minister during the review and overhaul of the care system were also recognised at the ceremony.

“The Youth Advisory Panel was made up of young people who have experience of state care and were essential in ensuring children and young people’s voices were heard during the review of the care and protection system. Another panel of young people will continue to advise me and the transformation team as the new system is developed over the coming months,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The young people at today’s awards really are an inspiration to their schools, communities and other young people in care, and they can be very proud of what they have accomplished.”
