Corrections Minister Judith Collins has today inspected the $19m upgrade of Invercargill Prison which will add another fifty years of life into the century old facility.

The Department of Corrections has just completed a three year, three stage refurbishment, providing significant health and security improvements to the prison that has the capacity to accommodate 172 prisoners on sentence and remand and 75 staff.

The project has replaced older facilities, created more space for trade and training programmes and earthquake strengthened some areas where required.

“The upgrade has enhanced safety and security at the prison, while also providing better rehabilitation and training facilities for prisoners.”

The refurbishment also included enhancements to the kitchen and laundry facilities and the completion of a new Health and At Risk unit to provide a fit for purpose facility.

Invercargill Prison was built in 1908-10 but still plays a significant role in New Zealand justice system.

“Even after all these years, the prison is regarded as being generally in good condition and upgrading some of its facilities will prolong its life. It also provides Corrections with a strategic response in the South Island in the event of another emergency in Christchurch,” says Ms Collins.
