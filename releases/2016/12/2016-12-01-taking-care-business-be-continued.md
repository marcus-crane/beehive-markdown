Small Business Minister Craig Foss says the Taking Care of Business roadshow has been so successful, more events are likely next year.

“Over five months, more than 2000 business owners and operators attended 22 Taking Care of Business events around the country, from Invercargill to Whangarei,” Mr Foss says.

“Every event got bigger and better and the feedback from attendees was outstanding.

“We expanded the roadshow twice, adding five additional locations and two Auckland-based events specifically designed to support the Korean and Indian business communities.”

The Blenheim event scheduled for November 14 — the day of the 7.8 magnitude quake — has been postponed. 

“The information and advice available through Taking Care of Business will now be even more important for business owners and operators in this part of the country.

“The Blenheim event will be rescheduled as soon as it’s appropriate and practical to do so.  I hope to announce additional locations at the same time. 

“Taking Care of Business is about helping business owners engage with agencies more effectively and efficiently by taking government to businesses, not the other way around.”

Many of the tools and resources featured in the roadshow are available online at: [www.Business.govt.nz](http://www.Business.govt.nz)
