Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today released the Government’s response to the report *Social Enterprise and Social Finance: A Path to Growth*, which outlines a range of actions designed to support the continued growth of the social enterprise sector.

“I’m excited to release the Government’s response to the *Path to Growth* report, and continue our support for the social enterprise sector,” says Mrs Goodhew.

As part of the Government response to the report, a cross-agency working group has been formed to coordinate different public sector agencies and engage with external organisations. The core members of the group are:

- The Department of Internal Affairs;
- The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment;
- Te Puni Kōkiri; and
- The Treasury.

The work programme includes determining an approach to producing data on social enterprise, overviewing funding for capability-building services, actions to encourage investment, and encouraging participation in the September 2017 Social Enterprise World Forum in Christchurch. 

Social enterprises are organisations that trade as a business to support their social or environmental mission.

“In October 2016, I launched the report of the Strategic Group on Social Enterprise and Social Finance, and indicated that the Government’s response would follow,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The 2014 Government Position Statement on Social Enterprise, outlined the Government’s commitment to facilitate further growth of the social enterprise sector, and we are progressing that with a coordinated Government approach.”

The cross-agency working group will report to the Regional Economic Development Ministers’ Group on progress with the work, including additional actions still under consideration.

The Cabinet paper endorses the Strategic Group’s vision of ‘flourishing social enterprises and a dynamic social finance market’.
