Economic Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett announced today that $158,000 is being committed to a visitor economy project as part of the Toi Moana Bay of Plenty Action Plan. The Plan has a key action to develop a collaborative regional tourism framework that supports growing the visitor economy to $2.5 billion by 2030.

The funding will be used to develop a regional strategic plan and four sub-regional strategies for Tauranga/ Western Bay, Rotorua, Taupo and Opotiki/ Whakatane/ Kawerau. The project will also include economic analysis and will identify regional priorities for future investment.

“Through the Bay of Connections regional growth strategy for the wider region, the territorial authorities, regional tourism organisations and others parties have agreed to identify opportunities to support the growth of the visitor economy in the wider region,” Mr Joyce says.

“This project will provide critical information and data that regions can use to guide and support their planning and funding. It will also provide clarity on priorities for local and regional government so they can work with central government to support the visitor economy.”

“The Bay of Plenty has some of New Zealand’s most well established tourist destinations, with a diverse range of offerings for both domestic and international visitors. Tourism has the potential to grow significantly across the region,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The project also contributes to the Government’s broader tourism strategy, one of the aims of which is to ensure that all regions benefit from tourism growth and that our international visitors are encouraged to explore not only our most iconic tourism destinations but also lesser known parts of New Zealand.”

The contract for this work was awarded to TRC Tourism, supported by Freshinfo, following a competitive tender process. Both organisations have extensive experience in the tourism strategy and development space.

The project will start in December 2016 and is expected to be completed by mid-2017.
