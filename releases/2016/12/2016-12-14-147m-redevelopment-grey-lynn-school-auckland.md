The Government will invest $14.7 million to redevelop Grey Lynn School in central Auckland, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This project will see ageing facilities replaced and will also set the school up to accommodate anticipated roll growth,” says Ms Parata.

“As with many parts of the city, the population in central Auckland is growing rapidly, and we need to ensure local schools have the capacity to meet increased demand.”

The $14 million investment will deliver 14 new teaching spaces, including six roll growth and eight replacement classrooms, as well as new library and administration facilities and a multi-purpose hall.

“Site constraints mean a lot of work is being put into the design work for the redevelopment,” says Ms Parata.

“The final plans will see a mix of two and three storey buildings, to ensure valuable outdoor recreation space can be retained.”

Early site works will be carried out over the summer holidays. Construction is expected to get underway in April 2017, and be completed by January 2019.

Grey Lynn School is one of 11 schools that are part of the recently established Waiorea Community of Learning (CoL). CoLs are about increasing student achievement by schools working together to share expertise and lift the quality of teaching and learning.

Today’s announcement means over $268 million worth of school redevelopments have been announced or have commenced  in Auckland over the past six months, including Macleans College, Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae, Te Atatu Intermediate School, Te Huruhi School, Waiheke High School, Northcote Primary School, Newmarket School, Clayton Park School, Takapuna Primary School, Bayswater School, Western Springs College, Freemans Bay School, Papatoetoe Central School, The Gardens School and Southern Cross Campus.
