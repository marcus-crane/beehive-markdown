International Day of Persons with Disabilities is a chance to celebrate the progress we have made to improve the lives of disabled New Zealanders, says Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner.

“This year’s theme, *Achieving 17 Goals for the Future We Want*, draws attention to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals and how these goals can create a more inclusive and equitable society for disabled people,” Ms Wagner says.

“Our government has been working hard to help us move towards a non-disabling society.

“We have recently launched the New Zealand Disability Strategy 2016-2026, which will provide guide the work of government agencies on disability issues over the next 10 years.

“The launch of the Disability Confident campaign by Prime Minister John Key aims to build employer awareness of and access to the wide range of existing programmes, services and resources to help them hire and retain disabled people.

“Robert Martin’s election to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities this year was a tremendous achievement. His election is historical because he is the first person with a learning disability to be elected to the Committee. I have no doubt that Robert will play a significant role in promoting the rights of disabled people around the world.

“I would also like to mention the success of our truly inspiring Paralympians in Rio earlier this year. Our 31 Paralympians achieved 21 medals in total. They maintained the top position achieved by New Zealand in 2012.

“While we still have some work to do, it is important that take stock of how far we have come in making a positive difference in the lives of disabled people,” Ms Wagner says.

The International Day of Persons with Disabilities is celebrated on 3 December every year.
