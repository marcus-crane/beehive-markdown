Police Minister Judith Collins has today joined members of Eastern District Police, local leaders and the community to open the newly built $5.5m Napier Police Station.

“This station represents a significant investment in policing in Napier and will provide a valuable asset for the people of this city for years to come,” says Ms Collins.

“It also represents the Government’s commitment to ensuring Police have the facilities and the resources they need to build on the huge programme of modernisation they have undergone in recent years.

“The men and women who police our communities and the staff who support them deserve to have a working environment that is safe and comfortable.

“The former building was entering into its sixth decade of service for the local Police and was becoming unsuitable for a modern day police team.

“This new station is fit for purpose and caters for the needs of both the public and our 21st century policing service.

“I’d like to thank the District and Area leadership teams, fronted by Superintendent Sandra Venables and Inspector Tania Kura, and all members of Hawke’s Bay Area Police who have had input into this project for their hard work and enthusiasm.

“I would also like to pay tribute to ocal staff for their patience while construction has been underway.  But I’m sure they’d all agree that any inconvenience and disruption has been worthwhile.”

Ms Collins was also pleased to hear local staff would be holding an open day this Sunday which would allow the public to check out the new station and interact with local staff, and encourages all those in Napier to attend.

While in Napier, Ms Collins also attended the Hawkes Bay Area awards ceremony at the Napier City Council Chambers.

Alongside Police Commissioner Mike Bush, Ms Collins presented 17 Long Service and Good Conduct awards as well as six G20 citations.

“A Long Service and Good Conduct award is only granted to those who have been in the Police service for 14 years or longer in seven year intervals,” says Ms Collins.

“To have had so many receiving awards today shows how rewarding a career in Police can be for so many people.

“I would like to especially acknowledge one staff member who today received a 42 year Long Service and Good Conduct badge.

“I would like to thank them, and the other 16 staff who received awards, for their excellence service and commitment to ensuring New Zealanders are safe from crime in our communities.”
