The public has one week left to make a submission on new proposals to modernise and future-proof New Zealand’s fisheries management system, says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“The Future of our Fisheries is a major programme of work to improve the sustainable, long-term benefits enjoyed by all New Zealanders,” says Mr Guy.

“Public meetings have been held around the country with good turnout and engagement from all sectors – recreational, customary and commercial. However submissions close on Friday 23 December so people need to send their thoughts in over the next seven days.”

The three strategic proposals are maximising value from our fisheries, better fisheries information and agile and responsive decision-making.

There are also two regulatory changes outlined for the Integrated Electronic Monitoring and Reporting System (IERMS), which includes cameras, geospatial monitoring and electronic reporting, and providing flexibility for developing new trawl technologies.

“Our fisheries management has been recognised as world-leading, but we need to keep looking for ways to improve the system and meet future challenges. This is a great opportunity for everyone to have their say on how we can better manage one of New Zealand’s most valuable resources.”
