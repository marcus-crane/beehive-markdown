Foreign Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Andrew Jenks as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Spain.

“Spain is an important partner for New Zealand and a key member of the European Union,” Mr McCully says. 

“Spain is a base for a number of NZ companies operating in the region, and there is scope to further develop our trade and economic relationship.

“We also share political and security interests through our cooperation on the United Nations Security Council over the past two years, and our participation in operations such as the UN mission in Afghanistan.”

Mr Jenks has previously been posted to Ottawa, Jakarta and Paris. As Ambassador to Spain he will also be accredited to Andorra.
