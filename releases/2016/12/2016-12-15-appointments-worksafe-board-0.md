Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced two new appointments to the WorkSafe New Zealand Board.

Stephen Reindler and Nikki Davies-Colley will join the board from 16 December for three year terms.

 “These appointments bring to the Board strong governance skills and experience in sectors which WorkSafe is particularly focused on,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Stephen Reindler is a very experienced director and engineer who has led health and safety programmes in large manufacturing, engineering, and transport companies.

“Nikki Davies-Colley brings her governance experience in the farming, forestry and energy sectors and her health and safety initiatives have become models for others in those industries.”

Chair and Deputy Chair of the WorkSafe Board, Gregor Coster and Ross Wilson, have also been reappointed.

“Both Gregor and Ross have shown a strong commitment to implementing the reforms introduced by the Health and Safety at Work Act.

“Gregor is an experienced health sector leader and has led the board from its establishment in 2013. Ross will continue to bring an employees’ perspective and a sound understanding of employment and workplace health and safety law.”

WorkSafe is a Crown agent and has an independent board, with five to nine members appointed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety.
