Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman will tonight help mark the success of New Zealand rugby at the 2016 NZ Rugby Union Awards.

“I’d like to congratulate all the nominees. It’s been a fantastic year for rugby with so many great team and individual performances,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman will present the ASB Coach of the Year Award at tonight’s awards, which are being held at Sky City, Auckland.

“Coaches are a crucial part of the game from grass roots to high performance, with nearly 13,000 rugby coaches across the country,” says Dr Coleman.

“I would like to acknowledge our thousands of coaches, from volunteers like mums and dads at local clubs through to those in the professional ranks.

“Most of our top players started playing rugby as children, and those first coaches will have helped shape both their skills and a love of the game which has seen them reach the highest levels.

“Just as the players from the All Blacks, Black Ferns and our sevens teams inspire future generations of players, our elite coaches are role models for those with aspirations of coaching at a higher level.”

The nominees for Coach of the Year are Chris Boyd (Hurricanes), Steve Hansen (All Blacks), Steve Jackson (North Harbour), and Scott Robertson (Canterbury).
