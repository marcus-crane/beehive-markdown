Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says recent observations by GNS provide a timely reminder to all New Zealanders about the need to be prepared for earthquakes.

GNS has observed unusual activity involving patches of slow slip movement between tectonic plates in the lower North Island.

“This heightened activity increases the uncertainty about the likelihood and size of future earthquakes,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Since the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on November 14, GNS has advised the public that an aftershock of similar or larger magnitude is unlikely but possible.

“While it’s not scientifically possible to predict future earthquakes, this ongoing seismic activity is a reminder to us all that we live in a seismically active country and should always be prepared for a major earthquake.

“Information from GNS is available publically at [www.geonet.org.nz](http://www.geonet.org.nz/) and has been discussed today with all political parties to ensure everyone is fully informed. Future updates from GNS will also be notified publically.

“The most recent earthquakes have prompted important conversations about being well prepared for natural disasters and it’s essential that we all sit down with family and friends to make sure we have a plan.

“Devising a household plan should include agreeing how everyone in your home would meet up after a disaster. Every house should plan to have plenty of food, water and other essential supplies.

“When an earthquake happens, make sure you drop, cover and hold and if you’re near the coast and feel a long or strong quake, then head inland or to higher ground immediately. Do not wait for official warnings – the earthquake itself is the natural warning.

“I would encourage New Zealanders to visit the Civil Defence website [www.civildefence.govt.nz/get-ready](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/get-ready) for information on how to get ready, and get through a potential disaster,” Mr Brownlee says.

Anyone requiring information and support should call the Government Helpline on 0800 779 997.
