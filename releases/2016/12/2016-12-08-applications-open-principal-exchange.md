Two New Zealand principals will have the chance to lead schools in South Australia as part of a trans-Tasman exchange programme, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“The South Australia/New Zealand Principal Exchange programme is the first of its kind and offers principals an exciting opportunity to experience leading a school in a different jurisdiction,” says Ms Parata.

The exchange programme was established jointly by the Ministry of Education and the South Australian Department for Education and Child Development. Two placements are available each year, one for a primary principal and one for a secondary principal. For one term, New Zealand principals will exchange schools with a principal of a South Australian school that has a similar roll to their own school.

The first exchange took place in Term Three this year and saw Steve Berezowski from Te Wharau School in Gisborne swap schools with Tracey Davies from Richmond Primary School in Adelaide.

“The principals and their schools have all learned and benefitted from the challenges, opportunities and insights offered by the exchange,” says Ms Parata.

“New Zealand has some of the best principals in the world and it’s important that we continue to support their professional development. This exchange will allow successful applicants to build on their leadership experience and bring back new ideas and skills.”

Applications close on Monday 27 February. Information about the exchange and how to apply can be found [here](http://www.education.govt.nz/school/working-in-a-school/south-australia-and-new-zealand-principal-exchange/).
