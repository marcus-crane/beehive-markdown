Trade Minister Todd McClay says New Zealand education institutions stand to benefit following the signing of an education cooperation agreement in Iran today.

Mr McClay is leading New Zealand's first Trade Mission to Iran in more than a decade, and believes the visit has strengthened the New Zealand-Iran relationship following bilateral talks in Tehran.

“Under this arrangement, we aim to strengthen, promote, and develop education cooperation and collaboration between our two countries including academic exchanges and research programmes,” says Mr McClay.

New Zealand is increasingly chosen as a destination for students looking for a world-class education, with eighty per cent of Iranian students in New Zealand studying towards PhD qualification.

“I also welcomed the reclassification of New Zealand universities into the top tier of international rankings for Iranian students looking to study overseas, further cementing New Zealand’s position as a destination for students wanting a world-class education,” says Mr McClay.

“I expect this will lead to more PhD students choosing to study in New Zealand.”

Whilst in Tehran, Mr McClay addressed the Iranian Chamber of Commerce and held bi-lateral talks with the Iran Minister of Industry, Mining and Trade, Mohamad Reza Nematzadeh. He also met with the Governor of Iran's Central Bank to further discuss opportunities to develop stronger trade links between the two countries.

“This visit marked an opportunity to renew acquaintances, build new ties, and celebrate the growing trade relationship,” says Mr McClay.

The business delegation accompanying Mr McClay included: NIG Nutritionals, Tait Communications, Enatel Limited, Sealord, Silver Fern Farms, Westland Milk Products, Fonterra, FrameCAD, Flight Coffee, University of Canterbury, ANZCO, Auckland University of Technology, Pacific Helmets, Pelco NZ, and Pultron Composites.
