Police Minister Judith Collins has congratulated 40 new police constables as they mark the end of their training at the Royal New Police College with an attestation parade today.

Today’s parade is being attended by Wing Patron Hon Luamanuvao Winne Laban and Police Commissioner Mike Bush, along with family and friends of the 40 new constables.

Ms Collins says the parade marks the beginning of a challenging but rewarding career for the new officers as they look to be leaders within New Zealand’s diverse communities.

It takes a special type of person to become a Police officer. Very few jobs ask their employees to put themselves in the path of danger on a daily basis to help keep their communities safe and free from crime,” Ms Collins said

“Every one of our communities has different needs and police are continuously looking at how they can best serve those communities.

“Members of Wing 301 show Police’s commitment to reflecting the communities it serves with individuals coming from Australia, China, England, India, South Africa and South Korea

“I congratulate these new constables on their achievement and I look forward to meeting them out on the beat as they continue through their career with police, protecting and serving those who need them most
