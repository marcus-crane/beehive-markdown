The Government is investing $837,132 in nine new projects for the upkeep of the New Zealand Cycle Trail, Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key announced today.

The investment comes from the fifth round of the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, which aims to ensure New Zealand’s premier rides are maintained to their current world class standard.

“The New Zealand Cycle Trail network continues to grow in popularity among both Kiwis and international visitors, with more than a million people visiting the 22 Great Rides last year,” Mr Key says.

“With such high usage, it is important that the cycle trails are kept to a standard that gives visitors a safe and enjoyable experience.

“The funding announced today will go to cycle trails in several different parts of the country. As part of the Government’s tourism strategy, the trails are helping ensure our regions benefit from the exceptional growth occurring in the tourism sector.

“An evaluation released in October estimated that the Great Rides had produced $37.4 million in economic benefits in 2015 alone, through revenue from visitor spending.”

The nine projects to receive funding from the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund are:

- Motu Trails Trust: Motu Trails (Bay of Plenty), $29,752
- Tasman District Council: Tasman Great Taste Trail (Tasman), $96,800
- Queen Charlotte Track Incorporated: Queen Charlotte Track (Marlborough), $255,000
- Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust: Old Ghost Road (West Coast), $42,971
- Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency: Rimutaka Cycle Trail (Wellington Wairarapa), $221,000
- Hauraki District Council: Hauraki Rail Trail (Hauraki), $26,196
- Central Otago Clutha Trails Ltd: Roxburgh Gorge and Clutha Gold (Otago), $21,713
- Nelson City Council: Dun Mountain Trail (Nelson), $69,000
- Ruapehu District Council: Mountains to Sea (Ruapehu), $74,700

In February 2014, $8 million over four years was announced for the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund. A total of $4.2 million has been approved for 46 projects across 19 Great Rides.
