Simple mistakes on our roads are costing too many lives, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Sadly and frustratingly, 308 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunties, uncles, cousins and friends have died on our roads so far this year,” Mr Foss says.

“Speed and alcohol continue to be major contributing factors. Last year, 90 people died in crashes involving alcohol and 101 died while travelling too fast for the conditions.

“All up, over half of the 319 deaths on our roads last year involved illegal behaviour such as speeding, driving while impaired, fleeing police or not wearing a seatbelt.  

“This simply isn’t good enough. We all have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe on the roads.

“The Government is constantly working to make our roads safer. The $600 million Safer Roads and Roadsides package, announced earlier this year, includes over 50 projects on high-risk rural state highway corridors and intersections across the country. It will see safety improvements made to around 1700km of New Zealand’s rural road network.

“The busy holiday season is here and our road toll is already much too high. So, I challenge everyone who gets behind the wheel to take a moment to ensure they and their passengers are wearing seatbelts.

“And, as the numbers show, no good will come from speeding or driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. Getting to your destination safety should be the number one priority.”
