Education Minister Hekia Parata has officially established a new primary school in the fast-growing north Hamilton suburb of Sylvester.

The school, located at the corner of Borman Road and Hare Puke Drive, will enrol year one to six students from Term One 2019.

“This is an exciting time for this new community. The school will be a focal point for families living in the area and a valuable community asset, Ms Parata says.

“This school will provide safe, supportive and inclusive learning environments that reflect the community.”

The Establishment Board of Trustees will be appointed shortly. It will have responsibility for appointing a foundation principal, determining school policy and governance practices, as well as ensuring the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community.

The school will initially be known as Sylvester Primary School, and will be designed, built, and maintained through a public private partnership. A special school satellite and an Early Childhood Education centre will be a part of the school.

“Sylvester Primary will also be able to tap into further resources and expertise by joining a Community of Learning | Kāhui Ako,” Ms Parata says.
