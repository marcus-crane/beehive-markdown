Redevelopment of Hamilton’s Meteor Theatre will receive $368,000 in Government funding, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced.

“The Meteor is an important part of Hamilton’s vibrant arts scene and a deserving recipient of this grant from the Regional Culture and Heritage Fund,” Ms Barry says.

“With the closure of the Founder’s Theatre, Hamilton needs its smaller venues to step up and carry the city’s touring and performing arts programmes.”

As a black box theatre, the Meteor’s flexibility as a venue will make it important for the city while a replacement for the Founder’s Theatre is developed.

In addition to seismic strengthening, the upgrade will improve facilities for the audience and performers, including a new theatre floor, dressing room and soundproofing.

“I congratulate the One Victoria Trust for steering this project through and Trust Waikato, the Lottery Community Facilities Fund and the Hamilton City Council for their support.

“My thanks go to my colleague, MP for Hamilton West Tim Macindoe, who made this announcement on my behalf today. As a former CEO of Arts Waikato, Tim is an avid supporter of theatre and the arts in Hamilton and he advocated vigorously for this grant on behalf of the One Victoria Trust.”

This is the final grant in the inaugural round of RCHF funding. In total, $13.8 million has been granted to projects in Hamilton, Whanganui, Nelson, Whakatane and Gore.

“I’d encourage anyone hoping to apply for RCHF funding to get their documentation in order as the second round will open for applications early in 2017.”
