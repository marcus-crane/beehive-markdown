The Chairperson and Maori community representative for the Board leading the development of new partnerships to increase youth development opportunities were announced today by Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley.

“I’m pleased to announce that following the Partnership Fund Board’s inaugural meeting, Karen Shires has been elected Chairperson for an 18-month term,” says Mrs Tolley.

Karen is a senior Assurance partner at PwC where she leads the Financial Services Risk and Regulatory practice, as well as being Lead Trustee of community involvement programme the PwC Foundation.

“Karen’s strong governance experience and commitment to corporate social responsibility will prove invaluable to the Board as it oversees investment decisions necessary to increase youth development opportunities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I’m also pleased to announce that Arama Ngāpō-Lipscombe will be the ninth member and Maori community representative on the Board.

“Arama is of Marutuahu, Ngāti Tamatera, Ngāti Pukenga and Ngāti Porou ki Harataunga descent. As a lawyer Arama has spent her career advocating for children and families, and she’s also been instrumental in supporting and implementing youth-based projects.”

Under the new Ministry for Youth Development direction announced last November, the Government will co-invest in youth development opportunities with philanthropic and business partners, to increase the number of opportunities available.

“The Board’s role is to draw on their expertise and networks to generate new ideas and forge new partnerships to grow youth development opportunities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This is about the Government, business and philanthropic organisations sharing ideas and funding to grow youth development opportunities, and I look forward to Karen and Arama contributing their combined skills and passion for young people towards this goal.”
