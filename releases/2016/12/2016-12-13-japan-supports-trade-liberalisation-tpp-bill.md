Trade Minister Todd McClay says Japan’s passing of TPP legislation demonstrates their support for international trade liberalisation.

“It’s good to see the world’s 3rd largest economy join New Zealand and show leadership on trade,” says Mr McClay.

With the Upper House endorsement on Friday (9 December), Japan has now completed its parliamentary process for the approval of the TPP Agreement. This follows New Zealand’s passage of the primary legislation necessary to ratify the agreement on 15 November.

“This is an important step in the right direction and a signal to other nations.

“We must continue to champion the benefits of openness and inclusiveness. This remains the only way to secure prosperity for our economy and for generations to come.

“New Zealand is trading nation and fair access to markets is essential for the continued growth and stability of our economy.

“We currently have an ambitious trade agenda. We are negotiating regional, multilateral and bilateral agreements and will continue to look for opportunities for New Zealand exporters in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world.

“Now, more than ever, the world needs leadership on trade and I congratulate Japan for passing their TPP legislation,” says Mr McClay.
