Acting Youth Minister Anne Tolley today announced the successful applicants for Youth Fund 2017.

“I’m pleased to announce that 36 projects will share $150,000 of funding available under Youth Fund 2017,” says Mrs Tolley.

Youth Fund is about supporting community initiatives designed and led by young people, either working alone or in partnership with youth organisations.

“Young people made up the panel which assessed applications, making this a completely youth-led initiative,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The projects supported in 2017 will enable young people around New Zealand aged between 12 and 24 to take part in a diverse range of volunteering, mentoring and leadership opportunities.

“These opportunities will include everything from learning more about and participating in the democratic process, to supporting siblings of people with disabilities, being involved in hospice care, delivering artistic productions and cultivating a community vegetable garden.

“As well as helping young people develop their own skills, Youth Fund is also about providing ways for youth to engage with and contribute to their communities.”

Since it was launched in 2010, Youth Fund has supported over 270 youth-led projects.
