The potato industry has become the thirteenth industry partner to join the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) biosecurity partnership, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“It’s very pleasing to have Potatoes New Zealand working with the Ministry for Primary Industries and other industry partners on biosecurity,” says Mr Guy.

“It means we can work together on managing and responding to the most important risks like tomato- potato psyllid.

“I want to thank the potato growers for joining GIA. It shows they want to work collaboratively with MPI on biosecurity preparedness and responses.

“As the recent Biosecurity 2025 Direction Statement outlines, biosecurity is a shared responsibility. It needs everyone working together sharing their expertise and experience.”

The signing of the agreement was attended by Mr Guy at a potato farm near Levin this morning.

The potato industry is worth $142 million at the farm gate and is a staple grocery item, generating $500 million across the value chain.

They join Vegetables NZ, TomatoesNZ, Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand, New Zealand Pork, New Zealand Equine Health Association, Onions New Zealand, the Forestry Owners Association, The New Zealand Avocado Growers’ Association, New Zealand Citrus Growers Incorporated and the Ministry for Primary Industries under GIA.
