Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is welcoming International Volunteers Day tomorrow (5 December) and is acknowledging the contribution made by New Zealand’s volunteers.

“My heartfelt thanks goes to all of those who volunteer, in particular those who have given up their time to assist during the response to the North Canterbury earthquake,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The theme of this year’s Volunteers Day is ‘Together we can’, emphasising what can be achieved by communities working together.

“Putting the needs of your community first, even though your home may have been damaged, is an amazing thing to do. Volunteers have put in countless hours since the early hours of 14 November, and all for the benefit of their communities, above themselves.

“Communities across the country are greatly strengthened by our volunteer workforce, who are major contributors to New Zealand topping lists of the world’s best places to live.

“They make a huge contribution across almost every type of activity from sports, recreation, arts, culture and heritage to emergency and social services, health, education, conservation, and the environment.”

New Zealanders are amongst the most generous in the world when it comes to donating their time and money, with the value of their labour alone worth $3.5 billion to our GDP.

“Around 1.2 million kiwis volunteer for at least one charity or not-for-profit organisation every year. While 90% of community organisations simply couldn’t exist without this generosity so it is timely that we thank them for their contribution,” says Mrs Goodhew.
