Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the visit to New Zealand later this week by Brunei’s Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Pehin Lim Jock Seng and Energy and Industry Minister Pehin Yasmin Umar.

“Brunei is an important partner for New Zealand in South East Asia, and we enjoy friendly cooperation in defence, trade and education,” Mr McCully says.

“During the visit, we will discuss Brunei’s plans to diversify its economy and how New Zealand can best support these efforts. Our talks will also focus on regional economic and political issues.”
