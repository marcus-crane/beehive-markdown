Tourism spending in the regions was again strong in the year to October 2016, reflecting the Government’s commitment to support regional tourism growth.

According to the Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates released today by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), tourism expenditure grew in all regions over the year to October 2016.

Nelson and Otago continue to be the fastest growing regions, with expenditure in Nelson increasing 16 per cent over the year to $334 million and Otago up 14 per cent to $3.4 billion. Bay of Plenty is the third fastest growing region, up 10 per cent to $1.7 billion.

“The recent MBIE Tourism Insight Series report showed that all regions have benefited from the strong growth in tourism over the past three years, as well as shoulder seasons becoming more popular with tourists,” says Associate Minister of Tourism Paula Bennett.

“The latest spending data affirms that the Government’s tourism strategy of spreading tourism growth around the regions is working.

“The Government has an extensive work programme to ensure all regions benefit from the exceptional growth happening right now in tourism. The most recent Tourism Growth Partnership funded a number of exciting initiatives outside the main centres to spread the economic benefits of tourism across the country.”

This release of the Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates does not include any impacts of the North Canterbury earthquake on 14 November. Data on the tourism spend in the affected regions will be available in January 2017 as part of the Monthly Regional Tourism Estimates for November 2016.
