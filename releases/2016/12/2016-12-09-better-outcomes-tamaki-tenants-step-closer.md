Formal proposals are being requested from three responders to carry out New Zealand’s largest housing redevelopment project, Ministers Bill English and Dr Nick Smith say.

Ngāti Paoa Consortium, Tūhono Tāmaki Consortium and Exemplar Communities Consortium have been invited to submit proposals for the first phase of the Tāmaki Regeneration project, redeveloping around 1,000 existing social houses into 2,500 social, affordable and market houses. 

The houses belong to the Tāmaki Regeneration Company (TRC), which is jointly owned by the Crown and Auckland Council. 

The whole project aims to redevelop around 2,800 social houses into at least 7,500 mixed tenure dwellings over 10-15 years.

The three consortia have been selected from six who responded to the Expressions of Interest (EOI) stage of the project.

“This is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the stock of social and affordable housing in Auckland,” Finance Minister Bill English says.

“The Government is undertaking a wide range of social housing reforms and the redevelopment of Tāmaki is an example of where we're working to improve the lives of vulnerable New Zealanders, while increasing new housing developments in Auckland.

“I was particularly pleased at the number of EOI respondents with the capability, understanding and motivation to deliver a better service for tenants,” he says.

Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith says the redevelopment is yet another step in the Government’s comprehensive programme to improve the overall supply of housing in Auckland.

“This development will improve the quality of housing by replacing older homes with warmer, drier and healthier homes, with a mix of size to match today’s needs. Step by step, development by development, this Government is addressing Auckland’s housing challenges.”
