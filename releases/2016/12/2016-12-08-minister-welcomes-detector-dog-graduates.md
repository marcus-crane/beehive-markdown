Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed five new members to Corrections Detector Dog team.

Corrections’ newest detector dogs were purchased from the Australian Border Force and graduated today, alongside their canine colleagues from Aviation Security and Customs, following a nine week training course.

“It is evident that the Dog Section has an essential role in the effectiveness of contraband reduction plans and has a real impact in keeping our prisons safe.”

The newest additions to the Detector Dog team will be based at Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Auckland Prison, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Rimutaka Prison and Christchurch Men’s Prison and will make a total of 19 Detector Dog teams in prisons around the country.

This course was the first to use a new dog training area developed at Corrections’ National Learning Centre, as well as using some of the facilities at the Police Dog Training Centre. 

The dogs are trained to recognise and seek out even the smallest quantities of various drugs to stop them entering prison. They inspect prisoner property and cells as well as search visitors, their vehicles, and property posted or couriered into our prisons.

“Corrections’ Detector Dog Team is highly regarded amongst the New Zealand working dog world and interagency cooperation is an important part of the work that they do. 

“Collaborating and working closely with partner agencies ensures that we are using best practice and effectively keeping contraband from entering prisons,” Ms Collins says.
