Education Minister Hekia Parata is encouraging graduates in high-demand teaching subjects to put their names forward for the 2017 Science, Technology and Maths Secondary Scholarships.

“The scholarships are a great opportunity for graduates wanting to become secondary teachers in the sciences, technology or maths (STM) subjects,” says Ms Parata.

“Science, technology and maths teachers are in high demand and we want to attract top graduates who can pass on their passion for these subjects to our secondary school students.”

Ms Parata says New Zealand has the overall right number of teachers, but not necessarily in the areas or subjects that we need them in.

“That’s why our Government is offering 100 graduates this scholarship opportunity, which could lead them to a new, exciting and challenging STM career,” she says.

“These scholarships are just one way the Government is working with principals and the education sector to identify solutions to teacher supply.

“In August I announced a $9 million package to increase the number of teachers in high-demand subjects and locations. This included funding for the STM Secondary Scholarships.

“We are also undertaking a $1 million national and international recruitment campaign focused on bringing Kiwi teachers back home.

“Together these initiatives will help to ease pressure.”

Applications for 2017 STM Scholarships close on 7 February 2017. More information, including how to apply, can be found [here](http://www.teachnz.govt.nz/scholarships/teachnz-science-technology-and-maths-STM-secondary-scholarships/).
