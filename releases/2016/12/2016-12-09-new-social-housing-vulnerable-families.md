Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says a new development in Auckland is a fantastic example of community housing providers and agencies working together to house vulnerable families.

The new 15-unit apartment block for transitional housing in Glen Eden is the result of a collaboration between Housing New Zealand and providers VisionWest, Monte Cecilia and Airedale Properties, with support from LifeWise.

Mrs Bennett, accompanied by local National MPs Alfred Ngaro and Parmjeet Parmar, attended an event at the block today to celebrate the opening of the complex which is now tenanted by families and young adults.

“This is the kind of partnership the Government encourages – the resources of Housing New Zealand together with the experience and people-centred approach of community housing providers,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The families and individuals who have moved into these homes will be given the support and help they need to transition into permanent, stable housing independence.

“VisionWest, Monte Cecilia and Airedale Properties, together with LifeWise, are excellent community housing providers and I’m delighted that they will be managing these units and providing tenants with vital support.”

Tenants will be able to access a range of services including social work support, advocacy and budgeting, counselling, parenting courses, back to work training and youth education.

“These partnerships are part of the Government’s comprehensive plan to improve the social housing stock. This site previously had just one dwelling, now it has a 15-unit block which houses some of our most vulnerable and high needs tenants,” Mrs Bennett says.
