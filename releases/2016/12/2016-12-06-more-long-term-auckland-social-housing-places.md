Changes to the way community housing providers are funded are paying further dividends as much-needed new supply comes on stream in Auckland, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

More than 50 new social housing places have been created in Papakura and Mangere through funding changes made by the Government in which community housing providers (CHPs) are able to access Income-Related Rent Subsidies.

Compass Housing Services and LinkPeople will lease new one- and two-bedroom properties from private owners for social housing for up to 10 years.

Compass has leased 36 places in Mangere and LinkPeople (formerly Keys Social Housing) has leased 20 in Papakura.

“Changes to the funding CHPs can access, which means they can supply more social housing, is paying off for vulnerable people on the Social Housing Register,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Mangere tenants of Compass Housing are moving in to fully furnished houses. One man, who came from emergency housing, told his provider he was just overwhelmed by what was being provided.

“The owner of the Compass properties is also including power and internet in the rent costs, so these tenants can be assured of modern, comfortable and warm social houses.”

Government funding through the Income-Related Rent subsidy enables CHPs to provide vital support services for those tenants most in need.

“These new social housing places are part of the Auckland 1000 Open RfP which has been extended for another 12 months. This will allow providers time to source more properties for the pipeline of permanent social housing over the next year,” Mrs Bennett says.
