Transnational criminal networks are targeting and recruiting people to act as drug couriers, by either duping or enticing them, and New Zealanders should be aware of the risks, says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

“Customs’ intelligence suggests older generations and the young and vulnerable are at risk are of being targeted by drug syndicates,” Ms Wagner says.

“This is not a new trend but we are aware of situations here and abroad that are of concern, and want to prevent New Zealanders from being preyed on.

“Drug syndicates may approach people online to recruit them to become drug couriers – either knowingly or unknowingly. They’re then provided tickets to travel and collect drugs to take to a final destination.

“These people may have invested money into the scam, and received or been promised financial or other benefits at the end of the trip. If you or someone you know has travel plans that sound too good to be true – they probably are.

“In the past 15 months, there were three interceptions of controlled drugs being imported by passengers over the age of 65.

“Customs also engages with dozens of ‘at-risk’ kiwis before departure, explicitly warning them about their suspicions and associated risks.

“Although Customs does not hold powers to stop them from departing, they do their best to make them aware of the risks and consequences of such travel.

“Drug syndicates don’t care about the welfare or wellbeing of drug couriers, who end up bearing the full-brunt of the law, whichever country they are caught in. The consequence is never worth the risk - border and enforcement agencies will act according to their laws.

“Many of Customs’ successes are based on information from concerned family or friends. If you have concerns, call 0800 4 CUSTOMS in confidence,” Ms Wagner says.
