Communications Minister Amy Adams is seeking applications from dispute resolution providers to help speed up agreements between property owners with joint access to install and maintain next generation telecommunications networks.

A dispute resolution scheme is part of the Government’s Land Access reform package which will help speed up delays in situations where the consent of multiple parties is required for access to shared property, enabling a smoother installation process for all involved.

“New Zealanders’ demand for faster, better broadband continues to grow, fuelled by the Government's rollout of Ultra-Fast Broadband,” says Ms Adams.

“Consents required to install telecommunications, where people are living in multi-dwelling units or where property owners have shared access driveways, can be time consuming as they may need to gain multiple agreements before they can proceed.”

The dispute resolution scheme will be brought in under the Telecommunications (Property Access and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, which amends the Telecommunications Act 2001, to ensure that any grievances which arise as a result of the new consenting regime are dealt with fairly and efficiently.

“Good dispute resolution is becoming a common feature of civic processes. This is a smart way to achieve a positive outcome while still respecting the rights of property owners,” says Ms Adams.

The Bill will implement a tiered consenting regime which allows fibre installation methods into one of two categories according to the impact they are considered to have on shared property.
