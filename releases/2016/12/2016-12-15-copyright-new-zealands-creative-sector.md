A report canvassing views from New Zealand’s vibrant creative sector, and the role copyright and registered designs has in their work, has been released today by Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“Our creative sector spans a range of industries and organisations and face a myriad of challenges as well as opportunities in the digital environment. This is the context in which copyright operates.

“Last year I asked officials to conduct a study of the sector – engaging with our writers, film makers, musicians, artists, fashion designers and game developers – to better understand how their works are created and distributed.

“The result is the *Copyright and Creative Sector* report. It gives us an up-to-date insight into the present practices of our creative sector and the challenges our industries are facing.

“For example, many new technologies impact directly on ownership and sharing of creative works.

“We welcome any industry feedback in the New Year, which will inform our thinking before the government decides on next steps,” says Mr Goldsmith.

The study was produced by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment in consultation with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. You can read the full report [here](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/intellectual-property/copyright/copyright-and-the-creative-sector).
