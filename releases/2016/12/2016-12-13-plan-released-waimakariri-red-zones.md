The Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee has approved the Waimakariri Residential Red Zone Recovery Plan – the first of several major future use decisions in the region.

About 100 hectares of mainly residential land in Kaiapoi, The Pines Beach and Kairaki sustained severe land damage in the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

The Crown subsequently bought almost 1000 properties in the district to allow people to move on with their lives.

After taking into account the public feedback received on the draft version– developed by the Waimakariri District Council – Mr Brownlee has finalised and approved the plan.

“I’m confident the Recovery Plan strikes the right balance between public green spaces and developments that will promote the wellbeing of Waimakariri communities and economic growth in the district,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Despite the widespread destruction caused by the earthquakes, the red zoning and Crown offer process and this Recovery Plan provide some unique opportunities to transform and future-proof the affected communities.

“The final Recovery Plan provides certainty about the land uses and the divestment of Crown-owned land to make those land uses happen. The majority of this land will be divested to the Council and some to *Te Kōhaka o Tūhaitara* Trust.

“Where Crown-owned land is divested to the Council, or to the Trust, there are some conditions in place.

“These include ensuring land uses in the Recovery Plan are implemented and that financial return is maximised wherever possible, with the Crown to receive a share of any future net financial returns.

“The Council is best placed to own and manage the land and implement the land uses in a coordinated and cost effective way.

“In the coming months, Land Information New Zealand will work to divest 991 Crown-owned red zone properties in the Waimakariri district.

“I would like to thank the Waimakariri District Council for its hard work in the Recovery Plan process and for ensuring there was comprehensive public participation throughout.

“The Council’s ongoing commitment to the regeneration of the Waimakariri district will help guarantee the long-term success of the land uses,” Mr Brownlee says.

Waimakariri MP Matthew Doocey says the future land uses stemmed from ideas put forward by the community.

“The Minister’s endorsement, following a time of exciting growth and progress for our district, reinforces we were heard.

“With its vibrant town centre, Kaiapoi is a destination of choice and we can look forward to some great new facilities and spaces to cement the town’s future direction and reputation as a great place to live,” Mr Doocey says.

The Plan will be gazetted on Thursday and the Waimakariri District Council will have hard copies available next week.
