Duty Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga says the New Zealand Government strongly condemns North Korea’s claimed underground nuclear test today.

“New Zealand views North Korea’s actions as highly provocative and irresponsible,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

This is the fourth nuclear test conducted by North Korea since 2006.  North Korea claims the test was a hydrogen device.

“The test would run contrary to the recent efforts at dialogue on the Korean peninsula and flies in the face of the international community’s calls for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapon programmes and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

“This action also flouts UN Security Council resolutions which have demanded that North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests.

“The New Zealand government strongly urges North Korea to cease its provocative behaviour and commit to not developing, testing or possessing nuclear weapons.”

An emergency UN Security Council meeting is expected to take place early tomorrow morning NZ time.

“New Zealand will work with other Security Council members to make sure there is a strong response to this latest provocation,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
