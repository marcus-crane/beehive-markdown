Around 100 young people who have overcome significant challenges have been selected for the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme (PMYP) and are participating in the programme this week.

Youth Minister Nikki Kaye says the programme, personally spear headed by the Prime Minister, held annually since 2010, is a great opportunity for the young people, aged 14-17, from Auckland, to be recognised for their personal achievements and community contributions.

“These young people have each faced and overcome significant challenges in their lives – including the death of more than one immediate family member, mental health issues, truancy, and offending. They have been nominated to attend the programme by people who have worked with them closely and know them well.

“This could have been their school teacher, principal, youth or social worker, Police Youth Aid officer, or other community members.

The Turn Your Life Around (TYLA) Youth Development Trust, BlueLight and The Village Trust are the key organisations supporting the young people through this programme.

“This week is about rewarding young people and also investing in their personal development. They will be participating in activities such as white water rafting in Waitomo, a ‘market to table’ chef’s experience, and visits to large New Zealand companies.

“The PMYP will involve a Celebration Dinner where the young people will receive their certificates. This year we are very pleased to have Parris Goebel as the guest speaker.

Parris Goebel won Young New Zealander of the Year in 2014, recognising her leadership at her Palace Dance Studio in South Auckland and her commitment to young people. Parris has gone on to be an internationally recognised and sought after choreographer and dancer, recently collaborating with Jennifer Lopez and Justin Bieber.

“This week is an important time to recognise and celebrate this group of 100 young New Zealanders who despite incredible challenges are doing very well. This programme is all about investing in them to do even better.”
