Ministers Bill English and Simon Bridges have announced that the proposed alternative Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue) flag will fly alongside the current New Zealand flag on the Auckland Harbour Bridge from Friday 22 January.

The Auckland Harbour Bridge will be the latest in over 250 sites around the country that have the alternative flag on-loan from the Flag Consideration Project to display beside the current flag, Deputy Prime Minister Bill English says.

“Having the two flags flying side by side around New Zealand will help people compare the designs before making a decision in the final flag referendum, which runs from 3 March to 24 March.”

Transport Minister Simon Bridges says he approved the request from the Flag Consideration Project to fly the alternative flag on the Auckland Harbour Bridge alongside the current flag from 22 January to 24 March.

“The proposed alternative flag will be flown alongside the current flag each day on the Auckland Harbour Bridge until the end of the referendum period, except for Waitangi Day when the current flag will be flown alongside the Tino Rangatiratanga flag.”
