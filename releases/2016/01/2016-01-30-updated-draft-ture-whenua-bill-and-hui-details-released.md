Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has released an updated draft of Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill and details around further consultation hui.

“I’m pleased that significant changes have been made to the Bill which reflect the written submissions and feedback from nationwide hui received last year. We listened to the people and acted on their kōrero,” says Mr Flavell.

Some of the key changes to the updated draft Bill are:

- Removing the controversial kaiwhakarite proposal
- Giving existing Māori trusts and incorporations the option to continue operating as the same entity so they don’t have to go through the cost of establishing a new one
- Ensuring greater safeguards are in place to retain the status of Māori freehold land.

Mr Flavell reiterated that reform of Te Ture Whenua Māori has always been about two things: Making it easier for Māori land owners to make their own decisions about how their land is governed and used, and protecting the status of Māori land as a taonga tuku iho.

The latest draft of the Bill can be viewed on the TPK website [here](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/a-matou-kaupapa/crown-iwi-hapu-whanau-maori-relations/consultation/review-of-te-ture-whenua-maori-act-1993).

“When you read the Bill you will see the reforms make decision-making by land owners easier and more efficient. That is mana motuhake in action.”

“The safeguards around retaining Māori freehold land have been strengthened and the threshold for selling Māori land remains the same,” he says.

A series of information hui to explain the changes will be held around the country in February.

Mr Flavell says these meetings will explain the changes to the draft Bill and provide the most up-to-date information on Whenua Māori reform.

“We’ve done a lot of groundwork to improve the law, services and opportunities for Māori land owners. These hui will give us the opportunity to explain the work we’ve done to date and what the plans are for the future,” he says.

Details of the hui can be found [here](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/a-matou-kaupapa/crown-iwi-hapu-whanau-maori-relations/consultation/review-of-te-ture-whenua-maori-act-1993).

The Ture Whenua Māori Bill will be introduced into Parliament in March this year.
