Transport Minister Simon Bridges says the launch of a new international air service out of Wellington is a significant development for Wellington Airport.

Singapore Airlines announced the new service today which will operate between Wellington and Singapore, via Canberra, four times a week.

“This new service opens up two new international connections and creates the first ever, non-stop connection between New Zealand and Canberra and the first direct service (operated with a single flight-number) between Wellington and Singapore,” Mr Bridges says.

“The new service will have significant benefits for the Wellington economy and the tourism sector with it expected to generate $95 million in visitor expenditure and add around $44 million to the national economy.”

Flights will begin operating in September.
