Kiwis’ use of government generated data is growing, says Land Information Minister Louise Upston.

New figures show another 7,650 users registered to download free government data from the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Data Service in 2015, boosting the service’s total number of registered users to more than 20,000.

“Kiwis have used the LINZ Data Service to do important work and develop great products - monitoring pests that might harm our horticultural industries, planning landscape gardens, and creating map apps. With the number of users continuing to rise, I’m excited to see what people come up with next,” says Ms Upston.

“Data available on the service includes the same data used by LINZ for making maps and charts, as well as information about property boundaries, place names, and aerial imagery.”

Since its launch in 2011, the LINZ Data Service (www.data.linz.govt.nz) has gone from strength to strength. It has won three international awards and a recent customer survey found that more than half of those surveyed depend on the service, with a further 20 percent describing it as critical to the success of their business.
