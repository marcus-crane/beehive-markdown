Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner congratulates those honoured for services to the disability community in the New Year’s Honours.

“Throughout New Zealand, there are thousands of people who work tirelessly to serve and help the disability community. I would like to congratulate those who have been recognised in the New Year’s Honours,” Ms Wagner says.

“People who contribute to the disability community often have first-hand experience with disabilities and include family members, community workers, caregivers and business owners.

This year’s recipients include:

**ONZM**

Mrs Dianne Glenn, JP, for services to disabled women and the environment.

**MNZM**

Mr Kevin Blogg, for services to people with disabilities.

Mr Philip Blundell, for services to people with disabilities and the community.

Mr Gary Endacott, for services to people with disabilities.

Ms Jan Moss, for services to the care of disabled people.

“Each of these recipients have made an outstanding contribution to disabled people and their communities and I am sure that their remarkable work will serve as an inspiration to others,” Ms Wagner says.
