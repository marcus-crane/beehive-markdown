Education Minister Hekia Parata, together with Parliamentary Under-Secretary David Seymour, has terminated the agreement under which the Ngā Parirau Mātauranga Charitable Trust runs a partnership school at Whangaruru in Northland.

Ms Parata informed the trust of her decision on Tuesday.

“Significant progress has been made in addressing the governance and management issues that caused me to issue the Trust with a performance notice in February.

“However, after considering the Trust's response to my proposal to terminate the agreement, I have concluded that the educational challenges facing the school are too great to be overcome.”

Among those challenges are, the kura’s:

- heavy reliance on third parties to take it forward
- lack of internal capability
- the difficulty of attracting suitably qualified teaching staff to Whangaruru; and
- concerns over whether a viable student base exists for the kura

Ms Parata says her decision is not a reflection on the Trust Board’s efforts or capabilities.

“The current Trust Board has worked hard, been extremely professional and acted in the best interests of the kura’s students throughout.”

The termination will take effect on March 7. The Ministry of Education is working with the Trust Board, students and whānau to help the students to transition to other education options.
