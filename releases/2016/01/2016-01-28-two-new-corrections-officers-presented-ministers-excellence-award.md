Corrections Minister Judith Collins presented the Minister’s Excellence Award to two newly graduated Corrections Officers today.

Ms Collins established the Minister’s Excellence Award in 2009 during her previous term as Minister of Corrections to recognise newly graduated Corrections Officers who have shown qualities of leadership, professionalism and all-round excellence.

The Minister attended the Corrections Officer Development Pathway graduation at Corrections’ National Office today, where 24 new officers graduated.

“Corrections Officers perform one of the most important roles in our society,” says Ms Collins.

“They are charged with keeping the public safe from some of our most dangerous and difficult people and often their work goes unrecognized.”

The recipients of the Award are Kresha Ross from Arohata Prison and Ingrid Bunney from Spring Hill Corrections Facility.

“These new Corrections Officers excelled in their assessments and gave their all to any task they were given. I’m confident that they, and all the new graduates, will carry out their duties with integrity, initiative, courage, common sense and professionalism,” says Ms Collins.

The new graduates will work at Auckland, Auckland Women’s, Spring Hill, Waikeria, Hawke’s Bay, Arohata, Rimutaka, Christchurch and Invercargill Prisons.
