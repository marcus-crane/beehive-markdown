Prime Minister John Key today announced funding of up to $115 million to accelerate regionally significant roading projects in Taranaki, Gisborne and  Marlborough, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The Government announced its Accelerated Regional Roading Programme in 2014 to speed up the delivery of transport projects considered important to regions.

A number of projects are already underway and today the Government has announced it’s accelerating a further four projects. These are:

- Awakino Tunnel bypass (Taranaki, $9-15m)
- Mt Messenger bypass (Taranaki, $80-90m)
- Motu bridge replacement (East Coast / Gisborne, $3-5m)
- Opawa bridge replacement (Marlborough / Blenheim, $14-17.5m)

“The two largest of these – the bypasses of Mt Messenger and the Awakino Gorge Tunnel in Taranaki – are new projects,” Mr Bridges says.

“They were not envisaged when the regional roading package was announced two years ago.

“This northern gateway into Taranaki is a key freight link with the Waikato, and has become increasingly unsafe, prone to unpredictable travel times and periodic closures,” Mr Bridges says.

“Improving the safety and reliability of this road is a real priority for the Government. The bypasses and other planned safety improvements will ensure this important stretch of road supports the ongoing economic growth of Taranaki.”

The Motu bridge, the only one-lane bridge on State Highway 2 between Gisborne and Opotiki, now requires ongoing maintenance.

“Currently, when the bridge is closed commuters are forced to travel an extra two hours via the East Cape along State Highway 5, causing delays for freight and the local farming community,” Mr Bridges says.

“The new two-lane bridge will improve safety and provide more predictable and reliable travel times. This will strengthen the region’s primary link with the Bay of Plenty and help boost economic growth and productivity on the East Coast.

The existing Opawa bridge on State Highway 1 in Marlborough is an important gateway to Blenheim but is narrow resulting in delays for heavy vehicles and campervans.

“The new Opawa bridge will be wider and more durable which will see traffic flow more freely, resulting in fewer delays and road closures,” Mr Bridges says.

“The existing bridge will remain in place and be used for improved cycle and pedestrian routes”.

There are three tranches to the Government’s Accelerated Regional Roading Programme.

The five projects under tranche one are either finished or underway. Those are:

- Kawarau Falls Bridge (Otago / Queenstown)
- Mingha Bluff to Rough Creek realignment (Canterbury)
- Akerama Curves Realignment and Passing Lane (Northland)
- State Highway 35 Slow Vehicle Bays (East Coast / Gisborne)
- Normanby Overbridge Realignment (Taranaki).

Last year the Government confirmed the first four projects under tranche two of the package. These are:

- the Whirokino Trestle Bridge replacement (Horowhenua)
- the Taramakau Road/Rail Bridge replacement (West Coast)
- Loop Road North to Smeatons Hill safety improvements (Northland)
- Mt Messenger and Awakino Gorge corridor safety improvements (Taranaki).

Today’s announcement comprises the final four projects under tranche two.
