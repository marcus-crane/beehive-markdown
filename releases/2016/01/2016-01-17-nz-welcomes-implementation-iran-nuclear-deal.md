Duty Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed the next stage in the historic nuclear deal between Iran, the Five Permanent (P5) members of the United Nations Security Council, and Germany.

“The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has now verified Iranian compliance with the deal and this will clear the way for the lifting of UN sanctions against Iran,” Ms Kaye says.

“New Zealand hopes this agreement can form the basis for building trust, opening a new chapter of cooperation in the Middle East.

“New Zealand has now started the domestic process for removing the UN sanctions, which we hope will be completed in February.  This will include removing the current requirement for those trading with Iran to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Consistent with the terms of the deal, some newly imposed restrictions, including restrictions regarding the transfer of sensitive goods, will apply.

“Iran was previously New Zealand’s fifth largest export market. We hope that the lifting of UN sanctions we enable us to build a stronger trade and economic relationship with Iran,” Ms Kaye says.
