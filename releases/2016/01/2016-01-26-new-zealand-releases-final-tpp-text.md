Trade Minister Todd McClay today announced that New Zealand has released the legally verified TPP text, in its capacity as Depositary of the Agreement. 

“This is the final version of the Agreement, which will be signed by TPP countries in February. New Zealand looks forward to hosting this important event,” says Mr McClay. 

New Zealand released an earlier version of the text on 5 November 2015.

“As Depositary, New Zealand will also release French and Spanish versions of the text.”

Legal verification is the final step in a treaty negotiation prior to signature, and involves the treaty text being reviewed by the Parties’ legal counsel to ensure it is consistent.

Immediately after signature the Government will submit the text of TPP to Parliament, along with the National Interest Analysis, for treaty examination. 

After that, the legislative changes required to implement TPP will go through normal Parliamentary procedures, including select committee scrutiny.

The legally verified text is available at [www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/text.](http://www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/text)
