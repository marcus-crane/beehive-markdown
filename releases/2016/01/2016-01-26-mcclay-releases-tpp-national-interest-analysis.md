Trade Minister Todd McClay today announced the early release of the National Interest Analysis (NIA) for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). 

“This document comprehensively analyses what TPP means for New Zealand, across the entire Agreement,” says Mr McClay.

“It finds that entering TPP would be in New Zealand’s national interest, adding an estimated $2.7 billion to GDP by 2030.”

The Government will submit the NIA, together with the text of the agreement, to Parliament following signature of TPP for Parliamentary treaty examination. 

“New Zealand has published an unprecedented amount of information on TPP,” says Mr McClay.

This includes 10 fact sheets released following the conclusion of negotiations on 5 October. The TPP text was first made public on 5 November, together with additional information on the estimated economic benefit and details of potential costs. 

“The Government will also be running roadshows for the public to learn more about TPP, and to help businesses prepare for the economic opportunities will bring,” says Mr McClay.  

The TPP National Interest Assessment and the text of the agreement are available at [www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz](http://www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/).
