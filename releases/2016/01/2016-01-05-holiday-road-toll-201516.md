Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is urging drivers to remain focussed and vigilant as they head home these holidays.

The provisional holiday road toll for 2015/16 is 12. 

“While it’s encouraging to see the holiday road toll is lower than last year’s 16, 12 deaths is still 12 too many,” Mr Foss says.

“My deepest sympathies go out to anyone who lost a friend or loved one this holiday season.

“Many people are still on holiday and still driving long distances on unfamiliar roads.  By taking a little extra care, we give ourselves and our families the best chance of making it home safe and sound.

“We all know what we need to do: avoid alcohol, drive to the conditions, wear a safety belt and make sure children are appropriately buckled in.”

**Notes for editors:**

The length of the official Christmas/New Year holiday period varies depending on where the statutory holidays fall in relation to the weekend. The 2015/16 holiday period was 11.6 days.
