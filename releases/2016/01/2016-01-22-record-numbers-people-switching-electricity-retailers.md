Last year saw the highest number of people switch electricity retailers since 2011, says Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges.

In 2015, 419,000 consumers switched providers, compared to 388,000 in 2011 when the ‘What’s My Number’ campaign began, resulting in potential savings of more than $24 million last year.

More than 1.8 million consumers have switched providers since 2011, with total estimated savings valued at $207 million.

“‘What’s My Number’ is continuing to provide increasing numbers of consumers with the choice to shop around for the best deal. I would encourage anyone to check it out to see if they can get a better deal on their power,” Mr Bridges said.

Mr Bridges says the Government is committed to a competitive electricity market that empowers consumers and keeps downward pressure on power prices.

“In recent years, there has been a large increase in the number of electricity retailers entering the market, with 22 independent retailers supplying consumers through 33 brands as at December 2015. Coupled with the success of websites like ‘What’s My Number’, this is translating into greater choice and record number of consumer switches.”

Mr Bridges says further steps are being taken to make it easier for customers to get a better deal. From 1 February 2016, consumers and their agents will be able to access more information about their electricity use and the plans offered by retailers.

“Access to a fuller picture of electricity data will allow consumers to make informed decisions and compare prices more effectively,” Mr Bridges says.
