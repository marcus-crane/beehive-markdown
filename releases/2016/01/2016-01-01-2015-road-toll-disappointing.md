The provisional road toll for 2015 is 321, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“It’s incredibly sad and disappointing to have lost so many lives on our roads in 2015.  The road toll is not just a number — every figure represents not only the life lost but also grieving families, friends and communities,” Mr Foss says.

“While it’s too early to say why the toll increased in 2015, data from 2012-2014 shows drivers continue to make the same mistakes.”

The common contributing factors to fatal and serious injury road crashes include:

- Speeding: 30 per cent
- Alcohol/drugs: 29 per cent
- Unrestrained occupants: 20 per cent
- Driver distraction: 8 per cent

“Long-term, the number of people killed on our roads is reducing, dropping by over a third (36 per cent) between 2000 and 2014,” Mr Foss says.

“The Government is committed to making New Zealand roads safer and reducing the number of people killed and injured in crashes.

“Road users have a role to play too. I urge all drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians to be vigilant and considerate while travelling these holidays.”
