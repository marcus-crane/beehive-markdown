Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says SmartGate reached a new record during its busiest holiday period with 100,941 passengers using it in the second week of January.

“This is the highest number of passengers to use SmartGate in one week, since it was introduced in 2009. It’s great to see travellers embracing the technology,” Ms Wagner says.

“I was pleased to open the first of the new next-generation SmartGates at Auckland International Airport last November, following the Government’s $6.6 million capital funding for SmartGate expansion.

“The new Gates are a welcome addition during the busy holiday season, as the process is faster, more intuitive and eliminates the need for the ticket and kiosk.

“Using the information available in ePassports and facial recognition technology to do customs and immigration checks allows Customs to focus on high-risk travellers while letting low-risk people clear the border easily.

“More SmartGates will be installed in Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown this year to manage growth in traveller volumes while ensuring New Zealand’s border processing systems continue to be world-class,” Ms Wagner says.
