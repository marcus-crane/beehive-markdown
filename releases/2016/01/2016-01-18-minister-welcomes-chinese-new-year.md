Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says he is looking forward to celebrating Chinese New Year with communities around the country.

“2016 is the Year of the Monkey, the ninth animal on the Chinese zodiac calendar. New Zealand’s Asian communities, and the wider community, look forward to the lunar new year with much excitement,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“It is a time for renewal, for families to come together and for celebration.”

Although the Chinese New Year officially falls on February 8, many celebrations in New Zealand are being held early to avoid clashing with Waitangi Day weekend and Auckland Anniversary.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will attend the Auckland Chinese Community Centre celebration in Auckland this weekend, to which up to 30,000 people are expected.

“I am looking forward to the colour, the culture, the food and, of course, the traditional dragon dance,” he said.

“I hope people from all of our diverse communities will join with our Chinese and other Asian citizens in celebrating this significant event in the lunar calendar.”

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Auckland Chinese Community Centre event.
