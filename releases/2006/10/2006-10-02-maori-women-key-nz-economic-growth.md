Mâori women have played a significant role in New Zealand's strong economic growth in recent years, entering the workforce in record numbers and helping lift productivity, Minister for Women’s Affairs Lianne Dalziel says.

"Women have been a driving force in the renaissance of Mâori language, art, culture and commercial endeavour. It was Mâori women who set up the Kohanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa and Matua Whângai programmes and who have taken an increasing and vital role in iwi authorities, Mâori trust boards, urban Mâori authorities, and businesses," Lianne Dalziel told delegates at the annual  
[Mâori Women’s Welfare League (MWWL)](http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WomensOrganisations/MaoriWomensWelfareLeague/en) conference at Turangawaewae today.

Lianne Dalziel, who is also Commerce Minister and Minister for Small Business, said research showed that a high proportion of Maori women go into business for the opportunities it offers, rather than just out of necessity. Mâori were almost twice as likely as the general population to expect to launch a new business in the next three years, she said.

"Mâori were ranked very highly for business optimism, for the use of the latest technology and for expectations of job creation.

"This supports my strong impression that there are legions of confident, talented Mâori women out there who are prepared to take risks to realise their vision. I doubt there has been a better time to be young, talented, female and Mâori."

Between 1994 and 2004 the number of Mâori women in the labour force grew 41 percent, from 68,000 to 96,000 and since 1991 Mâori female self-employment has increased at double the rate of that of Mâori men. In the same period the unemployment rate for Mâori women was nearly halved, from 19 per cent to 10 per cent, and has since fallen further – to under nine per cent. But there is still some way to go, she said.

"It's good that Mâori women's unemployment has fallen so much, but it is still well above that of both non-Mâori women and non-Mâori and Mâori men."

The government hoped to see more Mâori women unlocking their talents and making use of opportunities such as those afforded by the [Modern Apprenticeship Scheme](http://www.neon.org.nz/newsarchive/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=Middle/focusModuleID=3494/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl), backed by additional funding over four years of more than $34 million announced in the last Budget, Lianne Dalziel said.
