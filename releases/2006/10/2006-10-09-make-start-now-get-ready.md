Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker today urged New Zealanders to treat Disaster Reduction Week as a call to action to prepare for the impacts of a disaster or emergency.

“Recent disasters and emergencies in New Zealand and around the world have highlighted the need to look after ourselves and our families by preparing for the unexpected", said Rick Barker.

“It is easy to put preparedness off until tomorrow but unfortunately that maybe too late”.

To help raise public awareness a series of activities are planned for Disaster Awareness Week (8-14 October). Disaster Awareness Week coincides with the United Nations’ International Disaster Reduction Day on 11 October.

Rick Barker will be helping the Wellington Civil Defence Emergency Management Group, in conjunction with Red Cross, Child Youth and Family, Regional Health, Emergency Services and the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management raise awareness at the Wellington Railway Station on Wednesday.

“I encourage all New Zealanders to ensure they have the essential emergency survival items to cope at home for three days or more, and a Getaway Kit should you need to evacuate or leave your home or workplace in a hurry,” says Rick Barker.
