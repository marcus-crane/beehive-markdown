National won't truly commit to policies to combat climate change as long as Don Brash is their leader, Climate Change Minister David Parker said today.

"On Morning Report this morning, we heard Don Brash still equivocating about whether climate change is really a consequence of human activity. That's despite the enormous weight of evidence that it is, and a new report out on the huge cost to the world of not acting."

"National may be trying to greenwash their image with new climate change policies, but it's clear their leader is not convinced, and is being dragged along by his more enlightened colleagues."

"What's most ironic is that Brash also tried to criticise the government for not going ahead with the carbon tax and the methane tax – when it was National's opposition that helped stall those policies."

"Let's hope they are more forward-thinking in the future, but I have my doubts, with Brash in charge."
