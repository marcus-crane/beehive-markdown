Prime Minister Helen Clark today named the boat which will race for Emirates Team New Zealand at next year’s America’s Cup in Spain.

The new boat was officially named ‘New Zealand’ during a ceremony at Auckland’s Viaduct Harbour this evening.

“New Zealand has fashioned a superb record in the America’s Cup going back to our first participation in Fremantle in 1987,” Helen Clark said.

“In 1995, under Sir Peter Blake, Team New Zealand won the Cup in San Diego, leading to the two memorable defences in Auckland. The past decade has shown that New Zealand has the talent and expertise to win the toughest competition in international yachting.

“Winning the America’s Cup requires exceptional sailing skills and yachting design. Equally important, however, is exceptional leadership, management, and teamwork. Team New Zealand has demonstrated over the past 11 years that it can excel in all these facets.

“I wish the team all the best for the year ahead. They have the support of all New Zealanders as they work to bring the America’s Cup back to Auckland and New Zealand.”

Helen Clark said competing in the America’s Cup had significant economic potential for New Zealand, and government is investing in Emirates Team New Zealand to leverage off next year’s challenge in Spain.

“Tourism New Zealand and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise are strategic partners to the team. They will be using the regattas as a chance to raise New Zealand’s tourism and business profile in Europe and the Middle East.

“Part of Emirates Team New Zealand base at Valencia has been transformed into a New Zealand themed area where influential business contacts in Europe will be hosted during next year’s racing.

“It’s an excellent opportunity to impress sophisticated European audiences with New Zealand’s fine food, wine, technical expertise, and innovation, ensuring that not only our sporting profile is raised in Europe, but our overall national brand as well,” Helen Clark said.
