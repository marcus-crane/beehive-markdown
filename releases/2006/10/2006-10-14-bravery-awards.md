Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated the 15 new recipients of New Zealand Bravery Awards announced by the Governor-General.

"These Bravery Awards recognise New Zealanders who have displayed selfless courage in saving or attempting to save the lives of their fellow human beings," Helen Clark said.

"I am very pleased to note that none of the recipients announced today lost their own lives in performing these deeds of bravery.

The list of awards include five New Zealand Bravery Decorations and ten New Zealand Bravery Medals.

"The recipients include a 62 year old woman, four serving Police officers, a Police recruit and five current or former members of the New Zealand Defence Force.

"The acts of bravery they performed took place in a wide geographic area ranging from the Solomon Islands to Sydney and Auckland to Dunedin.

"The last Bravery awards were announced on the 29th of January last year. Since their institution in 1999, a total of 72 Bravery and 7 Gallantry awards have been made.

"The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, will formally present the awards at investitures to be held in March and April next year," Helen Clark said.

Note: Any person can make nominations for a New Zealand Bravery Award. The nominations are considered by an expert panel which then makes recommendations. These recommendations go to the Queen who confers the honours. For more information: www.honours.govt.nz
