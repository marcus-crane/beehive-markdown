Disarmament and Arms Control Minister, Phil Goff, was accompanied at Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum by two survivors of the nuclear blast, Mr Katsuji Yoshida and Ms Sachiko Yasui.

“Mr Yoshida is the only known survivor from within the one kilometre radius of the blast epicentre. Thirteen years old at the time, he suffered severe burns to his face and neck, but miraculously survived,“ Mr Goff said.

“Ms Yasui was six years old at the time and a little further distant from the blast. Twenty three of her family and relatives were killed, her siblings dying one after the other in 30 days following the explosion from radiation.

Both are now active members of the Nagasaki Foundation for the Promotion of Peace.

Meeting them and hearing from them their personal experiences was extraordinarily moving and a poignant reminder of the costs of war. Nuclear missiles today are on average 20 times more powerful that the 21 kiloton bomb exploded over Nagasaki.

Humankind now has the ability for the first time in history to destroy humanity.

The lessons we take from Nagasaki and Hiroshima are that we must renew our efforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. The costs of any future nuclear conflict would be unthinkable,” Mr Goff said.
