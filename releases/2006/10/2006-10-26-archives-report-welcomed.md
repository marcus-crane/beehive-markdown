Archives Minister Judith Tizard today welcomed a report reviewing Archives New Zealand's systems and processes for managing Ministers' papers.

The review follows the accidental release by Archives New Zealand earlier this year of security classified documents held among David Lange's papers.

"I welcome this report and look forward to further consideration of the recommendations made," says Judith Tizard.

"A Working Group is being established to consider some of the issues raised and we will also be seeking responses from other interested parties. I'll be discussing this feedback with Archives New Zealand to determine what changes need to be made to ensure good management and good access to these important records."
