The link here is to a 13 October 2006 Cabinet Paper advising why legislation is necessary to validate expenses incurred without or outside appropriation are in breach of section 4 of the Public Finance Act 1989.

The only legal remedy for such a breach is for the expenses to be validated by an Act of Parliament.
