A significant new international report on the impact climate change will have on the world's economy, reinforces the need to take comprehensive action, Climate Change Minister David Parker said today.

The [report](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm), by former World Bank chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern, warns of the devastating cost to the globe of failing to address climate change.

"This authoritative report provides further proof of the clear economic imperative to act on climate change. The world must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we are to preserve the way of life we enjoy," David Parker said.

"Although this report contains dire warnings, it also clears the way for governments to act to tackle climate change, knowing that the benefits of their actions far outweigh the costs."

"As the Prime Minister has already said, it's time to be bold in this area, and for New Zealand to aim to lead the world, by being truly sustainable."

"I look forward to further examining the detail of this report, and its implications for New Zealand," David Parker said.
