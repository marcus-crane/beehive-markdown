Minister of Biosecurity and Wigram MP, Jim Anderton opened the new premises of Fast Cargo International in Woolston and unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion. He said that the success was a tribute to the owners and the thirty staff in the company around New Zealand as well as the rapid growth of trade.

"Everyone associated with this firm is contributing to New Zealand's economy. You are part of the trade we need with the world to improve and enjoy our first-world way of life. Freight is expanding quickly in New Zealand," Jim Anderton said at the opening.

"It's a pleasure to see how this business has developed. It started out only in 1994 and in Christchurch in 1998, when it had just one staff member in rented office space. When it moved in 2004 into premises with eight thousand square feet of space I'm sure visitors thought you must have had a contract with the Canterbury rugby union to store the trophy cabinets. But with this move adding another ten thousand square feet, it's looking more like the All Blacks' trophy cabinet.

"I'm the Minister of Biosecurity – among other portfolios and it is my responsibility to make sure that as our trade expands, we are smart about how we keep out pests and other threats to our primary industries. In being vigilant at the border we are heavily dependent on freight forwarding companies working alongside MAF and Biosecurity New Zealand. It's a strong relationship; it needs to be because the biosecurity threats we face are real.

"All New Zealanders have a role to play in keeping us as free of incursions as possible. We all depend on our biosecurity. The Labour-Progressive Government is committed to working in partnership with the freight industry and will provide as much protection as possible with the resources we have," Jim Anderton said in Woolston. "And I wish Fast Cargo International all the best for their future endeavours."
