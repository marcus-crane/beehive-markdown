An independent review showing significant progress has been made towards achieving the ten goals of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy has been welcomed by Minister for Senior Citizens, Ruth Dyson.

"I am pleased to see the review by the New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing (NZiRA) shows very good progress is being achieved by government agencies in implementing the Strategy", said Ruth Dyson.

The New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy was launched in 2001, and sets out the Labour-led government’s vision for a society where people can age positively, where older people are highly valued, and where they have continuing opportunities for participation. The Strategy has ten positive ageing goals to support this vision.

The positive ageing goals were developed through nationwide consultation with older people. They reflect the priority issues that were identified to improve opportunities for older people so they are able to participate in their communities in ways that they choose.

"Since the launch of the Strategy central government agencies have worked hard to develop policies and programmes, to improve the lives of older people in New Zealand. There has also been increasing interest from local government authorities in the Positive Ageing Strategy.

"I am looking forward to seeing even greater progress made in ensuring that all older New Zealanders are able to have full and productive lives as they age," said Ruth Dyson.
