Courts Minister Rick Barker visited the construction site of the new Greymouth Courthouse today.

"The existing courthouse was built in 1908 and no longer meets the areas requirements", said Rick Barker.

"In Budget 2004 the Government allocated $4.5 million to build a new courthouse for Greymouth. Construction began in December last year and I'm pleased to say that the court is expected to be completed on time and within budget.

"The new Courthouse should be open for business by mid January next year.

"The Courthouse has been built to meet the needs of the community now and in the future. It will include two main courtrooms, one of which is jury capable, a hearing room for mediation and tribunals, multiple interview rooms, dedicated lawyer space, and increased public space

"In terms of technology, the courthouse is cutting edge. Video conferencing facilities are being installed which will allow more cases to be heard, and state of the art security systems will result in major security improvements.

"Massive underinvestment by the National Party in the 1990s resulted in many of our courts being badly neglected. We've taken on the challenge of getting it right and have embarked on this country's largest court building programme in recent history.

"It is great to be able to see first hand the results from our investment," said Rick Barker.
