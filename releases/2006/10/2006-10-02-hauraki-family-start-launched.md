Intensive support will now be available to 91 local families with young children from today, following the launch of the government's Family Start programme in Hauraki.

The Hauraki Maori Trust Board and Te Korowai Hauora O Hauraki will oversee the delivery of the programme, launched by Youth Affairs Minister and Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta at Waihi Community Marae today.

"It gives me great pleasure to launch the Family Start programme in Hauraki, which reflects the government's commitment to providing comprehensive early intervention services and support to families who most need it," Nanaia Mahuta said. "I believe that the abundant spirit, strength, and commitment of the Hauraki community will help ensure the success of the Family Start here."

Key to the programme are Family Start family/whanau workers, who provide intensive home visits to families and children who most need it. They help families to set and achieve their own goals, act as a service advocate if necessary, and ensure that services for the family are targeted and well co-ordinated.

Nanaia Mahuta said that Family Start was one of the government's most successful early intervention services, along with well-known initiatives like SKIP, Strengthening Families, and Well Child.

"The Hauraki Maori Trust Board and Te Korowai Hauora O Hauraki are the ideal organisations to deliver Family Start in Hauraki, with a very strong record of delivering health and wellbeing services to the local community."

An extension to Family Start was part of the government's latest early intervention initiative, Early Years, announced last month. Early Years will also establish new service hubs in high-need areas, along with teen parent co-ordinators in areas with high rates of teenage pregnancy, and a trial Roots of Empathy programme in schools.

"Our goal is to make sure that every family gets the services they need, when they need them," Nanaia Mahuta said. "Early Years is about extending both the reach and the integration of early intervention services like Family Start."
