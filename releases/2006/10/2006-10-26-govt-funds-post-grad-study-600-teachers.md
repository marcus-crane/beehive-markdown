In a move to further lift the quality of mathematics teaching, the government will fund tertiary fees for 600 primary teachers from next year, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"This is the first stage in a scheme the government is looking to extend across other priority areas of the curriculum," Steve Maharey said.

"It will ensure teachers have more opportunities to enhance their knowledge and expertise in important subject areas, including English, Science, Social Studies and Technology.

"The government recognises that the most important factor in lifting student achievement is effective teaching, backed up by good professional development."

Steve Maharey says the scheme will build on the results of numeracy and literacy professional development projects running in schools around the country.

"These projects have been hugely successful in lifting standards for all students.  
Our approach is about supporting teachers to enhance their skills and develop programmes that meet the diverse needs of their students.

"While New Zealand's highest achievers in mathematics are comparable with the best in the world, we need to be working harder to lift standards for all students.

"Since 2000 more than 21,000 primary and intermediate teachers have taken part in the numeracy project and 1,200 have taken part in similar literacy projects.

"Evaluations of these projects have shown major improvements across all of the schools involved. The highest improvement has been among students that were previously the lowest achievers, and there has been a lift in achievement across Maori and Pacific students."
