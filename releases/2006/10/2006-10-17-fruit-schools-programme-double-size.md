The Labour-led government's Fruit in Schools programme will be extended to 154 new primary schools as the government invests $4.4 million to more than double the programme's size, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

[Fruit in Schools](http://www.moh.govt.nz/fruitinschools) was [launched](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F22376) last year. Participating schools receive free fruit for three years as an incentive for schools to commit to policies encouraging healthy eating and physical activity.

This third phase of the project will be funded out of the four year, [$76 million campaign to fight obesity](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25801) announced in Budget 2006.

"Improving childhood nutrition is one of the most important things we can do to improve the overall health of New Zealand families," Pete Hodgson said.

"There's a growing sense of urgency around the need to improve nutrition and encourage kids to get active and the government is keen to play our part.

"The Fruit in Schools initiative has been a huge success since its inception and the latest rollout means every district health board around the country is now on board with the initiative.

"From today, school children at 268 schools – including all decile 1 schools – will be eating apples and other export-quality fruits which will be delivered to schools daily."

The [evaluation of the Fruit in Schools initiative early this year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26556) showed that it is well supported by participating schools and that it has also proven to be an effective way of increasing children's awareness of healthy living.

"Participating teachers are telling us concentration levels and the behaviour of children has improved rapidly since the Fruit in Schools programme began. One school has even had fewer suspensions, which they say is due to improved behaviour."

The Fruit in Schools extension is being implemented alongside the government's recently announced [Mission On package](http://www.sparc.org.nz/news/mission-on) to promote nutrition and increased physical activity. Mission On includes initiatives to:

- improve the quality of food served in schools,
- reduce children's exposure to advertising of unhealthy food and
- promote physical activity.
