Minister of Agriculture and Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Jim Anderton was presenting the awards today to agricultural and equine students at the National Training Academy (NTA). He said he was pleased that the students had completed their year-long courses, in a range of subjects that will equip them for a career in primary industry sectors.

“New Zealand needs young graduates as well as those in their mid-life years who want a change in direction, to develop a career in the primary industry sectors. They are increasingly science based industries, that need innovative and creative people to help them reach their full potential,” Jim Anderton said in Christchurch.

“The strong growth in the New Zealand economy over the past seven years has brought with it significant pressure on our labour market and people with skills are in short supply right across the economy.

“The importance of the primary industry sectors to the economic strength of the country means we are working collectively to attract our best and brightest to these sectors. Ministers across government are working with industry leaders to develop approaches to meet both the immediate skills shortages, as well as participating in longer-term planning to attract our most skilled people to the challenges and opportunities of the primary industries of New Zealand.

“The dairy industry's recent Go Dairying campaign, was aimed at people in their 20's and 30's looking for better prospects and a change in life style and resulted in over 2000 enquires and 800 firm prospects.

“Local initiatives such as the Waipaoa Farm Cadet School Trust that is modelled on Public Trust's excellent Smedley AgricultureTraining Farm in the Hawkes Bay are working hard to provide training for young people to meet the specific needs of the sheep and beef sector.

“As Minister of Agriculture, I know how crucial it is to have skilled and well-trained people in the field. I thank the NTA staff and tutors and institutions you work closely with – Telford’s training centre and the Southern Institute of Technology. And congratulations to the new graduates – New Zealand will welcome you with open arms,” Jim Anderton said.
