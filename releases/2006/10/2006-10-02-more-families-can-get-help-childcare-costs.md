More than 5,000 families stand to benefit from increases to childcare and [OSCAR subsidies](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/support-communities/OSCAR-funding.html), Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

“From today the income limits for eligibility will increase by around $5,000, making around 1,250 families eligible for [Childcare Assistance](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz/childcare-costs/) for the first time. In addition, around 3,900 families who are already getting Childcare Assistance will automatically get a higher rate,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

Mr Benson-Pope said that the changes mean 60% of all couples with children and 96% of sole parents will potentially qualify for help with childcare costs.

"If anyone thinks they might be eligible, I strongly encourage them to contact [Work and Income](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/) to find out more."

The new income limits will be $54,600 for a family with one child, $65,000 for a family with two children, and $75,400 for a family with three or more children.

Mr Benson-Pope said the changes will build on the government's [Working for Families package](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz), which has already made substantial increases to the number of people eligible for Childcare Assistance and the amounts families can receive.

The changes are also part of the government’s ten-year action plan [Choices for Living, Caring and Working](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/general/gen-choices-for-living.asp), which aims to improve employment and caring choices for parents and carers, and which has access to quality, affordable childcare as a key priority.

Childcare Assistance income limits will be regularly adjusted to keep up with the cost of living. The next increase will occur on 1 April 2007.
