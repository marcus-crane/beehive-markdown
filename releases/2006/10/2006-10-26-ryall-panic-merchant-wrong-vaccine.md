Tony Ryall's ill-informed attempts to discredit the MeNZB campaign are unworthy of him, says Health Minister Pete Hodgson.

"Mr Ryall's 'revelation' that there have been 33 treatment injury claims associated with MeNZB accepted by ACC since the beginning of 2005 is entirely within anticipated outcomes.

"The low number of accepted claims of a serious nature actually reinforce the view of the Ministry of Health that the vaccine has caused very few severe adverse reactions. Most of the cases were needle injuries sustained during one of the many injections that were administered," said Pete Hodgson.

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said Mr Ryall was either being lazy or deceitful in his misuse of claims information from ACC in order to increase the anxiety of New Zealand parents about the MeNZB vaccine.

"It really shows the National party do not have the best interests of New Zealand children at heart, that they would seek to spread panic in order to gain a few cheap political points," she said.

Ruth Dyson said that with a median cost of $79, the entitlements received by ACC claimants would appear to have been mainly GP visits, perhaps with some prescriptions as well.

Prior to the rollout of the campaign the epidemic strain of the Meningococcal B virus caused 200 cases a year in young people; just under a quarter of whom died or were left with lasting disability.
