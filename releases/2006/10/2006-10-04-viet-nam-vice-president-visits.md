Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Vice President of Viet Nam, Her Excellency Madame Truong My Hoa, has arrived in New Zealand for a three-day visit.

Viet Nam's Minister of Labour, senior officials, and a business delegation are accompanying her.

"Madame Hoa is a revered figure in Vietnamese political life and is the most senior woman in the Vietnamese political system. I had the pleasure of meeting Madame Hoa when I visited Viet Nam in 2003,” Helen Clark said.

“Madame Hoa’s visit, which starts today, presents an opportunity to maintain and build on the momentum developed during last year’s celebration of thirty years of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Vietnam. This visit forms part of an important pattern of ongoing high-level contact between Viet Nam and New Zealand.

“Viet Nam is a country on the move. Its economy is one of the fastest growing in Asia, with growth rates averaging over 7% in recent years. I was struck by its dynamism when I visited in October 2003.

“There is significant scope to broaden our relations, especially in the areas of education, tourism, trade, development, and scientific cooperation. Madame Hoa has a particular interest in education and social development issues.

"Business interaction between New Zealand and Viet Nam is expanding. Trade between New Zealand and Viet Nam was valued at approximately NZ$328 million for the year to June 2006.

"2006 is an important year for Viet Nam with its accession to the World Trade Organisation and hosting of the APEC Summit in November, which I will be attending," Helen Clark said.
