Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard today welcomed the launch of a comprehensive action plan for metro Auckland.

"It is encouraging to see Auckland interests working in partnership together and developing a joint action plan to help Auckland become a world class city.

"It is also encouraging to see the synergies between the government's priorities for action and those identified in the Metro Project Action Plan."

"Central and local government, businesses and communities, all want Auckland to become a world class city and a powerful engine to provide growth opportunities for both the city-region and New Zealand.

"The Metro Project Action Plan moves us towards a joint vision and a joint plan for action. Together we can work to make Auckland one of the premier cities of Australasia and a world class city in its own right.

"This is an exciting challenge, and I look forward to working with Auckland interests to meet this challenge."
