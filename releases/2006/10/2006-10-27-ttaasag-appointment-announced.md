Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the appointment of Craig Fisher to the Trans-Tasman Accounting and Auditing Standards Advisory Group ([TTAASAG](http://www.frc.gov.au/trans_tasman/)).

Craig Fisher is the Chair of the Professional Practices Board which, amongst its other roles, sets audit and assurance standards in New Zealand. The appointment of Craig Fisher follows the expansion of TTAASAG’s terms of reference to include consideration of New Zealand and Australian audit and assurance standards, and frameworks for audit regulation.

“Craig Fisher brings to TTAASAG a detailed understanding of New Zealand audit and assurance standards and the framework for audit regulation in New Zealand. I am sure that his expertise and experience will be of real benefit to TTAASAG as it considers audit regulation in New Zealand and Australia with the aim of reducing impediments to trans-Tasman business activity,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Chair of the Australian Audit and Assurance Standards Board (AUASB) has also recently been appointed to TTAASAG, which now has 12 members, including 5 New Zealand representatives.
