Air Vice-Marshal David Bamfield has had his appointment as Vice Chief of Defence Force (VCDF) extended for a further 12 month period from February 2007 Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"Air Vice-Marshal Bamfield was appointed to the role of VCDF in 2004 and has served New Zealand well in what has proved to be a very demanding period of transition for the New Zealand Defence Force", said Phil Goff.

Air Vice-Marshal Bamfield enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in 1966 as a trainee navigator. Air Vice-Marshal Bamfield served with squadrons operating Dakotas, Bristol Freighters and Hercules transport aircraft and in a variety of staff and headquarters appointments.

In 2004, on appointment as VCDF he was promoted to the rank of Air Vice-Marshal.
