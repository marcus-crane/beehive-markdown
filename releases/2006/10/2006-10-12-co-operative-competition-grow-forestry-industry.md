Minister of Forestry, Jim Anderton said today at the Pine Manufacturers Association (PMA) conference that our pine manufacturers faced decisions in a global marketplace with a choice of seizing the high value future they want for their industry or being bit players in it. He said that he was pleased that the conference is focussed on making a paradigm shift.

"In some ways the forestry industry is in the front line of the efforts we need to make to transform New Zealand's economy. The path to a high wage, knowledge based economy is pioneered by businesses creating more value from our natural resources and industries with the brightest future rely on skills and innovation that can't be relocated," Jim Anderton said

"The pine industry is exploring a shift from making and selling "bits of wood" to supplying end users with high quality products. We are seeing the need for partnership across the industry in order to tackle opportunities that can only be addressed in a co-ordinated way. Collaboration is especially healthy among members of the PMA.

"Our challenge is to keep moving up the value chain and to grow our market share among the high value products we produce. The aim must be to move to a customer focus where we are led by the opportunities in the market place.

"But putting our ideas into practice may need, for the good of everyone, 'co-operative competition' to beat the real competition. The ForWood project is an example of co-operative competition. Most of the players in the forest industry have collectively committed to contribute $560,000 a year for at least three years for a generic wood promotion campaign. It will further develop our domestic market.

"This project is up for discussion at the next Forest Industry Development Agenda Steering Group meeting later this month. If the Steering Group agrees to the project the Government will provide 75 percent of the costs through the FIDA’s Market Development fund. Potentially, that's worth another $5 million.  
"This partnership is perhaps the most exciting development in the forest industry in years. I hope it will lead to other examples in the future. It's daunting to make a paradigm shift to new ways of thinking and working but examples of it will be shown at this conference. I have very high expectations for our wood industry as it has all the ingredients to become our top export earner.

"Over the last ten years export income for value-added products grew by more than seventy percent in real terms. But we can do better still. More raw material is becoming available. An extra eight million cubic metres of logs a year could be available in the next five years. This is an opportunity New Zealand cannot miss. It can be turned into jobs, higher incomes, vibrant regions and deeper strength for the New Zealand economy.

"The Labour-Progressive government is committed to working in partnership with industry to unlock its potential. That future will be opened up by increased high value production - of the sort PMA are focused on. This conference is focused on the pathway and the paradigm shifts in thinking which are essential for us to realise our potential," Jim Anderton said.
