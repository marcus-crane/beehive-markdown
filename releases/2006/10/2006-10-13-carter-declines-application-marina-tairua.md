Conservation Minister Chris Carter has turned down an application for restricted coastal activity permits to construct a marina at Paku Bay in Tairua Harbour on the Coromandel Peninsula.

The proposal from Tairua Marine Ltd and Pacific Paradise Ltd was for a 150 berth marina. It required seven restricted coastal activities. Construction of the marina would have involved considerable dredging and excavation of sand, including from Pauanui Beach, reclamations and the construction of breakwaters and retaining walls.

"This marina proposal has been the subject of an Environment Court hearing, which recommended that I decline the proposal because the application failed the statutory threshold tests for a non-complying activity. That decision was appealed by the applicants to the High Court, which upheld the report of the Environment Court," Mr Carter said.

"The Resource Management Act requires that I make a decision on whether or not to accept the Environment Court's recommendation. In this case, I agree with the Environment Court that the proposal will have adverse effects on the environment that would be more than minor, and that the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of and policies of the relevant regional coastal plan.

"For these reasons, I have declined the permits," Mr Carter said.
