Niue’s long term viability has received a welcome endorsement with the signing of the Deed of Trust for the Niue Trust Fund, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark, Australia’s Prime Minister John Howard, and Niue Premier Young Vivian today signed into operation the Niue Trust Fund at the Pacific Islands Forum.

The Fund has been established to provide a long term, dependable revenue stream for Niue.

A Trust Account has been in place since 2004 and after contributions from New Zealand, Australia, and Niue its balance now stands at $23.5 million.

Helen Clark said the Trust Fund, like those established for Tuvalu and Tokelau in recent years, would build up a strong resource base which could contribute through interest revenues to Niue’s annual budget.

“The Trust Fund reflects the special relationship and partnership between Niue and New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

“New Zealand and Niue stand together through both the good times and the bad as the years since Cyclone Heta have shown so clearly. The establishment of this Trust Fund is a further example of that ongoing commitment which lies at the heart of our special relationship.

“Australia’s decision to support the Trust Fund so strongly is warmly appreciated. This is just the beginning and we will be encouraging other development partners to join us in investing in the Trust Fund in the years ahead.

“It is most fitting that the signing of the Trust Fund Deed can take place here at the Forum meeting. I am very pleased to be able to join with Prime Minister Howard and Premier Vivian in this clear commitment to Niue, its people and their long term wellbeing.”
