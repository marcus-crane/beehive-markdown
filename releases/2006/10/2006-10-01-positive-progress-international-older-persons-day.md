Minister for Senior Citizens, Ruth Dyson, today welcomed the progress many councils and agencies are making in taking the needs of older people into consideration.

"Good progress is being achieved by government agencies and local councils in implementing New Zealand’s Positive Ageing Strategy, which is particularly pleasing as we celebrate International Day of Older Persons," said Ruth Dyson.

The Day is designed to raise awareness worldwide about the need for older people to be recognised as valuable and to exemplify their contributions to society.

"This Labour-led government has a goal to ensure that all New Zealanders are able to maintain active, fulfilling lives in their later years, and participate fully in our communities," she said.

The government’s commitment to that goal is expressed in the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy, which was launched in 2001, eleven years after the United Nations' first International Day of Older Persons.

"The Strategy sets out our vision for a society where people can age positively, where older people are highly valued, and where they have continuing opportunities for participation – all of which fit in with the goals of Older Persons Day."

This year, for the first time, the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy annual report and action plan has been published as one document. The New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy has been widely distributed to local councils, libraries and community organisations, it is also available to the public from the Office for Senior Citizens and from the website [www.osc.govt.nz](http://www.osc.govt.nz)
