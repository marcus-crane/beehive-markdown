Environment Minister David Benson-Pope has congratulated Northland Regional Council on its progress towards providing for regional aquaculture management, as the council releases its Regional Coastal Plan for public and industry consultation.

“Aquaculture is a valuable industry, contributing around $20 million to Northland’s economy," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Through its aquaculture planning, Northland Regional Council is addressing economic development, environmental sustainability, and provision for settlement of Crown treaty obligations.

“The Northland Regional Council's work on revising its Coastal Plan is already being studied by other councils that may well benefit from its experience,” he said.

Mr Benson-Pope said that balancing uses and interests in our coastal areas and establishing good resource management processes was a delicate and important job.

“Central government is committed to working with the sector and other stakeholders to build a consensus to operate aquaculture in a sustainable way," he said.

Northland’s Plan change is necessary to make provision for aquaculture development in the region. The 2004 aquaculture reforms consolidated marine farm planning and management under the Resource Management Act, with New Zealand's 14 regional councils having the lead role.
