A new educational resource using music, animation and real-life examples to promote health and mental wellbeing among young Maori has been unveiled by Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Speaking at the launch of Maori mental health organisation Te Rau Matatini’s mental health resource kit for students, Whaia Te Ara Moû; Ko Tçnei Au at Parliament today, Nanaia Mahuta said the kit was a welcome addition to resources already being used in schools.

"It's a pleasure to launch this new resource, which has been developed with input from the young people who will be using it, and uses music, animation and real life examples drawn from te ao Mâori to support the teaching of the Health and Physical Education curriculum in te reo Mâori.

"Full credit to Te Rau Matatini for developing Whaia Te Ara Moû; Ko Tçnei Au, which not only provides students with the information they need to keep themselves healthy and well, but also raises their awareness about how they might use their knowledge to help others."

Whaia Te Ara Moû; Ko Tçnei Au Au is an adaptation of a resource that is currently being used in mainstream schools. This current version has been specifically tailored for use by students in Years 9 and 10 who are learning in Maori medium secondary schools and is an NCEA level 1 course.

It has been piloted and evaluated in five kura around New Zealand and comprises a video/CD rom, a guide book for both teacher and students, and promotional ‘giveaways’ like wrist bands.

"I really believe that the strong cultural identity that Maori are continuing to develop through their education is the best possible basis for a truly healthy life, and resources like this can help us achieve that," Nanaia Mahuta said.
