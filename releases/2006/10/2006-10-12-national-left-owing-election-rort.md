Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen today called on National to immediately pay the $112,500 it owes to broadcasters from its election advertising last year.

“National was caught out breaching the legal limit on broadcast advertising by treating the cap as GST exclusive rather than inclusive.

“During last year’s campaign, Labour was surprised at the scale of National’s television advertising. This rort allowed National to spend considerably more on television and radio advertising than it was allowed.

“Dr Brash has refused to pay National’s final bills because that will take his party over the cap. He wants retrospective legislation to permit National to break the law.

“Having blatantly broken the law, Dr Brash now wants to protect himself from the consequences.

“He should pay the bill and then incur whatever fine might be placed on National, which could be up to $100,000. Dr Brash broke the law and he should accept the consequences,” Dr Cullen said.
