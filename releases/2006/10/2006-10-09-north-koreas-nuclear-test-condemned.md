Prime Minister Helen Clark today said New Zealand utterly condemns the reports of a nuclear test by North Korea, saying it is a provocative and destabilising act for the region.

“The nuclear test undertaken by North Korea is contrary to the moratorium in place on nuclear tests for the past eight years, pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

“Any threat to this moratorium is a significant step back for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

“North Korea should have no illusion of the gravity with which the international community views its action.

The UN Security Council has [already moved](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20159&Cr=DPRK&Cr1=), prior to news of this alleged test, and must now [stay seized of this issue](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20171&Cr=DPRK&Cr1=).

“New Zealand will now be giving thought to what further measures can be taken with respect to North Korea. Our major concern is the broader security concerns of a nuclearised Korean peninsular,” Helen Clark said.
