Extra support to help reduce the risk of newly released prisoners reoffending will benefit the whole community, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

Reintegration caseworkers are about to start work in prisons around the country, helping prisoners obtain jobs and accommodation, establish support networks and manage their finances and relationships once they are released.

“Reducing re-offending is important as 29 per cent of prisoners return to prison within 12 months,” Mr O'Connor said. “Research shows that a smooth transition from prison to the community helps reduce the likelihood that people will end up back in prison.

"These new caseworkers will significantly boost the reintegration support that the Department of Corrections has in place to help newly released prisoners turn their lives around. They will perform an important role in helping to reduce re-offending by addressing the problems that we know increase risks for newly released men and women.

"Transition to the community can be difficult for a lot of prisoners as many have a limited employment history and few qualifications. Many also have significant behavioural, alcohol, or drug problems, and some have had difficulty in the past finding somewhere to live. It's important for everyone that we give them a real opportunity to contribute positively to society.”

Reintegration caseworkers, together with social workers and whanau liaison workers, form prison-based Regional Reintegration Teams. Reintegration caseworkers will work with prisoners with complex reintegration needs and with those in most need of reintegration support. Regional Reintegration Teams are based in five regions around the country. They will work closely with existing support services like the Prisoners’ Aid and Rehabilitation Society, Prison Fellowship New Zealand, and prison-based Work and Income Reintegration Teams.

Regional Reintegration Teams contribute to the Government's Effective Interventions strategy to drive changes to improve New Zealand's criminal justice system.
