Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today welcomed the release of a discussion document that explores tax incentives for Kiwis who contribute to charities and other non-profit organisations.

'Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations' was released today by Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne. The discussion document outlines several possible measures to promote charitable giving.

"The Labour-led government supports a strong, independent and capable charitable sector and the release of the discussion document demonstrates this commitment," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"Charities and volunteers make a wonderful contribution to the everyday lives of New Zealanders. I encourage all interested individuals and groups to send in submissions and attend the public meetings that are being held throughout the country.

"We look forward to good feedback from the charitable sector during the submission process.

"Misleading media statements like the one circulated this morning by opposition backbencher Sandra Goudie only serve to devalue the sector.

"Goudie quotes from a Cabinet paper – however, she seems to have forgotten that a) this was removed from the Charities Bill at the select committee stage, and b) the statement relates to the 'donee status' of organisations which has nothing to do with the Charities Commission.

"The Labour-led government is actively and positively working to strengthen the community and voluntary sector, and I am confident that the Charities Commission will deliver a good register by 1 February next year," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.
