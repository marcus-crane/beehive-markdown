Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson is wishing everyone a happy Labour Weekend,  
and to spare a thought for those who will be working on Monday while others  
have a holiday.

"Thanks to the Holidays Act, even though some people have to work on Labour Day, the cost to their recreational and family time will be recognised with a higher hourly payment."

The [first Labour Day in New Zealand]() was celebrated on 28 October 1890, when  
several thousand trade union members and supporters attended parades in the  
main centres. Government employees were given the day off to attend. It  
marked the struggle for an eight-hour working day, a right that New Zealand  
workers had been among the first in the world to claim, starting in 1840  
with Samuel Parnell in Wellington.

The Holidays Act also means that from April 2007 everyone will be entitled  
to 4 weeks annual paid leave, thanks to a Labour-led government.

"You can have better working conditions and fairness in the workplace  
alongside high productivity and good returns. In fact, New Zealand is among  
the top countries in the world for ease of doing business according to the  
World Bank and number two in the OECD for low unemployment rates."

"Skill shortages mean employers who can offer creative ways for staff to  
achieve better work-life balance will play an important part in attracting  
and retaining the best people," says Ruth Dyson.

The Department of Labour has been running a work-life balance project to  
find ways in which workplaces can maintain productivity whilst allowing  
employees to get the most out of their recreational and family time.

More details about the work-life balance project are available on the  
website: [www.dol.govt.nz/worklife](http://www.dol.govt.nz/) and more details about the [Holidays Act 2003](http://www.dol.ers.govt.nz/holidays_act_2003/) can be found at the [Department of Labour](http://www.dol.ers.govt.nz) website.
