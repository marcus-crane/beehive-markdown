Trade Minister Phil Goff will lead a major trade mission to Shanghai and Beijing in November to coincide with the launch of the first direct air service between New Zealand and China.

"Air New Zealand will be launching a direct air service to Shanghai on 6 November and around 60 New Zealand business people will join me on that flight", Mr Goff said.

"China is New Zealand's fourth largest trading partner and this mission offers a unique opportunity to get a first hand understanding of what is involved in leveraging the full potential of dynamic market", Mr Goff said.

"Two way trade with New Zealand is worth over $6 billion a year, is growing rapidly and is set to grow even more once the FTA we are working toward is complete.

"The mission will build the knowledge and understanding New Zealand businesses have of the Chinese market and their connections with it.

"New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will host a seminar in Shanghai where in-market experts will provide mission delegates practical understanding of the way in which they should approach the Chinese market and some of the challenges they may face.

"Mission members will also have the opportunity to meet with business contacts both in Shanghai and Beijing and to get first hand exposure to New Zealand companies who are doing business in China and to Chinese importers of New Zealand products.

"Companies interested in joining the mission, should contact New Zealand Trade and Enterprise", said Mr Goff.
