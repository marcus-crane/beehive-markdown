National's change of heart on climate change is better late than never, climate change minister David Parker said today.

"National says they now support the introduction of a cap and trade scheme to limit the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. The government signalled such an approach as far back as December last year. I expect to release further details on a proposal in the next month."

"National says it's interested in joining the Asia-Pacific Partnership, something the government is advancing," David Parker said.

"Nick Smith also expressed support today for increasing biofuels uptake, improving the building code, fuel efficiency vehicle labelling and incentives for more fuel efficient vehicles. These are all Labour-led government policies."

"It was predictable that National would finally realise that climate change is an issue to be taken seriously. We hope their votes now match their rhetoric."

"Today I issued a 12-page list of government initiatives already underway that will assist us in the fight against climate change. These initiatives demonstrate the steps that we are taking to make it easier for all kiwis to take sensible steps towards reducing our emissions," David Parker said.
