The continued growth in numbers enrolling for Modern Apprenticeships and Industry Training underscores the value of these initiatives at a time when employers are demanding more skilled labour, Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen announced the latest June year figures ahead of a speech tonight at the Wellington Registered Master Builders Carters 2006 Apprentice of the Year award ceremony.

As at 30 June 2006, there were 9,171 Modern Apprentices, almost 13 per cent more than in June 2005. Total Industry Trainees numbered 123,202, just over 11 per cent up on June 2005.

Modern Apprenticeships continues to prove its value with almost 2,300 having completed since the establishment of the programme in 2000.

"Just a few months ago I had the pleasure of congratulating the 2,000th Modern Apprentice to complete training. I am delighted that this successful initiative is continuing to make a real difference in developing the skilled labour force New Zealand needs.

"Industry Training and Modern Apprenticeships are central pillars in transforming New Zealand into a higher growth and higher wage economy by improving achievement in education, building a skilled workforce and lifting business productivity.

"The schemes' success is why Budget 2006 allocated an additional $58 million over the next four years to expand the number of Modern Apprenticeships to 14,000 by December 2008 and for other industry training initiatives," said Dr Cullen.
