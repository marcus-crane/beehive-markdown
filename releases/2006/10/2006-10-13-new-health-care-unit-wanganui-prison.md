A new health unit at Wanganui Prison will allow prisoners to take the first step on the road the rehabilitation, Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

Mr O'Connor officially opened the $3.3 million health centre today.

“Prisoners often arrive at prison with significant health issues, many of which have gone previously undetected,” Mr O’Connor said.

“These health issues impact on an offender’s rehabilitation and successful re-integration into society once they are released."

The new health care unit will ensure that all prisoners at Wanganui Prison are fully screened, assessed and treated, Mr O'Connor said. The level of care provided will be up to the level that generally exists in the wider community.

Mr O'Connor said the facility will make a real impact on the prison.

“The facility is designed along similar lines to a community health clinic – with modifications to ensure a safe and secure environment is maintained.”

The unit will house ten nurses who will work under a specialist Health Services Manager. A Medical Officer and dentist will provide services on a contract basis while specialist primary and secondary health services will be provided by the Wanganui District Health Board.
