A new seasonal work scheme will let Pacific workers fill horticulture and viticulture jobs when no New Zealanders are available, say Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope and Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

“The new Recognised Seasonal Employer policy has been designed to ensure New Zealanders get first opportunities at jobs. It contains strong incentives for employers to train and upskill the domestic workforce,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

Employers will need to show Work and Income they have made every effort to recruit workers locally and that they are good employers before being able to recruit migrant workers.

“This policy shows the Labour-led government’s commitment to helping the horticulture and viticulture industries meet their labour needs through facilitating a productive, accessible workforce.

“Due to record low unemployment, the horticulture and viticulture industries face considerable pressure recruiting staff," Mr Benson-Pope said.

“This is a good policy – it helps New Zealand employers, protects New Zealanders’ employment opportunities, and supports our Pacific development focus.”

Mr Cunliffe said officials would now work with Pacific countries and industries and flesh out the operational details.

"The scheme will start to transition in from April 2007 – existing policies will initially remain available for employers to recruit workers while the new policy is bedded down,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“Given New Zealand’s ongoing labour shortages, after confirming there are no Kiwis available, the policy facilitates employers to seek migrant workers from Pacific countries first – before looking to other countries.

“We are prioritising Pacific people as temporary migrants for these industries given our special relationship with and commitment to the Pacific region. This policy will lead to the upskilling of Pacific workers who will then return to their home countries with new experiences and capabilities.

"Pacific workers, as with other migrant seasonal workers, must leave New Zealand at the end of the season concerned. Enhanced facilitation and compliance measures will underpin smooth transitions for workers and employers alike.

“This policy has been carefully designed so that the scheme will further contribute to Pacific development and New Zealand’s objectives for economic success and stability in the region," said Mr Cunliffe.
