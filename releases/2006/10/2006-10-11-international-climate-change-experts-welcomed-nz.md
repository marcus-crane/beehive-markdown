Climate Change Minister David Parker today welcomed 180 of the world's leading climate change experts to Christchurch.

The experts are writing an assessment report on climate change for the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/)) and have travelled to New Zealand from around the world to take part in a working meeting.

David Parker said it was an honour to have such eminent experts in New Zealand for this important meeting.

“It is both an honour and a privilege to have the experts here. These are people dedicated to making a positive contribution to climate change,” he said.

“The IPCC’s role in the global climate change challenge is fundamental to New Zealand’s ability to plan for the likely impacts, and avoid them getting even worse. The future of New Zealand’s economy, environment and way of life depends upon effective international action being taken to cut emissions.”

From October 10-13, the experts are working on the draft of the [Fourth Assessment Report](http://www.ipcc.ch/activity/ar.htm) on options for reducing global emissions from energy production, transport, agriculture, industry and other sources. They are considering what can be achieved with existing technologies as well as what might be possible in future.

The full report – scheduled for release in 2007 – will provide comprehensive and up-to-date information about climate change, its causes, impacts and possible response measures based on the latest scientific, technical and socio-economic literature.

“[New Zealand’s preparation and management for the risks and opportunities associated with climate change](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=25) will be greatly enhanced by the findings of this key report,” Mr Parker said.

David Parker will outline the likely impacts of climate change on New Zealand and the how the government is responding, at a dinner for IPCC representatives tomorrow night in Christchurch.
