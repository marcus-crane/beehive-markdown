Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson on Buy Kiwi Made, today announced the first of a series of regional events to promote the awareness of New Zealand made goods.

The event will be a New Zealand Made Showcase held at Parliament on November 8. This event also marks the anniversary (6 November) of the death of former Green Party Co-Leader and Buy Kiwi Made champion, Rod Donald. Sue Bradford says it will be a fitting tribute to his passion for the local production of goods.

The events will showcase goods which currently qualify to use the New Zealand Made Campaign brand and its well-known ‘kiwi in the triangle’ logo. This definition will be used for the overall Buy Kiwi Made programme, and the logo will be the main identifier.

$11.5 million over three years was set aside for the Buy Kiwi Made Programme in the last Budget and has already assisted with the creation of a ‘Centre of Excellence’ within the Ministry of Economic Development to improve the procurement practices of government departments and agencies. Further spending will be allocated as other initiatives are developed.

Work is ongoing on a wider New Zealand Inc. media and promotion campaign which will incorporate a specific Buy Kiwi Made advertising programme.
