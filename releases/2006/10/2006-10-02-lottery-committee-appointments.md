Minister of Internal Affairs Rick Barker today announced 32 appointments to Lottery distribution committees.

"Since New Zealand Lotteries began in 1987 over $2 billion has been transferred to the Lottery Grants Board for distribution to our communities,” said Rick Barker.

"The Lottery Grants Board allocates the funding it recieves to eleven Lottery regional community distribution committees and a national distribution committee.

"The Lottery national distribution committee considers applications that have a national focus, or where applicants are national organisations. Lottery regional community distribution committees consider applications that have a more local focus.

"Those who put themselves forward to these committees deserve our recognition and respect. While there is more money available to be distributed than ever before, hard decisions still need to be made," said Rick Barker.

The distribution committee appointments are:

National: Duncan Taylor (reappointment) and Ken Laban; Northland: Colleen Urlich (reappointment), Heather Ayrton and Maxine Shortland; Auckland: Lynette Henry and Savaii Leutele (reappointments); Waikato: Angus McConnell and Judith Muru (reappointments); Bay of Plenty/Gisborne: Olive Isaacs, Mary Burdon (reappointments) and Beverley Adlam; Taranaki: Elizabeth McAllister (reappointment), Susan Hughes, Frank Gaze and Andrea Needham; Manawatu/Whanganui: Veronica Fitzmaurice and William (Bill) Greening (reappointments); Hawke’s Bay: Rangi Manuel (reappointment) and Pat Magill; Wellington: Sir Ronald Scott, Margaret Lee, and Star Olsen (reappointments); West Coast/Nelson/Marborough: Butch Bradley, Sharon Pugh, Kathleen Reilly (reappoinments) and Brent Maru; Canterbury/Kaikoura: Siale Faitotonu, Pamela Sharpe and Louise Tankersley (reappointments); and Otago/Southland: Dougal Soper and Trudi Sunitsch (reappointments).

Ms Needham has been appointed from 29 September 2006 and her term will expire on 30 June 2007. Ms Needham has been appointed for the remainder of the term of a resigned member and may be reappointed.
