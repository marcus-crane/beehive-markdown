China’s Commerce Minister Bo Xilai will meet Trade Negotiations Minister Phil Goff for bilateral economic and trade talks.

Mr Goff and Mr Bo will meet under the auspices of the Joint Ministerial Commission, established after a 2004 agreement between China and New Zealand to form closer trading links.

"The Commission enables Ministers to get together on a regular and formal basis for wide-ranging talks across bilateral, regional and international levels, Mr Goff said.

“This is Mr Bo’s second visit to New Zealand this year, after he accompanied China’s Premier Wen Jiabao here in April.

“The visit provides another chance for China and New Zealand to enhance trading ties which offer substantial benefits to existing exporters, while laying the groundwork for developing future opportunities.

“China is New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner, with total trade currently worth over $6.18 billion, and talks for a free trade agreement are continuing", said Mr Goff.

Mr Goff will be formally meeting Mr Bo on Monday.
