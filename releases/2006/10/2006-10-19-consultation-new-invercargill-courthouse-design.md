Minister for Courts Rick Barker said today that the consultation on concept plans for the new Invercargill Courthouse is underway.

“The current Invercargill Courthouse complex no longer meets the needs of the Invercargill community, and that's why funding was provided in Budget 2005 to design and build a new courthouse that would meet operational and security requirements now and in the future”, said Rick Barker.

"Significant time has been invested in planning and developing draft concept plans which have been released to stakeholders for consultation.

"The draft plans include a light and spacious courthouse split over two levels with a number of multi-purpose courtrooms. Many of these rooms are jury trial capable.

“The new courthouse will be modern and will have significantly more space than is currently provided in the Invercargill Courthouse. It will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology including video conferencing and evidence recording services. Where possible, Environmentally Sustainable Design practices have been incorporated into the concept for the courthouse.

"The large investment in this new building is part of the Government’s commitment to providing suitable court buildings that promote access to justice.

“Subject to stakeholder agreement and Resource Consent, we expect to start the two-year construction process by mid 2007,” said Rick Barker.
