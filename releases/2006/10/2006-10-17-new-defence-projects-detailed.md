Seven new defence acquisitions projects were announced today by the Minister of Defence, Phil Goff. The projects are included in the more than $1billion worth of spending remaining in the Long Term Development Plan.

"The third update of the Long Term Development Plan released today reports on both progress made in rebuilding the Defence Force and on seven new projects added to the Plan", Mr Goff said.

"The announcement of the NH90 acquisition, the single biggest defence purchase to date in the LTDP, completes the core capability projects on the ten year Plan.

"These have revolutionized defence force capabilities. The Army has state of the art light armoured and operational vehicles as well as new equipment such as radios, javelin missiles, and a fully operational air defence system.

"The Navy will see seven new ships added to its fleet all launched by the end of next year.

"The Air Force will have upgraded 757 passenger/freight planes, life-extended C-130 transport aircraft and P-3 surveillance planes with new mission, communication and navigation systems. Tenders were requested last week for six new Light Utility helicopters, valued at up to $110 million, to complement the eight new NH90 medium utility helicopters for which a contract has been signed.

"The seven new defence capital projects involve:

·a new fuel storage installation at Devonport Naval Base;

·a new power generation and reticulation system at the naval base;

·upgrading of the taxiways at Ohakea Air Base;

·options for replacement of the King Air training aircraft;

·upgrading of the ANZAC frigates' platform systems;

·upgrading the close in protection weapon systems for the ANZAC frigates; and

·investigation of a share in a satellite communication system for the Defence Force.

"The Long Term Development Plan sets out the priorities, timing, status and costs of the projects to be undertaken. It has the advantage of providing the Defence Force with greater financial certainty and ability to plan, to determine affordability, and to prioritise", Mr Goff said.
