Environment Minister David Benson-Pope has welcomed the news that the [Packaging Accord](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/initiatives/packaging/) is on track to meet its 2008 waste reduction and recycling targets, and thanked businesses and communities for their commitment and leadership.

Speaking at the function to mark the two-year progress report of the Accord, Mr Benson-Pope said the report showed many smart initiatives to increase recycling of glass, paper, plastics, steel, and aluminium packaging.

"In the past year, we've seen several councils extend their kerbside recycling to include Number 5 plastics such as icecream and margarine tubs," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"A [Glass Packaging Forum](http://www.packagingaccord.org.nz/GlassPackagingForum.php) has been established, to investigate alternative uses for recovered glass, and the steel, paper, and aluminium sectors are using smart strategies to increase recovery.

Mr Benson-Pope said that while the first two years had been about laying the foundations for future work, year three of the Packaging Accord would be about fast-tracking the work programme.

"Of the 673,090 tonnes of packaging used last year, 349,640 tonnes had been recycled rather than sent to landfill – over half of the total packaging used. This is thanks to the leadership shown by communities and businesses, and that leadership will ensure that we continue to do even better," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"There are challenges ahead, like the need to develop new markets for recycled products, to deal with mixed recycling that can contaminate glass and paper, and to encourage industry to stretch their targets," he said.

“New public awareness and education initiatives, guidance for local councils and activities to better track the packaging lifecycle are all on the cards.”

The Packaging Accord is a five-year, voluntary agreement between the packaged goods industry, recycling operators and central and local government.

“All New Zealanders have a common interest in reducing waste, as waste costs us money and degrades our environment. Reducing waste is integral to our clean, green national identity, the health and wellbeing of families, and our economic growth,” Mr Benson-Pope said.
