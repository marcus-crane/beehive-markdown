Climate Change minister David Parker today reinforced the need for New Zealand-wide action on climate change during a [keynote speech](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27314) in Wellington outlining the government's strategic direction on the issue.

"Climate change is widely recognised as a serious global problem. There is a growing sense of urgency among governments and citizens that action needs to be taken now.

"As a biologically based economy and trading nation, New Zealand's national interests are threatened by climate change. The Ministry of Economic Development's recently released "Energy Outlook" projects that 'business as usual' will lead to a 30 per cent increase in New Zealand's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in the next 25 years.

"Given the imperative for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood that, in future, emissions will carry an economic cost to the country, it is vital that New Zealand alters its growing emissions path.

"With that in mind we have been announcing initiatives across the whole of government, which will help New Zealanders respond to climate change."

These include:

- An adaptation programme to prepare for the impacts of climate change, especially in our coastal areas, and in the farming sector
- Measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
- Consultation on a minimum biofuels sales obligation
- A commitment to increase the uptake of solar water heating
- Options to create links with the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate
- The launch of the Permanent Forest Sinks Initiative

"The government expects to announce further proposals in coming weeks. They will include options to improve the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet, and ways in which government agencies can lead the way in sustainable practices.

"The government is also considering measures to discourage deforestation and encourage forest planting, and ways in which the agricultural sector can contribute to a climate change response, given it contributes around half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions."

David Parker said a combination of sectoral and economy-wide measures, including voluntary, price-based and regulatory measures, is likely to be needed in the long-term.

"The government is conscious of the need to prepare for a world where the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is reflected in every economy.

"Applying this principle broadly across the economy is likely to form a basis for policy post 2012."
