Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that New Zealand is committing $2 million to a Pacific Regional Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Project for the 2007-09 period.

Helen Clark said this grant followed that of $810,000 to the the Secretariat of the Pacific Community for 2006-07.

“It is widely accepted that a future influenza pandemic is inevitable, and Pacific Island countries won’t be safe.

“Previous pandemics had enormous social and health impacts in the Pacific: in 1918 some of the islands of the Pacific such as Samoa and Tahiti had mortality rates as high as 20-25 per cent of the total population.

“Planning for future pandemics is vital for Pacific Island countries, and this was recognised when Pacific Island Ministers of Health met in Samoa in March last year. Some progress has been made at the regional level on preparedness but with the exception of Fiji, which is well underway in its planning, no Pacific Island country has currently completed and tested a national influenza pandemic plan.

“New Zealand’s latest grant will help the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and World Health Organisation, who are the lead co-ordinating agencies on health emergency preparedness in the Pacific to address the gaps in plannning and response to pandemics within the region,” Helen Clark said.
