An initiative to further strengthen New Zealand’s border security is happening in Wellington this week, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

New Zealand is hosting the tenth annual Pacific Immigration Directors’ Conference (PIDC), attended by senior immigration officials from 23 countries including New Zealand and Australia.

“The aim of the conference is to manage migration flows and strengthen border management in the Pacific, to improve the region’s social and economic well-being and security, Mr Cunliffe said.

“With today’s trend of increasingly complex temporary migration around the globe, the border security of our Pacific neighbours has flow-on effects for New Zealand.

“So while we continue to facilitate the entry of the migrants our country needs, New Zealand must also sharpen its focus on the safety and security of the Pacific."

The conference, at Te Papa from 17 to 19 October, allows opportunities for regional bodies such as the Oceania Customs Organisation (OCO) and Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police, and government agencies, to share information and plan initiatives to strengthen border security in the Pacific.

“Examples of work underway are reviews of member countries’ border security laws to see if they meet international best practice.

“Another important function of PIDC is information-sharing between member countries - through meetings and workshops, building contacts, sharing information, and training and capacity building activities."

One way in which this takes place is through a regular immigration intelligence bulletin contributed to by member countries, co-ordinated and distributed by the PIDC Secretariat.

“I would like to welcome participants to the Conference and recognise the information-sharing and relationship-building benefits of this forum for New Zealand,” Mr Cunliffe said.
