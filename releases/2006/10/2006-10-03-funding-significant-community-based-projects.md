Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker announced the opening of the 2006/07 funding round for the Significant Community Based Projects Fund today.

"The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up in 2005 to provide communities with a way of obtaining funds needed to complete major projects", said Rick Barker.

"The calibre of the successful projects from the 2005/06 round demonstrates to potential applicants what the Government is looking for this round".

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

“I have visited a number of the successful applicants and was staggered by the community support each project had. This fund is making things happen,” said Rick Barker.

“These projects make a real difference and are wonderful assets for the community, region and in many cases New Zealand. They deliver economic and social benefits for communities and contribute to New Zealand’s national identity", said Rick Barker.

An interagency group comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Culture and Heritage, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Tourism, Sport and Recreation New Zealand and the Department of Internal Affairs make recommendations to Cabinet for final decisions.

Particular importance is attached to projects in the fields of arts, culture and heritage; sport and recreation; conservation and environment; tourism; and economic development.

The 2006/07 funding round opened on 2 October 2006 and closes 1 December 2006. All applications that meet the eligibility criteria will be ranked and presented to Cabinet. Funding decisions will be made in April 2007.
