Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, today launched the new and improved [Community Resource Kit](http://www.community.net.nz) in Wellington.

"This fantastic resource will make a real contribution to the development of strong, sustainable and connected communities", said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Community Resource Kit provides comprehensive information on setting up and running community and voluntary groups, and is freely available to anyone who needs it.

"The Kit will be particularly useful for small or emerging community and voluntary organisations, especially those starting up or undergoing change.

The development of the Kit is a joint project between the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Social Development and several not-for-profit groups. The Kit is in response to the community and voluntary sector's request for good quality support and information.

"The new kit is a great example of collaboration between the Labour-led government and the not-for-profit sector.

"I wish to thank the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations and all the organisations involved for putting their hearts and heads together to produce a resource that will meet the needs of communities,” said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Kit is an update of the Community Development Resource Kit developed by the Department of Internal Affairs. A hard copy of the kit will be available for use at a range of community information centres including libraries, community law centres, Department of Internal Affairs and Family and Community Services regional offices, Heartlands Centres, etc. It is also available electronically at [www.community.net.nz.](http://www.community.net.nz)
