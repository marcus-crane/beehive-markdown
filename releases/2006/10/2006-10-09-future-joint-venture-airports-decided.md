The Government has reached a decision on the future governance structure of remaining airports in which it is a joint venture partner.

Transport Minister Annette King says the Cabinet has decided that two airports – Hawke’s Bay and New Plymouth - will be given the option to corporatise, while the five airports, Whangarei, Whakatane, Taupo, Wanganui and Westport, will continue to be operated as joint venture airports.

Before Hawke’s Bay or New Plymouth can be corporatised, agreement has to be reached between the partners in the joint venture --- the Crown and the local authority(s) currently involved in the management of the airport. Corporatisation will also be contingent on protecting the rights of Treaty of Waitangi claimants.

Under corporatisation a new legal entity, an airport company, would be created to own and manage the airport, Ms King said. The council(s) and the Crown will both be shareholders of that new company but the directors would be responsible for governance of the airport.

The structure of any board would be subject to an agreement between the local authority and the Crown. The Crown’s interest would be managed through the Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit, with arrangements similar to Dunedin, Christchurch and Invercargill where the Crown has retained shareholdings.

“This decision paves the way for more active decision-making about important community assets. Of course, we can only proceed with agreement of our joint venture partners, and officials will be speaking with them soon,” says Ms King.

The airports will remain in public hands, and the company structure will provide clearer governance and enable the airports to borrow for investment if necessary.

Whangarei, Whakatane, Taupo, Wanganui and Westport will remain joint venture airports, where the Crown and the local authority operate in partnership to manage an airport, Ms King says. The Crown shares the cost of any capital expenditure such as jointly acquired buildings and facilities (including runways and taxiways) and future improvements. Any deficits or surpluses are shared equally between the parties.

The Crown owns half the venture but has no role in the day to day running of a JVA, she says. The local authority partner is responsible for the day to day operational running of the airport and the airport is treated as a council controlled entity for purposes of accountability to ratepayers.

Ms King says the Government is “committed to increased engagement with the councils to ensure the joint venture relationship works more effectively for both parties for the benefit of the communities.”

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

What are joint venture airports? Why are there only seven?  
The Crown entered into a series of joint venture arrangements with local authorities from the 1950s to the 1970s to develop New Zealand’s airport infrastructure. During the 1980s and 1990s many airports were corporatised or the Crown’s interest was transferred to its local authority partners.In 1999 the Government decided to retain its interest in the remaining joint venture airports, located at Whangarei, Whakatane, New Plymouth, Taupo, Hawke’s Bay, Wanganui and Westport. Joint venture airports are where the Crown and the local authority operate in partnership to manage an airport. The Crown shares the cost of any capital expenditure such as jointly acquired buildings and facilities (including runways and taxiways) and future improvements. Any deficits or surpluses are shared equally between the parties. The Crown retains a 50% shareholding in the venture but has no role in the day to day running of JVA’s. A local authority manages the airport as it does with any service it provides (such as libraries) and is responsible for the day to day operational running of the airport.

Why has the Government been re-evaluating its ownership interest?  
When the Government decided to retain its interest in joint venture airports in 1999, the decision was made subject to an evaluation of the costs and benefits of retaining its interest.

Does the Government own shares in any other airports?  
The Government owns shares in three corporatised airports: Christchurch (25%), Dunedin (50%) and Invercargill (45%) managed by the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU). The government also owns Milford Sound/Piopiotahi Aerodrome.

Who owns New Zealand’s other airports?  
Of New Zealand’s other main airports, Eight are owned and operated by local authorities (Gisborne, Hokitika, Kaikoura, Manapôuri, Masterton, Oamaru, Tauranga and Timaru); Two are privately owned (Ardmore and Paraparaumu); Six are council-owned and operated by airport companies (Blenheim, Hamilton, Kaikohe, Nelson, Queenstown and Rotorua); One is owned by a community trust (Chatham Islands); and Three are jointly-owned by local authorities and private interests and are operated by airport companies (Palmerston North, Auckland and Wellington). There are also numerous smaller privately-owned and operated airports located throughout New Zealand.

Which Government agencies from central Government have been involved?  
The Ministry of Transport has led the work, in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Tourism, Department of Internal Affairs, Office of Treaty Settlements, Te Puni Kôkiri, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation, Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit and the Treasury.

What does corporatisation mean? Corporatisation means that a new legal entity, an airport company, is created. The ownership of the airport will be transferred to that new company and the Councils and the Crown will both be shareholders of the company. This means that central Government will still retain its stake in the airports, but as a shareholder. Corporatisation also means a change of the management structure of the airport. A company board appointed by the councils and central Government in proportion to their shareholding in the airport will be in charge of the operation of the airport.

Why is the Government proposing to corporatise Hawke’s Bay and New Plymouth? What are the advantages of corporatisation?  
There are a number of benefits associated with corporatising the airports. These include:  
·Clarity of governance responsibilities through the formation of a board of directors. This is not possible under the unincorporated joint venture structure because Companies Act director duties and protections do not apply;  
·Limited liability of both the councils and Government; and  
·The ability to borrow in order to invest in the airports.

Is this privatisation? Will Hawke’s Bay and New Plymouth airports be sold?  
No, this is not privatisation. The airport will remain in public ownership operated by a company board appointed by the councils and central Government. Councils can decide to sell their share of the airport in the future, but the ability of the council or the Crown to sell its share of the airport will be governed by the agreement they make upon corporatisation. The agreement will ensure that selling the two airports to private interests will be subject to central Government approval.

Why is the Government proposing to corporatise Hawke’s Bay and New Plymouth and not others?  
Factors include the generation of consistent operating surpluses, scope to increase profitability, adequate capitalisation and capital expenditure requirements. Given these factors, the Government decided that it is only feasible at this stage to corporatise Hawke’s Bay and New Plymouth airports.

Who will the shareholders be? Who can buy shares? Will they be listed?  
The shareholders of each airport will be central Government and the local councils. Shares will therefore not be made available to the public and will not be listed on the share market.

How does this affect Treaty of Waitangi claims on an airport?  
As part of the corporatisation process, Treaty of Waitangi claims must be addressed before an airport can be transferred into an airport company.

Is the Crown planning to sell its shares?  
The Crown is not planning to sell its shares.

Who will manage the Government’s interest and how?The Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU) is responsible for monitoring the Crown’s shareholding in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill airports and will be responsible for monitoring the performance of any other corporatised airports. CCMAU will provide advice to Ministers on the performance of the airports and will recommend suitable persons to sit on the boards to represent the interests of Government. Board members will be appointed by Cabinet in proportion to the Government’s shareholding in the airport. Most decisions made by the board will not require Ministerial approval. Some major decisions will require shareholder approval.

Will landing and other charges increase? Who sets these charges?  
The airport company will be responsible for setting landing and other charges. The board will also be responsible for deciding whether charges should increase and the level of any increase.

Who will be on the airport board? How will board members be selected? What will they be paid?  
Board members will be appointed by councils and Government. As previously noted, Cabinet will appoint directors to represent the Crown’s interest in proportion to its shareholding in the airport. Remuneration of directors will be decided by the council and CCMAU.

Who will invest in major projects such as a runway extension?  
The airport company will invest in major projects such as any extension of the runway. If the company has insufficient funds to do so, it will be able to borrow the funds required, assuming the project makes good financial sense.

Can the airports go international?  
Airports will only be able to do so if they have first been designated a security aerodrome by the Minister of Transport. They must also be able to pay the costs associated with operating an international airport.

Will the Minister of Transport still be involved in decision making? The Minister of Transport will only be involved in regulatory decisions as with other airports. The Crown’s interest will be represented by directors appointed by Ministers.

Does the airport have to make a profit? Who gets the profit?  
The airport company is, on average, required to make a profit. Profits will be reinvested into the airport company or distributed to shareholders as a dividend. Any decision to pay a dividend will be decided by the board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, such as the company’s financial performance and expected cash flow. The Government has not typically taken dividends from other airports in which it has a shareholding.

How will the Crown engage with the five remaining joint venture airports?  
The Ministry of Transport will have a greater level of engagement with these airports. This includes:  
·commenting on the airport’s draft SOI, including on performance targets and capital works proposals;  
·input into other key documents such as the Airport Master Plan;  
·visiting the airports annually; and  
·providing joint venture partners with information about central Government processes, including the Budget process.

Is the Government going to invest any more money in these airports?  
Subject to Budget approvals, where there are insufficient funds in the airport accounts, the Government will continue to fund its half share of capital expenditure and operating losses.

Will the Government change its mind? When will it re-evaluate the situations at joint venture airports?  
The situation at joint venture airports will be re-evaluated and reported to Cabinet by 31 May 2009.
