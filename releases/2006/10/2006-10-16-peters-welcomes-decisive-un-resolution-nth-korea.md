The United Nations Security Council’s resolution on North Korea passed this morning (NZT) is a decisive response to Pyongyang’s claims of having conducted a nuclear test, says Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

Resolution 1718 imposes a range of measures to curb the further development of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. It was adopted under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which all member states, including New Zealand, are obliged to follow.

"New Zealand welcomes the strong and decisive response of the Security Council. The resolution sends a clear message to North Korea that its actions will not be tolerated. It is time they listened to the international community," Mr Peters said.

“We are examining closely the range of measures included in the resolution, and will implement these as quickly as possible.

“We understand the resolution imposes practical measures to encourage North Korea to come to its senses. It includes sanctions to prohibit its ships and aircraft from landing in foreign ports, and an interdiction/cargo inspection regime.

“It also seeks to prevent North Korea from trading in arms and any materials or technology that could contribute to a nuclear or ballistic missile programme.

“Targeting the regime’s illicit activities, such as counterfeiting and narcotics, and the movement of those involved in North Korea’s nuclear programme, is exactly the type of targeted sanctions that we support.

“We are also pleased the Security Council has called on all parties to restart Six-Party talks as a matter of priority, as New Zealand has consistently called for North Korea to return to the negotiating table.

“New Zealand fully endorses the Security Council’s demands that North Korea refrain from any further action that might aggravate the situation and that it honours the previous agreements it has entered into,” Mr Peters said.
