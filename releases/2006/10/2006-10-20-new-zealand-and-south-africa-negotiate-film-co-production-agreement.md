Prime Minister and Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced that New Zealand and South Africa have agreed to negotiate a film co-production agreement, and take other steps to strengthen cultural ties.

Helen Clark today held formal talks in Auckland with the South African Deputy President Mrs Phumzile Mlabo-Ngcuka.

"We discussed strengthening links across arts, culture, heritage, sport, archives, broadcasting, and tourism. Exchanges and other contacts across government and the cultural sector will also be encouraged," Helen Clark said.

New Zealand currently has cultural agreements with France, Italy, and China.

"The aim of the proposed film co-production agreement is to expand and facilitate film co-production to benefit the screen industries in both countries, and to develop cultural and economic exchanges.

"Under the proposed treaty, filmmakers from both countries would be able to pool resources to create films which will benefit both countries financially and culturally.

"Films made jointly by New Zealand and South African producers would qualify as works with national status in both countries, making them eligible for government support and facilitation.

"The definition of film under the agreement also includes television and other categories such as animation and digital productions.

“The South African and New Zealand film industries have a number of similarities, including good weather, a diversity of locations, English-speaking and experienced film crews and technicians, and good infrastructure to market their filmmaking capacity, Helen Clark said.

“We hope that such an agreement will encourage film-makers to share their energies and resources for the benefit of both countries.”
