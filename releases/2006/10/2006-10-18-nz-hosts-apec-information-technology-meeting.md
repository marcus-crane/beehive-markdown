New Zealand will host a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation senior IT officials and businesspeople next week, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

The 34th meeting of the APEC Telecommunications and Information Working Group (TEL) will be held at the Auckland SkyCity Convention centre from 23 to 27 October.

“This meeting will bring together economies from around the Asia-Pacific region to share their experience and knowledge.”

Mr Cunliffe said the TEL meetings had a long record of work on issues such as ICT development, co-operation and telecommunications regulatory reform and liberalisation.

“TEL 34 will include a steering group with a focus on security and prosperity. The first two days will be turned over to workshops on current issues including telematics, mobile communications opportunities, and trade liberalisation in telecommunications services.”

Mr Cunliffe said the business sector was taking a close interest in the work of the TEL.

“TEL34 will include an Industries Future Roundtable which will provide an industry perspective on priorities for future work in the TEL. It’s important that government officials have a good understanding of the industry and its potential, and the contribution from the private sector representatives will be crucial at this meeting.

“There will also be a presentation from the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).”

There will be 17 delegations, with particularly large ones expected from China, Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and Australia.
