Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of Mike Spedding to the Maori Heritage Council of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Mike Spedding, from Gisborne, is a now a member of both the Historic Places Trust Board and the Maori Heritage Council as required under the recently amended Historic Places legislation.

“Mr Spedding’s contribution and commitment to the Trust Board and his regional and cultural awareness will add value to the Council’s deliberations,” Judith Tizard said.

“His work over the last decade in developing the Tairawhiti Museum and related programmes at Tairawhiti Polytechnic have given him firm grounding in a bi-cultural environment with a strong local emphasis.”

Mr Spedding has previously served on the Board; he was elected onto it in 2003 and re-elected recently. His appointment runs until 30 June 2009, coinciding with his term on the Trust Board.

The Maori Heritage Council was established under the 1993 Historic Places Act to ensure that the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) meets the needs of Maori in a culturally sensitive manner in protecting wahi tapu, wahi tapu areas, historic places and historic areas of Mâori interest. The Council assists iwi to develop programmes for identification and conservation of these areas.
