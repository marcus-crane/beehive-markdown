"New Zealand and China had worthwhile, wide-ranging consultations at the second Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC)," said Trade Minister Phil Goff, and his Chinese counterpart, Commerce Minister, Bo Xilai

The Chinese delegation, led by Minister Bo, came to share views on bilateral, regional and multilateral trade and economic issues.

"We had extensive discussions about the Free Trade Agreement currently under negotiation. We reaffirmed this needs to be comprehensive, high quality, balanced and in the mutual interests of both countries. Negotiators must continue to seek these outcomes so we can reach a conclusion in line with the instructions of our leaders," said Mr Goff and Mr Bo.

The next round of negotiations will take place in New Zealand beginning on 9 October.

"We welcomed progress in other aspects of the bilateral trade and economic relationship and agreed we should seek to cooperate in implementing the FTA in due course.

"We agreed we should both seek to find ways to reinvigorate the WTO Doha trade negotiations, and shared perspectives on the current state of play and outlook.

"We also talked about APEC, the East Asia Summit process and other regional developments. China and New Zealand have many shared interests. The JMC is a good vehicle for theses exchanges," said Mr Goff and Mr Bo.

The JMC was established under the Trade and Economic Cooperation Framework signed in 2004. The first meeting was held in Beijing in June 2005. The JMC's mandate is to articulate a vision for the bilateral trade and economic relationship through exchanges on developments of interest and each country's development agenda.
