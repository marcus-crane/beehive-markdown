Celebrating young people and promoting safer communities is the focus of a march being joined by Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta in Tokoroa today.

Nanaia Mahuta said the 2006 Tangs and Involve TIS (Tokoroa Increasing Safety initiative) Hope March was a not only a celebration of children, young people and the community, but also a chance to reinforce the message that violence was never the answer.

"This march is a great opportunity for local people to promote the message that violence is not acceptable in our communities, which is particularly timely given recent tragic events involving young people in Auckland."

The march is just one of a range of activities being run in the region throughout October and November as part of Involve ’06, an I initiative which provides an opportunity for local organisations to "get involved" and showcase what they do.

"The message of the march is simple – people need to know that there are much better ways to deal with things that do not involve violence – and that they need to 'Blink', then 'Think – there's another way'.

"The hope march also supports the government's Push Play initiative, which is focused on getting people to do 30 minutes of physical activity each day," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"I also want to congratulate the South Waikato District Council and the local community on the Involve ’06 initiative, which has already seen some 40 local organisations put their hand up to run an community events during October.

Taupo MP Mark Burton, South Waikato District Mayor Neil Sinclair and Singer Emma Paki are among those also scheduled to attend the event.

"It is really important that as a community and as whanau we do our best to give our young people the very best start in life," Mark Burton said.
