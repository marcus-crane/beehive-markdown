Public consultation on whether up to 25 more occupational diseases should be added to Schedule 2 has been extended a further month says ACC Minister Ruth Dyson.

In March this year the Ministerial Advisory Panel on Work Related Gradual Process, Disease or Infection recommended an update to Schedule 2 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation (IPRC) Act 2001.

A public consultation process started in early October and was to have ended today.

"In order for the public to be able to fully consider the proposed additions, I have extended the time for submissions to 1 December," said Ruth Dyson.

“This public consultation document will be of interest to employer groups, unions, claimants, health professionals and anyone with an involvement in occupational health. I encourage interested groups and individuals to send in a submission."

Among the new diseases and causes which have been proposed, include Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome diagnosed as caused by hand and/or arm vibration, sino-nasal carcinoma diagnosed as caused by working with wood dust and naso-pharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed as caused by formaldehyde.

“By formally recognising these diseases through Schedule 2 it also raises public awareness about the help available from ACC to New Zealanders who develop an occupational disease and makes it simpler for them to get help. I hope it will also lead to greater occupational disease prevention.”

The submission document is available on the Department of Labour website [www.dol.govt.nz](http://www.dol.govt.nz) and the ACC website [www.acc.co.nz](http://www.acc.co.nz) or by emailing [info@dol.govt.nz](mailto:info@dol.govt.nz?Subject=Review) with "Review of Schedule 2" in the subject line.

The new deadline for submissions is 5pm, **1 December 2006.**

**Background**  
In general, ACC does not cover injuries that are caused by disease, infection or illnesses that result from exposure to a causal agent over a period of time (also known as gradual process), unless they are directly linked to a person’s employment.

Under ACC legislation injuries caused by work-related gradual process, disease or infection are covered if they meet specific criteria:  
Firstly there must be an injury that is defined in section 26 (this can be an occupational disease)  
Secondly there must be a causal link between the injury and the person’s employment

People who have been diagnosed with a disease listed in Schedule 2 are able to use a more streamlined system for establishing ACC cover. If a person has a disease caused by exposure to a listed substance, ACC can only decline cover if it establishes that the disease is caused by factors other than work.
