Finance Minister Michael Cullen noted that motormouth John Key finally fell over his own tongue in the House today.

"When, in an answer to a question, I said he would be Leader of the Opposition in 2008 he interjected "probably."

"At last he has confirmed publicly what he has been boasting to all and sundry around the world for months. That is, he expects to challenge and defeat Don Brash for the National Party leadership before the next election.

"Given his lightweight performance over recent months compared with Bill English, this seems a very bold assertion indeed," said Dr Cullen.
