Courts Minister Rick Barker today said Simon Power's attempted attack on the government is actually an attack on the judiciary.

"What Mr. Power fails to understand is that this government hasn't written off any fines or reparation. Not one cent. It is judges who decide whether to remit fines or reparation," said Rick Barker.

"The Collections Unit of the Ministry of Justice enforce the collection of fines and reparation and do so until they are told to stop by judges.

"The Collections Unit collects fines on behalf of nearly one-hundred issuing authorities from around New Zealand. They are doing a great job, with the number of fines and reparation collected increasing from $113.4 million in 2001/02 to $206.9 million in 2005/06. Although the number of fines being imposed has risen by 10% per year the collection of fines has increased by 16.5%," said Rick Barker.
