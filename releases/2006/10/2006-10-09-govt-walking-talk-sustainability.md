Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said tonight that the quality of the nominees for the [2006 Govt³ awards](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/govt3/awards2006.html) confirmed the government was walking the talk on the environment and climate change.

Mr Benson-Pope announced the eight winners of the 2006 Govt³ Awards at Parliament's Banquet Hall this evening.

Led by the Ministry for the Environment, [Govt3](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/govt3/about-govt3.html) encourages government agencies to be more energy efficient, save water, reduce waste and recycle, and make environmentally sound transport decisions.

This year's awards are the second round of Govt³ awards, and received 57 nominations for the eight categories of award: sustainable buildings, transport, procurement practice, energy efficiency, recycling and waste minimisation, office consumables and equipment, leadership, and staff behaviour change.

The Department of Conservation, Inland Revenue, Department of Corrections, The Treasury, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, NZ Defence Force, EECA and Ministry of Fisheries were the winners for 2006.

“The number and the quality of this year's nominations shows that Govt³ is really taking hold in the public sector, and making a real contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Mr Benson-Pope. "For government to show genuine leadership, we have to walk the talk – and Govt³ enables us to do that."

Mr Benson-Pope said that Inland Revenue, which won three of the eight categories (Transport, Behavioural Change, and Leadership) stood out for its work to adopt environmentally sound practices.

"Inland Revenue has undertaken a massive job for an organisation of over 5,800 people spread over 41 sites. The commitment and the initial results are very impressive,” he said. The Ministry of Fisheries was joint winner of the Leadership Award with Inland Revenue.

The Department of Corrections won the Energy Efficiency Award after cutting its energy costs by over $1.2 million – ahead of its 2007 target -- since 2002.

“The Department's energy efficiency programme aims to reduce energy use across its 18 major sites, 140 Probation and Offender Service offices, three new prisons and by 5,000 staff and almost 7,500 inmates. It has achieved permanent energy efficiencies of 9.5% and has reduced carbon dioxide emissions per prisoner by 37% since 2002,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

The Department of Conservation took the Sustainable Buildings Award, with its new offices in the former Hoyts movie theatre complex in Wellington being singled out as one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in the country.

“This building is the first office building in New Zealand to use chilled beams in place of a traditional air conditioning system, to reduce energy consumption. This is one of the most efficient air conditioning types in the world,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

Other awards went to: Recycling/Waste Minimisation, Treasury and the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority; Office Consumables, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Procurement, New Zealand Defence Force.

A six-member panel, including representatives from the Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and Westpac Banking Corporation judged the awards.
