The extra funding supplements previous time-limited and targeted funding that has been used to promote New Zealand overseas, and provides greater security for the industry, Mr O'Connor said.

"There is no doubt that offshore marketing helps to attract more visitors. In a competitive global tourism market it is vital we do more to ensure New Zealand remains at the forefront of the minds of potential visitors.

"Tourism has a critical role to play in expanding opportunities for New Zealanders and boosting the economies of regions across the country and it's going to become more important.

"The World Tourism Organisation predicts that a quarter of the world's tourists will visit the Asia Pacific region by 2020.

"The '100 percent Pure New Zealand' campaign shows how effective we can be. Tourism New Zealand is focused on attracting higher spending, interactive travellers who want to do more while they are here.

"Our strategy is helping to ensure the economic opportunities of tourism are maximised. And the extra $15.9 million a year will help Tourism New Zealand to expand its marketing efforts to ensure we keep telling potential visitors about the great New Zealand experience," said Damien O'Connor.
