The decision by Hamilton voters to retain fluoride is a victory for the health of local families, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

In a referendum that closed today, Hamiltonians voted resoundingly in favour of retaining fluoride in the local water supply. With turnout at 38 per cent, 70 per cent of voters voted for fluoride while 30 per cent voted against.

"We were never in any doubt that Hamiltonians supported fluoridated water," Pete Hodgson said. "The worry was that with turnout expected to be low, a small, but vocal minority could have swung the vote against the interests of the wider community.

"I congratulate and thank the 23,000 voters who took the time to stand up for the health of local kids. They knew that removing fluoride would have meant a significant deterioration in the oral health of children.

"I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the Hamilton health community and the District Health Board who made sure local people had the information they needed to make an informed decision."
