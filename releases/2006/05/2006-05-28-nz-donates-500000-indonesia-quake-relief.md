Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced a $500,000 initial aid contribution from New Zealand to assist with relief efforts after the serious earthquake which struck Yogyakarta, Indonesia early on Saturday morning.

“The earthquake has caused a terrible tragedy, with reports of 3000 people killed and up to 20,000 missing or injured. The situation in Yogyakarta remains extremely grave and New Zealand’s contribution will assist the wider international effort to provide essential care for the survivors.

“The contribution will be made through the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which is well-established in Indonesia and is already working on the ground in Yogyakarta.

“The Red Cross’ initial focus is on the health and well-being of survivors, but in coming weeks it will also re-establish essential services, such as sanitation and water, and rebuild homes.

“This is an initial contribution and we will be closely monitoring the situation over the coming days.

“Two staff from our Embassy in Jakarta are on their way to Yogyakarta and will report back any additional needs to our international aid agency, NZAID.

“The Embassy staff, who are expected to arrive in Yogyakarta later today, will be making checks on the safety and well-being of any New Zealanders who may be in the area.

“At this stage we have no indication that there are any New Zealand casualties, though we remain concerned for the wellbeing of the ten or so New Zealand families registered with the Embassy in Jakarta. Making contact has been difficult due to the breakdown in telephone links to the area,” Helen Clark said.
