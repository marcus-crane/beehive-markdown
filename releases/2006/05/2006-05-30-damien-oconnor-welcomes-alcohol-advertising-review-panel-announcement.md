Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor has welcomed the announcement today of members of a steering group to review alcohol advertising regulations and the review's terms of reference.

The review will look at regulations controlling the advertising of alcohol, including alcohol industry promotions, advertisements and product placement and whether they meet the Government's harm minimisation alcohol policy.

Mr O'Connor said he was pleased the panel was now in a position to start work.

"It has taken a while to get the balance of the panel right so that the advertising standards authority, the broadcasting standards authority and health policy makers can consider all of the issues around alcohol promotion."

Mr O'Connor said he expected work to start immediately. The panel is due to make final recommendations in December 2006.
