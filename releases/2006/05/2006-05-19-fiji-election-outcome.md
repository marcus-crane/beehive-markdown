Foreign Minister Winston Peters has congratulated Fiji on a peaceful and orderly election and passed on his best wishes to re-elected Fiji Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase.

“This election was an important milestone in Fiji’s history. Its successful conduct was important for future stability and prosperity in Fiji,” Mr Peters said.

“I had very useful discussions with Mr Qarase during my visit to Fiji in February this year and I look forward to working with him again to bring New Zealand’s partnership with Fiji even closer.”

Mr Qarase’s Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party (SDL) secured 36 seats in the closely fought election. The support of two independents brought their total to 38. The Fiji Labour Party, led by former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry gained 31 seats and the United People’s Party secured 2 seats.

Counting of votes after the week-long election, from 6-13 May, has taken several days because of complexities associated with the four-roll alternative vote electoral system.  
“While the votes have been counted, the next important step for Mr Qarase will be the formation of a new government in keeping with Fiji’s constitution which provides for a multi-party cabinet,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters said New Zealand had been happy to support the democratic process in Fiji through the provision of ten election observers and with a $5.44 million contribution to the Fiji Elections Office.

International election observers have indicated that despite some initial problems, the voting was conducted in a fair and credible manner.
