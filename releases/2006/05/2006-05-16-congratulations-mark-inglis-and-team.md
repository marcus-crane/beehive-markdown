Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated mountaineer Mark Inglis and his team on their stunning feat in reaching the summit of Mt Everest.

"To reach the summit of Everest is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement for any climber, but for Mark Inglis it will be even more satisfying," Helen Clark said.

"Mark is the first double-amputee to conquer the 8850m peak. He has said it was a childhood dream to stand on the roof of the world, but he thought he had lost it 23 years ago when he lost his legs after suffering frostbite while trapped in a cave on Mt Cook.

Mark Inglis has said "Climbing epitomises the concept of 'must do' in life. There is no room for just a can do attitude in the extreme environment of the New Zealand Alps so if a mountaineer can take that must do attitude to the rest of their life, they are unstoppable!"

"This is a truly remarkable feat for Mark, for New Zealand, and world mountaineering. I pay tribute to Mark and the rest of his party," Helen Clark said.
