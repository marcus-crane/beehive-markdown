Spirits Bay landowners are getting over $41,000 in grant funding to help protect to help preserve wildlife and natural habitat.

Labour MP Dover Samuels announced today that NZ Landcare Trust are getting two grants to help local landowners. The first, of $37,706, is for a 3km stock-proof fence and planting at Unuwhao, Spirits Bay. Unuwhao boasts 22 of only 31 known specimens of Rata Moehu (Bartlet's Rata), populations of Te Paki Kauri Snail endangered Flax Snail and other nationally critical or sparse invertebrates.

The second grant of $3,732 is to inform Muriwhenua Incorporation on the biodiversity values of the Unuwhao Pa Site, featuring rare plants and giant land snails. Maori landowners will see an actively managed biodiversity site, share information on and discuss issues associated with the site.

The local grants are part of a nationwide announcement by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa today that $1.3 million is being distributed to 104 projects across the country.

“Many fragmented areas of native bush and wetland now only exist on private land, and this funding makes a significant difference for landowners and community groups working to restore and preserve unique New Zealand fauna and flora. The funding goes some way to safeguarding New Zealand's rich biodiversity and identity as a clean green and sustainable nation," said Dover Samuels.

The Biodiversity Condition and Advice funds were established in 2000 under the $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package. The next funding round is now open: see www.biodiversity.govt.nz, or call 0800 86 20 20.
