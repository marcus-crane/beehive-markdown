Kaikohe landowners are getting over $30,000 in grant funding to help protect to help preserve wildlife and natural habitat.

Labour MP Dover Samuels announced today that Northland Regional Council is getting three grants around Kaikohe.

The Te Totara Farm Wetland and Bush Protection project gets $15,000 to fence the Lake Omapere boundary, protecting native bush and keeping stock out.

Te Ahu Ahu wetland gets a $9,000 grant for a 1.2km fence, to enhance current weed and pest control work.

And a grant of $6,140 for the Craig Dune Lake Restoration project will protect 1.5 hectares of coastal wetland with a 600m fence and new planting around the margins of the dune lake at Pataua North.

The local grants are part of a nationwide announcement by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa today that $1.3 million is being distributed to 104 projects across the country.

“Many fragmented areas of native bush and wetland now only exist on private land, and this funding makes a significant difference for landowners and community groups working to restore and preserve unique New Zealand fauna and flora. The funding goes some way to safeguarding New Zealand's rich biodiversity and identity as a clean green and sustainable nation," said Dover Samuels.

The Biodiversity Condition and Advice funds were established in 2000 under the $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package. The next funding round is now open: see www.biodiversity.govt.nz, or call 0800 86 20 20.
