"New Zealand music is thriving in Parliament judging by the results of this year's Music Month Quiz for MPs," says the unofficial 'Minister for New Zealand Music' Judith Tizard.

This year Luamanuvao Winnie Laban is the clear winner, scoring 100% in Judith Tizard's annual music month quiz. She was closely followed by Mark Burton and Doug Woolerton who tied for second, then Pita Paraone 3rd and Steve Chadwick 4th. Dianne Yates gets a special mention for completing the quiz without assistance and Judith Collins was most improved.

"I am again absolutely delighted with the results of the quiz," says Judith Tizard.

"The aim of the quiz is to get MPs aware of New Zealand music and the exciting role it's playing both here at home - on tv, radio and in our films as well as overseas. So it doesn’t matter if they got some help with their research."

"And the intense rivalry between MPs and their offices to win just adds to it!"

NZ music is now accounts for over 20% of airplay. And during music month last year over 28% of all music sold domestically was New Zealand music.

"New Zealand music has well and truly arrived. Creative industries like music are a vital plank in growing an innovative New Zealand and they are also a high growth sector in our economy".

"I congratulate all who entered and I hope they enjoyed finding out more about the wonderful New Zealand music that surrounds us," Judith Tizard said.
