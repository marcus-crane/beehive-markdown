The new schedule of product-specific rules expected to apply to goods traded between Australia and New Zealand from 2007 is now available on the Ministry of Economic Development website at [http://www.med.govt.nz/rules-of-origin/](http://www.med.govt.nz/rules-of-origin/)

This schedule is an important document for manufacturers exporting to Australia. It identifies changes in tariff classification rules at the product level as well as any supplementary rules that may be required for certain products. The new rules will substantially reduce transaction costs for the great majority of businesses as they will no longer be required to keep complex records to establish origin.

In February, Trade Minister, Phil Goff, and Commerce Minister, Lianne Dalziel, announced that the rules of origin would move to change of tariff classification (CTC) rules of origin from a traditional value-added approach.

The CTC approach is consistent with new international practice for determining rules of origin under Free Trade Agreements and will bring CER into line with the approaches taken under New Zealand’s FTA agreement with Thailand, and the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement with Chile, Singapore and Brunei.

Lianne Dalziel has also sent letters to interested parties and industry organisations informing them of the release of the schedule.
