The health and wellbeing of the next generation of Kiwi adults is to be gauged in a nationwide survey announced today by Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Around 10,000 young people aged 12-18 from schools around the country will be involved in the Youth2007 Survey, which both Ministers said would provide a comprehensive look at current and emerging youth health issues, as well as help build a picture of long-term youth health trends.

Ms Mahuta said the announcement was also a fitting way to wrap up New Zealand's 2006 [Youth Week](http://www.youthweek.co.nz/), which finishes today (Sunday May 21) and has featured more than 100 youth events nationwide involving young people.

"It's appropriate that as Youth Week 2006 celebrates young people and encourages decision-makers to listen more to youth voices, that this national survey focusing on youth health and wellbeing is being launched.

"This reflects the Labour-led government's commitment to ensuring that the views, feelings and opinions of young people on important issues which affect them – and therefore the future of our country – are taken into account," Ms Mahuta said.

“The significance of this survey is that as tomorrow’s leaders, parents, workers and taxpayers, today’s young people will be called on to support a population which is growing and ageing faster than the youth population can keep up. This is why getting good information about the health of our young people today is so important for securing a healthy future for them and for New Zealand tomorrow.”

Mr Hodgson said the survey was ground-breaking in that it had created a platform for many different agencies to work together in a co-ordinated way to address youth health issues.

"This Labour-led government has the strongest conviction that our young people are supported and helped to be all that they can be. These agencies have a common goal to find out as much as they can from our young people so we can best support them."

Youth2007 is a follow up to the [Youth2000 survey](http://www.youth2000.ac.nz/), one of New Zealand’s first comprehensive national youth health and wellbeing studies. It will involve students being asked questions about issues such as ethnicity and culture, physical and emotional health, family and living arrangements, and attitudes towards diet and physical activity.

The Youth2007 survey will be completed online. For the first time, it will also include questions about gambling behaviour, in response to the significant growth of gambling opportunities over the last decade.

Youth2007 is being conducted by the Adolescent Health Research Council and is funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, the Department of Labour, Families Commission, Accident Compensation Corporation, Sport and Recreation New Zealand, the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand and the Ministries of Youth Development, Justice and Health.

The survey will be split into three phases. The first phase will be to pilot the survey questions among students from randomly selected schools during 2006, before launching the nationwide survey in 2007. The final results of the survey are expected to be released in late 2008.
