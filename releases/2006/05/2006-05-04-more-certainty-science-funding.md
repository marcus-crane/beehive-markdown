The Labour-led government will provide greater certainty for longer-term research and science programmes, Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"An investment in science and innovation are key to lifting New Zealand's prosperity," Steve Maharey said.

"The government will work with the science sector on implementation of a number of changes agreed by Cabinet, including greater certainty of funding for programmes with a proven track-record.

"The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology will talk with the science sector over the next six weeks about how we can take these changes forward over the next 12 months.

"While contestability continues to be an important part of our science system, too much contestability can affect the ability of our scientists and science organisations to carry out research and apply their ideas over a longer period.

"The changes aim to put greater trust in scientists and science organisations, mean more consistent support for long term research and aim to reduce the costs and complexity of the funding system.”

“Changes to be worked through with the sector include:

- Introducing negotiated investments for longer-term programmes with a proven track record
- Systematic review of science programmes to assess their scientific quality, fit with national priorities, and delivery of outcomes to date
- Steps to reduce cost and complexity of competitive funding processes - which remain the most appropriate mechanism for many science investments
- Identify ways to provide more certainty of funding for essential 'backbone' infrastructure, such as nationally significant databases
- Continuing to increase the capability of New Zealand's Crown Research Institutes

“These moves follow discussion across the sector on priorities for improving New Zealand’s RS&T performance and recent evaluations of parts of the RS&T Vote. As well as strengthening the economic contribution of science, these changes will contribute to stronger links between research organisations and research users, and more secure and attractive career paths for researchers."
