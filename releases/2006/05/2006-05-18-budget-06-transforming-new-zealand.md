Budget 2006 is based on the Labour-led government’s clear vision to transform New Zealand and reinforces the government’s work of the past six and a half years, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

“This budget contains more initiatives to support the economy moving further from its traditional commodity focus to one focused on producing higher value goods and services for world markets both from our core primary sectors and from others.”

“We also want to ensure that all families, young and old, have the support and opportunities they need in the twenty-first century, and we want to reinforce the pride New Zealanders take in our national identity and heritage.

“In today’s budget, the government is progressing key investments and initiatives in infrastructure, Working for Families, in housing, health, and education, and in our unique national identity.

“This is an important budget for the future, built around a long term vision for the transformation of New Zealand. It is also a budget grounded in sound fiscal policy. Careful fiscal management and stewardship of New Zealand’s finances is a hallmark of the Labour-led government.

“Above all, this is clearly a Labour-led budget. Ours is an active and practical government, delivering policies and programmes based on fairness and inclusiveness to equip New Zealand and New Zealanders with the tools required to meet the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead,” Helen Clark said.
