Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the re-appointment of John Gilbert and Neil Plimmer as Temporary Safeguard Authorities for three-year terms commencing 11 June 2006.

Authorities are independent bodies with certain powers of a Commission of Inquiry who, on my request, carry out inquiries and recommend whether urgent temporary safeguard action is required to assist New Zealand industries faced with increased imports which are causing, or threatening to cause, serious injury.

"I am pleased that John Gilbert and Neil Plimmer are both able to continue on as Authorities for second terms," Lianne Dalziel said.
