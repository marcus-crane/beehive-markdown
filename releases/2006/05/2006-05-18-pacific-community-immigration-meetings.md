Meetings with the Pacific community will be held in Auckland and Wellington as part of the consultation process for the Labour-led government's Immigration Act Review, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

The Immigration Act Review Discussion Paper 2006 was released for public consultation last month, with the aim of incorporating feedback into a new Immigration Bill at a later date.

“This is a chance for the Pacific community to contribute to the most comprehensive review of immigration laws since the present act was passed in 1987," Mr Cunliffe said.

“Immigration is a topical subject for the Pacific community. For this reason, and because of our special relationship with the Pacific, we have organised two additional meetings - specifically to gather the views from this important group."

The Immigration Act review is part of a wider approach to reviewing New Zealand’s immigration system.

“The three pillars of our approach are legislative reform, a strategic review of key aspects of immigration policy, and supporting operational and process changes within the Department of Labour.

“These will be ongoing, complementary changes to ensure we have an integrated immigration system that is designed for the 21st Century,” Mr Cunliffe said.

The Immigration Act is the legislation that guides and drives immigration policies and processes. It has a huge impact on people from overseas who visit, study, work and live in New Zealand, and on the lives of New Zealanders.

The options in the paper are only proposals, and are not yet government policy.

"Cabinet will carefully consider the feedback from submissions in framing legislation later this year,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Meetings with the Pacific community will take place in Auckland on Monday 22 May at 7pm at 733 Great South Rd Otahuhu, first floor Pacific Business Trust office; and in Wellington on Monday 29 May at 7pm at Pacific Islands Presbyterian Church Hall, corner Constable and Daniel streets Newtown.
