Labour's 2006 budget delivers on our promise to solve key Auckland transport issues says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

An extra $1.3 billion is being invested over the next five years to accelerate critical roading projects including the Manukau Harbour crossing component of Auckland's western ring road - intended as a second link between Auckland and the North Shore, Warkworth Improvements Stage 1 and Waikato's Expressway."

The funding will  
\-advance the Manukau Harbour Crossing by one year to enable substantial completion by 2011;  
\-advance the four-laning of Longswamp to Rangariri and the Rangariri and Huntly bypasses by four or more years; and  
\-significantly improve state highway access in the Auckland area (see table of projects attached).

"By improving access to Auckland's key roads and motorways we're making it easier for people to do business, work and play in the greater Auckland area."

"We're also guaranteeing the funding by locking it in for the next five years – instead of just 1 year blocks. This will give road users and the construction industry will have more certainty about the road building programme."

"When this Government came to office we found a history and pattern of underinvestment in our infrastructure by the National government. Since 1999 we have embarked on New Zealand's biggest ever road-building programme – boosting overall funding by 134% in the past seven years."

The five-year increase would take total transport funding to $13.4 billion over the next five years – $300 million more than all revenue taken from petrol tax, road user charges and vehicle registrations.

A further announcement will be made tomorrow on a multi-million dollar funding package for the Waikato region following a report on Waikato’s transport needs from central and local government officials.

The Government will continue to work with Auckland and other local authorities on efficient and effective improvements to the public transport system. This will include how best to enable local authorities to meet their contributions to local land transport costs. It is likely that further investment into the rail system will be required to ensure the maintenance of a national network.

"The Labour-led Government regards a world-class transport network, which moves people and goods safely and efficiently, as a centrepiece of our drive to transform the New Zealand economy."
