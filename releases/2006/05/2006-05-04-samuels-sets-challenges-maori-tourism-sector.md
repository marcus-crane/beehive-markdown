Hon Dover Samuels Associate Minister of Tourism will open the New Zealand Maori Tourism Council's Wananga at Te Papa Museum on Monday 8th May.

In his opening the minister laid down a challenge to the Maori Tourism sector to  
diversify the Mâori tourism experience base to turn around the traditionally low penetration rate that Mâori tourism products have into the domestic tourists sector.

"We know that engagement in Mâori tourism products from domestic tourists has traditionally been low. I believe this is a large challenge for Mâori tourism; perhaps the answer to better domestic engagement is in diversifying the Mâori tourism experience base" said Minister Samuels

"I know at the operator level, we are seeing the development of a more diverse  
set of Mâori tourism experiences, such as Maurice's Manawatu’s tours,  
the Footprints in Waipaoa and Abel Tasman Waka tours, I vigorously support the continuation of these developments", said the minister

These types of businesses will assist in taking Mâori tourism out of the pigeon hole view of kapa haka and culture performances being the totality of Mâori tourism

Minister Samuels further added "….for Maori Tourism to be in a position to really make the most of it's indigenous point of difference, it will require trade education, a commitment from the wider industry and strong relationships with other organisations such as the RTOs, Tourism New Zealand and Inbound Operators and the like".

The Maori Tourism National Wananga will run from May 8-9,the powhiri to open the wananga will take place at the Te Papa Marae at 9.00am
