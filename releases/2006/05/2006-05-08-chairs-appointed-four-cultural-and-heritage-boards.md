Chairs appointed to four cultural and heritage boards

Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced the appointment of four new chairs of cultural and heritage boards:

- John Judge as Chair of Te Papa Tongarewa Board for a 3-year term
- Diana Fenwick as Chair of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra for a 3-year term
- Dr Ngahuia Te Awekotuku as Chair of Te Waka Toi Board for a 3-year term.
- Christopher Doig as Chair of the Council of Creative New Zealand for a 3-year term

"I am pleased that John Judge, experienced board member and Chief Executive of Ernst Young (NZ) Ltd, has accepted the position of Chair of Te Papa Tongarewa, to replace Dr Roderick Deane," Helen Clark said.

"I also want to acknowledge Diana Fenwick’s contribution to the NZSO Board as a member and as acting chair following the retirement of Sir Selwyn Cushing. Thanks to the efforts of Sir Selwyn and his board and the successful NZSO international tour in 2005, the Orchestra is in good heart.

"Dr Ngahuia Te Awekotuku will take over from Elizabeth Ellis as Chair of Te Waka Toi Board of Creative New Zealand, the body which allocates funds to Mâori creative artists throughout New Zealand.

“Dr Te Awekotuku’s two terms on the Council of Creative New Zealand have given her a wide-ranging understanding of the creative arts world and her extensive research and knowledge of Mâori tikanga and culture will bring a strong advocacy to Mâori arts.

"Christopher Doig is widely respected for his contribution and commitment to arts and sports agencies, as an opera singer, as CEO of Cricket New Zealand and as a board member and chair of several operatic and sports bodies."

Helen Clark paid tribute to Peter Biggs, outgoing Chair of the Creative New Zealand Council.

“These four appointments will add to the already excellent governance management of arts and heritage agencies. All four have developed their governance skills in Crown entity boards and I am pleased that they have agreed to share their expertise with the boards they will be chairing,” Helen Clark said.
