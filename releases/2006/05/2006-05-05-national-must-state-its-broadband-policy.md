"Nobody is fooled by National's pathetic attempts to avoid declaring where it stands on the Labour Government's bold move to deliver better, faster broadband," Communications Minister David Cunliffe says.

"All we are hearing from National are bleatings about the leak of a Cabinet paper.

"The leak does not detract from this Labour Government's comprehensive policy to ensure New Zealanders get access to the broadband we need to stay competitive in the information age."

Mr Cunliffe said National's silence on the substance of the broadband package was deafening.

"Their communications spokesperson is supposed to be Maurice Williamson. I have been unable to find any statement issued yet by him declaring where National stands on the policy's substance.

"Instead, all we see is constitutionally illiterate nonsense from Bill English, who is supposed to be their education spokesperson.

"I challenge Mr Williamson to declare National's support for this policy package that early indications suggest has been welcomed by an overwhelming proportion of New Zealanders."

Mr Cunliffe said his office had been deluged with messages of support.

"Kiwis wanted a level playing field in broadband and the Labour Government is delivering as we promised.

"It's time for National to wake up and smell the coffee. They should declare now whether they support this economically vital package so the public can judge them on their policy, or continuing lack thereof."
