National Deputy Leader Gerry Brownlee's backtrack from his plan to challenge the party's policy on the Maori seats wasn't quick enough to stop the public from getting a glimpse of National's true colours, Justice Minister Mark Burton says.

"Mr Brownlee's slip of the tongue again showed that there are no bottom lines for National and that it was only a matter of time before the party would cynically reverse its policy on the Maori seats in order to secure Maori party support.

"For National, winning power meant that nothing was off the table, including dropping their core platforms such as the abolition of the Maori seats.

"Mr Brownlee's gaffe also showed us the real reason for Don Brash's recent accusations of bias in holding the Maori electoral option.

"Concerns about the Maori option were simply a smokescreen for the National leadership facing the reality of desperately attempting to justify a policy flip-flop to its members and the public.

"Mr Brownlee's gaffe shows that political expediency and raw ambition always trump party policy in National."
