New Zealand looks forward to working with the new Solomon Islands’ Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, as the country moves ahead after last month’s troubles, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Mr Sogavare was elected Prime Minister at Parliament in Honiara today.

Governor-General Sir Nathaniel Waena announced the election of the Prime Minister which was received peacefully by a crowd of about 250 people at Parliament.

“The riots of two weeks ago demonstrated clearly the depth of the problems that Solomon Islands still faces,’’ Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand looks forward to continuing to address those issues in partnership with Mr Sogavare and the Solomon Islands people.”

New Zealand has participated in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, addressing issues of stability and governance, since its inception in 2003. The Government has also worked with Mr Sogavare during his previous term as prime minister in 2000-2001.

Mr Peters and Australia’s Foreign Minister Alexander Downer will meet to discuss Solomon Islands around the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum in Auckland, which begins tomorrow.

Mr Peters and Mr Downer will be seeking an invitation to visit Solomon Islands and call on Mr Sogavare later this month.
