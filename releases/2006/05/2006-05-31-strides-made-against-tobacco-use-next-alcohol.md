Progressive leader Jim Anderton addressed the Drug Foundation's 2nd Annual Policy Roundtable conference in Wellington this morning on the issues of young people and drugs.

"I am involved in overseeing the implementation of the National Drug Policy, which has a whole-of-government approach to addressing the harm resulting from tobacco, alcohol, illicit and other drug use. Central to the policy is the concept of preventing and minimising harm from drugs. Public consultation is underway and submissions on the new draft National Drug Policy 2006-2011 are welcome. Submissions close on June 9," Jim Anderton said today.

"There are all types of drugs out there aimed at enticing our youth into drug use. Methamphetamine, cannabis, party pills, and the myriad of other drugs, which pose various degrees of danger and risk of harm. But tobacco first, and then alcohol, are the main culprits when you look at the numbers of New Zealanders suffering the serious effects of drug abuses.

"Giant steps have been made in the campaign against tobacco use and I believe evidence-based action can also deliver success against alcohol and other substance abuse as well.

"Progress in and around alcohol policy is being made with initiatives like the government review of alcohol advertising, the ALAC culture change campaign and the consideration by a parliamentary select committee of a Member's Bill to raise the purchasing age of alcohol to 20 years. That Bill is to be reported back to Parliament in September and means all parliamentarians will have the opportunity to debate and vote on a measure, which I believe the evidence strongly supports," he said.

"Today is World Smoke-free Day. How about we aim for a day free of alcohol and the associated violence and harm that the evidence shows flows from such misuse of alcohol?

In his speech today Jim Anderton, who chairs the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy, also discussed the coalition government's evidence-based policies on methamphetamine, cannabis and other drugs.
