The government welcomes Telecom's commitment to review its strategy in response to public support for the telecommunications package announced last week.

"While the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, this looks like it is a positive response to the Labour-led government's package," Communications Minister David Cunliffe said today.

"I will look forward to working with Telecom and other key players to ensure the reforms proceed effectively in the best interests of consumers and all New Zealanders.

"We look forward to seeing tangible demonstrations of Telecom's new approach in the marketplace soon."
