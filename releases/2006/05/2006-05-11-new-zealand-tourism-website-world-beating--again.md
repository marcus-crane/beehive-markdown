The website www.newzealand.com has won the international Webby award for the best tourism website in the world for the second time.

The Webbys recognise online achievement and innovation and are managed by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. Websites are nominated and voted on by their membership, which includes musician David Bowie, businesswoman Anita Roddick and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening.

Tourism New Zealand's consumer website beat international contenders including the Earth Cam, Select Italy and Great Australian Spaces.

Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said: "www.newzealand.com has won several New Zealand-based website awards in the past but a second Webby recognises the international calibre of their online work.

"The tourism world is highly competitive, and this new award shows how sophisticated and cutting-edge New Zealand's marketing is."

www.newzealand.com is designed to market New Zealand as an attractive holiday destination, and help international visitors plan their trip. Over 300,000 users visit the site every month.

Innovative tools on the site include the ‘Travel Planner’, which enables visitors to create, plan and share a personalised New Zealand itinerary, and an interactive television commercial where users can explore parts of New Zealand featured in the ad.

The award recognises the work of Tourism New Zealand, and their online agency, Shift. The company has collaborated closely with Tourism New Zealand since 1999 to develop the online execution of the 100% Pure New Zealand advertising campaign. Tourism New Zealand and Shift join previous winners of this category including Lonely Planet, The New York Times and Expedia.
