Budget 2006 will help to ensure victims of crime have access to effective support services, Justice Minister Mark Burton said today.

More than $10.8m will be allocated over the next four years for the restructuring of Victim Support, which began in 2004.

The funding will go toward ensuring that the organisation's structure and staff can effectively meet the needs of the public, and will include the hiring of more practice specialists and other key staff.

"Although [Victim Support](http://www.victimsupport.org.nz/) will always have a core volunteer work force, the record numbers of people in employment and the growing need for specialist support means that additional funding will put Victim Support in a stronger position to support the victims of crime in the future," Mark Burton said.

"This initiative means that there will be the right people in place to ensure that improvements in the quality and consistency of services reach those who need it most, particularly the victims of serious and violent crime.

"Meeting the needs of the victims of crime is central to the Labour-led government's direction and objectives for New Zealand's Justice system.

"Labour is the only party to have ever passed legislation enshrining victims' rights - in 1987 and again in [2002](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=132614&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B8C1FC888%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC).

"We want strong families living in safe and secure communities so that all New Zealanders, young and old, can share in the progress this country is making."

The announcement was made in a [speech in Upper Hutt today](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25739), outlining key elements of the direction of the Justice sector for the rest of this electoral term and beyond.
