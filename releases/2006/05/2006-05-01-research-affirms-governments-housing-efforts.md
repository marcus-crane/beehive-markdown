New research by the Wellington School of Medicine showing significant health benefits from state housing demonstrates why the government has made such a massive investment in the Housing portfolio, Housing Minister Chris Carter says.

"National sold 13,000 state houses in the 1990s leaving a legacy of huge unmet housing need, disease and poverty. Since 1999, the Labour-Progressive government has been working to rebuild the state housing network, and get more families in to houses," Mr Carter said.

"Over the past six years we have added more than 5,000 homes back into the state housing network, as well as refitting numerous other state homes to make them warmer and healthier. Research published today by the Wellington School of Medicine demonstrates why."

The research shows that the health of tenants in state houses improves significantly once they move from the waiting list to being in state houses. For instance, acute hospital attendances were 10 per cent lower in Housing New Zealand tenants compared with those on waiting lists for state housing. Admissions for asthma were 18 per cent lower.

"This research makes it clear just how important to a family's health and wellbeing a good quality, affordable home is," Mr Carter said.

"It demonstrates why Labour has acquired so many new houses for the state house network, and it demonstrates the on going legacy of poor health that National's irresponsible policies have left us with."
