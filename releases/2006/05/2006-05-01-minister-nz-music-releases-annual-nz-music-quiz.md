Judith Tizard has released her annual NZ music quiz to all Members of Parliament today as part of New Zealand Music Month.

"New Zealand Music Month is an opportunity to promote New Zealand music and increase airplay of New Zealand music on commercial radio. It’s also an opportunity to celebrate New Zealand musicians and their talents."

"My annual music quiz is a fun way to get my colleagues thinking about New Zealand music and its importance to us – it helps cement our sense of national identity and contributes to our economy. So it doesn’t really matter if they lean on google to help them out.

Entries close midday Wednesday 10 May and prizes will be awarded to the top five entries from MPs and include New Zealand Music Month t-shirts and CDs by New Zealand musicians.

Over the past four years there has been a rapid increase in New Zealand music being played on commercial radio.

"We had hoped to increase airplay to 20% by the end of 2006. But the radio industry has already outstripped the targets by playing 20.77% local music last year.

"Last year four of the top five most played songs on our radio were New Zealand songs – who would have imagined that ten or even five years ago?"

"This Labour–led government is committed to supporting New Zealand music. The New Zealand Music Code is an initiative that has been embraced wholeheartedly by the recording and broadcasting industries and has proven a stunning success since its inception in 2002.

"The government is promoting our music overseas by funding the New Zealand Music Industry Commission's 'Outward Sound'. And NZ On Air's 'Phase Five' programme helps support New Zealand musicians wanting to record and perform overseas.

"This month I encourage all New Zealanders to celebrate New Zealand music. Let's all sing, play and buy New Zealand music this month".
