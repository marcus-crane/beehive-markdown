The Ministry for the Environment’s Warm Homes project is funding $250,000 towards a study which examines the effects of the indoor environment on asthmatic children and their families.

The study is being carried out by the He Kainga Oranga/Housing and Health Research Programme at the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Otago.

Minister for the Environment David Benson-Pope said the research will examine the impact on family health after changing to more sustainable forms of heating such as heat pumps, wood pellet burners and flued gas.

The study has recruited around 400 households who have a child with asthma, of 7-12 years of age, in Dunedin, Porirua, Lower Hutt, Christchurch and Bluff.

Every household that participates in the full study will get a new heater and will be insulated, if they are not already. The heaters are new-generation healthier, energy efficient heaters that may make it cheaper to heat more of the house.

“We support initiatives that help New Zealanders make better choices when it comes to home heating because a warm, healthy home not only improves people’s health, it also reduces air pollution,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The researchers will compare the health and energy consumption of families with the new heaters to those still living with the old ones. These new heaters match the ones that are recommended through the Warm Homes project.

“This research investment will help shape our analysis in respect of household heating behaviour. It complements research already being done in Tokoroa and Timaru,” he said.

The first phase of the study was carried out last winter and starts again over this winter period.

The core grant for the study comes from the Health Research Council, and other investors include Contact Energy and the Hutt Valley District Health Board. The total budget for the project is $3 million over three years.

### Background information: Warm Homes project

New Zealand has clean air most of the time in most places. There are some problems in some areas, however. Air pollution causes a range of significant health problems, including respiratory diseases, asthma attacks, reduced immunity and even premature deaths. Many of these problems are preventable.

The majority of air pollution comes from domestic heating. Domestic solid fuel burners and open fires are the main source of fine particles in most urban areas. That is why it is important for New Zealand families to install cleaner heating and make their homes more healthy and energy efficient in an affordable way. Insulation and more efficient forms of heating play an important part in this.

To help New Zealanders reduce the effects of home heating while staying warm, the Ministry for the Environment is working with a range of central and local government agencies and industry on the Warm Homes project. The Warm Homes project aims to ensure that New Zealanders heat their homes sufficiently, cleanly and efficiently.

The ‘Housing, Heating and Health’ research of the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences is consistent with work previously funded under the Warm Homes project - in particular, the small scale retrofit trials in Tokoroa (19 properties) and Timaru (29 properties). It is an ideal extension to the project.

The government has provided more than $2 million to fund a range of initiatives that assist local government meet new air quality targets:

- $800,000 for new air quality monitoring for 15 councils in the country
- $500,000 to assist Environment Canterbury’s Clean Heat scheme in the retrofit of 200 properties
- $250,000 to assist Nelson City Council’s Clean Heat/Warm Homes scheme in the retrofit of 70 properties
- $100,000 to survey home heating in New Zealand
- $70,000 for understanding the social drivers behind home heating choice
- $50,000 for evaluating different heating types
- $100,000 for two Warm Homes trials in Tokoroa and Timaru; and
- $160,000 for a new study examining the performance review of the wood burner standard.
