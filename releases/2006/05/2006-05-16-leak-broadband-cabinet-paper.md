Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that she has received the State Services Commissioner's report into the leak of the broadband Cabinet paper and its finding that it was the result of dishonest behaviour by a single employee.

"The report makes it clear this leak was a result of dishonest behaviour from a person employed at a low level in a government department. He was a messenger in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

"I am advised that employee has now been dismissed and the matter is being referred to the police by the State Services Commission.

"The Chief Executive of DPMC has offered me his full apology. He offered his resignation. I have not accepted it on the ground that it is not appropriate for a senior public servant's career to be ended by the dishonesty of a low level employee. It is clear that the systems in place for document handling have been in place for many years and there is no evidence they have been abused before.

"I expect the system to be reviewed in the wake of this report, but I accept that the best system will not thwart blatant dishonesty," Helen Clark said.
