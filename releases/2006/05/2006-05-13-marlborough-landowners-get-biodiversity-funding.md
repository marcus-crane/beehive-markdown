Marlborough District landowners are getting $94,500 in grant funding to help protect to help preserve wildlife and natural habitat.

Te Tai Tonga MP & Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa announced that Alpine Discovery Ltd, owners of Puhi Peaks Nature Reserve , is getting $32,000 to kill mustelids, rodents and possums. The Puhi Peaks reserve, registered with the QEII National Trust, is home to one of the world's only two colonies of the endangered Hutton Shearwater.

Marlborough District Council is getting three grants. The largest, $19,000, goes towards a 3km fence to protect 25 hectares on one of the most outer heads of the Marlborough Sounds. The property uniquely contains good-sized areas of scarce kohekohe forest and protects a land snail population. A further grant of $10,000 will help Peter and Patricia Cashin control weeds in their restored wetland on Hillocks Road. And a grant of $3,000 will help control grey and crack willows over stream margins and a wetland area south of Seddon, home to the largest harakeke swamp in the ecological district.

Ron and Gerry Marriott are getting $17,500 to help assess the removal of 2,500 sheep from their Queen Charlotte Wilderness Park. "Land retirement " is seen as a model for legal protection of property as a carbon sink.

Weyerhaeuser NZ is getting $3,000 to control old mans beard in indigenous forest. Weyerhaeuser is also getting $10,000 for a control and management plan of contorta pine in Golden Downs Forest near Nelson.

The local grants are part of an announcement by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Conservation Minister Chris Carter that $1.3 million is being distributed to 104 projects across the country.

"Many fragmented areas of native bush and wetland now only exist on private land, and this funding makes a significant difference for landowners and community groups working to restore and preserve unique New Zealand fauna and flora," said Mahara Okeroa.

The Biodiversity Condition and Advice funds were established in 2000 under the $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package. The next funding round is now open: see www.biodiversity.govt.nz, or call 0800 86 20 20.
