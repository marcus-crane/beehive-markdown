How will our houses and buildings look and perform in future? That's the question the Government wants New Zealanders to help decide.

Building Issues Minister, Clayton Cosgrove has today launched a discussion document, "Building for the 21st Century – Review of the Building Code."

The Code sets the performance-based standards for building design and construction, and this will be its first substantive review since its introduction in 1991.

"This Labour-led government is committed to ensuring New Zealanders have high quality homes and buildings that are built right the first time, and suit their needs."

“The review will change what we build and the way we build, because we expect a lot more from our buildings than we did 15 years ago,” Mr Cosgrove said.

“There have been significant advances in construction technologies and in our knowledge of building products and performance. A modern Code must reflect that."

Mr Cosgrove said key issues include energy efficiency and the impacts of New Zealand’s changing population. The document proposes a wider scope and content for the Code's objectives of safety, health, wellbeing, and sustainable development.

"Our cities are intensifying, with apartment living becoming an increasingly popular option. We want buildings to provide a healthy living environment in terms of indoor air quality and temperature, noise exposure, and security, among other factors," said Mr Cosgrove.

"The review must also balance short term cost with long term benefits - for example, where insulating a house leads to major savings on power bills."

Environmental factors such as climate change see the proposed introduction of coastal erosion to the Code's existing list of hazards affecting structural safety standards, as well as considering tsunami, wildfire, landslide and volcanic eruption.

Mr Cosgrove said a second discussion document with detailed performance criteria would be published next year, with the entire review scheduled for completion by November 2007. The new Code is projected to take effect in 2008.

"I urge Kiwis to stake a claim in their housing future by making a submission,” Mr Cosgrove said.

"This review is a crucial element in the current transformation of the building sector, which includes the introduction of builder licensing, better outcomes for leaky-homes owners, product certification, a better consent and inspection process and consumer warranties for building work."

### Media Backgrounder

**Why is the Building Code being reviewed?**  
The review is required under the [Building Act 2004](http://www.building.govt.nz/). This is to ensure the Code is setting clear performance standards that are easy to understand, and reflect society's expectations of homes and buildings. The Act also requires buildings to have attributes that promote safety, health, wellbeing and sustainable development.

**What is “Building for the 21st Century – Review of the Building Code” about?**  
This public discussion document is designed to stimulate debate about how homes and buildings should look and perform in the future. It is the result of the Department of Building and Housing's 2004/2005 workshops with industry, consumer groups and other government departments on what is expected of the Code. It raises a wide range of issues and the government is seeking public feedback.

**What is in the Discussion Document?**

Background information on the Building Code and its objectives

The proposed scope and content of the new Building Code for New Zealand.

Information on how performance criteria will be developed and the Code’s relationship with compliance documents (methods of achieving compliance)

It sets out a new format for the Code so the performance requirements will be more specific and it will be easier to understand and to use

**Why aren't detailed code requirements in the public discussion document?**  
This consultation is about broad issues and outcomes. A second discussion document with detailed proposed performance criteria will be published in 2007.

**What will the new Building Code mean for me?**  
There will be more certainty for Code users, while still allowing for innovation. The review is likely to further develop the performance-based nature of the Code. Consumers will have the reassurance of having a quality home or building that suits modern lifestyles and expectations, and meets energy and environmental realities.

**Will the new Building Code mean higher costs?**  
Any changes to the Building Code will only be made after thorough consideration of the potential costs and benefits. One consideration in developing the new Code is doing things smarter and paying a little more up front to obtain long-term benefits. For example, installing insulation leads to lower heating costs. Building materials' durability and maintenance will also be considered.

**When will there be a new Building Code?**  
The review of the Building Code is scheduled for completion by 30 November 2007. This will be followed by the implementation of changes to the Building Code, and to compliance documents that support the Building Code. The new Code will be phased in, along with an education programme, to ensure a smooth transition. The government may propose amendments to the existing Building Code and compliance documents ahead of changes following this full review.

**Where can I get a copy of the discussion document?**

- on the Department's website [www.dbh.govt.nz](http://www.dbh.govt.nz) along with an electronic submission form, or
