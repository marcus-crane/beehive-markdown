Trade Minister Phil Goff today congratulated Kiwi businesses on successfully entering the rapidly growing Vietnamese market.

Speaking in Viet Nam, he welcomed the progress of New Zealanders in selling an increasing volume of goods and services in the fastest growing market in South East Asia.

Kiwi snow-capped mountains and a log fire were the unusual backdrop to the start of Mr Goff's three-day visit, as he officially opening the X-Cream Café in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, owned by New Zealand entrepreneur Hamish Stalker and his Vietnamese business partner, Le Ha Vu Vy.

“The café sells as its signature food item New Zealand ice cream manufactured by the Deep South Ice Cream Company, based in Invercargill," Mr Goff said.

“At the same event we also launched the Alpha Domus (Hawke's Bay) wine label in Viet Nam for New Zealand exporter Ollie Powie.

“Most of the 80 invited guests were New Zealanders running businesses in the food, consultancy, education, hospitality, construction and furniture industries.

“Tomorrow we visit the Stompcraft boat building company, established by New Zealander Steve Thompson and his Australian partners. Most of the equipment -- winches, pumps, electronics, sails, spars, and resins – are imported using proved New Zealand design and technology.

“Last year New Zealand exports to Viet Nam grew by 10 per cent on the previous year, to $152 million. Considerable potential exists to do more and with New Zealand’s recently concluded bilateral trade negotiations with Viet Nam, and its entry into the WTO this year, trade should continue to boom.

“Education, where new Vietnamese student enrolments for study in New Zealand grew by 34 per cent last year, is a real success story. And Zedex Mining, which has just been awarded a major mining investment licence, will soon be New Zealand’s largest investment in Vietnam.

“This is great news for New Zealand exporters and investors.”

Mr Goff is in Viet Nam for a two-day APEC Trade Ministers meeting.
