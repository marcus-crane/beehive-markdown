New Zealand’s next Ambassador to The Hague will be career diplomat Rachel Fry, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today. Ms Fry will also have responsibility for New Zealand’s relations with Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark.

“I am confident Rachel Fry’s experience in foreign affairs and trade negotiation will serve New Zealand well in the Netherlands and the other countries to which she will be accredited. New Zealand has a close connection with the Nordic countries that is continually growing and developing.

“The Netherlands has traditionally been one of our best friends in Europe with ties forged through shared experience in war, migration and the mutual exchange of ideas. We share a principled approach to international relations, and as small countries, we both place great importance in the multilateral system.

“This is a significant year for Dutch-New Zealand relations. New Zealand is honoured to be hosting a visit by the Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima at the end of the year,” Mr Peters said.

Ms Fry joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1988 from the Department of Trade and Industry and was most recently the Director of the Ministry’s Information Technology Division. She was the lead negotiator on the New Zealand-Thailand Closer Economic Partnership. Her previous overseas assignments have included Canberra and Paris.

She will take up her assignment in August replacing David Payton who is returning to Wellington.
