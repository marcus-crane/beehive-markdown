Justice Minister Mark Burton announced today that Rosslyn Noonan has been appointed to a second five-year term as Chief Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission.

"Rosslyn Noonan was appointed Chief Commissioner in 2001 at a time of significant change for the Human Rights Commission," Mark Burton said.

"Ms Noonan successfully oversaw changes to the Commission that followed amendments to the Human Rights Act in 2002. These changes included the merger between the Commission and the Race Relations Office and the establishment of the roles of Race Relations Commissioner and Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Commissioner.

"During her time the Commission has strengthened its ability as an advocate for human rights and has developed relationships across a broad range of sectors to advance human rights in New Zealand.

"I have every confidence that Rosslyn Noonan will successfully lead the Commission into its next stage of development and further the cause of human rights in what is often a highly charged environment," Mark Burton said.

The primary functions of the Human Rights Commission are to:  
§advocate and promote respect for, and an understanding and appreciation of, human rights in New Zealand society;  
§encourage the maintenance and development of harmonious relationships between individuals and among the diverse groups in New Zealand society.

To carry out its functions the Commission provides education and information about human rights and can inquire into human rights matters. The Commission also has the power to resolve disputes relating to unlawful discrimination.

Before she joined the Commission, Ms Noonan held the position of Trade Union and Human Rights Co-ordinator with Education International and was based in Brussels for four years. She also has extensive experience in the New Zealand trade union movement.

Human Rights Commissioners are appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Justice Minister for terms of up to five years.
