Minister for Courts Rick Barker today announced that Budget 2006 will contain a fees increase for many of the Judicial and Statutory Officers who serve on Tribunals and Authorities administered by the Ministry of Justice.

Judicial and Statutory Officers perform vital functions as members of a wide variety of Tribunals and authorities like the Disputes Tribunal, Tenancy Tribunal and Human Rights Review Tribunal.

“Many Judicial and Statutory Officers have not had any form of remuneration review for several years, some going as far back as 1988. These bodies deal with complex and difficult issues that require highly capable judicial officers. The pool of suitable people for many tribunals is small, so adequate levels of remuneration are essential to attract the right people.

"The Budget announcements result from work I asked the Ministry of Justice to commission to review the level of remuneration payable to various Judicial and Statutory Officers. That review carried out by Joanna Beresford and the announcements made today means there will be a coherent and integrated platform to enable us to move forward with the management of remuneration issues in the future that is a more consistent representation of output across the tribunals," said Mr Barker.

In 2004, Mr Barker commissioned an independent review of the levels of remuneration for Judicial and Statutory officers. The report recommended fees increases for around two thirds of Officers to remove inequities and address fee levels. The increases announced today will be backdated to July 2005.

Fees are paid to Officers for serving in their official capacity, normally on a part time basis. Generally fees are paid as a daily rate that is set to fit within the ranges prescribed by the Cabinet Fees Framework. The State Service Commission administers the Cabinet Fees Framework.

The table below shows those officers who will benefit from the increases announced today and the existing and new rates of remuneration:

All rates are expressed as daily rates unless otherwise specified.
