Courts Minister Rick Barker, officially launched today a Government initiative designed to help parents going through separation to help their children.

"This information programme for parents “How to Help Your Kids When You Separate” is designed to assist parents and children through this change in their lives," said Mr Barker.

The Government has committed over $6 million until 2009 and $1.7 million each year after that for this programme, which is available free of charge to up to 15,000 parents per year with dependent children who are contemplating or undergoing separation.

“The Ministry of Justice Information Programme for Parents is a tangible outcome from the introduction of the Care of Children Act 2004, which was introduced last year.

"The Act makes the welfare of the child the most important priority and promotes co-operative parenting. The Act also made the law more consistent with the responsibilities parents have towards their children. This programme is a tool to help parents achieve this,” Mr Barker said.

This programme was developed from the successful pilot programme “Children in the Middle”, run by the Auckland Family Courts Association since November 2004. An evaluation of the “Children In The Middle” programme showed a reduction in parent conflict, an improvement in children’s behaviour and well-being, an increase in parent’s knowledge about the impact of separation on children and a very high level of satisfaction by participants.

Mr Barker says "the Ministry of Justice Programme is intended to provide advice to parents so they can understand and manage the effect of separation on their children. When there’s a relationship break up, everyone in the family has to come to terms with many changes. That’s all hard on the parents. But while the adults have their own issues, any children involved have feelings and emotions they may not be able to understand or deal with."

The Programme is structured to help parents who have separated, or who are in the process of separating, to understand their children's needs and how to communicate with each other and their children to ensure the best outcome for the children.

“Research tells us a lot about how children react to separation and what helps and what harms. The psychologists and people involved in developing this programme know that simple strategies put in place by parents can make a real difference for children," said Mr Barker.

The Programme is also intended to help children maintain a positive relationship with both parents and the extended family following separation.

“The Ministry of Justice Information Programme for Parents, will help parents understand separation from the child’s point of view which can make a positive impact on how parents behave,” said Mr Barker.

Another important part of the programme is to help parents communicate better so that they are able to provide the best parenting possible to their children at this time.

"The programme is free to parents and completely voluntary. It is being delivered across nearly 170 sites nationally by 41 experienced providers contracted to the Ministry of Justice. The range of providers takes into account the diversity of family make-up and ethnicity in New Zealand today," said Mr Barker
