A unique project to build an authentic classical Chinese Garden in Dunedin has been awarded up to $3.7 million from a new fund to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Prime Minister Helen Clark today met Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin, who is also the Chairperson of the Chinese Gardens Trust, to be shown design plans and to announce the project will receive the grant.

"The Dunedin Chinese Garden will be a spectacular site, with hopes that it will become a significant tourist attraction for the country," Helen Clark said.

"It will acknowledge the sister-city connection between Dunedin and Shanghai, and honour the role that the Chinese community played in the settlement of Otago and the rest of the country.

"The garden will be constructed on a site gifted by Dunedin City Council, adjacent to the Otago Settlers Museum, and will feature pavilions, courtyards, water features, terraces, and display galleries.

"The project is also supported by Shanghai local government and museum officials, who will help guide the design, construction, and maintenance of the garden.

"These growing links with Shanghai are reflected in the establishment of the first direct air link between New Zealand and Shanghai in November this year.

"The Chinese community has made a significant contribution to this country through its culture and heritage, and the government is pleased to support this worthwhile project," Helen Clark said.

The grant is being made available through the Significant Community Based Projects Fund, which was announced in the 2005 Budget to address funding issues faced by a growing number of large and important community projects.

[The Fund](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Community-Funding-Significant-Community-Based-Projects-Fund?OpenDocument) is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, which together with five other government bodies formulated recommendations to Cabinet for final decision.

Cabinet guidelines stipulate that the objective of the Fund is to support major community-based projects which have significant support from and participation by the community, with a range of regional or national benefits.

Particular importance is attached to projects in the fields of

arts, culture and heritage;

sport and recreation;

conservation and environment;

tourism; and

economic development.

Helen Clark said further announcements would be made over the coming week about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year. There will be two further funding rounds.
