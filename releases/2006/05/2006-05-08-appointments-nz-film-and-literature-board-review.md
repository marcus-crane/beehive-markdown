Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker has announced appointments to the Film and Literature Board of Review.

The Film and Literature Board of Review is a statutory appeal body. It examines publications already classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (the Chief Censor’s Office). Each publication is examined without regard to the initial classification.

“On 31 May 2004 the terms of eight members of the Film and Literature Board of Review expired. Changes to relevant legislation and the 2005 General Election caused considerable delays in the appointment process for these positions. The eight members agreed to remain in office until such time as the appointment process could be completed.

The process is now complete and I am happy to announce the reappointment the eight incumbent members of the [Board](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Agency-Film-and-Literature-Board-of-Review-Index?OpenDocument).

The terms of appointment will be varied, so that in future years all eight vacancies will not arise at the same time.

Claudia Elliott has been reappointed as President, and Mark Andersen as member for terms commencing on 20 April 2006 and concluding on 31 March 2009.

Greg Presland has been reappointed as Deputy President, Dr Brian McDonnell and Marion Orme as members for terms commencing on 20 April 2006 and concluding on 31 March 2008.

Peter Cartwright, Dr Lalita Rajasingham and Stephen Stelhin have been reappointed as members for terms commencing on 20 April 2006 and concluding on 31 March 2007.

All members bring valuable experience and expertise in a range of areas such as law, science, education, media, communications and information technology,” said Mr Barker.

“Each member has a high level of integrity and is experienced in dealing with the publications of the sensitive nature likely to come before the Board”.

Mr Barker thanked all organisations that nominated people for the roles, and thanked the individuals who had made themselves available.

“There is sometimes controversy about [decisions of the Board](http://www.dia.govt.nz/pubforms.nsf/wpg_Publications_FLBRD?Openview) and those who put themselves forward as willing to serve the public in this way deserve gratitude and respect for their willingness to carry out a task requiring judgment, discernment and an understanding of public attitudes.”
