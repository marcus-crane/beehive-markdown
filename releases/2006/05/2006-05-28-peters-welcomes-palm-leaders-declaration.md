The principal outcome of the fourth Japan-Pacific Islands Forum (PALM) Summit was a Leaders’ Declaration named the Okinawa Partnership which outlines Japan’s new Pacific assistance plan, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said.

Mr Peters' attendance at the PALM Summit concluded yesterday. He was joined at the Summit by the Leaders of Japan and fourteen Pacific Island countries, as well as the Australian Foreign Minister, to discuss the challenges the Pacific region faces.

In addition to the Okinawa Partnership, Japan, New Zealand and Australia also issued a Joint Statement on Enhanced Donor Cooperation, which noted the intention of the three governments to strengthen their dialogue on development issues, promote the harmonisation of their assistance efforts in the Pacific and work together to support the Pacific Plan.

"This represents an important and progressive move for the three countries involved and will serve to improve outcomes for our Pacific region," Mr Peters said.
