He koanga ngakau, he mâpuna aroha kei te mihia ki te manu a korokî.  
“This year we celebrate a remarkable milestone—the 40th Coronation Anniversary of Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu,” Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.  
“It is a wonderful achievement for Aotearoa, by a gracious and compassionate woman, born to lead.”  
Te Arikinui’s reign began on 23 May 1966 when she was elected at the tangi of her father King Koroki to succeed him. Then, she was the sixth in succession and the first woman to hold the mantle of paramount leader of Te Kingitanga.  
“During her reign Te Arikinui has raised the profile of the Kingitanga to its most significant level. Few people in Aotearoa would not know of her unselfish service to Mâori throughout the last 40 years; her constant and unfailing support for contemporary and traditional Mâori art and craft; her encouragement of her people to pursue quality and excellence in everything they do - from sports to tribal enterprise and management, and her generous hospitality to all including the many visiting dignitaries who call on her each year.”  
“As the Minister of Mâori Affairs, I extend my warmest congratulations to Te Arikinui, Te Kingitanga, and to the people of Tainui as we all celebrate 40 years of leadership of the Kingitanga.”  
E Te Arikinui e noho nei ki tô ahurewa tapu a ô mâtua tûpuna kei te mihi, kei te mihi atu râ.
