Mr Ron Prosor, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Wellington on 31 May to call on Foreign Minister Winston Peters and conduct discussions with New Zealand officials on bilateral and international issues.

Mr Prosor, whose delegation included Israeli Ambassador, Naftali Tamir, is the most senior Israeli official to visit New Zealand since 1984.

"I welcomed the visit as an opportunity to discuss issues of common interest, particularly in respect of New Zealand's relations with Israel, and the outlook to the Middle East peace process.

“New Zealand appreciates the very difficult challenges that face Israel and the Middle East region in seeking to establish a durable peace. Our shared democratic traditions provide a good basis for a productive dialogue and Mr Prosor’s visit was an opportunity to carry forward relations between our two countries,” said Mr Peters.
