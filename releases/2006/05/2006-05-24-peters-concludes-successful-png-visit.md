Foreign Minister Winston Peters departed Papua New Guinea this morning, having concluded a successful bilateral visit.

Mr Peters met with Foreign Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu and Acting Prime Minister Sir Moi Avei.

“My visit presented an excellent opportunity to debrief my counterpart following our recent visits to Solomon Islands. Sir Rabbie and I share the view that the Regional Assistance Mission (RAMSI) has played, and continues to play, a critical role in Solomon Islands,” said Mr Peters.

“I discussed a range of other bilateral and regional issues with Sir Rabbie and Sir Moi, such as the current situation in Bougainville, and the issue of seasonal labour mobility in the Pacific.

“PNG is also facing a number of complex development challenges, particularly the spread of HIV/AIDS. The New Zealand Government, through NZAID, will continue to assist PNG to fight this problem,” said Mr Peters.

Papua New Guinea is traditionally New Zealand’s largest development partner, with an aid programme amounting to NZ$18 million in the current financial year. Mr Peters also visited the “9 Mile” Health Clinic, assisted by NZAID, and the Bomana War Cemetery. This was Mr Peter’s first visit to Papua New Guinea.
