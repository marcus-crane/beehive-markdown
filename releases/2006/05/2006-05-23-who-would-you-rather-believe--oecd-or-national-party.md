An average New Zealand family with two children will have the lowest tax burden in the OECD thanks to the Working for Families package, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope told Parliament today.

Mr Benson-Pope told Parliament that OECD data confirms that for a single earner family with two children, on average earnings, Working For Families tax credits have taken New Zealand from having the eighth lowest tax take, to having the fifth lowest tax take, in the OECD.

"In the process New Zealand has overtaken Australia – lying in sixth place," says Mr Benson-Pope. "The 1 April extension of Working For Families will further reduce the overall tax take. If other countries remain unchanged, New Zealand will be ranked the lowest in the OECD for tax take.

"For families with children, Working for Families has made a big difference. Of course, these aren't facts that the National Party want to share with New Zealanders as they continuously talk up Australia and talk down their own country.

"The National Party has confirmed that it would borrow billions of dollars and cut health and education spending to deliver their misguided and poorly targeted tax cuts. What they haven't given us is a serious alternative approach to targeted tax relief that tells New Zealand families whether they will lose the tax relief they currently get under Working For Families to pay for tax cuts for high income earners."

Mr Benson-Pope says the OECD also confirms that for an average person, the overall tax take, taking into account all government contributions, transfers and tax credits, as a proportion of gross earnings, is already lower in New Zealand than Australia.

"Even after Australia's recent Budget, Treasury advise that New Zealand's tax wedge for the average family will remain lower than Australia's – Australia's tax cuts being targeted at the higher tax thresholds.

"National keeps claiming the grass is always greener in Australia. Ordinary New Zealanders need to know that the OECD doesn't see it that way," says Mr Benson-Pope.
