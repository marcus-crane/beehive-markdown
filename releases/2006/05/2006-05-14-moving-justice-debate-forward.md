Tackling the problem of the growing prison population is one of the key challenges facing the Justice sector, Justice Minister Mark Burton said today.

The comments were made in a [speech](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25739) to the Prison Fellowship Conference in Upper Hutt today outlining the direction of the Justice sector for the rest of this electoral term and beyond.

"This Government's vision for the justice sector sees a society and an economy where all families, young and old are safe and secure so that they are able to reach their full potential and prosper. To achieve this, our Government will continue to address crime with policy that reduces its occurrence, helps victims and targets repeat offenders and hardened criminals and their activity," Mark Burton said.

"We still have to be tough on crime and its causes and we are, but I believe this doesn't even begin to tell the full story of what we want to achieve in the Justice sector, and the complexity of some of the issues we face as a nation."

The Minister outlined five pillars that underpin the Government's objectives. These are:

- Making crime prevention work;
- Putting in place effective sanctions that address crime and criminal offending, which have the confidence of the public;
- Improving public access to justice;
- Maintaining the integrity of the justice system;
- Modernising legal frameworks.

"Important progress has been made in addressing the needs of the victims of crime though there is still more to do. In fact Labour is the only party to have ever passed legislation enshrining victims' rights – in 1987 and again in 2002.

"Restorative justice programmes have proved to be positive in helping to meet the needs of many victims of crime. We continue to look at policy to further meet these needs. With this is mind I welcome the inquiry into the rights of the victims of crime that was agreed to between the Greens and the Government and got underway this month."

In the speech Mark Burton also announced that more than $10.8 million of additional funding will be allocated over the next four years to [Victim Support](http://www.victimsupport.org.nz/) for completing the restructuring of the organisation, and for its ongoing resourcing, as part of the upcoming budget. "The funding will go toward ensuring that the organisation's structure and staff can meet the needs of the public, and will include the hiring of more practice specialists and other key staff.

"Meeting the needs of the victims of crime is central to this Government's direction and objectives for the New Zealand justice system.

"There is no doubt that there have been significant positive impacts from the reform of the Justice sector carried out since 1999. The crime rate in New Zealand is now down as low today as it was 25 years ago. Prosecutions continue to rise, with the number of prosecutions in 2004 the highest since 1989, while New Zealand’s most serious offenders are being imprisoned for longer.

"However, there have been some down sides. The area of greatest concern, which has been the focus of much public debate recently, is the growing prison population.

"As we are all very much aware, New Zealand’s incarceration rate is high. In my view, New Zealand’s increasing rate of imprisonment is not sustainable, either financially or socially. Every dollar we spend on a new prison is a dollar less for our health system or our children's education. Reducing the imprisonment rate is not something that Government can do on its own. Achieving this goal will require the action of a wide range of people across society, from judges and police to community groups and families.

"A team of officials from across the state sector, led by the Justice Ministry, is working on options to take this work forward. This team will report to Cabinet mid-year. My Ministerial colleagues and I have an open mind on what these alternative approaches should be, but they are likely to be based on three themes:

1. First, tilting the balance earlier to prevent crime;
2. Second, using alternatives to prison – where this is appropriate;
3. Third, adopting smarter uses of prison resources.

"By any measure, preventing crime before it occurs represents a better use of our resources, which also helps potential offenders to avoid a life of crime. I believe we can make significant gains in this area through expanding early interventions, focussing efforts on at-risk youth and strengthening the Police’s crime reduction role. This means not relying on the proverbial ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.

"Let me be clear, for serious repeat offenders and hardened criminals from whom the public must be protected, there are no other viable options to imprisonment. For some other offenders however, imprisonment is not the solution it is often perceived to be. The use of a range of sanctions, including non-custodial approaches, may be more productive, as well as being a smarter use of resources."

"Public debate around law and order has typically been polarised. Encouragingly, more recent public debate indicates a willingness by many in our communities, a number of politicians, advocacy groups and commentators to consider new approaches to reducing and preventing crime, and punishing and rehabilitating offenders. We all need to actively encourage and engage in this debate further.

"As New Zealanders, we need to decide whether we want more money to be spent on building new prisons or whether these resources can be used more productively. I have suggested that we need to build a new approach based on investing earlier to prevent crime, using alternatives to prison (where this is appropriate) and adopting smarter uses of prison resources.

"The debate needs to move forward in a constructive manner so we can sensibly discuss the options that are in front of us."
