Budget 2006 continues the Labour-led government's commitment to making workplaces safer by funding programmes to manage hazardous substances.

The funding of $6.6 million over the next three years means hazardous substances will continue to be safely managed in workplaces and expertise will be retained within local government and the community, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

"Workplaces need to be as safe as possible and having effective ways of dealing with hazardous substances safely is a vital part of this.

"The funding announced today will maintain workplace hazardous substance enforcement and compliance services by territorial authorities, regional councils and individuals," Ruth Dyson said.

The funding will provide:

- Information and advice to workplaces and industry to understand relevant legislation and manage hazardous substances
- Assessment and reporting on the management of hazardous substances in the workplace
- Timely response to notifications and incidents
- Identification of breaches of relevant legislation and ability to take appropriate action
- Emergency response capability.
