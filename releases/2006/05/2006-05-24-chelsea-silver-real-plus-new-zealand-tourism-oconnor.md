Tourism New Zealand and designer Xanthe White have done New Zealand proud, winning silver at the Chelsea Garden show, Tourism minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The 100% Pure New Zealand Garden includes thousands of plants from New Zealand and depicts the rugged bush and beach of Auckland's west coast.

"Congratulations to Xanthe and Tourism New Zealand. The Chelsea Flower Show is a great opportunity to bring the beauty of New Zealand to the British public," Mr O'Connor said.

The garden has been a huge talking point at the show and no doubt will entice more visitors to come to our shores, Mr O'Connor said.
