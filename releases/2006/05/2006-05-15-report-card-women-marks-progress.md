A government report on the status of New Zealand women prepared for the United Nations (UN) records that considerable progress has been made in the last four years, Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel said.

New Zealand's Sixth Report on its Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) co-ordinated by the Ministry of Women's Affairs updates their last report in 2002 and will be presented to the UN's CEDAW Committee in 2007.

"I believe we can hold our head up high in terms of the progress that we have made. This is more than a record of achievement – it reaches merit and excellence standards as well, largely because we have very strong laws and policies to protect and advance the interests of women. But challenges remain," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The level of violence against women in New Zealand is intolerable; pay equity remains an issue with women earning on average 20 per cent less than their male counterparts (even in the same professions); women's employment is still concentrated in female-dominated occupations and New Zealand lags the world in the number of women on private sector boards.

"The Labour-led government is addressing these issues but in most instances it is attitudinal change that is required, which the government cannot legislate," Lianne Dalziel said.

"We cannot afford to be complacent, because much of what women take for granted today could be lost at the stroke of the legislative pen. New Zealand was well behind like-countries when a Labour-led government introduced paid parental leave. Its introduction was opposed by the opposition but its extension to self-employed parents is now supported by them. This means it is vulnerable to policy change."

Lianne Dalziel said that leadership on women's issues has been a cornerstone of New Zealand's national identity ever since we led the world in granting women the right to vote.

"The report's credibility is enhanced by the process used to compile it. There was wide-ranging consultation with both government and non-government organisations and this is reflected in the appendix entitled 'Voices of New Zealand Women'. I will be very proud to present this report on behalf of the government," Lianne Dalziel said.
