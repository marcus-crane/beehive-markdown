New Zealand’s ability to protect and preserve its heritage sites is to be strengthened significantly, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said today.

The Labour-led Government is allocating $12.8 million of new operating funding to the Historic Places Trust over the next four years, as well as an additional $600,000 in this 05/06 financial year in supplementary funding.

Baseline operational funding for the Trust will rise from the current level of $7.153 million to $9.9 million in 2006/07 and to $10.5 million in 2007/08 and subsequent years. The Trust will also receive new capital funding of $3.2 million during the period 2005/06 to 2007/08 to support its capital plan, such as refurbishing its heritage buildings.

“This is a very significant funding increase for the [Historic Places Trust](http://www.historic.org.nz/). In 2007/08, the Trust’s operational funding will be 47 per cent higher than it is currently. The additional funding will help build capability and capacity within the organisation, better equipping the Trust to continue its important work,” Helen Clark said.

“This year, the Historic Places Trust celebrates fifty years of protecting and promoting New Zealand’s most [significant places and buildings](http://www.historic.org.nz/places2visit/places2visit_index.html) – from the Kerikeri Mission House and Stone Store to the Timeball Station in Lyttelton, and from Rangiriri Pa in the Waikato, to the Totara Estate near Oamaru.

“These places have played a significant role in our nation's history. Knowing and understanding more about our past and conserving our historic heritage is a critical part of establishing a strong sense of national identity. Achieving that is a high priority for this Labour-led Government.

“Investment in protection of our historic heritage also has important economic spin-offs. Iconic sites support heritage tourism, bringing visitors to regions throughout New Zealand and encouraging them to stay and explore our unique heritage," Helen Clark said.
