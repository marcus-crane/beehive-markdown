Budget 2006 demonstrates the government's continued commitment to and investment in a vibrant arts, cultural and creative sector says Associate Minister for Arts, Culture & Heritage Judith Tizard.

"In 2000 the Labour government made a sustantial investment in the arts sector with the injection of our $80+ million cultural recovery package to provide financial stability for our major arts institutions and organisations."

Budget 2006 demonstrates this Labour-led government's continuing commitment and investment to the wider arts community.

Budget 2006 has delivered the following to the arts, cultural and heritage sector: (NB all figures are GST exclusive):

-Creative New Zealand receives new operating funding of $2.5 million a year, taking its annual operational funding to $15.452 million. The new funding will enable Creative New Zealand to maintain levels of support for around thirty key arts organisations.

-The Royal New Zealand Ballet receives an additional $250,000 a year from 2006/ 2007. This brings the RNZB's annual operational funding to $3.534 million and will enable it to continue to produce and present quality performances, particularly in light of increased touring costs in the last few years.

-The Auckland War Memorial Museum receives an additional $1.778 million in 2006/ 2007, taking its operational funding to $6.48 million in 2006/ 2007. The funding is earkmarked for the Museum Trust Board's redevelopment project.

-As announced last week, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust has received a 47% boost in its operational funding. The government is allocating $12.8 million of new operation funding over the next four years, as well as an additional $600,000 in this 05/06 financial year in supplementary funding.

Baseline operational funding for the Trust will rise from the current level of $7.153 million to $9.9 million in 2006/07 and to $10.5 million in 2007/08 and subsequent years. The Trust will also receive new capital funding of $3.2 million during the period 2005/06 to 2007/08 to support its capital plan, such as refurbishing its heritage buildings.

"We see this funding as an investment, as this sector can also provide sustainable and rewarding employment, and contribute to our economic growth and prosperity."
