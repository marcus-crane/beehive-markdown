Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui is describing the Maori Party's decision not to vote on the Te Arawa Lakes Settlement Bill as astonishing.

Te Arawa have been waiting for more than 80 years to have their grievance addressed and as a member of parliament I have been working very hard to get to this point since 1999 said Mita Ririnui.

"The Maori Party's position on this issue is perplexing. Dr Sharples contribution to the debate, supported by his party including the MP for Waiariki Te Ururoa Flavell, shows complete contempt for the process and all parties involved including the claimants.

"Dr Sharples action in effect deprives Te Arawa of exercising its decision to negotiate a mandated deal with the crown over the lakebed claim. It also flies in the face of their assurance to send all Bills to select committee.

"It is plain nonsense for Maori Party to indicate that they abstained from voting. They did not they choose not to vote at all which has been confirmed by the Office of the Clerk. This action is usually reserved for Party's that don’t bother to turn up to parliament.

"Stirling stuff considering the Maori Party were directly critical of Te Arawa kaumatua who were present in the public gallery. And yet all of the posturing counted for nothing because when the time came to record their opposition by voting against the Bill they instead took the spineless course of action.

"I wonder how the Te Arawa leadership felt being lectured by an academic of Kahungunu extraction, who lives in Auckland, about how they should advance the dreams and aspirations of their people," said Mita Ririnui.
