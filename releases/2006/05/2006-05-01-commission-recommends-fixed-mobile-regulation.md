Communications Minister David Cunliffe has released a Commerce Commission report on regulation of mobile termination rates.

The commission’s reconsideration final report recommends regulation of voice calls made from fixed home or business phone lines to all mobile networks, including those using 3G technologies.

Under the [Telecommunications Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=183645&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B1BDB8FB6%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC), the minister may accept, reject, or require the commission to reconsider the recommendation.

Before making his decision on the report, the minister has invited written submissions on any new matters raised by the report that were not the subject of previous submissions to the commission.

"I do not intend to repeat the consultation process undertaken by the commission, but I want to provide interested parties with the opportunity to comment on relevant matters they have not previously raised," Mr Cunliffe said.

“I do not expect to make any further public comment on the issue until I have made my decision on the commission’s recommendation."

Mr Cunliffe thanked Telecommunications Commissioner Douglas Webb and the commission for their work on the report.
