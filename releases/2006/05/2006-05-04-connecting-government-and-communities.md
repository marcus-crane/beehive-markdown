Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, today met with Bob Wyatt, the Executive Director of Muttart Foundation in Canada, to discuss relationships between the community and voluntary sector and government.

Both Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and Bob Wyatt both spoke at Philanthropy New Zealand's 'Funders' Forum' on Tuesday in Wellington. Minister Laban thanked Bob Wyatt for presenting his research, and welcomed the opportunity to hear comment from beyond New Zealand's shores.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said that in New Zealand, the relationship between the government and the community and voluntary sector is complex, but evolving in a positive way and there is a healthy tradition of dialogue between the two.

"This Labour-led Government is committed to strengthening and nurturing relationships with the sector." Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"Government, businesses and community organisations need to continue to work respectfully together in order to have a strong and vibrant society.

"The 'Keeping It Legal: E Ai Ki Te Ture' resource ([www.nzfvwo.org.nz/keepingitlegal](http://www.nzfvwo.org.nz/keepingitlegal)) is an excellent example of collaboration, as it is a joint initiative between the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations (NZFVWO) and the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector (OCVS)," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

Bob Wyatt noted that New Zealand could not survive without the voluntary sector, describing it as the 'root of democracy in our countries'. He also stated that there needed to be an ongoing dialogue between all parties, noting that relationships need work, mutual understanding and respect.

Both Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and Bob Wyatt agreed that the the Study of the NZ Non-Profit Sector, involving the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Statistics New Zealand, Massey University, Johns Hopkins University, and an advisory committee, will provide information about both the size and the nature of the sector, and provide a platform to enhance these relationships.
