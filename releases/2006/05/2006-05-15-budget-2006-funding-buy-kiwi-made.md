Funding of $11.5 million will be made available over the next three years to fund a Buy Kiwi-Made programme, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard and Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi-Made Sue Bradford announced today.

The Buy Kiwi-Made programme was part of the [post election cooperation agreement between the Government and the Green Party](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F24256).

Ms Bradford said she hoped the campaign, which was the brainchild of late Greens Co-Leader Rod Donald, would provide a real boost for New Zealand businesses.

"The Buy Kiwi-Made campaign will encourage Kiwis to buy locally made products, use local services and to be local tourists," Sue Bradford said.

"We correctly acknowledge those high profile Kiwis who excel in sports or in film. But it is time that we also value those who keep this country working; those who make the products and provide the services that we consume every day.

“We have just finished a series of regional workshops on Buy Kiwi-Made. The businesses and unions that I have spoken to are very enthusiastic about our plans. They are keen to get on board and give the campaign their full support. I look forward to working alongside them to make it a huge success,” Sue Bradford said.

"One aspect of the Buy Kiwi-Made campaign will be to provide the information needed by consumers to buy local. We are sure that many who want to buy New Zealand-made products or purchase New Zealand services are frustrated by not knowing where to look for them," said Sue Bradford.

"We will be helping firms get a fair go with government procurement. We will also be supporting community and buy local initiatives such as craft and farmers markets."

Trevor Mallard said the Government is pleased to support this Green Party initiative.

"Investing in Kiwi businesses is a going to be a key part of addressing New Zealand's balance of payments deficit. Saving funds on imports has the same effect on our balance of payments as earning funds through exports.

"I want to acknowledge the passion and hard work of the late Rod Donald and now Sue Bradford in leading this campaign. I look forward to it producing some positive results," Trevor Mallard said.
