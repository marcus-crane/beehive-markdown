Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Mark Burton welcomed the Te Arawa Lakes Settlement Bill's passing of its first reading in Parliament today.

The Bill will settle all historical claims of Te Arawa relating to 14 lakes around Rotorua and gives effect to the Deed of Settlement, signed in December 2004.

"It was pleasing to see such a large number of Te Arawa people in Parliament today to witness this important milestone in the process to address historical grievances in the Rotorua region," Mark Burton said.

The title to 13 lakebeds will transfer to Te Arawa, but the Crown will continue to own the water column and airspace above the lakebeds.

"This Bill acknowledges Te Arawa's special relationship with these lakes while also providing for continued public access. The settlement also resolves outstanding issues relating to the annuity previously paid by the Crown to Te Arawa.

"The Te Arawa Lakes settlement is this government's eighth settlement Bill since 2000. This Labour-led government is committed to working toward putting these grievances behind us so that we can pursue an economy that provides opportunities and a unique quality of life for all New Zealanders.

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised and addressed in a peaceful and constructive way.

"Treaty settlements strengthen the relationship between the Crown and iwi and lay the foundation for us to build a strong and confident nation."

Te Arawa has approximately 40,000 members and is centred in Rotorua. The settlement includes a formal Crown apology; cultural redress including title to the 13 lakebeds; and financial redress of $2.7 million.

The Bill will now move to the Mâori Affairs Committee for consideration. The Committee will report back on the Bill in the next few months.
