"Read the budget Rodney" is the advice from the Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard to ACT MP Rodney Hide in response to his comments that Auckland missed out on Budget funding for land transport.

"Rodney Hide needs to spend more time in Parliament," says Judith Tizard.

"Budget 2006 increased land transport spending to $13.4 billion over the next five years to guarantee and accelerate New Zealand's largest ever road building programme as part of the government's economic transformation theme. Auckland's the winner here."

"Budget 2006 allocates an extra $1.3 billion to guarantee the state highway programme and to speed up work on major road and public transport projects to ease traffic congestion in Auckland and other centres."

"These projects include finishing the Western ring route and trans-regional links including the Waikato Maramarua expressway and the route as far north as Whangarei."

The full list of Auckland transport projects is available at http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/Key%20Deliverables.Auckland%20roads.Budget2006.doc.

"Rodney Hide is out of step on the dance floor and on Auckland issues. Last week the Auckland Mayoral Forum formally thanked the government for its support for Auckland projects – especially roads and public transport services. They described it as the greatest support Auckland has ever received from central government."

"When we took office in 1999, the National government was spending just over $18m per annum on Auckland passenger transport - that's just $18 per Aucklander. This Labour–led government has allocated $172,850,300 this year – that’s $154 million extra per annum under Labour being invested just in Auckland passenger transport."

In December last year the government announced it would fund 100% of the cost of upgrading the Auckland rail network, which is estimated to cost between $450 million and $600 million. The upgrade projects include double tracking of the Western Line, signalling and minor capacity upgrades, linking the southern rail corridor and Manukau City, and reconfiguration of the Newmarket junction.

"I am proud of what this government has done for Auckland and I will continue to work for Auckland's interests," says Judith Tizard.
