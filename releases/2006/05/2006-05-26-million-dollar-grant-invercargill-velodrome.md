The Invercargill velodrome has been awarded a grant of up to $1 million from a new fund set up to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Prime Minister Helen Clark tonight opened the velodrome, and announced that up to $1 million will be available to the Southland Indoor Leisure Centre Charitable Trust for the facility.

"The velodrome has the support of Bike New Zealand and is the only facility of its kind in New Zealand. It is world-class infrastructure, built to international standards," Helen Clark said.

"Southland community leaders have an outstanding record of investing in first class facilities for the region, and this velodrome is no exception. Cycling in Southland will benefit tremendously from this velodrome. The government is pleased to support this project as well.

"I am pleased to see that this Stadium Southland project also includes the provision of new covered courts suitable for netball, tennis, volleyball, basketball and soccer.

"There is increasing recognition of the role which sport and recreation plays in achieving broader social and economic goals. The more active we are, the healthier we will be. Sport helps unite communities and gives New Zealand a strong presence and proud identity on the world stage," Helen Clark said.

The grant is being made available through the Significant Community Based Projects Fund, which was announced in the 2005 Budget to address funding issues faced by a growing number of large and important community projects.

The Fund is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, which together with five other government bodies formulated recommendations to Cabinet for final decision.

Cabinet guidelines stipulate that the objective of the Fund is to support major community-based projects which have significant support from and participation by the community, with a range of regional or national benefits.

Particular importance is attached to projects in the fields of arts, culture and heritage; sport and recreation; conservation and environment; tourism; and economic development.

Helen Clark said further announcements would be made over the coming week about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year. There will be two further funding rounds.
