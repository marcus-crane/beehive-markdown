9 May 2006: Media Statement: National Library

The National Library has been allocated funding in the 2006 Budget to evaluate options for a major expansion of their building the National Library Minister Judith Tizard has announced.

Speaking at the AGM of the National Library Society last night the Minister responsible for the National Library, Judith Tizard, announced that the government has made available $300,000 as part of this year's budget.

"The National Library is projected to run out of space for its collections within 5-6 years. This money will enable it to explore options to add an additional floor to the building."

"A capital injection of $18 million has been earmarked for this development in 2008/09 subject to Cabinet approval."

"This development recognises the importance of the National Library at both local and central government levels."

The National Library is responsible for supplementing and furthering the work of other New Zealand libraries and works collaboratively with other organisations with a similar purpose.

"The Alexander Turnbull Library is the jewel in the National Library's crown – it's a national treasure which contributes significantly to our heritage and our sense of national identity. This funding will support the continued growth of this collection."

The Alexander Turnbull Library is a New Zealand documentary research collection and collects all information by or about New Zealand. It includes the largest collection of early printed books in New Zealand – back to the early voyages, as well as stunning fine art and printing, music, books and pamphlets.

The building was once famous for being the 'hole in the ground'. It was designed in the 1960s but the site sat empty for many years. The building was finally opened in 1987.
