Schools will get more help in efforts to tackle disruptive behaviour, with new Budget funding of $9.5 million over four years, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring every school is able to provide a safe and productive learning environment for students," Steve Maharey said.

"This new funding will help all schools promote positive behaviour and tackle disruption.

"The funding will be used to strengthen the work we're doing to eliminate bullying, to re-engage kids who are being disruptive, and to ensure there are consistent guidelines about appropriate behaviour, reinforced through all schools.

"While every school has a responsibility of care to its students, we are also very clear that schools can't do it alone. Parents and communities also have a responsibility and this new funding will help to reinforce that responsibility.

The funding will provide for:

- Additional funding to ensure children with severe behaviour difficulties can remain in school, without putting themselves or others at risk
- Better information and resources to ensure there are good policies and guidelines in every New Zealand school – including more sharing of examples from schools where behaviour problems have been turned around
- New behaviour screening to enable schools and the Ministry of Education to work together to identify children who are at risk of developing severe behaviour problems, before this behaviour becomes harder to manage
- Funding to continue [Project Early](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=8774&data=l#P220_25069) in Auckland and Christchurch
  
  "The funding enables us to build on the substantial programme of work in this area, including the [Student Engagement Initiative](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/governance/attendance/sei_e.php) and specialist teachers in schools. We will consult the sector over the next twelve months about next steps.
  
  "Setting clear boundaries for the behaviour of young people is vital. Discipline in schools is not just about controlling those students who cause problems. The learning of all students suffers if there is disruption, bullying or violence. Our aim is to ensure all New Zealand schools have the support they need to maintain and foster a positive environment for students, free from disruptive behaviour."
