Budget 2006 will allocate new funding to help achieve the Labour-led government's target for all historical Treaty claims to be lodged by 2008 and settled by 2020, Treaty Negotiations Minister Mark Burton announced today.

The funding of $5.2 million over the next four years would provide the Office of Treaty Settlements (OTS) with additional staff and resources to further progress Treaty settlement negotiations.

"Increasing the capacity of the Office of Treaty Settlements will build on the momentum generated to date and ensure we are able to settle all historical Treaty claims in a fair, final and timely manner," Mark Burton said.

"Treaty settlements strengthen the relationship between the Crown and iwi and lay the foundation for us to build a strong and confident nation.

"Part of developing a strong national identity is coming to terms with our past and righting historical wrongs so we can all move forward.

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised and addressed in a peaceful and constructive way.

"This Labour-led government is committed to working toward putting these grievances behind us so that we can pursue an economy that provides opportunities and a unique quality of life for all New Zealanders.

"On Thursday the eighth settlement bill since 2000 – the Te Arawa Lakes Settlement Bill – had its first reading in Parliament. Currently, the government is negotiating with over 20 groups, covering several hundred claims."
