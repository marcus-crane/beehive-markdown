Hurunui District landowners are getting over $39,000 in grant funding to help protect to help preserve wildlife and natural habitat.

Te Tai Tonga MP, Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa announced that John Angland is getting a grant of $15,975 to control wilding pines on Hossack Station, South-East of Hamner village.

Logan Shearer is getting $14,400 towards control of wilding pines, eliminating a seed source that has caused infestations on neighbouring indigenous bush and shrublands.

Angus & Sue Galletly get $8,960 to fell wilding pines on their property, Hossack Downs, affecting over 800 hectares of indigenous bush on the windward side of the Amuri Range.

The local grants are part of an announcement by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Conservation Minister Chris Carter that $1.3 million is being distributed to 104 projects across the country.

"Many fragmented areas of native bush and wetland now only exist on private land, and this funding makes a significant difference for landowners and community groups working to restore and preserve unique New Zealand fauna and flora," said Mahara Okeroa.

"The funding goes some way to safeguarding New Zealand's rich biodiversity and identity as a clean green and sustainable nation."

The Biodiversity Condition and Advice funds were established in 2000 under the $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package. The next funding round is now open: see www.biodiversity.govt.nz, or call 0800 86 20 20.
