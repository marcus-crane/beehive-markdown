Wigram MP and Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton today opened the Little River Rail Trail in Banks Peninsula. He commented on the social and economic benefits of the project and cut the flax ribbon to declare it officially open.

"This Rail Trail is a pathway through the spectacular scenery we are privileged to enjoy in this part of New Zealand. There is rich and diverse wildlife here, especially around our fifth largest lake, Lake Ellesmere. We have begun to develop New Zealand without destroying our precious natural resources because we now understand that we gain economic value from this lake and the way it showcases our stunning landscape and our clean, green New Zealand environment," Jim Anderton said at the Rail Embankment.

"It will be a new activity for international visitors who are interested in eco-tourism.  
It will help to emphasise that everything coming from New Zealand is the result of a unique, pure and clean environment. This is becoming more and more important as we compete to add value by being cleaner, greener and more ecologically responsible. We have to live those values, not just try to create an image of them. So the more we can showcase our assets in a responsible way, the better it is for our wider economic development.

"The Rail Trail is good for healthier lifestyle activities. For all the extra money we spend on the health system, every single study shows that the best dollar we can spend is in encouraging more healthy activities. We need more walking and cycling and this trail will be a great venue. It's particularly appropriate as well for older folk. It can be walked without carrying a huge pack because there is a broad range of places to stay, eat and relax. A resource such as this can be enjoyed by anyone who is able to enjoy the outdoors. It is free, it is beautiful and it is open year-round.

"Christchurch is one of the few cities in the world fortunate enough to offer such spectacular activities at their backdoor. In coming years it will continue to be developed as a major regional resource. It will be a pathway along which future generations will come to walk. And they will delight in it then as we all do now.

"It is my privilege to declare the trail open. And to join with you all in hoping this rich resource is enjoyed by as many as possible who want to see the magical beauty of our Canterbury environment," Jim Anderton said.
