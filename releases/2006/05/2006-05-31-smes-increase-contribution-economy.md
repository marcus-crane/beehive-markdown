Minister for Small Business Lianne Dalziel said a Ministry of Economic Development report, SMEs in New Zealand: Structure & Dynamics, provides further evidence of the important role that small to medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) play in the New Zealand economy.

SMEs, defined as businesses with fewer than twenty employees, accounted for 39 per cent of total value-added output in 2004, up two percentage points from the previous year. SMEs account for 96 per cent of all enterprises in New Zealand.

"The Labour-led government recognises SMEs as one of the drivers of the economic transformation we envisage for this country and I am working hard with them to address roadblocks in their path in the review of regulations that I have just launched," Lianne Dalziel said.

"It is their numbers that makes them important to the economy, but it is their potential for growth that makes them vital to the economic transformation agenda."

The report shows a particularly strong profit result for businesses with five or fewer employees. The average real profit per employee for this group in 2004 was $31,169 – up from $26,296 in 2003. This result was well above any other size group, demonstrating the high number of skilled people and professionals in the economy’s smallest businesses.

SMEs in New Zealand: Structure & Dynamics presents statistics on the demographics and performance of New Zealand firms. It has a specific focus on the country’s SMEs, examining their significance to the economy, their financial performance, the dynamics of SMEs and the significance of SMEs internationally. The data is sourced from Statistics New Zealand.

Data on participation by gender shows men still account for the majority of employers and the self-employed. Women made up just 30 per cent of employers and 33 per cent of the self-employed, as at March 2006.

"As Minister for Women's Affairs as well as Minister for Small Business I am in a unique position to try to gain a better understanding of women's experiences in business and to explore opportunities for the government to support women to achieve greater business success," said Lianne Dalziel.
