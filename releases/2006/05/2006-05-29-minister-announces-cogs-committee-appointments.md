Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, today announced five newly elected people to the National COGS Committee (NCC).

The Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS) provides essential support to non-profit, voluntary and community organisations. The national committee functions as a governance body for the 37 Local Distribution Committees (LDCs) throughout New Zealand.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said the elected candidates were all experienced and committed people, who would make a valuable contribution to the effective operation of COGS.

“These new NCC members come from a diverse range of backgrounds. I am confident that their skills and abilities, and their commitment to helping others, renders the National COGS Committee in good hands.”

Two community leaders from the South Island were elected: Memea Eleitino’ Bubsy Ma’aelopa JP (elected as deputy chair), and Sumaria Beaton. Mr Ma’aelopa has been actively participating in Pacific Island agencies for 24 years, and is committed to serving the unique needs and aspirations of communities at a national level. Ms Beaton has a history of working with Maori communities, including chairing the Te Rau Aroha Marae and developing a bi-lingual early childhood centre.

Three North Islanders were also elected to the NCC: Anthony Olsen, Sandra Terewi (elected as chair), and Yvonne Wilson. Mr Olsen’s community work has focussed on guiding governance processes in community groups. Ms Terewi has fifteen years governing experience with both local and national community organisations, including the Alzheimer’s Society and the Prisoners’ Aid and Rehabilitation Society. A recipient of the 2002 Child, Youth and Family 'Leading Light Award', Ms Wilson has 20 years of strategic and community development experience in a range of community organisations.
