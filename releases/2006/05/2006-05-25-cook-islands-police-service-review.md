New Zealand would be supporting a comprehensive review of policing in the Cook Islands following a request received from the Cook Islands Government, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“A functioning and well performing Police force is essential to any country. In the context of the special relationship that New Zealand shares with the Cooks it is important that we support this work.

“The objective for the review team is to assess the overall effectiveness of the Cook Islands Police. The review will recommend ways to provide a cost-effective and improved police service.

“I expect the review will provide a very useful account of the current state of policing in the Cooks while also providing clear directions to the Government in terms of future improvements and initiatives,” said Mr Peters.

The work will be jointly funded by the Cook Islands Government and NZAID and will take 3 months to complete.  
The review will be carried out by C&M Associates, and the lead reviewer will be retired NZ Police Commissioner Rob Robinson. Mr Robinson was identified by NZ Police, in consultation with the Cook Islands’ Government, as well placed to lead the review.

“As a former NZ Police Commissioner and former member and chair of the South Pacific Police Chiefs, Mr Robinson is uniquely qualified to lead this important piece of work,” Mr Peters said.
