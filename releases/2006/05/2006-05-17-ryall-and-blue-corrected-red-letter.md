Health Minister Pete Hodgson has today moved to correct statements made by National Party MPs Tony Ryall and Jackie Blue in Parliament this week.

Both MPs have claimed that the 'red letter' issued by some GP groups on Monday was the first of its kind in the rollout of the Primary Health Care Strategy. It was in fact the third such letter since 2002 with the most recent letter having been sent out just last year.

"Given the National Party's repeated assertions on this point, I have a responsibility to point out their error. Tony Ryall and Jackie Blue thought they had a good story, but unfortunately the facts have got in their way.

"I will leave it to them to correct their statements in Parliament and to get on top of the recent history of primary health care in New Zealand."
