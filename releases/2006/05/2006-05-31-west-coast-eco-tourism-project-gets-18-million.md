Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced a grant of up to $1.8 million dollars to develop an eco-tourism attraction in the Oparara Valley, in the Kahurangi National Park on the West Coast.

The grant comes from a new fund to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Helen Clark today walked the track into the Oparara Arch limestone rock formation north of Karamea, and later announced the grant to the Oparara Valley Trust at Karamea.

"The Oparara Valley project will develop and enhance the area to become a major eco-tourism attraction," Helen Clark said.

"Since I opened a mountain bike track in the area in 2003, the Trust has proceeded to develop other plans that will open up new tracks, conserve historic gold workings, restore an old sawmill site, and develop picnic, parking, and toilet facilities and appropriate signage.

"The Oparara Valley is home to the blue duck (whio), the great spotted kiwi, the rare endangered short-tailed bat, and the Powelliphanta snail.

"This community initiative aims to develop the Valley into a premium tourist attraction on the northern West Coast, and also create employment opportunities.

"Improved access to this area will give both local and overseas tourists a better understanding of our unique natural heritage in this remote and beautiful part of New Zealand, and further add to this country's reputation as a world-class visitor experience," Helen Clark said.

The grant is being made available through the Significant Community Based Projects Fund, which was announced in the 2005 Budget to address funding issues faced by a growing number of large and important community projects.

The fund is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, which together with five other government bodies formulated recommendations to Cabinet for final decision.

Cabinet guidelines stipulate that the objective of the fund is to support major community-based projects which have significant support from and participation by the community, with a range of regional or national benefits.

Particular importance is attached to projects in the fields of arts, culture and heritage; sport and recreation; conservation and environment; tourism; and economic development.

Helen Clark said further announcements would be made this week about other successful applicants to the fund this financial year. There will be two further funding rounds.
