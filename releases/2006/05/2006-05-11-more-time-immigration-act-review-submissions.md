The deadline for public submissions on the Labour-led Government's Immigration Act Review discussion paper has been extended from 14 June to 30 June,Immigration Minister David Cunliffe says.

"There has been significant public interest in the proposals, with well-attended consultation meetings around New Zealand," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Due to this high interest, it has been decided to allow extra time for people to respond. The extra two weeks will allow the Department of Labour to respond to all the requests for meetings and ensure people have extra time to consider their submissions."

Mr Cunliffe unveiled the Immigration Act Review Immigration Act Review Discussion Paper 2006 on April 5.

The draft proposals in the paper represent the most comprehensive review of immigration laws since the present Immigration Act was passed in 1987.

They are not Government policy. The Government will consider the public response to the paper before drafting legislation later this year to replace the 1987 act.
