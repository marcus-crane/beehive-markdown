Budget 2006 continues the Labour-led Government's long-term commitment to protecting our communities, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The Government has already made a substantial investment in ensuring the Corrections Department can manage present and future prisoner numbers by building four new prisons – all of which will be in operation in 2007. This investment will continue as necessary, Mr O'Connor said.

"Sustained high levels of investment in Corrections has allowed the department to modernise New Zealand's prisons, and reinforces the high priority this government places on keeping our families safe.

"A further $28.67 million has been allocated next year to fund beds on existing sites that have already been approved."

At the same time, the Government recognises the ongoing importance of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes to help steer prisoners away from crime in the future, Mr O'Connor said.

From July, a third drug and alcohol treatment unit, in Christchurch Men's Prison, is expected to be in operation, adding to two units running at Waikeria and Arohata prisons.

"The unit has been relocated and the programme enhanced, and it will provide places for 100 offenders a year. Drug and alcohol abuse is a major driver of offending and I am determined to direct greater resources in this area."

A new employment strategy, which will focus on getting more prisoners into work, and the expansion of intensive rehabilitative programmes also reinforce the Government's commitment to reducing re-offending, Mr O'Connor said.

"I have asked the Corrections Department to report back to me on ways to reprioritise expenditure to focus on enhancing rehabilitation and reintegration outcomes. I expect it to report back shortly with a range of options in thess areas."

By 2007, the department will also have increased the number of Corrections reintegration caseworkers working in prisons to 16. The caseworkers work with other government and community agencies such as Work and Income, Housing NZ, Prisoners' Aid and Rehabilitation Society (PARS) and employer organisations to make sure services are in place prior to an offender's release.
