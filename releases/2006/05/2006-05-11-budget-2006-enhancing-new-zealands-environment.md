Cleaning up contaminated sites and enhancing biodiversity and biosecurity are the focus of $20.5 million in Budget funding, announced today by Research Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey and Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

"This package will advance work we are doing to clean up contaminated sites, and fund new research to enhance biodiversity and protect biosecurity," Steve Maharey said.

"The Labour-led government recognises that an investment in the environment is vital to transforming our economy and preserving the New Zealand way of life.

"The Budget provides an additional $16 million over the next four years through Vote Research, Science and Technology for research to enhance biodiversity and protect biosecurity, and $4.5 million over the next three years through Vote Environment to clean up [contaminated sites](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/hazardous/contaminated/remediation-fund.html)."

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said protecting and enhancing the environment was a priority for the Labour-led government.

"New Zealand has an unwanted legacy of potentially contaminated sites from activities like pesticide manufacture, coal gas production, mining, rubbish disposal, timber treatment, and sheep dipping.

"In cooperation with local government we have been addressing this issue, but more resources are required as we meet people's expectations about environmental quality."

Steve Maharey said the research funding would assist the government in dealing with key issues around biodiversity and biosecurity.

"The areas we will focus on, include research to improve pest management, vital to halting the decline in New Zealand’s biodiversity; fresh water biosecurity research, particularly aquatic weeds like Didymo."

### BACKGROUND INFORMATION

**Budget 2006: Environmental research – Backgrounder**

Around $16 million of new government funding has been provided over the next four years for environmental research.

The money will go towards enhancing biodiversity and protecting biosecurity and will fill critical gaps in environmental research capability across key areas of environmental research.

Impacts of existing pests and biosecurity incursions are recognised as major threats to New Zealand’s economy, natural environment, health security and social well-being.

The impact on our forests of exotic pests and invasive weeds has highlighted the need for new and improved weed and pest control methods.

These threats, especially from new plants, invertebrates, and micro-organisms, continue to grow as trade volumes, tourism, and travel increase.

For example, the arrival of the freshwater algae, Didymo, in our rivers and lakes has highlighted the need for more researchers and resources for freshwater biosecurity research. It is important that we continue to support the world-class scientific expertise New Zealand has in freshwater biosecurity.

New Zealand’s vulnerability is also affected by changes taking place offshore, for example, changing climatic conditions, and biosecurity breaches elsewhere can open up new opportunities for pests in our neighbouring or trading-partner states.

The extra investment committed in the Budget lifts the Government’s total investment in environmental research through the science budget to $90 million per annum.

Our environment is a vital part of our heritage, culture, quality of life and national identity. In New Zealand more than many countries we rely on our environment to create wealth and social wellbeing.

**Budget 2006: Cleaning up contaminated sites – Backgrounder**

The Budget provides an additional $4.5 million over the next three years through Vote Environment to clean up contaminated sites.

New Zealand has an unwanted legacy of potentially contaminated sites from activities like pesticide manufacture, coal gas production, mining, rubbish disposal, timber treatment, and sheep dipping.

The Labour government agreed in 2002 to provide $2 million a year to establish the Ministry for the Environment's Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund to help with the clean up of New Zealand’s unwanted legacy of contaminated sites.

Since 2003 the Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund has allocated $1 million a year for the clean-up of the Mapua site near Nelson, considered New Zealand's most contaminated, with the other $1 million being available to councils on a contestable basis.

Setting on-going funding for the clean-up of Mapua aside, the new funding represents a 150 percent increase in the amount of money that will be available annually to councils to clean up contaminated sites in New Zealand.

The Fund aims to assist regional councils with the investigation and remediation of high-priority contaminated sites, so they can be returned to productive and safe use.

Regional councils apply for funding in partnership with local communities and landowners. Councils can apply for funding for a site investigation or clean-up if:

- there is a high risk to human health
- the site is in an environmentally or culturally sensitive area
- there is other contributory funding, such as from the regional council or landowner.

So far, the Fund has provided financial support for 28 projects – many of these are on-going. Five projects are for the actual clean-up of contaminated sites, while funding has been available for other projects to help investigate, scope and plan clean-ups.

The Fund provides an example of local and national government working together to make a real difference to the environment and local communities, by returning high-risk sites to safe and productive use.
