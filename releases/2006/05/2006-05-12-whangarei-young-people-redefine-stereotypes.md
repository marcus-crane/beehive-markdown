Young people from Whangarei are joining in a nationwide campaign aimed at busting negative youth stereotypes during Youth Week 2006.

Labour MP Dover Samuels says Youth Week, running from 15 to 21 May, challenges policy-makers, leaders, teachers and the media to help Young New Zealanders develop as proud, confident, capable and creative Kiwis, who make a positive contribution to our national identity.

Youth Week activities in the Whangarei area include the launch of the "UR Free 2B" Youth Card, which fits pockets and wallets and has contact details for Whangarei young people, plus useful websites and how to deal with text bullying. The launch event on 17 May, between 10am and Noon at Forum North will showcase Whangarei talent, including the UR Free 2B song by Victor and Norm.

"Events like this offer everyone a chance to focus on the value and importance of young people in the community," said Dover Samuels.

"There's Negative stereotyping of young people – it hits their self confidence and their feelings for those who do it to them.

"Youth Week is about celebrating young people's energy, enthusiasm and fresh ideas. Whangarei people can make a real difference by thinking about the issues and finding local solutions to local challenges."

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is to launch Youth Week with a celebrity debate at Parliament on 15 May. The week is being coordinated by the NZ Association for Adolescent Health and Development with the support of the Ministry of Youth Development. For more information: www.youthweek.co.nz
