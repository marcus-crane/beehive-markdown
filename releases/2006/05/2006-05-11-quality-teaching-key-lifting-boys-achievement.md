Education Minister Steve Maharey told a national boys’ schools conference in Christchurch that quality teaching will make the biggest difference in efforts to lift boys' achievement.

"Whether boys are in a co-ed or single-sex school setting, quality teaching is where we can make the biggest difference to their achievement," Steve Maharey.

"Most boys are doing well in our education system, and in most subjects there is little difference in achievement between boys and girls. For some boys, however, issues around reading and writing, and engagement at school, can get in the way of their achievement.

"The government believes the best way to address this issue is not through a homogenous approach to teaching boys, but through quality teaching in all schools that focuses on the needs of individual students.

"We are working towards a more flexible, learner-centred system, where teachers get good support to identify the needs of their students, along with tools and guidance to respond to those needs.

"Research tells us that when our teachers have great professional support and high expectations of all students then the quality of learning is high, across all school types.

Steve Maharey said the major investments being made in learner-centred teaching would help to lift boys' achievement over time.

"We currently invest more than $90 million a year on professional development for teachers and around $32 million a year in programmes to lift literacy standards. The literacy project is one where we're making a big impact. The greatest gains in reading achievement are being made by Mâori and Pacific students, including boys, who make up the largest proportion of participants.

Steve Maharey said boys also make up around two thirds of students getting help through the Student Engagement Initiative. "This is an $8.5 million initiative, which has already had huge successes in reducing truancy, early leaving exemptions and suspensions across a range of schools."
