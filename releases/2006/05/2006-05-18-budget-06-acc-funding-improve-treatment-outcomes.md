Budget 2006 increases ACC funding for a range of rehabilitation and treatment providers to help improve the well being of those in need in the community.

Home-based rehabilitation funding will increase by $5.5 million and ACC contributions towards specified treatment providers will increase by $12.9 million, both over the next four years.

"The Labour-led government is committed to supporting healthy and strong New Zealanders by giving them timely access to treatment so they can return to health as early as possible, regain independence, return to work if possible, and participate in the community," ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

"More funding for home-based rehabilitation providers will help ensure that injured people living at home receive high quality care by helping to retain and recruit support workers.

"The additional funding will start to address the shortage of support workers providing home-based rehabilitation, such as home help and attendant care. Currently around 2700 New Zealanders require significant long-term care," Ruth Dyson said.

ACC’s contribution towards specified treatment providers such as acupuncturists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, osteopaths, physiotherapists, podiatrists, and speech therapists will increase by $12.9 million over the next four years.

ACC has two different methods of paying providers, both of which increase by:

- $5 per treatment visit (to a total of $24.48 per treatment visit); and
- $12.57 per hour (to a total of $61.57 per hour).

Increasing ACC's contribution for such providers will:

Help ensure ACC's contribution to treatment consultations keeps up with the increasing costs of health care.

Strengthen consumer choice over the type of treatment provider.

Contribute to reducing barriers to accessing care.
