The Labour-led government is moving to stop any abuse of the visa system by guardians of foreign fee-paying students, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Restrictions will be put on the type of work permits granted to people who come to New Zealand as guardians. This follows evidence that some students have been able to avoid paying fees when their guardians gain a work permit.

“Guardian policy was primarily instituted to protect the welfare of foreign children who come to study in New Zealand,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“The changes, effective immediately, are to ensure guardian visa holders are honouring this commitment when they come here.

“Under the amended policy, guardian permit holders will continue to be able to vary the conditions of their permits to allow them to work or study part-time, and they will still be able to apply for any permit under partnership grounds.

“However, guardian permit holders will not be eligible for a general work permit that would allow them to work full-time," Mr Cunliffe said.

“At the same time, guardians can apply to remain in New Zealand longer if they can show they meet the criteria under categories such as the Work-to-Residence categories or the Skilled Migrant Category.

“Immigration policy is focused on attracting people to NZ who have the skills, talent and experience to contribute to our labour market and economic growth. We want to acknowledge these qualities among guardian permit holders as well.”

### Background

More than 7,000 guardian permits have been issued since this form of visitor visa was introduced in 2003.

The intent was to ensure that foreign-fee paying children attending New Zealand schools were adequately cared for.

Guardians are required for students aged 13 or younger, enrolled in school years 1 to 8. Guardians of students who are up to 17 years of age and are enrolled in school years 1 to 13 are also able to apply for a guardian permit. The guardian must be the legal guardian who normally cares for the child in the home country.

As at 3 March 2006, 941 applications for work permits had been received by guardian permit holders, and 798 (85 per cent) approved.
