Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard today announced that the government is reviewing the 'window card' information which second-hand motor vehicle traders are required to provide to consumers.

The window card – otherwise known as the Supplier Information Notice or SIN Card – provides information about the car's 'birthday', import history, mileage, accident record, the fuel it uses, warrant of fitness and licensing details, as well as consumers' rights of redress.

“Motor vehicles are often one of the biggest financial commitments a consumer makes. And they're technically complex. So it's vital that consumers receive useful and accurate information to allow them to make informed decisions,” says Judith Tizard.

The government is reviewing whether the Supplier Information Notice is meeting consumers' needs.

"We want to hear back from consumers. Is the right information being provided? Is there too much or too little information? Is there alternative information consumers would like to see?"

"Last week the government launched the Fuel Saver website (www.fuelsaver.govt.nz). We'd also like consumer feedback on whether fuel efficiency information should be included on the Supplier Information Notice."

A Ministry of Consumer Affairs discussion paper, Review of the Consumer Information Standards (Used Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2003 identifies and discusses potential concerns, and signals areas where the current information required could be amended and improved. Submissions on the discussion paper close on 14 July 2006.

“I encourage consumers and industry to consider the issues and I welcome their comments on how consumers can best be assisted when buying motor vehicles.”
