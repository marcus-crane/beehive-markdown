Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the appointment of Fergus Welsh as the New Zealand Government Representative to JAS-NZ, a joint accreditation body for Australia and New Zealand that certifies management systems, products and personnel.

Fergus Welsh is the Chief Financial Officer at the Ministry of Economic Development. He starts a three-year term on 1 May 2006 and replaces Yvonne Lucas.

"Fergus has extensive practical experience of financial structures and good governance across a broad range of Crown entities operating nationally and internationally which will assist the JAS-ANZ board and complement the skills of New Zealand’s two other appointees,” Lianne Dalziel said.

JAS-ANZ, through its accreditation and certification programmes, enhances trans-Tasman trade and assists exporters seeking to gain international recognition.
