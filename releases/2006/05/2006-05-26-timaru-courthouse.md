Courts Minister Rick Barker today announced that Timaru would get a new courthouse as part of a package of funding in the 2006 budget for Ministry of Justice construction projects.

"Dr Cullen's Budget this year provided for $12 million over the next four years to see a new courthouse built in Timaru. This is great news.

"It has long been agreed that this courthouse needs to be replaced. Now, with funding secured, work can begin.

"Until this point, we have had to secure the funding, now Budget 2006 provides specifically for $12 million to be allocated across four years for the replacement of the 128 year old court.

"The existing courthouse that has served Timaru since 1877 cannot be substantially altered due to heritage classification. Questions over the structural integrity mean a new courthouse is the most viable option for meeting the current and future requirements of the local community," he said.

"A new building will alleviate the shortcomings of the current Timaru courthouse and provide an operationally effective and secure facility for at least the next 25 years.

"The Ministry of Justice has identified a need for a building of approximately 1,900 square metres, which is twice the size of the existing courthouse. This project will allow the Ministry of Justice to continue to provide court services at Timaru while increasing and strengthening capacity and capability.

"I'm pleased with the outcome of this year's Budget process, the Labour-led government has identified priorities in our court infrastructure and has funded for work to begin," he said.

No details of the new courthouse are yet available but planning for the project by Ministry of Justice officials will begin immediately with construction expected to start in mid 2007.
