The paper sector have been congratulated for exceeding their target for recycling – two years ahead of schedule.

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today congratulated the performance of the paper sector during Year One of the New Zealand Packaging Accord.

Speaking to a meeting of the New Zealand Paperboard Packaging Association in Auckland he described their achievement of 72 per cent recovery of paperboard packaging for the year to March 2005 as impressive.

"As you will all know, this success exceeds the Accord target of 70 per cent by 2008, set for the paper sector," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"You certainly make a mockery of the recent comment by Green's Environment Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos when he said the present voluntary Packaging Accord has proved to be a 'remarkable failure'.

"In fact, national targets for the recovery of paper, plastic, aluminium, glass and steel, by weight of consumption, are all tracking towards their 2008 targets.

"These recycling targets are of course comparable with those overseas, for example Europe, and the current recovery rates in New Zealand are similar to those achieved in regulated jurisdictions."

Mr Benson-Pope said the efforts of the paper sector were to be celebrated.

"The Packaging Accord is all about continuous improvement and you may consider setting additional targets or goals to strive for with the overall objective of reducing waste and increasing recycling and reuse of paper."
