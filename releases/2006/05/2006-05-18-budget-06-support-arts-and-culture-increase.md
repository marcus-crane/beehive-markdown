Creative New Zealand’s core funding has been increased by $10 million over the next four years, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today.

Budget 2006 increases Creative New Zealand's baseline funding by $2.5 million per annum over the next four years and ensures the level of support which has been possible because of one off funding last year, can be maintained over the next four years. This increases the organisation's annual direct government funding to $15.5 million, up from just $2.4 million in 2000.

“This Labour-led government is committed to investing in our vibrant arts and cultural sector so that all New Zealanders can enjoy our unique national identity,” Helen Clark said.

“[Creative New Zealand](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/) is our leading arts development organisation, investing in professional artists and arts organisations to develop a strong arts infrastructure for the country.

"This funding will enable Creative New Zealand's investments in arts and culture to be maintained.

“It will enable Creative New Zealand to maintain the level of support it provides to around thirty key arts organisations, such as [Toi Maori Aotearoa](http://www.maoriart.org.nz/) and the [NBR National Opera](http://www.nzopera.com/).

“These are excellent performing arts organisations. They help us to express ourselves as a nation, who we are, and where we stand in the world.

“We are seeing a strong and confident cultural identity emerging and this investment will help our leading arts organisations continue to produce world-class performances with a uniquely New Zealand flavour,” Helen Clark said.
