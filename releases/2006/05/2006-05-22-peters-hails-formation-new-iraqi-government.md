The formation of a new government in Iraq after months of negotiations is a crucial step in the democratic process, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“I congratulate Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and his colleagues on persevering over many months with forming a representative list of Cabinet members,” Mr Peters said.

The process of identifying ministers for the new Iraqi Government has taken five months, and followed the election of an Iraqi parliament – the Council of Representatives – as provided for by the new Iraqi constitution.

The new Cabinet was approved by the Council of Representatives over the weekend.

“This opens up for Iraq the possibility of a positive future and I welcome the formation of the new government. Now its job will be to try to make that future become a reality.”

Iraq continues to face severe challenges in terms of internal security and in securing an economic foundation for the future. Problems remain in ensuring even the basis necessities of life are provided for many.

“Iraq’s security challenges are partly reflected in the fact that appointees to the security, interior and defence portfolios have yet to be found.

“It is vital to find the right people for these jobs and I wish Mr Maliki well in his ongoing talks,” said Mr Peters.
