Housing Minister Chris Carter opened four new social housing units in Nelson today, the first phase of a broader housing project led by the Nelson Tasman Housing Trust using $1.25m of government funding.

The four new two-bedroom units in Kawhai Street will be made available to people in need of housing at subsidised rents. The project was made possible after the Trust received a 10-year interest free loan of $651,700 and a grant of $139,650 from the Labour-Progressive government's Housing Innovation Fund.

“These units will provide much needed housing for the Nelson community. I applaud the Nelson Tasman Housing Trust for its commitment to social housing and the years of hard work that has gone into these units," Mr Carter said.

“The great thing is these new units are just a start. Housing New Zealand has approved further assistance through the Housing Innovation Fund for the Nelson Tasman Trust to purchase another two three bedroom houses. In total the Trust has secured around $1.25 million from the Fund.

"This project is a magnificent example of what can be achieved when the government and community organisations work together to increase the supply of social housing," Mr Carter said.

"Numerous councils, charitable trusts and community organisations throughout the country already maintain social housing that is in need of upgrading or reconfiguring to make it more effective. Many organisations also own land on which they could put new social housing, and others are interested in purchasing land and providing social housing for the first time.

"Until recently, these groups have struggled to access resources to enable them to make the most of their existing assets or turn their interest in to a reality. The Housing Innovation Fund is designed to provide grants and loans to do just that.

"Budget 2006 secured an additional $16.4 million for the Fund, a recognition of the emphasis we are placing on this work," Mr Carter said.
