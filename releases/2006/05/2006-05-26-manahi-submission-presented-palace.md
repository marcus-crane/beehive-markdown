Defence minister Phil Goff today presented a submission to Buckingham Palace on the case of Haane Manahi who was recommended for, but did not receive, a Victoria Cross during the Second World War.

"I took the opportunity today to visit London, following OECD and WTO talks in Paris, to make representations to the Palace on behalf of the Manahi VC Committee and the Te Arawa people, whose representatives accompanied me," Mr Goff said.

"The government has been in discussion with Te Arawa and the Manahi VC Committee. We believe that, on the best evidence, the actions of Haane Manahi were worthy of the award of the Victoria Cross for his bravery at Takrouna Ridge in North Africa in 1943.

"In my view, he won the VC not just once, but time and again.

"Given that the entire chain of military command recommended him for the Victoria Cross, it is hard to understand why he received the DCM.

"The original citation and supporting sworn statements are compelling evidence of Lance-Sergeant Manahi's conspicuous bravery.

"We are exploring with the Queen's advisors whether his case can be reconsidered, mindful of the fact that the consistent position of the monarch since the late 1940s has been not to revisit such decisions.

"We had a positive meeting with the Queen's Private Secretary this afternoon. We are grateful to him for making the time to see us, and for giving us a sympathetic hearing, " Mr Goff said.
