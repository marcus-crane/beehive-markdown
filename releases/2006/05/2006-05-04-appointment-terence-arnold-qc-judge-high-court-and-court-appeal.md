The Attorney-General, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, announced today the appointment of Terence Arnold QC as a Judge of the High Court and Court of Appeal.

Justice Arnold has been Solicitor-General since 2000. During that time there has been a significant growth in the demand for legal services by government agencies. Justice Arnold has successfully managed this growth through organisational changes within the Crown Law Office.

As Solicitor-General Justice Arnold represented the government in a number of leading cases in the Court of Appeal, Supreme Court and Privy Council in the areas of taxation, Treaty of Waitangi jurisprudence, human rights law, criminal law and administrative law.

In addition to providing legal advice to the government on a day-to-day basis, Justice Arnold, as Solicitor-General, was also chair of the Ministerial Advisory Group which provided recommendations to the then Attorney-General on the purpose, structure, composition and role of the new Supreme Court.

Before being appointed Solicitor-General Justice Arnold was a partner of Chapman Tripp Sheffield Young between 1985 and 1994. He became a barrister sole in 1994 and shortly thereafter, was appointed Queen’s Counsel.

Before joining Chapman Tripp Justice Arnold taught criminal law at Victoria University in Wellington as well as at several Canadian universities, including Dalhousie University and the University of Calgary, where he was visiting professor in the mid-1980s.

Justice Arnold has a BA and two LLM degrees from Victoria University and New York University. He has been a member of the Market Surveillance Committee of the New Zealand Electricity Market as well as a founding member of the Law and Economics Association of New Zealand.

Justice Arnold’s appointment will take effect on 19 May 2006.
