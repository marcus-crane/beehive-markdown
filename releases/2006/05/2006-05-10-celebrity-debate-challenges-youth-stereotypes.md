Former Silver Ferns Captain Bernice Mene, columnist Jane Bowron and New Zealand Post CEO John Allen will pit their wits against the crème of young debating talent to launch New Zealand's 2006 Youth Week.

The celebrity debate, chaired by Speaker of the House Margaret Wilson, will see the National Secondary Schools debating team argue the affirmative on the theme "that it's never been so good to be a young person," as part of the launch Youth Week 2006, running from 15-21 May.

The debate, taking place in Parliament's Banquet Hall on Monday 15 May, is part of a nationwide campaign aimed at tackling the negative stereotyping of young New Zealanders. The theme of this year's Youth week is “Re:Define - Challenge Youth Stereotypes”.

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, who will host the debate, says negative stereotyping of young people impacts on their perception of themselves, each other and significantly on their attitude in life.

“Often these stereotypes are so subtle we don’t even notice...it can be hugely negative in a community and result in young people becoming disconnected as teenagers instead of being the best they can be.”

She says the Youth Week campaign lays down a specific challenge to policy-makers, leaders, media and educators and others who influence young people.

“That challenge is a call to action, to redefine attitudes by recognising young peoples’ talents and strengths – not focus on them as problems to be fixed.”

“There is a lot to celebrate. Young people have energy, enthusiasm and fresh ideas, and we need to harness that energy as a positive force.

"Youth Week 2006 is a chance to focus on the value and importance of young people in our communities. Activities organised by and involving young people will be taking place all around New Zealand to celebrate this."

Youth Week is coordinated by the New Zealand Association for Adolescent Health and Development ([NZAAHD](http://www.nzaahd.org.nz/)) with the support of the [Ministry of Youth Development](http://www.myd.govt.nz).
