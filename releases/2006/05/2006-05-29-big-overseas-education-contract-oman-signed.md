A five year deal to provide course content to universities in Oman is a testimony to the quality of our tertiary education institutions, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The New Zealand Tertiary Education Consortium (NZTEC) and the Omani Minister of Higher Education, Her Excellency Dr Rawya Saud Al Busaidi signed the contract at the Beehive earlier today.

The consortium will be providing content for several business and IT degrees and English language courses.

While the value of the deal is confidential, it is understood to be the biggest ever for our international education sector.

“Education has become the cornerstone of the developing bilateral relationship between New Zealand and Oman,” Dr Cullen said. “This is a great opportunity for both countries and further underlines our international reputation for excellence.

“Individual institutions have previously had off-shore contracts, but this is the first time a New Zealand consortium has been formed. This project would have been too big for any one or our institutions.

“It is particularly exciting to see New Zealand education providers diversifying and recognising that by working together, they can access high value opportunities in international markets.

“A partnership approach, involving collaboration between education institutions, backed by government support of the kind New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has provided, is a winning formula for growing New Zealand’s international education sector.”

NZTEC members include: Academic Colleges Group, Auckland University of Technology, The University of Waikato, Victoria University of Wellington, The University of Otago and PINZ Limited.
