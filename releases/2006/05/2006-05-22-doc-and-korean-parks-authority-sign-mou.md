New Zealand's Department of Conservation and the Korean National Parks Authority today signed a Memorandum of Understanding designed to improve co-operation on conservation matters.

"This Memorandum is a significant development and I offer my thanks to the Korean government for participating in it, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"The links between the biodiversity of New Zealand and that of Korea and other Asia nations, are much greater and more important than first appear. Each year more than 150,000 shorebirds migrate between New Zealand and Asia, and then on to Siberia and Alaska, and back again.

"Exactly where all these birds stop off in Asia is still unknown, but it is highly likely Korea's tidal flats will be a home to at least some of our migratory species," Mr Carter said.

"This means the threats these species face in one country directly impact on the abundance of the species in the other country.

"Today's Memorandum is designed to build on New Zealand's already positive relationship with the Korean government. It will facilitate a number of activities such as information exchanges, joint seminars and workshops, joint survey and research programmes, and staff assistance," Mr Carter said.

"Over time, it is my hope this MOU will improve the conservation of migratory birds in both countries."

DOC has initiated similar agreements with the United Kingdom, California, Fiji and Italy.
