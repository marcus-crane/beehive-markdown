Tracing and tracking hazardous waste in New Zealand will soon be as easy as sitting at a computer thanks to the introduction of a new government funded database.

WasteTRACK is an internet-based system that has been designed to improve the monitoring of hazardous waste throughout its life cycle and has received nearly $300,000 of Government funding, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The database, which has been welcomed by the waste industry and territorial authorities, is already being used by some city and district councils, and will be rolled-out around New Zealand.

“[WasteTRACK](http://www.wastetrack.co.nz/default.asp) is all about transparency. For the first time, we will know exactly where hazardous waste is going throughout its entire life cycle. This system is an important tool in the management of hazardous waste,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“Creating clarity and certainty about what happens with hazardous waste is a key focus of the Government’s hazardous waste policy. We are not only looking out for the well-being of the environment, but we are also focusing on the health of our communities.”

WasteTRACK, which is modelled on a similar scheme from the Western Australian Department of Environment, was trialled in New Zealand in 2005. During that time more than 75 million litres of liquid and hazardous waste, mainly from farms and household septic tanks, has been tracked.

Currently Waipa District Council, Hamilton City Council and Waikato District Council are using WasteTRACK. Mr Benson-Pope says more councils have expressed an interest in using the system to gain better control of what enters treatment plants and disposal facilities.

Representative of the liquid and hazardous waste industry, Richard Worsnop, emphasises the sector’s support of the initiative: “With this system our members have the opportunity to improve their environmental performance. Participating companies have to comply with specific requirements to guarantee quality and minimum standards,” he said.
