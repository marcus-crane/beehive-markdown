Jim Anderton today addressed the second of the Sustainable Water Programme of Action meetings in Dunedin. Jim Anderton's Ministry of Agriculture is jointly responsible with David Benson-Pope's Ministry of the Environment for getting the discussion on fresh water out as widely as possible, which has at its heart, the ecological and economic development future of New Zealand. The first meeting was held in Wellington yesterday.

"These meetings are taking place in all the main centres and David Benson-Pope and I are going to most of them to hear what is being said in heartland New Zealand. We are here because we know this discussion is of utmost importance and we want a partnership approach to the solutions that are central to these discussions on water.

"These talks could have happened years ago but they didn't - and for a country that sells itself as "clean and green with an abundance of lakes and rivers" we certainly need this dialogue and the follow-up action plan to get moving. There was an extensive public consultation process undertaken early last year, which has helped shape the government’s priorities and actions on water at this stage of the process.

"Up until now, most New Zealanders have taken water for granted. It is true that we have an abundance of freshwater in some parts of New Zealand, but we are finally reaching the point where pressure to satisfy our different values and needs for freshwater is pushing the resource to its limits in many places. We all need to recognise that water is not an unlimited resource. It is one of the country’s most valuable assets, and we must manage it efficiently and sustainably. Many of the issues we are talking about at these meetings are simply an indicator of an emerging national trend.

"Some people have suggested this is a step towards privatisation. I don't know where they have got their information from but nothing could be further from the reality of what is proposed by the Sustainable Water Programme of Action. Water is a publicly owned resource. We are talking about strategic management in partnership with industry, local government and local communities. We are looking at all these issues from a nationwide perspective, which has never been done before. For the first time, we will have the big picture on water use and a national approach to manage freshwater in New Zealand. This is good news for us all," Jim Anderton said today.
