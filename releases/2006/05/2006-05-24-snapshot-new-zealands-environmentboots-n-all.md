A snapshot of New Zealand’s key environmental issues has been published in a new book launched today by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

Gentle Footprints: Boots ‘n’ All is published by the Ministry for the Environment and aims to provide a starting point for ordinary New Zealanders to have conversations about their environment.

“Boots ‘n’ All is all about informing people about real environmental issues in New Zealand in a way that all Kiwis can understand,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“Concern for the environment has become a shared and common value among all New Zealanders. The book will encourage people to discuss, debate and engage in this most challenging, but ultimately important issue.”

Boots ‘n’ All contains easily accessible information on key issues surrounding New Zealand’s environment such as waste, air quality, toxic substances, climate change, oceans and water.

“The environment is integral to our daily lives and the quality of our lives. It is central to the lifestyles and identity we cling to as New Zealanders.

“We want children to read the book and talk to their friends and families about it. We want people in cafes to pick it up and read it. It’s all about starting conversations and increasing the awareness of New Zealanders about these important issues,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

The books will be distributed all over New Zealand to schools, libraries and local councils as well as different places in communities like cafes, doctors’ waiting rooms and workplace lunchrooms.
