Whangarei landowners are getting over $65,000 in grant funding to help protect to help preserve wildlife and natural habitat.

Labour MP Dover Samuels today announced the government biodiversity funding grants for Northland Regional Council, QEII National Trust, NZ Landcare Trust, and Pouto Topu A Trust.

Northland Regional Council is getting four grants around Mangaturoto, south of Whangarei. The Ball Estuarine and Native Bush Restoration project gets $16,000 for a 4.5km fence to protect mature coastal remnants and regenerating coastal forest on Ohutu Farms. A grant of $10,700 goes towards a 4.7km fence to protect the 25 hectare McKay Wetland and Estuarine Protection project regenerating native forest and wetland. The Ballard Bush and Estuarine Wetland Protection gets $4,500 to help protect 28 hectares of bush, estuary margins and salt marsh wetlands with a 3.6 km fence. And $4,000 goes to Lupton Estuarine Wetland and Bush for a local couple to fence off and protect over 27 hectares of estuarine edge, salt marsh, and wetland, plus a 2.5 hectare remnant of kowhai bush.

QEII National Trust's Ocean Beach Restoration Project gets $10,068 to help restore covenanted private owned land 35km south-east of Whangarei. The project involves spraying pest weeds and planting over 8000 plants and is in partnership with landowners, Northland Regional Council, Whangarei District Council and the QEII National Trust.

A grant of $9,762 goes to the 26 landowners in the Tutukaka Landcare Coalition for pest control to rejuvenate the endangered pateke in the 1,000ha tutukaka coastal forest from Sandy Bay to Ngunguru Sand Spit north-east of Whangarei. After a trapping programme, DoC plans to release pateke bred in captivity to supplement the small numbers of pateke already breeding in the area. The project will get a $5,000 more for a resource document on the area's biodiversity values. NZ Landcare Trust will oversee the project.

Kaipara Harbour's North Head sees a grant to the Pouto Topu A Trust of up to $5,000 for an ecologist to develop a management plan to protect and sustain indigenous biodiversity values for future generations.

The local grants are part of a nationwide announcement by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa today that $1.3 million is being distributed to 104 projects across the country.

“Many fragmented areas of native bush and wetland now only exist on private land. This funding makes a significant difference for landowners and the community working to restore and preserve unique native fauna and flora. The funding goes some way to safeguarding New Zealand's rich biodiversity and identity as a clean green and sustainable nation," said Dover Samuels.

The Biodiversity Condition and Advice funds were established in 2000 under the $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package. The next funding round is now open: see www.biodiversity.govt.nz, or call 0800 86 20 20.
