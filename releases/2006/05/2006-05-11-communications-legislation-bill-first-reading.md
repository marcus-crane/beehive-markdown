Communications Minister David Cunliffe today moved the first reading of the Communications Legislation Bill.

The bill is largely a technical measure that corrects some anomalies in existing legislation and deals with some timing issues.

It is not related to any decisions on the broader telecommunications stocktake the minister announced last week. It was introduced to Parliament on 6 April.

The bill has been referred to the commerce select committee, which is due to present its report back to Parliament by July 28.
