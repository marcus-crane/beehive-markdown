The interception of $135 million worth of drugs at the New Zealand border yesterday is just reward for the hard and often unrecognised work done by Customs and Police officers, says Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The bust, involving massive amounts crystal methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine, is the largest ever in New Zealand.

"These operations can often take months of hard work by Customs, Police and other agencies to get to the point where arrests are made and charges laid. I personally congratulate all the men and women, both in New Zealand, and from the Hong Kong Police, for all their efforts in helping to stop these insidious and dangerous drugs from getting into New Zealand and out into our communities," Ms Mahuta said.

"However, this large haul of drugs and the ongoing battle against the devastation they cause in our communities is a chilling reminder that we cannot let up in our fight against the criminals attempting to bring them into our country.

"While agencies such as Customs is committed to stopping these drugs at the border, and works closely with Police, it is essential that all of us – as individuals, families, communities and governments – work together, by refusing to accept the spread of these destructive and harmful drugs in our society.

"As Youth Affairs Minister, I am also concerned about the effects of drugs on our young people. As part of this, I am involved in supporting initiatives committed to reducing drug harm, such as the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy and the Drugs and Young People Policy Roundtable."
