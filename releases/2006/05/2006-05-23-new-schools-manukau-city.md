The government will invest around $237 million over the next ten years to build seven new schools in Flat Bush, Manukau City, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The schools are needed to meet population growth in Flat Bush, with the population projected to increase to 40,000 by 2020, including more than 8,500 school age children.

"The government is committed to providing a world-class learning environment for all New Zealand students," Steve Maharey said.

"This investment will provide Flat Bush with four new primary schools, two junior high schools and a senior high school, across four sites.

"Students will be able to attend local schools that are well resourced, and well integrated into their community. The plan for these new schools has been developed in close consultation with the community to ensure it meets local needs and provides a safe and supportive learning environment for all children.

"The [network of schools](http://www.flatbushstrategy.co.nz/) will include two multi-school campuses and three stand alone school sites, including Baverstock Oaks School which opened in 2005. All sites will include provision for early childhood education centres. Additional funding will be provided to build these centres as population growth makes them necessary."

Steve Maharey said the Ministry of Education would bring together a group of community representatives to guide implementation of the plan.

"This group will undertake preliminary planning for the campuses, assist in establishing boards of trustees and develop strategies to ensure all students learning needs are met, including special education. The Ministry of Education will consult the boards of other schools in the area and the wider community before individual schools are established."

Manukau Mayor Sir Barry Curtis welcomed the announcement: "Flat Bush is the fastest growing area in New Zealand. I'm delighted the government is planning ahead to ensure local families will have access to a world-class network of new schools."

Steve Maharey said the government was making further increases to school property funding through this year's Budget.

"Capital funding for schools will increase by $148.9 million, taking it to $527.8 million in 2006/07. The big investment we've made in property since 1999 means schools can now use funding to continue modernising their buildings and creating environments suitable for the 21st century."
