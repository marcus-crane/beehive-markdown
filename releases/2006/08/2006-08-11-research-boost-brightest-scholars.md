Twenty four scholars will be undertaking vital research thanks to the latest [Top Achiever Doctoral scholarships](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/scholarships/topachiever.htm), the Minister for Tertiary Education Dr Michael Cullen announced today.

“These scholarships have been set up to nurture high quality research in all disciplines, and support development of internationally competitive researchers and graduates,” Dr Cullen said.

The 24 scholars will get almost $2.8 million over the next three years of their study. While most of the scholars will undertake their research at a New Zealand university, some will carry out their studies at an overseas tertiary institution.

On the completion of the scholarship, students conducting research overseas must return to New Zealand for a period equal to that of the scholarship.

The research supported includes:

- analysis of New Zealand’s export education industry and how to strategically manage its development.
- development of enhanced management practises for brown kiwi and brushtail possum through global positioning systems and geographic information systems.

“The research supported by the scholarships shows how tertiary education can be a driver of innovation and improved productivity, and underpin this country’s economic transformation,” Dr Cullen said.

Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships are administered by the Tertiary Education Commission. The next round of applications for the scholarships closes on 15 December 2006.
