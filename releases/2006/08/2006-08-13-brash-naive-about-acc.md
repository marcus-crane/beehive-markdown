ACC Minister Ruth Dyson says comments made in a radio interview by National Party leader Don Brash about New Zealand's world respected ACC scheme highlight once again his lack of policy knowledge.

"The comments made by Dr Brash show he is driven by radical free market ideology, not what is best for New Zealanders," says Ruth Dyson.

"Dr Brash has admitted that ACC is working - but wants to "fix" it anyway by introducing private insurers, a return to National's failed policies of the 1990s.

"Is this to keep his donors in the insurance industry happy? Because it would lead to rising costs for employers and less comprehensive care for New Zealanders injured at work.

"Dr Brash also proposed opening the door to expensive litigation for New Zealand companies by refusing to rule out giving people the right to sue as an option.

"This in particular shows up Dr Brash's lack of basic policy knowledge - public and private companies all operate under the same legislation - or is this another secret policy surprise that National is keeping from the public?"

Since the Labour-led government returned ACC to public being a fully public scheme, the average levies for self-employed, earners and employers have reduced.

Australian and New Zealand workers' compensation schemes had similar levies eight years ago but New Zealand rates are now on average just over a third of Australia's.

"ACC gives New Zealand a clear competitive advantage in most industries - and this Labour-led government wants to keep that," says Ruth Dyson.
