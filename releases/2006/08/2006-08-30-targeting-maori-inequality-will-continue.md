Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui is describing Tony Ryall's attempt to embark on a [racial finger pointing](http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/Documents/20060830.htm#_Toc144720245) exercise in Parliament this afternoon as amateurish at best and provocative at worst.

Lifestyle coaching aimed at Maori males aged between 35 and 45 is a serious attempt to address a very real concern around the effects of heart disease in the health sector.

"One can only draw a very insidious picture of why Ryall chose to highlight this governments efforts in addressing Maori health issues and yet failed to mention any of the other target groups," said Mita Ririnui.

"Tony Ryall chose to highlight Maori because of the colour of their skin and that type of behaviour in this day and age has sinister overtures.

"What he needs to understand is that Maori are dying in huge numbers because of the issues that revolve around heart disease.

"[Cardiovascular disease is by far the biggest killer of Maori](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0607/S00074.htm) and I support Western Bay PHO's innovative response in addressing a very real concern.

"I am surprised that Ryall doesn't know that, considering heart disease was also a leading cause of death among Maori during the 90's when his outfit did nothing about it.

"It makes absolute sense to target Maori in any campaign like this because they are dying at alarmingly higher rate than any other group in this country as a direct result of the issues around heart disease.

"It is not acceptable that we should be forced to sit back and watch our people die just because of the naive ramblings of a tory MP.

"I will continue to support programmes that unashamedly seek to target those who require help to reduce inequalities," said Mita Ririnui.
