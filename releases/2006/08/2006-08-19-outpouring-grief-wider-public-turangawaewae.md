Mourners gathered outside the gates of Tûrangawaewae Marae at 8.00 o’clock this morning as members of the general public gathered to pay their final respects to the Mâori Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

Due to an outpouring of requests received from the wider public provision was made by the whänau pani (grieving family) to set aside two-hours to allow the community to express their sympathy and grief at the loss of a respected leader loved by many different communities and cultures in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Nanaia Mahuta, family spokesperson said “Te Arikinui was not a leader that was confined to Mâori and she was able to move easily amongst all members of society, she was loved and respected by them also”.

Sombre downcast faces expressed unspoken sympathy as tears flowed freely amongst the procession of mourners. Floral tributes, a simple touch of the casket and silent prayers were laid at the feet of Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu’s cloak covered casket as the procession filed slowly past the meeting house Mahinarangi.

“The family thank all those members of the public who took part in the solemn procession. We also would like to thank those Local Authorities who have instituted a condolences book to honour Te Arikinui, no reira tçnâ koutou katoa”.

Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu aged 75 years passed away peacefully on Tuesday evening surrounded by her family members.
