Tomorrow's International Youth Day (Saturday 12 August) is a great chance to celebrate one of New Zealand's greatest natural resources – the 780,000* young people that make up almost a quarter of our country's population.

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said International Youth Day, being launched in Wellington with "Aotearoa Fusion" – a special expo on youth issues – was an opportunity for parents, communities, leaders and government decision-makers to reflect on the positive contribution young people made.

"So often what we see portrayed in the media is the negative youth stereotypes, which focus on the minority of young people who may get into trouble or cause problems. While there are issues and challenges facing our young people – as there are with any group – research shows that for the vast majority of young New Zealanders, the picture is overwhelmingly positive."

Aotearoa Fusion is organised by Rangatahi Impact, a group of dedicated young people from the Future Leaders programme, a national leadership development course run by the New Zealand Leadership Institute. The group will be hosting a series of workshops for young people, focusing on their vision for the future of New Zealand, and looking at setting up an active national youth network.

Ms Mahuta will launch International Youth Day with a speech at Zeal Youth Cafe, Garrett Street, Wellington, at 10.30am tomorrow (Saturday August 12).

"Congratulations to Rangatahi Impact for organising this great event, and I encourage and support all of those young people around the country who are out there getting involved in positive activities with their peers and in their families, schools and communities.

"Young people aged 15-24 make up about 18 per cent of the world's population, which is just over one billion people. That's a fantastic source of innovation, energy and potential, which needs to be nurtured and encouraged. International Youth Day is a great chance for all of us to celebrate young people and remind ourselves of the fresh ideas, energy and enthusiasm that they bring.

"The Ministry of Youth Development is the government's key link with the young people of New Zealand, and is just one of one of the ways that passionate young are getting involved and making a difference to the world around them.

"On International Youth Day, I would like to encourage all young people who are passionate about issues affecting them to get involved in the decision-making process, whether its through Ministry's youth development programmes, or through their local youth council, school, youth group or community."
