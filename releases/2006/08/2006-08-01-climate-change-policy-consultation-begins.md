This week the government will hold the first of several stakeholder consultation sessions to discuss possible new approaches to dealing with climate change.

Key sector groups have been invited to attend the first workshop in Auckland, where the Climate Change Minister David Parker will present the government's current thinking on ways to reduce carbon emissions.

Further workshops will be held in Wellington and Christchurch, and will be followed by a much broader programme of engagement in coming months.

The discussion with stakeholders will be closed to the general public to allow free and frank debate. However interested media are invited to attend the initial address by Mr Parker (duration 25 minutes).

DATE:Thursday, 3 August 2006  
TIME:2pm.  
VENUE:Heritage Hotel, 35 Hobson St, Auckland
