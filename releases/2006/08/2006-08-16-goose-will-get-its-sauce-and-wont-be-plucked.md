There is no intention to withdraw retrospective legislation to help the New Zealand Herald's owners out of their tax pickle, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The point I was making, which seems to have escaped National Party leader Don Brash, is that the Herald is being outrageous in continuing to campaign against possible retrospective legislation over parliamentary service spending while ignoring the argument for retrospectivity when it comes to its owners' problems," said Dr Cullen.

"As I said yesterday, it's all about the consistency of the newspaper's arguments.

"Dr Brash needs to read the Solicitor-General's opinion closely.

"Either he believes everyone should abide by the rules, even though they are unfair and nobody has observed them, in which case he was right to pay over the $10,000 and now agrees that National owes millions more and the Herald should never be forgiven its big tax bill.

"Or he doesn't believe that, in which case, he was silly to pay over the $10,000 and agrees with me that the Herald is being hypocritical and retrospective legislation on both issues is a sensible way forward.

"You can't have it both ways Dr Brash."
