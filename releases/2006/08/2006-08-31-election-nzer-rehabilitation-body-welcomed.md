The election of Anne Hawker of the Disabled Peoples'Assembly as president of Rehabilitation International has been welcomed by Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson.

"I am pleased that Anne Hawker will become the next president - and first woman president - of Rehabilitation International starting in 2008. This recognises her long association with the organisation and her commitment to disability issues in New Zealand and worldwide," says Ruth Dyson.

New York-based Rehabilitation International is a federation of organisations represented in more than 80 nations that develops and promotes initiatives to improve rehabilitation and to protect the rights of people with disabilities.

The organisation is playing an active role in promoting the recently negotiated United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Anne Hawker has previously had roles as Rehabilitation Improvement Manager for ACC, Access Manager for the Health Funding Authority and Chief Executive Officer of the Head Injury Society of New Zealand.

In her capacity as National President of DPA (NZ) Anne Hawker was host of RI's 1996 World Congress, which was held in Auckland and sponsored by ACC.
