Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban visited Whangarei today to congratulate eight Northland community groups who are the successful recipients of Community Partnership Funding (CPF).

The eight groups are: Te Hua O Te Kawariki; the Otamatea Kauri and Pioneer Museum Trust Board; Carers New Zealand; One Double Five Whare Roopu Community House; Pa O Te Ora Charitable Trust; Motatau Marae Trustees; He Iwi Kotahi Tatou Trust; and the Ngatiwai Trust Board. They are among over 50 successful applicants throughout New Zealand.

“The Community Partnership Fund supports national, regional, and community Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives. The Northland projects encompassed all three ‘C’s’ of the Digital Strategy - Content, Confidence, and Connection,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

“These projects reach out into the community, involving schools, businesses, various iwi, and community organisations across the Northland region.

"I look forward to seeing how these partnerships evolve to develop a digital Northland of the future,” said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Minister said she was keen to promote and showcase innovative ICT projects like the eight Northland projects.

“These groups highlight the healthy ICT appetites New Zealanders have, and our potential to be leaders in community ICT projects. Realising the ICT potential of our communities can lead to enhanced economic, cultural and social opportunities."

Through the Community Partnership Fund, the Labour-led Government is providing $20.7 million seed funding over four years to partly fund partnership initiatives that will improve our communities’ capability and skills to use ICT and develop digital content. The Fund, which is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, will look to innovative and collaborative ventures that will unlock the potential of New Zealand communities.
