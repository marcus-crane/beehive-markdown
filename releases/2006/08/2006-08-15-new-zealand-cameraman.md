Prime Minister Helen Clark today said the government is very concerned for the safety of New Zealand camerman Olaf Wiig.

Mr Wiig, a television cameraman, and a US citizen have been taken captive.

At this stage information is sketchy about the circumstances.

It is not clear who is responsible for their capture and where in Gaza the incident took place.

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was alerted by British authorities this morning. New Zealand diplomats are travelling to the region to work with other officials and governments on the release of Mr Wiig and his colleague," Helen Clark said.
