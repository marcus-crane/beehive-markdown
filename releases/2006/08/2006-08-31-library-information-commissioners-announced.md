The Minister responsible for the National Library Judith Tizard today announced three new appointments and a new Chair of the Library and Information Advisory Commission (LIAC).

The purpose of LIAC is to provide advice to the Minister on library and information issues in New Zealand, including matauranga Maori, and access to library and information services.

The new LIAC Chair is Brian Pauling. A current LIAC Commissioner, he is a Director of the NZ Broadcasting School at the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology. Brian also brings extensive knowledge in publishing, and adult education.

The following new members have been appointed for three-year terms:

New member Bill Macnaught is Manager of Puke Ariki, which comprises New Plymouth's museum, public library and visitor information centre. In 2003 Bill was appointed Chair of the United Kingdom Advisory Council on Libraries by the UK Minister responsible for libraries.

Janet Copsey is the Librarian at the University of Auckland. She is a Fellow of the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa and a member of the Council of New Zealand University Libraries.

Paul Thompson (Wellington) is the former Director of the Museum of Wellington City and Sea and brings extensive experience in the heritage, museum, archive and technology sectors. He has attended museum leadership programmes at the University of Melbourne (2003) and the Getty Art Museum in Los Angeles (2005).

Judith Tizard said, “The new LIAC commissioners are very experienced in the arts and culture sector. Their appointments herald the way for closer working relationships between National Library and similar New Zealand organisations, which will benefit all New Zealanders by greater access to their cultural heritage.”

Aucklanders Evelyn Tobin and Paul Reynolds have been reappointed for a further two years. Evelyn (Ngati Manu and Nga Puhi) is a specialist in the field of Maori education. Paul Reynolds, a Director of on-line media company McGovern & Associates, has a special interest in community access and contribution to knowledge issues.

The Minister thanked the outgoing LIAC members, Ainslie Dewe (Chair) and Chris Szekely, for their commitment and support to the Library during their tenure.
