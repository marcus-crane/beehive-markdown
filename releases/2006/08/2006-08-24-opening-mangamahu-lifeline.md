The official opening of a temporary bailey bridge at Mangamahu restores a vital lifeline to community, Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today.

"The collapse of the Ngaturi Bridge on 9 July effectively isolated the community of Mangamahu," said Rick Barker.

"The resilience and resourcefulness displayed by the community since the collapse is typical of how New Zealanders respond to such things, a little less talk and a lot more 'do'.

"I visited the area two days after the collapse and assured Mangamahu locals that the government would work as fast as we could to restore access. And we did.

"The day after my visit I contacted Transit who agreed to plan and manage the construction of a bailey bridge. Land Transport New Zealand then confirmed that they would pay for it, on the very same day.

"Transport Minister Annette King played a vital role in making this happen so quickly and I'd like to use this occasion to thank her for all her help.

"I'd also like to thank those involved in the speedy construction of this bridge. It has been a complex, seven-day-a-week job, made tougher by challenging weather conditions. They have done a superb job.

"It is with great pleasure that I declare this bridge officially open!" said Rick Barker.
