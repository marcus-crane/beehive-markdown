“The decision of New Zealand Windfarms Ltd to build almost 100 turbines in New Zealand for its new windfarm is great news for New Zealand manufacturing," Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made, says.

“This commercial decision shows that New Zealand has both the design and manufacturing capability to build state of the art technology for the growing market of alternative energy sources.

“It debunks the myth put forward by right wing commentator Matthew Hooton this week that New Zealand manufacturing is “almost dead and will be dead in 20 years”, Sue Bradford says.

New Zealand Windfarms' chief executive, Chris Freear said in a statement earlier today that Windflow Technology, which has a 40 percent stake in his company, will make the turbines in New Zealand.

He said the main advantage is that there will be no exposure to changes in the exchange rate and the creation an industry in New Zealand for parts and maintenance. He also anticipated that the design, specifically for New Zealand conditions, will mean a lower unit cost for the project.

Sue Bradford has written to New Zealand Windfarms to congratulate them on their decision.

Declaration of interest. Sue Bradford is a beneficary of Green Futures, which holds 6, 033 shares (or .089% of the 6.7 million total shares) in Windflow Technology.
