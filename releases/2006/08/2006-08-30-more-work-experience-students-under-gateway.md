More senior school students will gain valuable hands-on workplace experience next year with another 92 schools joining the successful [Gateway](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/training/gateway.html) programme, Minister for Tertiary Education Michael Cullen announced today.

"Since Gateway was launched as a pilot in 2001, it has gone from strength to strength with 13,000 students already having gained valuable skills," Dr Cullen said. "Next year almost 9,000 students from 298 schools will be on board, representing three quarters of all state and integrated secondary schools.

Budget 2006 provided additional funding of $8.1 million (GST exclusive) over four years to expand Gateway opportunities to all decile 7-10 state and integrated secondary schools. Total funding for Gateway will be approximately $21 million (GST exclusive) in 2008/09.

"The expansion of Gateway is great news for students and businesses. The scheme helps students to make better career choices and employers to identify the talent of tomorrow. Over 6,000 businesses are already offering workplace learning to Gateway students.

"Last year 27 per cent of students participating ended up being directly employed while another 57 per cent went on to further secondary or tertiary study. That's a great result.

"Gateway builds on other initiatives such as Modern Apprenticeships which recently celebrated the 2000th apprentice to complete training. It underlines the many measures this government is taking to address skills shortages.

"Gateway is helping New Zealand produce more people with the skills needed to transform this country into a high-wage, knowledge-based economy. I encourage all businesses and schools not currently participating in Gateway to take advantage of this opportunity,” Dr Cullen said.

**Background information:**  
The Gateway programme integrates schools-based learning with structured workplace learning for senior students (Years 11-13) at state and integrated secondary schools. It provides young school leavers with better learning and work-ready habits, increased employment opportunities, and enhanced knowledge about the workplace and its expectations and requirements of people entering the industry.
