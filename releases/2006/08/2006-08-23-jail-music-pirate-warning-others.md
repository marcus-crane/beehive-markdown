Judith Tizard Associate Commerce and Arts, Culture & Heritage Minister has welcomed today's jail sentence for a music pirate.

"I welcome today's decision which must set a precedent for other music and film pirates," said Judith Tizard. "Piracy and theft of copyright materials for film, music, fashion and design are serious crimes which are damaging our creative businesses and workers.

"This disrespect is undermining our own film and music industries.

The South Auckland man was sentenced to nine months jail today in the Manukau District Court for illegally copying music and selling it at weekend markets in Auckland. In addition he was ordered to pay reparations of $8,500 to the copyright owners and forfeit the equipment he used.

"Copyright is a really significant issue for our creative sector. It enables our artists, authors, musicians, performers and other creators to make a living from their work. It provides incentives for creators to create original works and investors to invest in the creation of new stories and other creative efforts."

Judith Tizard said the Labour-led Government had a special interest in the promotion of innovation, arts and culture.

”Both world wide and in New Zealand, the cultural and heritage sectors are amongst the key growth areas for the 21st century. Creativity is at the heart of innovation and it contributes to our economy, to job growth, and to the promotion of our country.

“We want to have vibrant and active creative industries where New Zealanders can tell, hear and see their own stories and make a living from it. Copyright obligations are an important part of ensuring that. We all need to respect the ownership of the creativity which we all enjoy so that artists can earn a livelihood and continue to create their works.

"This decision will help to reinforce the need to respect the copyright of creative New Zealanders."
