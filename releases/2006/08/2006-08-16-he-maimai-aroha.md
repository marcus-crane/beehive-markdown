Labour MP Mita Ririnui has expressed deep sorrow at the passing of Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu this morning.

Her contribution over the past four decades has been unmatched by any contemporary or traditional Maori leader and she leaves an impressive record of achievement.

Te Arikinui spearheaded Maori development in a number of key areas with a strong focus on education.

"All of our Maori caucus members will mourn her loss. Our immediate thoughts are with Nanaia and we will join her at Turangawaewae as the nation delivers its final farewell over the coming days.

"Her humble gait hid a strong spirit, sharp mind and a pragmatism to get things done.

"I met Te Arikinui on numerous occasions, her smile was infectious and always welcoming, she epitomised Kingitanga which was founded on unity and a common purpose to serve the people.

"Te Arikinui can pass knowing that she lived a full life and lead her people through a period of change that will continue to reverberate for many years to come.

No reira kei te tangi te ngakau  
Therefore my heart weeps  
Kua ngaro atu koe  
You are lost  
E kaikini nei ahau, tatou katoa hoki, i te hinapouri  
We are gnawed with a profound sadness  
Pakoko kau toku kanohi i te pouri  
Our faces are etched with grief  
Haere atu ra ki a ratou ma kua wheturangitia  
Go to those who have taken their place among the stars  
Ki te huinga o te kahurangi  
To the great gathering place of rainbows  
Aue te mamae  
Alas the grief  
Kei te tangi nga maunga huri noa, kei te waipuke nga awa, kei te maringi mai nga kapua pouri  
All of the mountains weep, the rivers are flooding and the clouds of sadness gather  
I rere mai koe i runga i nga pakau o te hau, rere atu ki a Taupiri he moenga rangatira whakaoti atu  
You flew to us on the winds and now you must fly to your ancestral mountain to rest among the chiefs for a final time  
No reira Te Ata, moe mai, moe mai, moe mai  
Therefore Te Ata may you sleep and rest  
Mo ake tonu atu paimarire  
For ever more in peace
