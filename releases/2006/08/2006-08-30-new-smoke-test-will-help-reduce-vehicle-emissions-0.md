From October a visible smoke test will become part of the warrant of fitness in an effort to reduce vehicle emissions and clean up air quality the Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

"This Labour-led government takes the vehicle emissions issue seriously. We need to act - our health and our clean green and sustainable environment depend on it," says Judith Tizard.

"It's estimated that vehicle emissions contribute to the death of nearly 400 New Zealanders every year and that the overall effects cost the country $442 million each year. These emissions harm the young, the old and the already sick, make respiratory and heart conditions worse, and damage our resistance to colds and flu."

As part of the warrant or certificate of fitness, inspectors will check exhaust smoke by running the car for five seconds while the engine idles and for another five seconds when engine speed is increased. Vehicles that produce smoke for five seconds or more will need to be repaired before they can be taken out on the road. The new test will be implemented on 27 October 2006.

"If your vehicle emits visible smoke then it needs maintenance. Poorly maintained vehicles emit up to 10 times more pollutants than a well-maintained vehicle," says Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven. "If your vehicle is well-maintained you'll be saving on your fuel bills as well as reducing emissions and improving air quality."

"The visible smoke test is one of many measures this government has implemented to reduce vehicle pollution. We have also improved fuel specifications, we have tightened requirements for imported vehicles, and we have Police ticketing smoky vehicles," says Judith Tizard.

"The current 'Choke the smoke' campaign, which is also part of this programme, aims to increase public awareness of the harmful effects of vehicle emissions."

"This is a good step to further reduce vehicle emissions," says Judith Tizard. "We'll be considering more sophisticated test methods for the future."

Climate change minister David Parker says having vehicles tuned means they use less fuel, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

"Here's an example of a small practical step to address climate change, that makes sense to do anyway, because it saves us money."

David Parker says the change will take its place alongside a wide range of climate change policies under development, which aim to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions as well as position the country to best deal with the impacts climate change will have on our lives.
