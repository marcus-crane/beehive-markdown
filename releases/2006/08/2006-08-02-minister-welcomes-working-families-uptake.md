Targeted tax relief aimed at New Zealand families has received the only endorsement that really counts – families taking up their entitlement, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The latest uptake figures show that in the month of June 2006 there were 70,500 more families receiving [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz) tax relief through the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) than a year ago.

Over that month the Government paid out $140 million in Working for Families targeted tax relief.

“As everyone knows, raising children costs money, which is why Working for Families is about targeting tax where it is needed, not to the wealthy but to hard working New Zealand families raising children,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The increase in uptake since the 1 April introduction of the extended Working for Families package can be directly attributed to the extensive public awareness campaign.

“Nevertheless, we will be continuing to promote this package at a national and local level to ensure that people are aware of their entitlements. This includes providing information to people in workplaces to ensure that everyone is aware of their entitlement.”

It is estimated that about 360,000 families will be better off as a result of Working for Families in the 2006/07 tax year.

This includes families who will only claim Family Assistance for part of the tax year, and many other families who will not claim their entitlements until after the end of the tax year.
