Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has welcomed a ministerial directive that young prisoners be kept separate from adults in transit, following the death of teenager Liam Ashley who was attacked in a prison van.

Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor yesterday instructed Corrections to separate prisoners aged under 18 from older prisoners when transporting them to and from prison until inquiries into the incident were complete – a move endorsed by Ms Mahuta.

"I support the action the Corrections Minister has taken to ensure young offenders are kept apart from adult offenders in transit. I also welcome the various inquiries into this tragic event, and hope that they may help bring some resolution for the family."
