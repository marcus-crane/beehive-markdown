New Zealand Post chief executive John Allen will to be the next co-chair of the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Mr Allen replaces Kerry McDonald, chairman of the Bank of New Zealand, who is stepping down.

“Mr Allen is a highly-regarded business leader, with the skills and standing required to assume this important role. He has been chief executive at New Zealand Post since 2003, and holds several directorships, including on the board of Te Papa," Mr Peters said.

“The Leadership Forum has become a significant feature of the relationship between our two countries, and I am very pleased someone of Mr Allen's stature will be New Zealand's new co-chair.

“I want to pay tribute to Kerry McDonald’s central role in inaugurating the Leadership Forum. His energy, vision and commitment have been essential in establishing the Forum as a viable entity,” Mr Peters said.

The Leadership Forum was established in 2004. It brings together prominent businesspeople, senior political and public sector figures, academics and media from both countries to discuss the present and future state of the relationship, and to network on issues of common interest.

The Australian Co-Chair is James Strong, Chairman of Woolworths Group and the Insurance Australia Group.
