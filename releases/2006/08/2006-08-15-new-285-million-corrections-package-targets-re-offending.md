New Corrections measures [announced today](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26778) will go a long way to reducing re-offending and making the community a safer place, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said.

The initiatives include:

- **Two new prison-based drug and alcohol units** over the next 18 months. These are in addition to the two recently announced drug and alcohol treatment units and the expansion of an existing unit, and bring the total number to six.
- **Two new high-intensity special treatment units**. Programmes running in these units have been shown to significantly reduce re-offending rates.
- Money to **extend the [prisoner work employment strategy](http://www.corrections.govt.nz/public/policyandlegislation/prisoner-employment-strategy-2006-2009/)**. An increase from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of prisoners in meaningful work plus significant increases in training.
- Money to boost **treatment programmes for offenders serving community-based sentences**. Targeted interventions at this stage lower chances of offending escalating to a point where prison becomes the only option.

Mr O'Connor said the new initiatives, which will cost $28.5 million over four years, put the Corrections Department in a very strong position to spur offenders into turning their lives around.

"Most of these offenders eventually come out of prison. The government is determined to do everything possible to steer offenders away from creating more victims when they do. This investment recognises that we all benefit from lower re-offending rates."

They add to a number of steps already undertaken, which include:

- The replacement of low-performing criminogenic programmes with [better-targeted, more intensive programmes](http://www.corrections.govt.nz/public/news/mediareleases/2006/20060321-rehab-programmes.html).
- 16 Corrections re-integration workers.
- 19 teams of Work and Income work brokers to help prisoners find employment on their release.

The Labour-led Government has invested $1 billion to modernise our prison system, adding 2100 extra beds and greatly improving security, Mr O'Connor said. Prisoner escapes are a small fraction of what they were in the late 1990s.
