Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven says he is developing a policy in consultation with interested organisations, to take to his cabinet colleagues that would restrict access to the New Zealand Motor Vehicle Register.

Announcing this today Harry Duynhoven said this would ensure the register is only available to people for approved purposes connected with transport.

"A great deal of public concern has been expressed about how easily the register can be accessed and that such access is regarded as a breach of an individual’s privacy.

“Under the 1986 [Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3002193&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BFA8D6F22%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) people can pay a small fee to [access the details about a motor vehicle, its owners and their address](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3002193&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1986-006%2Fs.19&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1986-006/s.19). There have been reported instances of people using the register for criminal purposes. This has been confirmed by the New Zealand Police and Land Transport New Zealand.

"There have been concerns at the direct marketing industry using information from the register to compile mailing lists.

“A number of people find this very intrusive and have asked for this type of access to be stopped.

“I believe that the public want changes made to tighten up access to the register. The Fair Go television programme has also highlighted the problems and shown the degree of public concern.”

"The Ministry of Transport and Land Transport New Zealand have been working on a proposal and I believe that it will be possible to introduce a Bill to change the law before the end of the year," Mr Duynhoven said.
