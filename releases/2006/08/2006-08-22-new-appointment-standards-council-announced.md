Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel has announced the appointment of Dr Sharon Kletchko, a senior executive with the Nelson-Marlborough District Health Board, to the Standards Council.

Canadian-born Dr Kletchko had a broad knowledge of the health sector, extensive links with district health boards and regional hospitals, and experience in the application, delivery and implementation of standards and quality, Ms Dalziel said.

"I am delighted at the appointment of such an experienced health and education specialist. Dr Kletchko has worked in New Zealand for more than 20 years across our national, regional and local health systems, in positions ranging from healthcare delivery through to senior management and leadership roles."

In addition, Dr Kletchko had previously played a key part in the development of standards for medical records and ambulance services for Standards New Zealand, Ms Dalziel said. Her appointment is for a three-year term.

The Standards Council’s primary functions are to develop standards, and to promote, encourage and facilitate the use of standards to benefit all New Zealanders by improving safety, quality, prosperity and convenience.
