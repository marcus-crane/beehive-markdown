While New Zealanders love their natural waterways, the image of fully clothed adults standing up to their waists in rivers and lakes may seem a little surprising.

Surprise is the reaction the [Ministry for the Environment](http://www.mfe.govt.nz) is aiming for with its national [Water Awareness Campaign,](http://www.4million.org.nz/water/) launched today by the Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

The campaign's promotional materials feature fully-clothed people standing up to their waist in some of New Zealand's iconic water bodies.

“The human body is two-thirds water, so we chose these images along with the slogan, ‘New Zealand. A valuable body of water’. We wanted to grab people’s attention and get them thinking about how they use one of our most precious assets. The photos were shot under closely supervised conditions, and our marketing research showed they created a powerful visual impact.

“The people in these pictures are everyday New Zealanders who, like all of us, depend on freshwater for business, recreation, and family life,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“Most New Zealanders would be astonished if they knew how much water we all use – and waste – every day.

“Most would also be surprised to learn that New Zealand doesn’t have an endless supply of pure water. Some of our rivers are dry, and some of our rivers and lakes are polluted. We may be able to reverse the damage and protect our waterways from now on, but only if we change our behaviour. The first step to changing behaviour is to change attitudes, and that’s what this campaign is doing,” he said.

“To find out more about the value of water and the need to use it more wisely, visit [www.4million.org.nz,](http://www.4million.org.nz/water/) the Government website promoting environmental awareness and the concept of New Zealand having four million careful owners.”

The Water Awareness Campaign is a three-year partnership between central and regional government. It aims to raise people’s awareness of water use and quality issues, and encourage more personal responsibility in water use in the home and the workplace.
