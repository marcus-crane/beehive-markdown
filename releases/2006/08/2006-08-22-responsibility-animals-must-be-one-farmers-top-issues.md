Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton said that while the recent snow event and the long winter recovery in Canterbury has been a test for both farmers and their livestock, this is no excuse for any neglect of the needs of these stock.

He encouraged anyone who sees real cases of neglect or stock suffering to report these to MAF's own 0800 327 027 Animal Welfare line.

"While it is accepted that the snow and cold conditions may have contributed to the potential animal welfare situation, a small number of livestock owners have clearly not met their personal responsibilities to their animals and to the community," Jim Anderton said.

"All those involved in our industry agree that any person who takes on the care of animals must also accept that this responsibility and accountability continues regardless of the weather. Farmers are accountable for ensuring that the animals in their care are provided with the protection they deserve," Jim Anderton said.

Following the snowfall of 11th June the Government, through MAF, appointed five Rural Facilitators and a Rural Coordinator to help the rural community through this devastating event. These appointees have been working for nearly two months with farmers, volunteers and all the rural organisations such as Federated Farmers to ensure that farmers had the physical resources to care for their stock and the feed to ensure no stock went hungry. The Work and Income Task Force Green teams have been actively helping farmers with the cleanup.

"The detailed feed surveys clearly demonstrated that adequate feed is available at reasonable prices for all stock. Today significant quantities of supplementary feed are still being advertised in our papers and available through all stock and station agents.

"The Rural Facilitators have visited hundreds of farms throughout the area and have provided targeted support wherever this has been needed. Publicity has encouraged all rural folk to ask for support if it is needed through contacting the 0800 2 DEFROST line. We all need to be proactive to deal with issues such as animal welfare before they get out of hand.

"Taking into account all the support offered by the farming community itself plus the volunteers and the Government assistance there is no excuse for any stock owner or manager who fails to act in a proper and timely manner to alleviate pain and suffering and allows the animals to get to a point where they hit the headlines like we are now seeing. If a stockowner cannot look after their stock they are responsible to give or sell them to someone who will!

"Sadly while most farmers who dedicated the past two months to the care of their stock are now seeing the benefits of their good work with good lambing, calving and milk production, those who failed to do so will be facing problems – some of which include animal welfare.

"The majority of farmers and stockowners have been shattered by the reports of animal neglect, especially after the commitment they and the rural support teams have made.

"The accusations by some commentators of “greedy farmers” failing to feed their stock is a slander on the good work of 99.9% of stock owners whose personal efforts have ensured that very few stock suffered or died as a result of this long event.

"Those who have failed the community and their stock through neglect of their responsibilities must be dealt with. We must all accept that our community rates a high standard of animal welfare as the norm that is both good farm economics and good care of farm stock," Jim Anderton said.
