New Zealanders aren't in denial about the global challenge we face in climate change, and neither is the government, says Climate Change minister David Parker, in response to a claim by the Green Party's co-leader Russel Norman.

Mr Parker says that on the contrary, the Labour-led government is very much focused on ways to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, as well as preparing the country for the effects of climate change that will inevitably occur.

"Climate change is a long-term challenge, and we are intent on developing a long-term, durable solution," David Parker said. "Russel Norman has discovered New Zealanders are concerned about climate change. This is the feedback I have also been receiving from the many discussions I have had about climate change around the country, and I welcome it."

"The government is currently consulting on its climate change work programmes, along with the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the review of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy."

David Parker says work across a broad spectrum of government departments is feeding into the government's response to climate change, which will reduce the country's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"As the Greens well know, from their work with us developing a solar water heating programme, this government is keen to promote initiatives that save New Zealand families money, as well as do our bit to tackle climate change."

"For this to work, all must play a part. That's why we are intent on gaining input from as many New Zealanders as possible."

"I can assure Mr Norman the government's response is not 'do nothing' but it is essential that the solution we find is sound and durable, and based on thorough consultation."
