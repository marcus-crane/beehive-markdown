Taupo’s hosting of the A1 Grand Prix series in January will provide significant spin-offs for the region and the country, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“This is a significant international sporting event for Taupo and New Zealand. It is a major achievement for New Zealand motor sport and a huge fillip for our tourism and event industries,” Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard said.

“It will also help to cement New Zealand’s emerging reputation as great place to host major international sporting events, following on from the considerable worldwide exposure we earned through the America’s Cup regattas in 2000 and 2003.

“As New Zealand looks forward to hosting the Rugby World Cup and World Rowing Champs in 2011, Taupo’s A1GP round will provide a further opportunity to promote New Zealand to a significant global audience.”

The New Zealand round of the A1GP, a series which is known as the World Cup of Motor Sport, will be raced at the Taupo Motor Sport Park on January 21.

A $2 million funding boost for the park was announced by the government in June, supplementing funding from the Taupo District Council and private investors to upgrade the track and facilities at the park.

The Government’s grant came through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s Major Regional Initiative funding, a component of its Regional Partnerships Programme which supports projects that promote regional economic growth.

That support gave the organisers of the A1GP the confidence to confirm a round of the World Cup of Motor Sport at Taupo in 2007. Besides regional benefits, the event is expected to provide a $23 million boost to New Zealand’s economy.

“We’re sure New Zealanders will embrace such a quality event being held in our backyard and, as a government, we’re pleased to have helped with funding.

“Now we will be examining how we can leverage this significant opportunity to New Zealand’s benefit even further,” Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard said.
