The Government is looking to reduce compliance costs for registering trade marks through joining key international trade mark treaties the Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

Judith Tizard says it is important for government to pursue measures to support and facilitate New Zealand’s successful participation in the global economy.

"By joining these Treaties, New Zealand businesses can make significant financial savings when registering their trade marks overseas."

The treaties are the Nice Agreement, the Singapore Treaty, and the Madrid Protocol.

"Kiwi ingenuity is helping New Zealand to become a country which produces high- value goods and services for the export market. We want to ensure our intellectual property is protected in other jurisdictions in an efficient and effective way.

The Madrid Protocol provides an international regime for the registration of trade marks, called the Madrid system, which would enable New Zealand businesses to file a single application directly with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) and designate one or more overseas countries where protection is sought. Currently, New Zealand businesses need to submit separate applications in each country where protection is required.

The Nice Agreement provides an international classification system for trade mark goods and services. Accession to the Nice Agreement will enable IPONZ to participate in the development of the Nice classification system to ensure it meets the needs of New Zealand businesses.

The Singapore Treaty aims to make national trade mark registration systems more user-friendly through the simplification and international harmonisation of trade mark registration procedures.

Judith Tizard says the public consultation part of the process is completed and the next step will be for these treaties to be presented to the House of Representatives to allow Parliament to examine the merits of New Zealand’s accession.

“Following successful conclusion of the examination process, I will be seeking to introduce a Bill into the House next year amending the Trade Marks Act 2002 to implement the Madrid system.”
