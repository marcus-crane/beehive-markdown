A compensation deal has been reached between the government and New Zealand Cricket over the cancelled tour of New Zealand by the Zimbabwe cricket team.

The government has agreed to pay New Zealand Cricket $406,000.

The Zimbabwean team's planned tour here in December was called off after the government decided to withhold visas for players.

"We decided the tour was not appropriate given the Zimbabwean government's continuing human rights abuses. At the time over 200,000 people had been made homeless after the government there ordered the destruction of their homes," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

New Zealand Cricket subsequently approached this government over financial losses it suffered from the cancellation of the tour.

"The Labour-led government made an important stand over this tour in order to send a strong message to Robert Mugabe's government over its appalling human rights record and continuing abuse of democratic principles.

"We continue to abhor the regime's treatment of many of its citizens.

"However, it is only fair that we now compensate New Zealand Cricket for the losses it suffered."
