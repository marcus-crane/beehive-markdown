State-owned Enterprise Minister Trevor Mallard and Energy Minister David Parker today announced new appointments to the Electricity Commission and the board of state-owned Transpower New Zealand Ltd.

Stan Rodger CMG has been appointed by Mr Parker as a Commissioner of the Electricity Commission for a three year term.

“Stan Rodger will make a valuable contribution to the Electricity Commission. He has extensive public sector experience in board governance and operating at a strategic level. He also has a sound knowledge of the electricity sector through his membership of the Transpower board,” David Parker said.

Mr Rodger is a former senior cabinet minister, holding portfolios including SOEs, Labour, State Services, and Deputy Finance. He is also currently director of NZ Post and chair of the Health Workforce Advisory Group. Because of this appointment, he will be resigning as deputy chair of the Transpower board to avoid any conflict of interest.

“The commission has operated with five members - the minimum required under the Electricity Act - since May last year. I have made this further appointment now so that the commission can be increased in strength during this critical period when it is engaged in some significant work,” David Parker said.

“I am aware that some decisions that the Electricity Commission will make on transmission issues in the near future will relate directly to matters Stan Rodger has been advised on and decided on while on the Transpower board. For this reason, and to avoid any conflict, Stan Rodger will remove himself from decision-making on such matters until the information he has is out-of-date or overtaken by events or decisions.”

The Electricity Commission is a crown entity with responsibility for the governance and regulation of the electricity sector.

Trevor Mallard announced that Northland businessman and company director Wayne Brown has been appointed to the Transpower board to replace Mr Rodger. Mr Brown has a background in the engineering sector, and extensive governance experience. He is currently the chair of Transmission Holdings Ltd and the Auckland District Health Board.

"I'd like to thank Mr Rodger for his strong contribution to the Transpower board and note that Mr Brown is well placed to make an equally strong contribution to this state-owned enterprise, with his excellent technical skills and experience, aligned to electricity sector experience."

Both appointments take effect immediately.
