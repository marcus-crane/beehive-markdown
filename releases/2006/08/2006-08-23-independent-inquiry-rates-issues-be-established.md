The Government is to establish an independent inquiry into issues around local government rates funding, Local Government Minister Mark Burton announced today.

Mark Burton said the government will develop the inquiry's terms of reference in consultation with other parties. The terms of reference and other details of the inquiry will be released in due course.

"This is an important issue which is concerning central government, local government, and ratepayers. The Labour-led Government believes an independent inquiry is the best way to consider these issues.

"We have been working closely with New Zealand First because, like us, they are concerned to ensure that this issue is dealt with in an independent manner. I look forward to wide Parliamentary support for this inquiry process," Mark Burton said.

Mark Burton said the inquiry will be able to consider the work of the joint Central Government/Local Authority funding project, which will report to the Central Government/Local Government Forum in October.
