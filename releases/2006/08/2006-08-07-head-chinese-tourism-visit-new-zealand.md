One of the most important figures in Chinese tourism is visiting New Zealand this week.

Chairman Shao, head of the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) is in New Zealand at the invitation of the New Zealand government. He will be experiencing tourism activities in Queenstown, Arrowtown, and Auckland, where he will also meet tourism leaders.

“We are delighted to welcome Chairman Shao and his tourism officials to New Zealand,” Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said.

“The number of Chinese visitors coming to New Zealand has grown rapidly over the last few years, and this is likely to continue. We are very pleased to have the opportunity to show this important member of the Chinese government the very best of what New Zealand tourism has to offer.”

Chairman Shao will be in New Zealand for four days from tomorrow and is accompanied by a number of dignitaries, including chiefs of provincial tourism bureaus. In China, these bureaus have responsibilities in both inbound and outbound tourism, making this opportunity all the greater.

“We know that potential visitors from China do not have a good sense of the variety and authenticity of the tourism experience in New Zealand. Being able to showcase New Zealand to such influential people will pay dividends for our tourism industry,” Mr O'Connor said.

New Zealand has received 96,000 visitors from China in the last 12 months (up 15% on the previous 12 months) of which 50% have travelled here for holiday purposes.

Tourism New Zealand this year concludes a massive three-year training programme for Chinese travel agents. As a result, 64 travel agencies are now recognised under the Approved Destination Status agreement New Zealand has with the Chinese Government.
