Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed news that the United Nations Security Council had earlier today (NZT) unanimously passed a resolution calling for a full cessation of hostilities in southern Lebanon.

“Reaching agreement on this resolution has been a protracted and difficult process. The next steps towards achieving an immediate ceasefire and a lasting solution may be just as trying.”

"The onus now lies on the governments of Lebanon and Israel to accept the resolution as the basis for moving forward. They must work, in conjunction with the UN Secretary-General, to agree on the cessation of hostilities and the implementation of the steps identified in the resolution for the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the compliance of all parties with the ceasefire arrangements.

"The international community will need to play its part in supporting the implementation of the resolution. I call on all parties involved in this tragic conflict, as well as the wider international community, to use their influence to help bring peace and a lasting solution.

"New Zealand stands ready to consider what role we might play in an expanded UN presence in southern Lebanon, taking into account the other demands on our Defence Force," Helen Clark.
