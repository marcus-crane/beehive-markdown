The Government has continued funding for the eradication of the Southern Salt Marsh Mosquito (Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus), with Cabinet granting $11.132 million for the programme for the coming year, Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

Cabinet has also asked Biosecurity New Zealand, which took over the programme from the Ministry of Health on 1 July, to reassess the feasibility of eradication and report back on this and alternative pest management options by June next year.

Southern Salt Marsh Mosquito was first detected in Napier in 1998. It was eradicated from Napier and also from six other sites. The population at Wairau near Blenheim is, however, proving particularly tenacious. In addition, the national surveillance programme found a resurgence of a population in the southern Kaipara harbour in November last year, and again, in May this year. It was also detected at discrete sites on the Coromandel and experts consider these infestations are likely to be the result of internal spread, rather than new incursions from Australia.

“While it’s a pest we can do something about, it does come at a significant cost – the Government has already spent $48 million on this programme, and it still keeps spreading,” Jim Anderton says.

“Because this mosquito is a vector for Ross River Virus (RRV) and an aggressive daytime biter with significant nuisance value and consequent impacts on our way of life, we’re really keen to get rid of it, but at some point it’s going to become a cost-benefit exercise. Right now, there’s not enough information available to make final decisions. That’s what we’ve asked Biosecurity New Zealand to provide.”

There is no evidence that RRV has established in New Zealand, but it is endemic in Australia and could be introduced to New Zealand Southern Saltmarsh mosquitoes by returning travellers carrying the virus. It cannot be communicated person to person because it requires a bite from a mosquito carrying the virus to spread it.

RRV causes pain and tenderness in muscles and joints and flu-like symptoms, including a rash on the torso and limbs. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms.

The Southern Salt Marsh Mosquito lives in areas where salty water is available, such as coastal saltmarsh, saltwater lagoons, and reclaimed land near estuaries. It lays its eggs in soil or vegetation in these environments. The eggs hatch when they are submerged by floods or especially high tides. It does not breed in standing water.

The treatment agents, S-methoprene and Bacillus thurengiensis israeliensis (Bti), have been used already in the eradication programmes. S-methoprene is a sand-based insect growth regulator that stops mosquito pupae hatching into adults and has been used extensively overseas to control mosquitoes. S-methoprene breaks down quickly in the environment and is believed to be environmentally safe for use in New Zealand. Studies have shown there has been no impact on non-target species where it has been applied elsewhere in New Zealand.

Bti is an organic product based on naturally occurring bacteria and has undergone a full health impact assessment. The spray leaves no long-term residue and is not allergenic.
