A new super high-speed internet link between New Zealand universities and research organisations, was launched today in Auckland by Prime Minister, Helen Clark, Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey and Communications Minister, David Cunliffe.

Helen Clark said the $43 million [Advanced Network](http://www.reannz.co.nz/about/), which went live this evening, would significantly enhance the range and quality of research we are able to do in New Zealand.

"An investment in this kind of digital infrastructure is crucial to ensuring we can attract and retain the best scientists and researchers and continue to produce world-leading science," Helen Clark said.

"The Advanced Network gives Kiwi scientists access to new tools and techniques, and allows them to participate in real time collaboration with their colleagues around the world."

The $43 million investment from government will cover the costs of the Network during the establishment period of around four years. That investment will be matched by the members, which include tertiary institutes, CRIs and the National Library.

The network will comprise an optical fibre 'backbone' linking universities and research institutions in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin as well as connections to the Hawkes Bay, Nelson, and Rotorua.

Steve Maharey said the focus of the Advanced Network would be on increasing the capability of research institutions to access data in real-time and be more connected both nationally and globally.

"Initially, it will be used by the members. As capabilities develop, others will have the opportunity to come on board, for example schools, libraries and museums.

"Government departments, hospitals, private firms, and international networks will also have the opportunity to collaborate with members for education and research purposes."

David Cunliffe said the network was an important part of the government’s Digital Strategy, aimed at ensuring New Zealand is world leading in using information and technology to increase productivity and realise New Zealand’s economic, environmental, social, and cultural goals.

“The Advanced Network, with its super-high-speed links, helps transform the economy by lifting the capability of our researchers and enabling more innovations to emanate from New Zealand,” David Cunliffe said.

### Additional Information

- The Government has invested $43.42 million (GST exclusive) to support the establishment of Advanced Network – to be known the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network, or KAREN
- As well as allowing the rapid exchange of large amounts of data, the Advanced Network will allow high-quality real-time videoconferencing and video-streaming for the delivery of course material and lectures at a distance
- Researchers will also be able to share computing power and high-cost instruments via the network
- New Zealand scientists will be linked to international networks, for example engineers, geologists and geophysicists will be linked to the international Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ([NEESgrid](http://www.neesgrid.org/))
- The project is of particular significance for the growing number of New Zealand-based projects that are collaborating internationally. An example is the [Physiome Project](http://www.physiome.org/) led by Professor Peter Hunter of the Auckland University Bioengineering Institute. This project assembling digital models of every system and anatomical feature of the human body is a worldwide initiative involving a dozen research teams across the United States, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom
