The joint approach between beekeepers and Biosecurity New Zealand to dramatically reduce levels of varroa bee mite in Nelson would maximise the effectiveness of controls, Minister for Rural Affairs Damien O'Connor said.

"This is an excellent example of an industry group working proactively with a government agency to help resolve a problem, rather than sitting back and demanding solutions.

"The South Island Varroa Control Group presented a sound and logical argument to government, which is now to be incorporated into the Biosecurity New Zealand management plan.

"This outcome reinforces the reality that ongoing cooperation between industry and Biosecurity New Zealand is the best way to monitor, identify and deal with unwanted incursions. This must always be the approach."

Mr O'Connor said beekeepers had been through a very tough time, especially those whose commercial operation is their sole source of income.

"That they have been listened to and given a direct role in the management of the incursion must help reduce some of their understandable frustration.

"In the meetings I have had with the beekeepers I have appreciated their cooperative attitude and the positive way in which they have worked with Biosecurity New Zealand.

"I am sure that those beekeepers throughout the rest of the South Island will now feel a lot more secure given that their representatives have had direct input into management measures, which should more effectively slow the spread of this pest.

"There are far-reaching implications of greatly reduced bee numbers due to varroa, for a number of our primary products, with associated social costs. There is a now sound process in place to greatly lessen the immediate threat within the South Island.

"Such cooperation must always be the approach to protect the income of our rural primary industries and communities", Mr O'Connor said.

In yesterday's announcement the Government decided to allocate an additional $1.25 million to the management programme for varroa in the South Island to allow Biosecurity New Zealand to work closely with beekeepers on a programme to reduce varroa levels in Nelson.
