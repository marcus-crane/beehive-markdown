Classic Kiwi recipes like pikelets, meatloaf, coleslaw, fish pie, and apple crumble are all part of the Great Little Cookbook for Work and Income clients, launched in Nelson this morning.

Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope joined Work and Income and District Health Board staff, community groups, families, and the regional mayor for the launch at the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

Mr Benson-Pope said Work and Income frontline staff came up with the idea of the cookbook when they saw how much clients would benefit from a simple, practical guide to affordable cooking and good nutrition. While skills like gardening and cooking used to be passed on within families, times had changed.

"We can no longer take for granted that people know what ingredients are needed for a good, nutritious family meal, or that they know how to put these ingredients together," he said.

Each recipe in the Great Little Cookbook was developed by a dietician and tested by a Work and Income client and her children. The focus is on recipes that are simple, nutritious, and easy to prepare, and the cookbook also includes general advice about shopping, cooking, and nutrition.

The Great Little Cookbook is available free of charge through Nelson/Marlborough Work and Income and the local District Health Board.

Mr Benson-Pope said that other regions had already shown an interest as well.
