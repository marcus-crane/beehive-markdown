The rules governing staffing of schools have been changed to allow primary schools to employ an extra 455 teachers from next year, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

Steve Maharey says the changes, approved by Order in Council, will further reduce pupil teacher ratios in primary and special schools and help ease the workloads of teachers.

"Funding of $26 million is being provided for this initiative, which builds on the additional 3040 teacher positions the Labour-led government has created since 1999," Steve Maharey said.

"Many primary schools can expect to see noticeable staffing improvements as a result of these changes.

"The extra teachers are over and above what is needed for roll growth, and will ensure all schools can deliver a high quality education for their students."

The increases, which affect all primary and special schools, include:

- A reduction in student-teacher ratios for years 9 and 10 from 25:1 to 23.5:1
- A reduction in the maximum average class size from 26 to 25 for schools with rolls of less than 176
- An increase in management staffing for schools with rolls above 92 (schools with rolls below this have had increases in previous years)

"This investment stands in stark contrast to National's slash and burn approach, and is a reminder that only a Labour-led government can provide the investment needed to create a world-leading school system.

"Labour is committed to further reducing pupil teacher ratios, including employing around 1,300 extra primary teachers in Year 1 classes over the next three years, so that by 2008 there are no more than 15 students in a class.

Details of the government's school staffing improvements since 2001 are attached.
