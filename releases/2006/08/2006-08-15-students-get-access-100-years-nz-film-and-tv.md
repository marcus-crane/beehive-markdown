A new library of DVDs showcasing a century of New Zealand film and television will help secondary schools with teaching of the new school curriculum, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Launching the new ON DISK library in Wellington today, Steve Maharey said the resource would give students new insights into events that shaped New Zealand's culture and identity over the last century.

Developed by the Film Archive and Ministry of Education, the library will be available free to all secondary schools and includes 75 hours of excerpts from New Zealand films, documentaries, advertisements and current affairs programmes over the last 100 years.

"This resource draws from a huge range of iconic images and clips, that describe New Zealand's history, identity and unique place in the world," Steve Maharey said.

"It will help students to learn about defining moments in our history, including our involvement in two world wars, the Springbok tour, the nuclear free debate and much more.

"Through the clips that are available, students can look at issues and topics as broad as race relations, the language of advertising, and the representation of New Zealand identity through film and television.

"As well as learning about history and culture, it will help students to become more critical viewers of film and television by exploring the attitudes and events that shape how images are portrayed."

The resources can be used as part of teaching across a range of subjects, including English/Media Studies, History, Geography, Social Studies and Art/Art History.
