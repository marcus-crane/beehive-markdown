Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson has welcomed the release of the terms  
of reference to review of how the New Zealand Disability Strategy is being  
implemented and its impact on the lives of disabled people.

"In 2001, when Cabinet approved the [New Zealand Disability Strategy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F10400), it also asked for a review of progress to be conducted at five and ten years intervals. This April marked the [five year anniversary of the Strategy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25584) and I am pleased to announce that [terms of reference for the five year review](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/terms-reference.html) are now available."

The five year progress review will evaluate the effectiveness of the  
processes used to implement the Strategy, and their potential for creating positive change in the future for disabled people.

The reccomendations from the five year review will guide future implementation of the New Zealand Disability Strategy, including expanding implementation activity beyond government departments.

The outcomes of the review will also contribute towards developing an effective ten year evaluation of the New Zealand Disability Strategy implementation, due in 2011.

All government departments are required to develop annual NZ Disability  
Strategy implementation work plans that specify actions each department  
will take to implement the Strategy.

The Office for Disability Issues also works with territorial authorities  
and non-departmental public bodies to consider ways that they can implement  
the Strategy.

"Agencies have been encouraged to focus on activity that will make a real  
difference in the lives of disabled people, and I encourage them to  
continue with this work," says Ruth Dyson.

Results from the review are expected to be reported to the Minister by  
early 2007.

Issues website at: [www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/terms-reference.html](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/terms-reference.html)
