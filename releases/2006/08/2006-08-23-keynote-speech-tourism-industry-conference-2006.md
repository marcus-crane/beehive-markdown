Kia Ora and welcome to Wellington.

I would first like to acknowledge Rod McGeoch, Geoff Burns and Fiona Luhrs.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for inviting me to address the Tourism Industry Conference ahead of what will be a busy and rewarding day. Usually at these events we talk about celebrating and advancing the tourism industry.

I want to talk to you also about the tourism industry advancing New Zealand.

The tourism sector is a vibrant one, and a vital part of our great country. Everyone here should be proud of their involvement and contribution.

Tourism, alongside our primary production sectors, drives New Zealand’s economy. The sector has experienced very strong growth to take its place as New Zealand’s largest earner of foreign exchange.

While this is one measure of tourism’s relative importance to the economy, I would argue that we need to spend less time comparing ourselves with other sectors, and more time realising our sector’s real potential to contribute to New Zealand now and into the future.

This government has made economic transformation one of its key priorities for New Zealand. The economic transformation agenda recognises that industries in which we do well provide springboards for us to develop further.

Tourism is one of those industries. And we've come a long way.

This sector’s growth has been almost double that of the economy as a whole during the five years to 2004. It has grown by seven percent compared with the rest of the economy's four percent.

We have achieved greater international awareness of New Zealand as a destination through Tourism New Zealand’s award-winning 100% Pure New Zealand campaign.

We’ve come a long way in our product development. We pioneered jet boating and bungee jumping, and we’ve developed our lodge market to be the envy of those across the globe. Equally our wine and fine food tourism products have gained an international reputation.

We want people to come now, spend more and come back. And, of course, to tell all their friends what a wonderful time they've had in New Zealand. We're not asking too much.

In Australia, we’re taking that awareness of what New Zealand has to offer and going the next step – by showing Australians just how easy it is to visit now and experience what our distinctive regions have to offer.

We must continue to develop and improve what we have on offer to stay ahead of emerging regions such as South America and South East Asia, and all other traditional competitors in the international tourism market.

When you take a moment to think about it, what we're asking for is many of our potential visitors to make an irrational decision.

It's more expensive for people in many of our markets to holiday in New Zealand when they have a huge range of low-cost holiday options.

It takes longer to get here, when there is growing pressure for people to take shorter holidays. There is an ever-greater choice of destinations, while we are promoting ourselves as a must-do experience.

This means it is a challenge to get them to visit, and spells out the need for us to be the very best we can be in order to compete at every level of tourism.

We want people to make this irrational decision. But we do this with the full knowledge that the decision will deliver the experience of a lifetime. Therefore, we must know that what we have to offer is truly world-class.

Apart from our incomparable scenic beauty we need to have other unique attributes that set us apart.

One of these unique aspects is our Maori culture. I’d like to acknowledge the work my colleague Dover Samuels has done in this area, supporting the Maori regional tourism organisations.

I’d also like to acknowledge the important work that the New Zealand Maori Tourism Council has done to develop Maori tourism businesses and networks.

Their work has provided a strong foundation for many Maori businesses, which, though still young and relatively small, now have financial plans in place, and have access to appropriate tools and technology.

But just as importantly we all have a greater understanding of Maori culture itself and the additional value it can add to all our tourism products. No-one else in the world can deliver this!

Recent research, co-funded by the Tourism Industry Association, looked carefully at the business of tourism, how it is doing and what its drivers are, with a view to learning how we can do better in future.

Improving yield is one of the key opportunities in realising our future potential for tourism. While we have experienced good levels of growth, this seems stubbornly linked to growth in visitor numbers. In essence, we might have attracted more people, but we have not encouraged all of them to spend more.

The fact that we are at the stage where we are asking hard questions is a reflection of tourism becoming a mature industry, one that is prepared to take a good look at itself to lay the groundwork for that future.

The research has found that tourism operators often come into the industry for lifestyle reasons, but once in place they are intent on developing successful businesses.

This challenges previous thinking that tourism is made up of a large quantity of lifestyle businesses content to rest on their laurels.

Financial yields in many tourism businesses are, in fact, above average, although overall they are relatively modest.

We have also learned that tourism is a diverse and complicated industry. Sub-groups such as accommodation, transport and retail have different capital and labour requirements, business models and operator attitudes.

This new information and more will influence the New Zealand Tourism Strategy update. We are now better equipped to address issues like business capability, staff development and capital investment across the whole sector.

Over the past five or six years the New Zealand Tourism Strategy has been successful in laying strong foundations for our industry.

The strategy has helped bring the industry together, and moved it forward with a common purpose.

It did this by focussing on four key themes:  
·Securing and conserving a long term future,  
·Marketing and managing a world class visitor experience,  
·Working smarter, and,  
·Being financially and economically prosperous.

We’ve added to this a fifth theme: which is about enabling components of the sector, such as its people and investment.

These principles remain as valid now as they were then. They form the basis of work being undertaken by the Ministerial Advisory Group, which as many of you know, is working on the strategy update.

It's useful to take a moment to reflect on just how far we're come. Since 2001:  
·RTOs have developed best-practice processes, and now work together to learn from each other – including forming RTONZ,  
·We've expanded Qualmark to include new categories such as student accommodation, holiday homes, environmental accreditation and an exclusive accommodation category,  
·The Visitor Information Network has embraced technology,  
·Sustainable business practices have become a core policy for tourism businesses, through the sustainable tourism charters,  
·The Workforce and Skills Strategy report has spelt out the industry's needs going forward,  
·And a whole host of other progress has been made.

The challenge from this point and for you in our conference sessions is to drill down deeper so that we can develop business capability further, allowing the industry to attract more capital and labour, and to develop expertise.

We as a Government want small to medium sized businesses to go to the next level – to transform themselves into the powerhouses of the future.

To do this we need industry leadership and engagement at every stage of this update process.

The work we do today and over the coming months to update the strategy will help us identify and prepare for the opportunities and challenges that are before us.

If we are clear-sighted now, and if we pull together we will get to where we want to be.

The Government is here to help, but it is the operators involved in tourism who will ultimately be the driving force for the strategy. The industry-led nature of this update process recognises this.

Since the development of the strategy in 2000 and 2001 there have been many changes that have affected the tourism sector and the environment we operate in.

The introduction of low-cost airlines, rising fuel costs, regionalisation of travel through changes to distribution channels and increasing use of the Internet are prime examples.

But some of the challenges we face as a sector are not as a reaction to external changes. Rather they reflect the need for us, as an industry, to change.

Using the five themes as guiding principles, we have in my view, a number of priorities ahead of us. These include:  
·Bringing our conservation estate and the tourism sector closer together so that visitor numbers can grow in a sustainable way. This will require ongoing communication and education in both directions,  
·Ensuring our Maori experiences are authentic,  
·Developing public/private sector marketing initiatives,  
·Having marketing strategies for and effective links with all our markets, including emerging markets,  
·Facilitating regional, local and central government to work more closely on planning and marketing, which will save costs.  
·Encouraging businesses to become more profit-focussed rather than revenue-orientated.

It is also true that we are not using technology to its full potential. Both the availability of technology, and the skills to fully utilise it, are lacking in New Zealand in comparison to some of our international competitors.

We also face some very real issues regarding our labour force. As the tourism sector has grown, the ability to attract and, importantly to retain, high quality staff is something that must be addressed.

Labour productivity in tourism is not high. We need to ask whether we are using the labour and capital at our disposal in the best ways we can.

We are facing a period of slower growth and we need to approach the strategy in a way that considers this issue and answers the question of how we gain most value from the visitors we attract.

The only way that our updated strategy is going to be successful is if it strongly reflects input from all parts of the sector.

We need a strategy that does more than highlight the issues. We need a strategy that identifies the specific actions that are needed in each of the key areas. And we need commitment from you all to meet set targets as we move forward.

Although this conference is likely to represent the largest single meeting where the strategy will be debated in any formal sense, this is certainly not the only arena where discussion will take place.

Over the next two months, views and input will be actively sought from across the tourism sector.

The updated Tourism Strategy will provide the tourism industry with a robust platform from which we can move purposefully to a stronger future. The effectiveness of that springboard, however, will only be as strong as the input and commitment that goes into developing it.

I urge you to contribute to this process in any way you can, including here at this conference. The idea you contribute could be that missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle.

Remember, those who think they can and those who think they can't – they're both right. I think we can.

Thank you.
