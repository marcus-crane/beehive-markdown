Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the news that a United  
Nations General Assembly committee had reached agreement on the first ever  
UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.

"I am pleased that disabled people's rights are to be formally recognised  
by the UN," said Ruth Dyson.

"I congratulate the New Zealand delegation for their leadership in drafting this treaty and I especially thank the New Zealand ambassador and chairman of the committee Don MacKay, for his work in getting agreement on this important issue."

The draft of the convention is expected to be considered by the UN General  
Assembly later this year.

The convention is expected to apply to an estimated 650 million disabled  
people worldwide in countries which ratify it.
