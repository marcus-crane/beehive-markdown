Education Minister Steve Maharey has announced the appointment of a new chair and two new board members, and the reappointment of one board member, to the Careers Services board.

"The new board members bring a breadth of experience and knowledge that will ensure Career Services remains New Zealand’s leading provider of career information, advice and guidance," Steve Maharey said.

The appointments are:

**Kaye Turner** has been appointed Chair of the Board (commencing 1 September). Ms Turner is an educational contractor with extensive academic and management experience in tertiary education, and is Deputy Chair of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). Ms Turner replaces Trish McKelvey who has retired as Chair of the board after 10 years of involvement with Careers Services.

**Brent Kennerley** has been re-appointed as a member of the board and Deputy Chair of the board until July 2009. Mr Kennerley is a chartered accountant and a partner in the Wellington branch of the international firm, Grant Thornton. Mr Kennerley was first appointed to the board in 2003.

**Arthur Graves** and **Dr Majolein Lips-Wiersma** have been appointed to the board until July 2009. Mr Graves has been active in leadership roles throughout his education career, and has been the principal of Greymouth High School for the last eight years. Dr Lips-Wiersma is a senior lecturer at Canterbury University’s Department of Management, where her academic interests focus on career development and management, aligning personal and organisation values, and purpose beyond profit.

**Maria Humphries** and **Elizabeth Welch** have both retired from the board.
