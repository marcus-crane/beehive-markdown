Foreign Minister Winston Peters tonight expressed his thanks to everyone involved in securing the safe release of New Zealand hostage Olaf Wiig and his American colleague Steve Centanni in Gaza City.

"I am delighted and relieved for Olaf and Steve, and their families, that they have been released unharmed by their captors," Mr Peters said.

"All those involved in securing the release of the hostages deserve to be congratulated. I would like to acknowledge the great cooperation of the Palestinian authorities, led by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, and the wholehearted way in which they worked to secure the release of the hostages.

"I especially commend the work of Foreign Affairs officials Jan Henderson, Peter Rider, Brian Chambers and Kevin Kay who, along with Police Inspector Rob Abbott, worked many long hours on the ground in Gaza.

"It is always a moment of great satisfaction when a situation like this has a successful outcome," Mr Peters said.
