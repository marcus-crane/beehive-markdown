Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector and Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today paid tribute to the Maori Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

"Dame Te Atairangikaahu made a tremendous contribution to the community and voluntary sector through her work with the Maori Women's Welfare League and through many Maori community organisations.

"As a Maori woman leader she demonstrated how culture and tradition are strengths that provide a sense of identity and can support indigenous people to operate successfully in a modern world.

"Dame Te Ata maintained a close and long-standing relationship with the people of the Pacific, both in New Zealand and the Pacific. The people of Samoa hold her with great affection.

"Her support of traditional arts and crafts, including Pacific Island dance, has been central to the cultural renaissance in New Zealand today.

"As a calm and unifying leader, Dame Te Ata has worked with all to make this country a more inclusive and peaceful nation for all New Zealanders - she will be deeply missed," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.
