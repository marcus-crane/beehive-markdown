Fishing industry proposals to limit bottom trawling will have significant conservation benefits and so are being taken seriously, said Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton.

Mr Anderton was responding to claims from Greenpeace and the Environment and Conservation Organisations (ECO) that these proposals would do little to protect fish life.

“I understand the proposed areas generally have a low biodiversity of fish life; but I also understand they are pristine habitats, untouched by bottom trawling or dredging. The industry’s proposal is about protecting the sea floor and that which lives upon it. The proposal is not about protecting fish; we do this through the quota management system. Greenpeace and ECO are claiming the proposal fails to achieve something it was never designed to do,” he said.

The industry proposal would close some 1.2 million square kilometres – 30 percent of New Zealand’s EEZ - to bottom trawling and dredging. When added to New Zealand deepwater areas already closed, the proposed closures would mean that 42 percent of seamounts in New Zealand waters will be protected. This would be one of the largest marine protection measures ever proposed within a nation state’s EEZ.

The proposed closures would extend from the Subantarctic waters south of Campbell Island to our Subtropical Kermadec region. They lie across a range of depths, and cover a range of habitats that broadly represent New Zealand offshore waters.

The Ministry of Fisheries has sought submissions from interested people on the industry proposal and is currently analysing these submissions.

“I am looking forward to receiving the Ministry’s analysis so that I can determine whether the proposal should proceed or not. Before making my decision, I will consider the contents of all submissions,” Jim Anderton said.
