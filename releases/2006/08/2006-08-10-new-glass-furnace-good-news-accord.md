O-I NZ's investment of $78 million on an additional glass furnace in Auckland is good news for recyclers, local government, the packaging industry, and of course the environment, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"The new furnace will mean more glass recycling, more markets for recovered glass, and more glass manufacturing in Auckland," Mr Benson-Pope said. "It's a real vote of confidence in the future of recycling and in New Zealand manufacturing."

"Every year, O-I NZ's Auckland facility recycles around 71,000 tonnes of used glass into new bottles and jars. As a country, we already recycle half of all the glass packaging we use. The new furnace will help us meet the 55% recovery target for glass under the Packaging Accord 2004", Mr Benson-Pope said.

Signed in August 2004, the Packaging Accord has the commitment of the packaged goods industry, central government, local government and recyclers. It has a five-year duration and aims to minimise the environmental impacts of packaging. More than 200 organisations are signed up to the Accord, representing the majority of New Zealand's packaging production and supermarket business.
