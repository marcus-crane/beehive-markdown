Health Minister Pete Hodgson has congratulated the health sector and business and community leaders for their work to prepare for a flu pandemic after New Zealand's planning has been praised in the world-leading medical journal The Lancet.

The Lancet says New Zealand – along with Australia and Hong Kong – is to be applauded for taking a strategic approach to pandemic planning that included the development of detailed 'guidance manuals.' The journal's praise follows earlier commendation for New Zealand's planning from the World Health Organisation.

"The last couple of years has seen an historic effort to prepare New Zealand communities for a possible flu pandemic," Pete Hodgson said. "Through it all there has been a remarkable level of good will and cooperation across the whole of government, businesses, communities and the health sector.

"Everyone involved in planning for a pandemic has demonstrated a commitment to protecting the health of New Zealand families. They have my thanks for their work and my congratulations for the international praise it has received."
