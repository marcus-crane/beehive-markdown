Minister Responsible for the Law Commission Mark Burton welcomed the Law Commission report Access to Court Records, which was tabled in Parliament today.

"The Law Commission's report examines the complex issues relating to public access to court records and provides a comprehensive review of the rules governing access to court records across all jurisdictions," Mark Burton said.

"The accessibility of court information is an important element of the judicial system and I welcome the Law Commission’s contribution to this debate, and the suggestions contained in the report. The recommendations made in the report will require a considered response from the Government."

The Government's response to the report will be lead by the Minister for Courts and will be presented to Parliament by the end of the year.
