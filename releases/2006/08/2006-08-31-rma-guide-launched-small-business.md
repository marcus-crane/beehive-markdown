[![Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel and Environment Minister David Benson-Pope launch guide for small business and the public about dealing with the Resource Management Act ](/sites/default/files/styles/embed_medium/public/images/06-08%20RMA%20guide%20launch%20B-P%20and%20LD%20med.jpg?itok=mAy5Kytq)](/media/89)

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope has launched a four-part guide for small business and the general public about working with the [Resource Management Act (RMA).](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/index.php)

[An Everyday Guide to the RMA](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/everyday/) consists of a CD-Rom, website, 0800 phoneline, and brochures. Mr Benson-Pope said the resources provided a straightforward and thorough introduction to the RMA, why we have it, and how people can take part.

"There's a wealth of information, from background about the legislation to step-by-step timelines and guides to advice on how to make a submission or undertake consultation," he said.

"People sometimes see the RMA as something of a hurdle to overcome when they want to make changes to their home or business", Mr Benson-Pope said. "An Everyday Guide to the RMA will help to demystify the process and remove a few misconceptions."

"The RMA is about sustainable management of our growth, our economy, and our environment. These have a strong influence on our national identity, economic transformation, and families young and old. The more we can encourage and support people to take part in the RMA, the better for everyone."

The material will be available from local and regional councils, Biz Information Centres, public libraries, Citizens Advice Bureaux, Community Law Centres, Environment Centres, and the Ministry for the Environment. The free phoneline is 0800 RMA INFO (0800 762 4636), and the web address is [www.rma.govt.nz.](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/index.php)
