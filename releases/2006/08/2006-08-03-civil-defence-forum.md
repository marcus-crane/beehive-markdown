In a first for the sector, Rick Barker today hosted the heads of the country’s 16 Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Groups at a Forum at Parliament to update them on recent developments and discuss current issues.

"Civil Defence capability has improved markedly due to a strong philosophy of local decision making with national level support where it is needed, said Rick Barker

"Recent events in South Canterbury, Canterbury, Wairarapa, Wanganui, Taranaki Hawkes Bay and Gisborne, and the latest Indonesian Tsunami disaster have again focused attention on a need for investment and commitment by us all.

"We are continually striving to improve the delivery of the crucial services we provide in and for our communities.

"At the heart of this focus are four documents that describe and define our work. These are the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, the Strategy, the Plan, and the Guide to the Plan.

"These set out just what we are working towards, and the way we see ourselves getting there.

"This is the best way forward. It means we all have to take some responsibility for ourselves, for our families and for our communities.

"There are now unprecedented levels of public interest in, and scrutiny of, Civil Defence Emergency Management. None of us should see this as a threat. It is, in fact, a great opportunity.

"Every threatened or real emergency is an opportunity at the local and national level to get our messages across - awareness, understanding, commitment and, finally, preparedness.

"I want to leave you with the message that I will continue to drive the process of incremental improvement and look forward to your company on that journey," said Rick Barker.
