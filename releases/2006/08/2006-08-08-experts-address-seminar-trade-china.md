A seminar hosted by Trade Minister Phil Goff, entitled Doing Business with China, will offer a rare chance to hear two experts speak on engaging in business and trade with China.

The seminar will be held at the Fickling Centre, Mount Albert Road Three Kings on Friday 18 August from 1:30 to 3:00pm.

"This seminar is important to anyone wanting to get a better understanding of what is involved in accessing the world's fastest growing economy and leveraging the full economic potential of this very dynamic market", Mr Goff said.

"China is already the world's fourth largest economy and at its current growth rate of over ten percent per annum, is on track to becoming the world's largest economy.

"Two way trade with New Zealand is worth over $5 billion a year and is growing rapidly. China is New Zealand's fourth biggest export and import partner.

"Featured speakers are Dr David Walker, Lead Trade Negotiator in the China – New Zealand Free Trade Agreement negotiations and Pat English , former New Zealand Trade Commissioner in Beijing and Shanghai , now working in New Zealand as China Market Manager, with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

"David will speak on the complex nature of negotiating a free trade agreement with China and what is involved and Pat will discuss practical aspects of doing business in China.

"Attendees at the seminar will also have the chance to ask questions following the presentations.

"Anyone interested in attending, should register with my office on 04-470-6553 or email [inez.mccaughan@parliament.govt.nz](mailto:inez.mccaughan@parliament.govt.nz)" said Mr Goff.
