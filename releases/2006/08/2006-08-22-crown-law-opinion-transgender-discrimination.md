Attorney-General Michael Cullen today released a Crown Law opinion which clarifies the position of transgender people under the Human Rights Act.

The opinion was sought as the issue has been raised in a private member's bill in the name of Labour MP Georgina Beyer.

"I note that Crown Law states that "there is currently no reason to suppose that "sex discrimination" would be construed narrowly to deprive transgender people of protection under the [Human Rights Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=634551100&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B5B72868A%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC)."

"I welcome the acting Solicitor-General's clarification that due to existing protection the Human Rights Act does not need to be amended," said Dr Cullen.
