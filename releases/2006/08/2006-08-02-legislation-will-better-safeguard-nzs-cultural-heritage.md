New Zealand’s unique and significant cultural heritage will be better protected under new legislation passed by Parliament today says the Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

The Protected Objects Act replaces the 31year-old Antiquities Act and takes effect from 1 November.

"The legislation seeks to preserve the delicate balance between the national interest and private property rights established under the Antiquities Act 1975,” says Judith Tizard.

"Under the new law illegally exported New Zealand objects are now more likely to be returned home. New Zealand can now become party to the1970 UNESCO and 1995 UNIDROIT Conventions which deal with the illegal trade in cultural treasures.

“Signing up to these conventions will increase the chance that recent situations such as the one involving the Motunui Pataki panels (the “Ortiz” case) can be resolved with the return of the objects,” the Minister said.

“It will also allow New Zealand to be a ‘good international citizen’, by allowing other countries similar redress, should items of cultural significance to other parties to the conventions be imported or attempted to be imported illegally into NZ.”

The Protected Objects Act will also simplify the process of awarding ownership – not just custody – of newly-found taonga tûturu (formerly called artefacts). Penalties for breaching the act will be more realistic and in line with similar legislation.

“It will be easier for collectors, traders, and members of the public to identify objects covered by the Act.”

The Culture and Heritage Ministry will be undertaking a comprehensive information campaign to raise awareness of changes and their practical impact.
