The creation of nineteen additional positions within key Courts was announced today by Courts Minister Rick Barker.

The positions will be spread across the Auckland District Court (10), Manukau District Court (3) and Christchurch District Court (6).

"This Government is committed to the continuous improvement of Court services so our Courts can cope with current and future demands, and this increase in staffing for three of our busiest Courts demonstrates this commitment," said Rick Barker.

"Gross underinvestment into the justice sector through the 1990's led to a necessary review of baseline funding. The baseline review found that resources in the District Courts did not match current or forecast work volume and recommended additional staffing.

"As a result this Government injected a massive $156 million into Votes Courts and Justice in 2004, and commenced a broad three year programme of review and service improvement.

"Today's announcement on nineteen additional staff is a direct outcome of our investment and is an important step towards our vision of delivering first class justice services", said Mr Barker.

Further additional positions are expected next year.
