Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today that a contract has been signed for the creation of a master plan for the redevelopment of the Royal New Zealand Air Force base at Ohakea.

"The Chief of the Defence Force and representatives of engineering consultancy Beca Carter Hollings and Ferner Limited signed a contract to become principal consultants for the redevelopment of Ohakea", Mr Goff said.

"The principal consultants will create a master plan for the re-development of Ohakea. This will provide a detailed overview of all work required for the successful relocation of Air Force operations from Whenuapai to Ohakea.

"This is a major project under the auspices of the government's Long Term Development Plan for defence and will deliver significant operational efficiencies through consolidation of operations currently undertaken at Whenuapai and Ohakea.

"Some units from Hobsonville and Whenuapai have already re-located to Ohakea. This has been accomplished without significant need for development work, but we are now at the stage where expert assistance is needed with the complex process involved in assessing and scoping the details of the work that will be needed.

"The master plan will enable the preparation of detailed cost estimates which can be presented to cabinet as a request for funding. This paper is not expected to be ready until 2007.

"The scope of the relocation includes the construction or alteration of 68 functional areas which are currently classed as 26 separate construction projects. All design and construction packages will be competitively tendered", said Mr Goff.
