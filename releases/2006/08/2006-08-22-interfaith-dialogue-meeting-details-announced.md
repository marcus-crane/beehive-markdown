Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the 2007 Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith Dialogue meeting, which New Zealand is to host, will be held at Waitangi from 29-31 May next year.

"I was honoured to attend this year's regional Dialogue in Cebu, the Philippines, in March. At that meeting I offered New Zealand as the host for the 2007 meeting.

“The Cebu meeting was the second meeting of the regional inter-faith dialogue. The aim is through such dialogue to promote peace and security in our region. The meeting New Zealand will host at Waitangi next year be the third in this series.

"I am proud of New Zealand's role as a co-sponsor of the Asia-Pacific Dialogue. These regional meetings bring together faith and community leaders from fifteen countries from Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

"Through the Dialogue, all participants are working to find better ways of engaging and communicating to build greater understanding and mutual respect amongst our region’s different religious faiths and communities.

"The New Zealand Government and New Zealand participants in the dialogue process look forward to welcoming delegates from around the Asia-Pacific region to Waitangi," Helen Clark said.
