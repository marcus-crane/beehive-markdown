A large grouping of Te Arawa iwi and hapu finalised a Deed of Settlement covering all their historical claims under the Treaty of Waitangi in an initialling ceremony held at Parliament today.

The iwi and hapu, whose membership is approximately 24,000, are represented by Nga Kaihautu o Te Arawa Executive Council. The finalised Deed of Settlement follows the signing of an Agreement in Principle on 5 September 2005. Since then, the parties have been working intensively to incorporate the settlement package into a comprehensive and legally binding Deed. The settlement includes:

- acknowledgements of, and a Crown apology for, historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles;
- a cultural redress package including the transfer of a number of sites of cultural significance to Te Arawa; and
- financial redress totalling $36 million, which Te Arawa will receive in Crown forest licensed land (together with accumulated rentals).

"I wish to congratulate Te Arawa in reaching this historic milestone and I acknowledge the hard work and rapid progress made by both parties in order to reach this point,” Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Mark Burton said.

“This settlement with Te Arawa will settle over 70 claims, the largest number of claims and the largest number of people since the Ngai Tahu settlement in 1998. This will also be the first major settlement in the central North Island.”

The Deed, along with a governance entity to receive the settlement assets, is now subject to ratification by the iwi and hapu. If the Deed is ratified, it will be signed by both parties, and become final at the passage of legislation.

The Te Arawa lakes settlement, which was signed in 2004, related to the 14 Te Arawa lakes and any remaining annuity issues. This settlement addresses all the remaining historical claims of the iwi and hapu represented by Nga Kaihautu.

"Over the past three years we have seen six deeds of settlement reached, while we are currently in negotiations with over 20 groups covering several hundred claims," Mark Burton said.
