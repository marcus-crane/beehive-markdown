A new electronic enrolment system will make it easier for schools and the Ministry of Education to keep track of students and ensure they don't fall through the cracks when they leave a school, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The web-based ENROL system goes live in 124 Auckland schools from next week, and a further 339 secondary and intermediate schools nationwide over the next month.

Steve Maharey says the new system will improve the information that goes with students from school to school, and help to ensure every student stays in the school system until they are sixteen.

"The new system will quickly alert us to students who are not enrolled, so we can get them back to school as soon as possible," Steve Maharey said.

"Where a student doesn't re-enrol after 20 days, a notification will be sent to the Non-Enrolment Truancy Service for follow-up.

"As many as 4000 students a year leave one school and fail to enrol in the next. The current paper-based system is too slow to identify these students and imposes a high administrative burden on schools.

"For the first time we will be able to accurately measure issues like student transience and ensure students and schools get extra support where it's needed."

Steve Maharey says ENROL will reduce the time schools spend on data entry and chasing up enrolment information.

"A student's data only has to be entered into the system once, and can then be updated throughout their schooling.

"ENROL will also reduce the high number of inaccurate notifications that result from the current paper-based system. In 2005 there were around 8,000 non-enrolments notified to the Ministry of Education and in nearly half of these cases the students were already enrolled in another school or had legally left school.

"The system will be strengthened from next year with the introduction of a National Student Number, when it is rolled out in primary schools."

ENROL has been piloted in a number of schools over the last 10 months. Funding of $4.8 million was provided through Budget 2005 for the implementation of the ENROL system. The system will be in all schools by the end of 2007.

**Background Information on EROL**

**ENROL**  
ENROL is a central electronic student enrolment register for all school students, that will be updated and used by schools when students enrol, change schools or leave the school system.

ENROL replaces the current process of updating the Register of Admissions and Withdrawals and the student’s Enrolment Record, and manually requesting and posting the enrolment card when students change schools.

The collection of this enrolment information is authorised by section 77A of the Education Act 1989.

**Why it has been introduced**  
ENROL provides schools with a quick and easy system for enrolling and moving children between schools. It will also enable quick identification of a child who leaves one school but does not enrol in another. This will help to minimise the time these children spend out of school.

**Access to ENROL**  
Intermediate, secondary and restricted composite schools will use ENROL following implementation in Term 3 2006. It will then be rolled out to groups of schools on a regional basis. ENROL will be used by all schools by the end of 2007.

The initial rollout in Auckland will provide the opportunity for the Ministry of Education to monitor the system and identify and fix any bugs or system problems before the nationwide rollout.

**All records updated and kept online**  
All records are kept online and accessed online. Schools will no longer need to maintain enrolment forms or sending copies of enrolment records between schools.

**National Student Number**  
From next year the project will be rolled out in primary schools, where new entrants will be assigned a National Student Number. This is provided for under the Education Amendment Act 2006.

**Teaching and Learning Notes move with a child**  
Schools will benefit from new features, such as Teaching and Learning Notes. The last school attended can advise the next school of issues that may potentially impact on a student’s placement and pastoral care. The Teaching and Learning Notes can relate to academic, behavioural, personal, attendance, health or custodial issues. Teaching and Learning Notes are a valuable tool for helping at-risk students.

**Automatic notification if students are not enrolled within 20 days**  
ENROL automatically identifies students who have not enrolled in another school within 20 days of leaving their previous school. ENROL’s automatic monitoring will send an email prompt to the previous school to complete the non-enrolment notification form within the system, and then email it to the Ministry of Education. This initiates a tracing process for non-enrolled students. A notification will be sent to the Non-Enrolment Truancy Service for follow-up.
