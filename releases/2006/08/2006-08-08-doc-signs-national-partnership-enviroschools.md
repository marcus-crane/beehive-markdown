Conservation Minister Chris Carter today announced a national partnership between the Department of Conservation and the Enviroschools Foundation aimed at enhancing conservation awareness among school students.

"Conservation is all about preserving what we have today for those who will come in the future, so it is critical the next generation understand what we are doing and carry the philosophy forwards," Mr Carter said.

"The Enviroschools programme seeks to help young people understand the environment, how we affect it, and how changes in it affect us. Through the programme students work alongside each other, and develop a sense of ownership and care for the environment, starting with their school grounds.

"The programme is now utilised by about 370 schools, or 15 percent of schools around the country, and growing. A national partnership with it presents a unique opportunity for DOC to help integrate conservation into school sustainability programmes," Mr Carter said.

"To cement the partnership, DOC is to make a $50,000 grant to the Foundation to develop conservation education resources, and help DOC and Enviroschools plan how they will work together."

Houghton Valley School is one of 43 enviroschools in the Wellington region. Students from the school have constructed a coastal rainforest in their school grounds. They have been cleaning up rubbish on nearby beaches, as well as recycling paper.

Other projects typically undertaken by enviroschools include organic food gardens, waste reduction schemes, establishing walking school buses, and working with communities to look after local wetlands and streams.
