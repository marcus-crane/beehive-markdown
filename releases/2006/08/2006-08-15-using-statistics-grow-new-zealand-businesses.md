Using statistics to grow New Zealand businesses

The Statistics Minister Clayton Cosgrove has today launched a new pilot programme to help small-to-medium sized enterprises use statistics to grow their business.

The "Go Stats!" pilot programme was officially launched at a function co-hosted by the Gisborne Chamber of Commerce, in Gisborne at 6pm. The event was attended by local business owners, as well as specialist Statistics New Zealand staff.

Mr Cosgrove said small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) - which are defined as having less than 20 employees - are fundamental to the New Zealand economy.

"SMEs accounted for an increase of nearly 84,000 jobs nationwide over the last five years, representing nearly 33 percent of increased employment over that period. Nationally these businesses account for one in every three jobs and employ more than half a million New Zealanders. They provide a huge contribution to New Zealand's economic transformation," Mr Cosgrove said.

However Mr Cosgrove said he believed SMEs held even more growth potential, and statistics were an important tool in achieving that.

"As a former small-business owner myself, I know the realities of the competitive business world. Good businesses are not built on guesswork or hope. One of the first rules of business is to know your market," he said. "Statistical information collected by government can be tailored to help businesses determine their market share, identify export markets or potential local customers, monitor trends and better target products."

Mr Cosgrove said much of the information collected and analysed by Statistics New Zealand was available free of charge, or for minimal cost.

The Minister will continue the pilot programme with presentations to the Dunedin business community on 16 August and in Christchurch on 18 and 25 August 2006.

This free event also includes local business people talking about how they used statistics to get their businesses started and increase their market share, as well as a video presentation.  
Electronic tutorials will also be available for participants to take away either as a CD-ROM or via the Internet at www.stats.govt.nz, along with an information booklet.

Mr Cosgrove said that if the pilot proves popular, he would look at rolling it out nation-wide.
