Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced details for the swearing-in ceremony for the new Governor-General, Judge Anand Satyanand, on Wednesday 23 August.

Judge Satyanand and Mrs Satyanand will arrive at Parliament from Government House at 11.45am.

A small group from the Indian community will meet Judge and Mrs Satyanand inside the gates of Parliament and conduct a brief ceremony before the Maori welcome to Parliament.

Following the Indian and Maori welcomes, Judge and Mrs Satyanand and the official party would proceed to the dais on the steps of Parliament for the swearing-in.

After the swearing-in and the Proclamation is read, the Governor-General will take the Royal Salute and inspect the guard. The Prime Minister and the Governor-General will then deliver speeches.

There will be a Naval led Tri-service Royal Guard of Honour comprising 100 men and women drawn from the three services and their respective Queen’s Colours and escorts, and the Band of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Royal New Zealand Air Force Trumpeters will also be in attendance. The 16 Field Regiment from Linton will fire a 21-gun salute. The choir will be the Wellington College Chorale.

The official party then enter Parliament Buildings by the main steps and proceed to the Grand Hall before entering the Beehive banquet hall for a reception.

In the event of wet weather, the official ceremony will take place in the Legislative Council Chamber in Parliament.
