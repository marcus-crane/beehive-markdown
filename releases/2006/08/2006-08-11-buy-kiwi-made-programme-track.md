The new Buy Kiwi-Made programme will work alongside and support the present Buy New Zealand Made Campaign and will not be changing the rules about which products can be labelled Made in New Zealand, Government Spokesperson on Buy Kiwi-Made Sue Bradford says.

“Some confusion seems to have arisen about what role the Buy Kiwi-Made Campaign will have in relation to labelling,” Ms Bradford says.

“I want to reassure New Zealanders that everything is on track in line with the original Green Party/Labour agreement signed after the election.

“New Zealand manufacturers and workers can be assured that only products actually made in New Zealand will be entitled to carry the New Zealand Made labelling, as specified by legislation.”

“Policy work is still being done on our Buy Kiwi-Made programme, which will incorporate a number of elements, however we will not be creating a new branding exercise.

“This is just one key aspect of the programme. Much work is still to be done. The policy work as a whole has yet to be completed and I look forward to soon being able to make other announcements about how the fuller programme will be able to contribute to the sustainable development of New Zealand’s economy,” Ms Bradford says.
