Trade Minister Phil Goff yesterday joined with two New Zealand companies to launch new export products into the Malaysian market.

In Malaysia for trade talks with [ASEAN](http://www.aseansec.org/) and East Asia Summit countries, Mr Goff praised crown research institute, [ERS](http://www.esr.cri.nz/news/ESRMalaysiaCEPIcollaboration.htm), and private company, Living Nature, for breaking into new markets in Malaysia's growing economy.

ESR yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Malaysian Centre for Environmental Protection and Information.

"ESR has entered into agreement with the Malaysian Centre to provide expert scientific advisory services in the areas of environmental protection and management," Mr Goff said.

"It is recognised by Malaysia's largest state, Selangor, for its world class services in this area.

"The contract may be worth up to several million dollars and ESR will add to income now being earned annually by New Zealand of around $1.8 billion from the export of environmental products and services.

"ESR has already won contracts in Malaysia for setting up Malaysia's first DNA database with the Malaysian Police Force."

Mr Goff also spoke at the launch of New Zealand company [Living Nature's](http://www.livingnature.com/index.cfm) new range of skin-care products made from New Zealand native plants like flax and manuka.

"This company, supported by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, already has a turnover of around $20 million.

"Working in 12 key Asian markets, it has the potential to make New Zealand an international name in natural skin-care products.

"The main distributing company in Malaysia, Blue Oasis, is led by two Kiwi-educated Malaysian graduates who have a huge enthusiasm for New Zealand.

"It is a further example of how international education in New Zealand can have positive spin-offs for our country in other areas of business."

Mr Goff also visited a farm importing and breeding Jersey cattle from New Zealand.

"The farm models the use of New Zealand agricultural products and technology.

"Agricare, a consortium of New Zealand companies, is working to become a major supplier of dairy equipment, technology, livestock, training and services in the Malaysian market," Mr Goff said.

"In each of the enterprises I visited New Zealand companies were able to reap the benefit of our reputation as a clean, green, environmentally conscious country with a track record of providing quality goods and services," Mr Goff said.
