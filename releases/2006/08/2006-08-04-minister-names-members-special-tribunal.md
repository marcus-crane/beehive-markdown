A tribunal to consider an application from Fish and Game to amend the [Buller River Water Conservation Order](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/freshwater/water-conservation/) has been established, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“The tribunal will consider Fish and Game’s proposal that the Buller Water Conservation Order be changed to recognise the outstanding nature of the Gowan River trout fishery and its contribution to trout fisheries in Lake Rotoroa and the Buller River,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“Members Jim Lynch, Glenice Paine and Dr Gerry Closs each bring expertise and a range of skills in Resource Management Act hearing procedures to this inquiry, and I wish them well in this work.”

Jim Lynch, an experienced resource management and local government barrister and hearings commissioner, will chair the tribunal.

Glenice Paine is a resource management officer for Te Atiawa. She brings an understanding of cultural issues as they relate to the use of water.

Dr Gerry Closs is a freshwater ecologist from the University of Otago.

Once the special tribunal has met, the public will be invited to make submissions on the application. The special tribunal will then hold a hearing and report back to the Minister with recommendations about whether the Buller Water Conservation Order should be amended or not.

The findings of the special tribunal can be appealed to the Environment Court.

Note: The appointments to the special tribunal are made under section 202 of the [Resource Management Act 1991](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/rma/)
