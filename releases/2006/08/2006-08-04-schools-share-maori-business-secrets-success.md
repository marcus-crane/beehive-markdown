What do a medal-winning winery, a Montana Book Award-winning publisher and a clothing label worn by Kiwi golf star Michael Campbell have in common?

They're among top Maori businesses to recently share the secrets of their success as part of a project aimed at introducing more young Waikato people to the business world.

Last night in Hamilton, budding young business people from Melville High School, Hillcrest High School, Fraser High School, Fairfield College, Te Kura o Te Kaokaoroa o Paatetere and Cambridge High School presented the findings of their projects, which examined the workings of six successful Maori businesses, at the inaugural Rangatahi Business Competition.

The businesses to open their doors to the students included, Tohu Wines, Huia Publishing, and Kia Kaha Clothing, Law firm Rainey Collins, online media company SOL Media, and restaurant Kai in the City.

"The quality of the work put into this project by the various schools and the support from all the businesses involved was fantastic," said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, one of the judges for the competition. "While all the projects are worthy of congratulations, it was Hillcrest High School that won the competition and took away the top prize with their efforts."

Students from the school received $2,500 prize money for their work, which involved pairing up with Tohu Wines.

"The common thread among all the businesses studied was that they each positively reflected culture in their operations, which was a key driver of success – particularly for those operating in international markets," Nanaia Mahuta said.

Organised by Hamilton City Council, the competition is one of 12 projects nationwide being supported by the Ministry of Youth Development through the Youth Development Partnership Fund. The fund involves local councils partnering with the Ministry to support worthy projects which local encourage young people to get involved in their communities and learn valuable skills.

"It's fantastic to see these projects making a difference for young people across the country. The various Youth Development Partnership Fund projects offer a huge range of opportunities, though activities which support youth enterprise, research, team challenges, participation and resource development."
