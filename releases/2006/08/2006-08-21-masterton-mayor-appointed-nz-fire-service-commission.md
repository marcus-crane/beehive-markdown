Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today announced the appointment of Masterton Mayor Bob Francis to the New Zealand Fire Service Commission.

Rick Barker said Bob Francis would bring valuable business expertise, management skills and a local government perspective to the Commission.

“As a former Director and Deputy Chairman of Skill New Zealand and Executive Officer of the Masterton Business Enterprise, Bob Francis has experience and grass roots understanding of the value to local communities of vital support services such as the New Zealand Fire Service,” said Rick Barker.

“Bob Francis has huge expertise in local government matters. He was first elected in 1986 and is now in his seventh term of office.

“His appointment complements the Commission’s existing skills and experience in science and technology, financial and public service management,” said Rick Barker.

Bob Francis joins Dame Margaret Bazely, John Hercus, Angela Foulkes and Terrence Scott on the Commission, a Crown entity that oversees the New Zealand Fire Service, with an annual budget of over $250 million.

The Commission is responsible to the Minister of Internal Affairs for the efficient administration of the Fire Service Act 1975. It is also the National Rural Fire Authority for the purpose of the Forest and Rural Fires Act 1977.
