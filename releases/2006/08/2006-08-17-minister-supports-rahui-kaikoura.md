Minister of Fisheries Jim Anderton has agreed to renew the temporary closure of the Whakatu Quay area at Kaikoura to fishing for a further two-year period. This provides statutory support for a local traditional rähui over the area.

“The Whakatu Quay area is an important resource to the people of Te Runanga o Kaikoura,” Jim Anderton says. “They asked me to renew the temporary closure for a further two years, as they believe the resources within the area have not recovered from past fishing pressure.”

The area’s first closure to fishing ran from 12 September 2002 to 15 August 2004. This closure was later renewed through until 17 August 2006. This third renewal will expire 17 August 2008.

The closure is strongly supported by local iwi and the wider community, and is unlikely to significantly affect the rights of customary, recreational or commercial fishers in the area.

The long-term vision of Te Runanga o Kaikoura, in conjunction with the Kaikoura Coastal Marine Protection Society, is to have a management system in place to ensure protection of the Kaikoura coastal marine environment.

“We appreciate the support from the Minister of Fisheries and all other stakeholder groups involved in the renewal of the closure,” says Runanga spokesperson Thomas Kahu.

“The monitoring and management of this site over the last two years has generated tremendous community support, and is testament to what can be achieved when communities work together. The site has responded positively to the closure and re- seeding efforts that have been undertaken within the site, and we are confident that the next two years will provide further positive results.”
