New Zealand has a world-leading, easy to access, no-fault accident compensation scheme – which the National Party wants to try to destroy.

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson says that through the public ACC scheme under this government, New Zealanders who suffer injuries receive more comprehensive care than in any other part of the world. This care is provided at a lower cost than in any other comparable accident compensation scheme.

"National's proposal to privatise ACC is ideology triumphing over common sense. The government's decision to bring the ACC workplace account back under ACC has protected New Zealanders from escalating insurance costs and insolvent insurers."

"A joint Australian-New Zealand report on workers’ compensation comparisons shows that while eight years ago ACC and Australian levies were similar, New Zealand’s rates have been steadily decreasing and are now on average just over a third of Australia’s. This gives New Zealand a clear competitive advantage in most industries."

"Since this government returned ACC to being a fully public scheme, the average self-employed levy has come down by 6 percent, the earners’ rate has reduced by 7 percent, and the average employers’ levy has dropped by a massive 43 percent. This is the sort of result you can expect when you don’t have privatisation of ACC on your mind."

The National Party tried to privatise ACC in the 1990s and failed.

This is just a taste of what National is planning for New Zealanders – a return to the failed policies of the past.
