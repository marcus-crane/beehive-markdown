Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today he was deeply shocked at the death in custody of a young prisoner in Auckland.

The 17-year-old was allegedly assaulted last night while being transported to Auckland Central Remand Prison, and was taken to hospital, where he later died.

Mr O'Connor said the incident raised serious questions about the level of appropriate protection offered to this young man, which if inadequate is totally unacceptable. He could not comment further as a Police homicide investigation was now underway.

"I would like to offer my deepest sympathies to the family of the young man following this tragic incident," Mr O'Connor said.
