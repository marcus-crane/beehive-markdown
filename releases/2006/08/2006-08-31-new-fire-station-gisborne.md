Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker offically launched the new Gisborne fire station today.

"The new station is a big improvement. It’s modern, has much greater capacity, and is directly suited to Gisborne's operational needs," said Rick Barker.

"The station will be a training facility for brigades throughout the whole East Coast region. Together with the new National Training Centre in Rotorua, it means that the training needs of local brigades will be very well served.

"It is my pleasure to declare Gisborne’s new fire station open," said Rick Barker.
