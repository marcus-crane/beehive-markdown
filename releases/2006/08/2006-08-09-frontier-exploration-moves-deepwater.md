Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven today announced the award of a large petroleum exploration permit in the Outer Taranaki Basin, the first ever in the area.

The 55,800km2 permit awarded to Global Resources covers most of the Outer Taranaki Basin, which has previously seen very little exploration.

“With recent attention having been focused on the Great South Basin, it is exciting to see that other frontier areas of New Zealand are also seen as having potential,” Harry Duynhoven said.

Global Resources is a Colorado-based company and a new entrant to exploration in New Zealand, having previously promoted and developed deepwater exploration blocks in Africa.

The proposed exploration programme will see Global Resources acquire 3,100km of new 2D seismic data along with associated geo-technical studies, and commence drilling of an exploration well within 42 months. The results of the programme are expected to provide a better understanding of the basin.

“The exploration programme is particularly exciting because if the initial stages of exploration meet expectations, there is a real prospect of the Outer Taranaki Basin having its first well drilled,” Harry Duynhoven said.

“Much of the ongoing interest in petroleum exploration in New Zealand is due to increasing awareness of the potential here, particularly as a result of the data acquisition programme that the Government established in 2004.

“While it is too early to speculate on what this or any other frontier basin might produce, the programme of acquiring and promoting information about our petroleum basins is continuing to deliver international interest in exploring New Zealand,” Harry Duynhoven said.

### Background Information on the Outer Taranaki Basin

- The Outer (or Deepwater) Taranaki Basin is defined as the extension of the Taranaki Basin from the shelf edge into the head of the New Caledonia Basin.
- The Basin covers an area of approximately 60,000 sq km to the 2000m isobath within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone.
- Interpretation of recent seismic data has shown that there are exciting plays and structures in this unexplored region. In 2001, 6200 km of new 2D seismic data was acquired in the Basin. The survey was tied to eight wells on the shelf and the deepwater Wakanui-1 well in the adjacent Northland Basin. The survey indicated more than 10,000 m of sedimentary section in the deeper water off the shelf and revealed a new play unknown from the Taranaki Basin.
- The basin has a number of similarities to Gippsland Basin off southeast Australia (one of Australia’s major petroleum producing basins) and to the Great South Basin (which was probably contiguous with the Taranaki Basin when the basin was being formed).
