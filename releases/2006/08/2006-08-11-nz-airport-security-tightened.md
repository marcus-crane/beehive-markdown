Prime Minister Helen Clark today said security procedures at New Zealand airports had been tightened in the wake of the terror plot [exposed in Britain](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/threat-level-update).

"Security at airports around the world has been increased as a result of the [arrests](http://www.police.uk/content/viewarticle.asp?xslfile=~xsl~transform_article.xsl&xmlfile=~_content~xml~news~MPS_AntiTerrorOp_dh2.xml&refererURI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.met.police.uk%2F&refererDomain=www.met.police.uk) of the 24 people in London, High Wycombe, and Birmingham on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

"This is a serious situation and could have led to high loss of innocent lives. Government officials here have been working together since this emerged yesterday afternoon to determine the implications for New Zealand. The system for [Domestic and External Security](http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/dess/index.htm) has been activated; chief executives met early this morning, and other work is underway.

"Our civil aviation authorities have received notice from the [US Department of Homeland Security](http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/) advising them of an emergency amendment to normal security procedures for flights into and out of the USA.

"As a result of the new requirements, security procedures in New Zealand airports are being raised. Passengers on flights to the United States will be subject to new inspections and procedures from this afternoon in respect of carry-on luggage, particularly liquids and gels, to meet the US requirements," Helen Clark said.

"Our High Commission in London is providing advice to New Zealanders caught up in the disruption, and [travel advisories](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/index.php) and other information for intending travellers has been placed on the MFAT website.

"The British Home Secretary has announced that as a precautionary measure, the threat level in the UK has been raised from severe to critical – the highest category (terrorist attack expected imminently). These measures are to stay in place as long as the situation warrants it." Helen Clark said.
