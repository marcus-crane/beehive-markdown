Building Issues Minister Clayton Cosgrove has set out an accelerated timeframe for the passage of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Amendment Bill in his First Reading speech in Parliament today.

In his speech Mr Cosgrove requested that the Social Services Select Committee report back to the House by 4 December 2006, to give time for the legislation to be passed this year.

Mr Cosgrove said the Bill proposes a major shake-up of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service (WHRS) and the sooner it is passed, the sooner that owners of leaky homes can get compensation from the liable parties, get their homes fixed and get on with their lives.

The key changes in the Bill are:

- A new streamlined process involving pre-hearing conferencing and time-limited mediation before claims automatically move to adjudication
- Beefed up assessment reports for all WHRS claimants so people can claim for potential as well as actual weathertightness-related damage
- The establishment of a new Weathertight Homes Tribunal to provide independent adjudication services
- A new streamlined process for lower-value claims
- Changing the voting thresholds to make it easier for a class action approach to be taken by owners of units within apartment blocks
- Requiring territorial authorities to place WHRS notices on affected property files and to make that information available on Land Information Memorandum (LIM) reports
- Clear objectives for adjudicators to take a more investigative approach
- Enhancing the power and authority of adjudicators, including new offence provisions when parties fail to appear when summoned or disobey an order of the Tribunal

"The Bill will be referred to the Social Services Select Committee, so it can deliberate over the proposed legislation," Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said the proposed changes to the Act sit alongside other enhancements to the WHRS, including improved case management, better information and assistance for claimants, and consumer and industry education. The new requirement to place WHRS notices on LIM reports means potential buyers should know if the house is fixed, as it will be listed along with any consented repair work and code compliance certification.

Mr Cosgrove said work was also progressing well on the development of a financial assistance scheme pilot for those worst affected by leaky homes issues.

The WHRS enhancements are part of a suite of Government reforms aimed at ensuring homes are built right the first time. These include:

- the licensing of those who design and build whilst at the same time protecting the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture,
- the review of the Building Code,
- an auditing and accreditation scheme for Building Consent Authorities,
- the investigation of a home warranty insurance scheme and building product certification.
