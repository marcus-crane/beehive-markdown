Work and Income contact centres have been swamped by requests for the Great Little Cookbook of simple, affordable recipes for nutritious family meals.

The cookbook was launched in Nelson on Thursday, and featured in media around the country. So many families have contacted Work and Income, local media, and voluntary agencies wanting copies that the Ministry of Social Development will put it up on its website in pdf format, as a way of meeting immediate demand.

"The first print run was for 5,000, providing free copies for Work and Income and District Health Board clients in Nelson Marlborough", Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"Obviously, we'll be looking at printing more copies for more families around New Zealand – but meanwhile, we want this terrific resource to reach as many people as possible. Putting it up on the internet is a first step. I hope people also take photocopies and share them around."

The idea for the Great Little Cookbook came from frontline Work and Income staff in Greymouth. Along with around 60 recipes for Kiwi classics like pikelets, fish pie, and apple crumble, it includes meal plans, shopping and cooking tips, and nutritional and food safety advice. Each recipe was developed by a dietician and tested by a Work and Income client and her children.

Mr Benson-Pope said he was delighted by the level of interest shown in the cookbook. "The Great Little Cookbook contains the sort of knowledge that used to be handed down within families. It shows that no matter how times may have changed, simple, practical, commonsense advice never goes out of style."
