[Centres of Research Excellence (CoREs)](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/research/core/core.htm) will receive extra funding and up to two further CoREs are to be established, Minister for Tertiary Education, Michael Cullen, announced today.

The government decided in June that CoREs would be supported beyond 2008.  
An additional $10m in operating funding and one-off capital funding of $20m from 2007/08 has now been allocated.

“I’m extremely pleased to be able to confirm that further funding will be available for current CoREs if successful in the next selection round and excited by the prospect of New Zealand having up to two additional CoREs,” Dr Cullen says.

Seven CoREs were established by the government in 2002 and 2003 to produce world-class research that is focused on New Zealand’s future development.

“There is some excellent work being carried out in the current centres and New Zealand now has collaborative scientific networks which didn’t exist before the establishment of CoREs.

“The research CoREs are doing also helps and supports developing New Zealand industries, which in turn has a positive impact on the economy,” Dr Cullen says.

The Royal Society of New Zealand will conduct the funding allocation round on behalf of the Tertiary Education Commission.

Requests for proposals are likely to be called for early next month with final applications due in December. Final decisions will be made by June 2007.

It is proposed that there will be a flexible investment strategy that supports the development of new centres and existing centres.

"I am excited at the prospect of supporting excellent research that will help transform our economy through the development of world class quality research and build our national identity by focusing on New Zealand's future development", Dr Cullen concluded.
