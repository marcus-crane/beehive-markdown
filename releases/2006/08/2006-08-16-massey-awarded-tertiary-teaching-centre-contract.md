A Massey University-led consortium has won the contract to establish the new National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence, the Minister for Tertiary Education Michael Cullen announced today.

The government will spend $4m a year on the centre which will be hosted by Massey University in collaboration with Auckland University of Technology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch College of Education, Universal College of Learning and Manukau Institute of Technology.

The centre will be based at Massey’s Wellington campus with regional hubs in Auckland, Christchurch and Palmerston North.

The hubs will work with tertiary education providers to fund and support a range of services, activities and projects throughout the country.

Dr Cullen said the centre would promote and support effective teaching and learning across New Zealand’s tertiary sector.

"It will assist tertiary education organisations and educators to deliver the best possible learning outcomes for students," Dr Cullen said.

"The centre will also support and challenge tertiary education organisations to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning practices. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the quality of teaching and will result in students achieving their full potential."

The [National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/teaching2/ncftte/about.htm) will:

- Establish benchmarks to improve teaching practice
- Support the development of subject expertise in tertiary teaching
- Research, identify and share effective teaching and learning practices
- Explore the need for professional standards including entry requirements to the tertiary teaching profession.
- Administer the [Tertiary Teaching Excellence awards](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/for-providers/awards/ttea/)

"Encouraging excellence in teaching will reinforce our reforms of the tertiary sector funding framework as we strive to lift quality across the sector. High quality teachers producing high quality, work ready students where the economy needs them most, is vital for economic transformation," Dr Cullen concluded.
