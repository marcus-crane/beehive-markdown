The biggest development in tourism marketing overseas since the launch of the 100% Pure New Zealand campaign in 1999 is being launched in Sydney today, Minister of Tourism Damien O’Connor said.

Tourism New Zealand has enlisted the support of media personalities Petra Bagust and Robbie Magasiva to lure more Australians to New  
Zealand.

The new television commercial is still under the banner of the award-winning 100% Pure brand and features the pair using their ipods to show Australians in offices and on the street the latest of what’s on in New Zealand.

“All our research shows us that Australians are starting to see us as a domestic destination. What we needed was to give them a reason to come now and come often,” Mr O’Connor said.

The six million dollar ‘What’s On?’ campaign will highlight key events and experiences around New Zealand and focus on different regions around spring and autumn. All regions in New Zealand will be highlighted either through television or print advertisements or through [www.newzealand.com](http://www.newzealand.com).

“The idea behind the campaign is to show that New Zealand is a range of destinations, each with their own unique attractions, as Kiwis think of Australia, and to continually provide updates on new events in New Zealand,” Mr O'Connor said.

“We don’t say we’re going to Australia, we say we’re going to Noosa or Melbourne. We want Australians to think of New Zealand in the same way, to think of it in bite sized-chunks that they can visit frequently."

Tourism New Zealand Chief Executive George Hickton said cheaper airfares were luring more Kiwis to Australia, so there was no reason it couldn't work the other way.

"Nearly a million New Zealanders will travel to Australia this year. We want to redress the balance.”

Regional differences, unique events, activities and the distinct seasons New Zealand can offer are used to create urgency to visit New Zealand now, with lots of information to convince Australians to make the trip ‘across the ditch’, Mr Hickton said.

The campaign also marks 100 years since Tourism New Zealand opened its first office in Australia.

Images to be used in the campaign will be available from 4pm today at: [www.tourismnewzealand.com](http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/).
