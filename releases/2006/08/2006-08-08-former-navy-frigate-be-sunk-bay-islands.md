Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced that the former Royal New Zealand Navy frigate, HMNZS Canterbury will be sunk as a dive wreck at Deepwater Cove, Cape Brett in the Bay of Islands.

"The disposal of the Canterbury for scrap was examined as an option but the greater long term economic benefit to the country was thought to come from the sinking of the frigate as a dive wreck", Mr Goff said.

"A number of registrations of interest for disposal of the Canterbury were received from the North Auckland area. The strongest case was that put forward by the Bay of Islands Trust which will be given responsibility for sinking the vessel.

"The Bay of Islands Trust's proposal was seen as having the best potential to deliver the greatest overall economic benefit to the community and the country.

"The addition of a dive wreck will add to the attraction the Bay of Islands has to domestic and international visitors, in what is one of the country's most visited tourist destinations.

"The strong support of regional MPs, local government, iwi and tourism operators made the Bay of Islands Trust's proposal the strongest we received.

"While this vessel will be sunk, the ships name and its honour board will live on with the newly constructed multi role vessel, due to enter service in early 2007, which will have the same name and same home port", said Mr Goff.

The frigate HMNZS Canterbury was commissioned into the Royal New Zealand Navy in October 1971 and de-commissioned in March 2005. HMNZS Canterbury was the last of the Leander-class frigates in the Royal New Zealand Navy. HMNZS Canterbury carried a crew of 240 Officers and Ratings.
