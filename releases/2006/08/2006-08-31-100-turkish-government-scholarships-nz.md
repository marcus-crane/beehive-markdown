Up to 100 Turkish students will be eligible for places in New Zealand tertiary education institutions under a new Turkish government sponsorship programme Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen announced today.

"This is another endorsement of New Zealand's growing reputation for international education. It reflects well on the quality of our institutions and their academic staff.

"The fact that 10 per cent of Turkey's total global allocation of scholarships have been awarded to New Zealand is a real boost for our profile as an education provider," Dr Cullen said.

The announcement follows high-level visits to New Zealand by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Ergodan last year and Education Minister Husseyin Celik in April this year.

The new scholarships are available in 32 subject areas and will provide opportunities for a number of New Zealand’s tertiary education institutions, particularly those with strengths in agriculture, forestry and science.

Turkey's decision follows the government's recent announcement outlining its new direction for international education. The sector plays an important role in improving the knowledge base of the country and so helping the transformation of the economy.

"Our desire to revitalise international education complements our efforts to reform the tertiary funding framework. Improving quality across our institutions will raise our profile and increase our ability to attract more of the finest from overseas.

"We want to ensure that international students have a top quality experience in New Zealand, and we would hope these Turkish students return home recommending New Zealand as an excellent place to live and receive an education," Dr Cullen concluded.

The first Turkish students are expected to arrive from June 2007.
