Minister of Justice Mark Burton was treated to an impromptu performance by Dziah Dance Group, yesterday, while visiting their base with Crosspower Ministries in Otara, where it all began for the hip hop group who are now ranked second in the world.

The performance was part of a day spent visiting with community service providers in Auckland to learn about the services, activities and support they provide their community, and to hear their feedback on the recently announced Effective Interventions initiatives.

In spending time with Crosspowers Ministries, "I'm impressed by the great work being done to steer the young people in this area away from a life of crime," Mark Burton said

Mark Burton said to the group, "the work you do is vital to the success of these crime prevention initiatives."

"It is great to see young people, like the Dziah dancers, developing their skill and talent and succeeding on the world stage," Mark Burton said

Allan Va'a, team leader at Crosspowers, talked with passion about the organisation's work with the young people, "most of the kids we meet can't see beyond their front gate, we give them the opportunity to be involved in all sorts of activities in the community and go on outings, like to the movies or swimming." He said, "we want to show them the opportunities they have – lift their horizons so they can become people who give back to the community."

Sully Paea who founded Crosspowers 12 years ago said, "all we strive to do is connect with these young people."

Mark Burton also got to hear about the work done by Tamaki Pathways Trust, with at-risk young people in Tamaki Makaurau, and surrounding areas of Auckland.

The Minister commended their contribution to reducing youth offending and their special focus of involving the whanau of the young people they work with to reduce the number of young people involved in criminal activity.

The Minister also met with District Court Judges, the Public Defenders, and a number of senior Auckland legal practitioners to discuss their work and to get their feedback and input on the Effective Interventions package, which aims to reduce crime and address the growing prison population.
