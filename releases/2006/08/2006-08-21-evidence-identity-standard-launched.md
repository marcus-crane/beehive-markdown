Today's launch of the Evidence of Identity Standard will assist government agencies establish the identity of people accessing their services, and help reduce identity fraud, said Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker.

State Services Minister Annette King and Rick Barker launched the Evidence of Identity Standard and other All-of-Government Authentication Standards today.

“The Evidence of Identity Standard is a good practice guide to establish the identity of New Zealanders who need access to government services that have identity-related risk. Examples of these types of transactions include obtaining citizenship, enrolling at university, receiving a benefit or paying taxes,” says Rick Barker.

"By applying the Standard, agencies can have greater confidence that an individual is who they claim to be. This will help reduce identity fraud and theft.

"There is currently the potential for agencies to seek too much evidence, or not enough. The Standard provides accessible, good practice advice that will help agencies develop consistent processes.

"This means the public ‘know what to expect’ and can be assured they are not being asked to provide more personal information than is reasonable.

"The Evidence of Identity Standard is not a 'big brother' initiative. It simply provides overarching guidance on the type and amount of information agencies ask of people accessing their services.

"It is essential that government online services are as safe and secure as possible. The Evidence of Identity Standard, as part of the suite of Authentication Standards, demonstrates our commitment to this.

“The launch of the Standard today reflects a significant achievement and a milestone for the management of identity information,” concluded Rick Barker.

As custodians of the Evidence of Identity Standard, the Department of Internal Affairs will shortly seek interest from agencies to begin piloting the Standard.
