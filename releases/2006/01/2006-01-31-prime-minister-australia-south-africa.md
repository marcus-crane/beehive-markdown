Prime Minister Helen Clark will next week travel to Australia and South Africa for formal bilateral meetings, and for the Progressive Governance Summit near Pretoria.

Helen Clark is visiting Australia for the annual bilateral meeting between the New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers, to be held in Canberra on 8 February. She will also meet with other members of the Australian Cabinet.

“New Zealand and Australia are close neighbours and longstanding friends. Our relationship is underpinned by common values, a shared history, and an ever growing economic partnership,” Helen Clark said.

“The annual meeting gives the two Prime Ministers the chance to review a range of international, regional and bilateral issues, and maintains the strength of a very strong trans-Tasman relationship”.

“Our deepening engagement with Asia, and our ongoing joint efforts to develop good governance and stability in the Pacific, will be key discussion topics.”

In South Africa, the Prime Minister will meet with President Mbeki and members of his government, before attending the Progressive Governance Summit.

“The summit brings together leaders from Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Africa to discuss matters of common concern”, Helen Clark said.

“South Africa, an acknowledged leader in Africa, is of increasing importance to New Zealand, and is our largest trading partner in Africa. The visit will provide an opportunity to talk about ways in which we can strengthen the relationship between our two countries.”

"The Progressive Governance Summit and associated High Level Round Table will focus on policies for growth and development; migration and social cohesion; energy security and environmental stability," Helen Clark said.
