Finance Minister Michael Cullen today attacked opposition finance spokesman John Key for his unwarranted attack on government officials.

Mr Key has once again demonstrated his ignorance of the conventions of government, said Dr Cullen

Officials from the Reserve Bank and Treasury visited Japan in December to ensure the risks of investing in Uridashi New Zealand dollar bonds were well understood at this time.

"Officials were simply doing their job of protecting New Zealand's best interests," said Dr Cullen.

"John Key got rich on the back of currency speculation so it's hardly surprising that he's defending currency markets", said Dr Cullen. "He should instead be applauding the responsible efforts of officials at a time when exporters are clearly suffering from the high dollar."
