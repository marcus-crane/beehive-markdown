Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor has ordered an independent review of how the Corrections Department under-estimated the cost of building prisons in Waikato and Otago.

The department, which supports the review, has told Mr O'Connor that the cost of the prisons was under-estimated by $140 million.

The final capital cost for four new prisons at Northland, Auckland, North Waikato and Otago has been confirmed at $890 million, a rise of 16 per cent.

In comparison, cost increases between 2003 and 2005 in the non-residential construction industry countrywide average 15 per cent.

The review is to be carried out by the State Services Commission and the Treasury and will look at the department's processes, systems and contracting practices at Spring Hill and Otago prisons.

It is expected to take at least four months to complete.

Mr O'Connor said a long period of strong economic growth, a tight labour market, and rising materials prices had put exceptional pressure on large building projects across all sectors.

But he was concerned that the final build costs were substantially higher than advice given to the government had indicated, and wanted assurances the project had been well managed and that that everything that could have been done was done to keep costs to a minimum.

"Every aspect of the projects will be carefully scrutinised, including whether the mechanism for reporting to the government was appropriate for a capital project of this size.

"Building prisons is a very expensive business and as safety of the community is paramount it has to be done to a very high standard. But it is unacceptable that any more money than is absolutely necessary should be spent."
