Conservation Minister Chris Carter today announced the purchase of the Stonewall Block, a 121 hectare coastal property near Cape Palliser on the southern Wairarapa coast.

Mr Carter made the announcement while visiting the Stonewall Block to meet with its former owners, the Koers family. The newly purchased area will be managed as scenic reserve by the Department of Conservation.

Chris Carter said the $600,000 purchase of the Stonewall Block by the [Nature Heritage Fund](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Community/007~Conservation-on-Private-Land/001~Nature-Heritage-Fund.asp) secured important recreational opportunities on the southern Wairarapa coast, as well as protecting a pristine area of the region's costal environment.

“This stunning piece of coastal flat runs from the western part of the famous Ngapotiki Fan to the boundary of land owned by the local iwi Ngati Hinekawa. The Stonewall Block rises from sea level to meet with the Haurangi Forest Park that forms a back drop to this magnificent piece of coast.

"In addition to its strong conservation values, the land adjoins a popular surfing beach.

"Thanks to the efforts of the Koers family this land has been preserved. There is a diverse range of regionally threatened plant species and communities that make this an extremely important biological area that is almost unique to the lower North Island.

"In combination with the adjoining Haurangi Forest Park it will provide complete sequences of vegetation from shore line to hill top that are not protected elsewhere. The Ngapotiki Fan which has scientific and educational values will also be protected."

As part of the conditions of sale four wheel drive vehicles will continue to be excluded to ensure the biodiversity of the area remains protected. Mr Koers will continue to graze the property until the end of April 2007.

Chris Carter said that the purchase is in keeping with the government’s Conservation Policy to increase protection of coastal land. It complements other recent coastal and island purchases such as [Knuckle Point](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F15692) in Northland, [Waikawau Bay](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F16119) on the Coromandel, [Kaikoura Island](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F19627) in the Hauraki Gulf and [Greville Harbour](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23706) on D’Urville Island in the Marlborough Sounds.
