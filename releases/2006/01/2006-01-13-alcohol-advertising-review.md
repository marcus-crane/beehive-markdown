The government has initiated a wide-ranging review of regulations controlling the advertising and promotion of [alcohol](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/wpgIndex/About-Alcohol), Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The review will over the coming year seek the views of the wider community including consumer and sports groups, industry bodies, and non-government organisations, and will include a formal public consultation period, Damien O'Connor said.

It forms a part of the government's alcohol policy based on harm minimisation– one of the 13 priority population health objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy.

Mr O'Connor said [research shows](http://www.shore.ac.nz/publications/publications.html) a connection between alcohol advertising and the beliefs and behaviours of young people, with advertising reinforcing cultural norms.

The review will address specific issues with alcohol advertising in New Zealand, including the large amount of alcohol industry sponsorship, promotions and advertisements young people are exposed to, he said.

Both policy-makers and industry groups agree that alcohol advertising needs to be regulated to some degree, Mr O'Connor said.

"What is not agreed is how best to regulate and to what extent. A balance needs to be achieved between the need for public health and wider social objectives to be met, the right that industry has to advertise and market their products, and individual and parental rights and responsibilities."

Mr O'Connor said responsible marketing would help to achieve the harm reduction objective of the government’s [alcohol strategy](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/2844f7e8856b21a14c256a51007258f3?OpenDocument). This is supported by a Culture Change Programme, started earlier last year by the Alcohol Advisory Council, which is focused on changing New Zealand’s drinking culture from one that accepts intoxication as a social norm to one where bingeing and intoxication are seen as unacceptable.

The review will need to be proportionate and fair so that the resulting regulatory framework addresses the potential and real harms associated with advertising alcohol in a balanced and effective way, Mr O'Connor said.

The review will assess whether improvements can be implemented within the current voluntary self-regulatory framework or if consideration will need to be given to different regulatory approaches.

A steering group made up of members from the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand, the ministries of Health, Justice, Youth Development, and Culture and Heritage, the Advertising Standards Authority and Broadcasting Standards Authority, plus two independent members will lead the review. Members are to be appointed by the end of February.

The group is expected to provide final recommendations to the government in late 2006.
