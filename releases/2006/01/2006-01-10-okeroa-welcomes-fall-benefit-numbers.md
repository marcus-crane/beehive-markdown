Unemployment benefit numbers in Southland have fallen by 14 per cent in the last year, according to the latest statistics.

Te Tai Tonga MP Mahara Okeroa welcomed the drop as further evidence of a strong economy across New Zealand, and across the regions.

Results from the Ministry of Social Development’s quarterly benefit survey show that for the year to December 2005, 1,786 people were on the Unemployment Benefit, down from the previous year's 2,084 – a drop of 14 per cent.

Mr Okeroa says that compared with the 1999 figures when Labour took office, the total number of people receiving an Unemployment Benefit in Southland has dropped by 3,129 or 64 per cent.

"We've seen a huge change in our communities with more people than ever before moving into work," said Mr Okeroa. "This has happened on the back of Labour's sound management of the economy leading to strong economic growth.

"Importantly these gains are being shared with all regions of New Zealand. National is scare-mongering with warnings of an economic downturn, but the truth of the matter is that our economy is, as forecast, currently slowing before it is expected to pick up again in late 2007.

"We have had good jobs growth and an overall reduction of people on any kind of benefit. The labour market is still tight, and our local economy is in good shape and it is time for people to stop talking it down and to get on with business."

The latest statistics showed that in 2005 the total number of people receiving any kind of benefit in Southland fell by six per cent. Between 1999 and 2005 the total number of people on unemployment, domestic purpose, sickness and invalid benefits dropped by 32 per cent or in other words there were 3,130 fewer people receiving benefits.

"Behind these statistics are the realities of Kiwis getting on with supporting their families, working towards individual goals and making real contributions to our communities and local economies – these are the real success stories," Mr Okeroa said.
