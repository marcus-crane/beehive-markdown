Associate Conservation Minister Mahara Okeroa formally opened the new Horoirangi Marine Reserve in Nelson today.

The 904-hectare marine reserve stretches for a little over 5 km from Glenduan, on Nelson’s Boulder Bank, to Ataata Point at the south-west entrance to Cable Bay, and extends one nautical mile offshore.

Mr Okeroa said Horoirangi Marine Reserve was the 28th marine reserve to be gazetted in New Zealand waters with another three approved and awaiting gazettal. It joined a network of marine reserves established to protect special and unique sites as well as representative marine areas.

“I have every confidence the Horoirangi Marine Reserve will become a considerable asset to the Nelson region. It is just 11 km from Nelson city, making it an extremely accessible site for people to observe marine life, boat, swim, snorkel and dive," Mr Okeroa said.

"I want to take this opportunity to thank all those involved in making this reserve a reality, particularly the Nelson branch of Forest and Bird, who initiated the whole project, and the Nelson iwi, which has given the reserve its name."

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said Nelson was renowned as a centre of excellence for marine studies and science and it was particularly fitting to have a marine reserve nearby.

"This reserve complements much of what the Nelson community is about. It will provide a valuable opportunity for scientific study, and schools will also be able to use the reserve as an educational resource to enhance awareness of the marine environment," Mr Carter said.
