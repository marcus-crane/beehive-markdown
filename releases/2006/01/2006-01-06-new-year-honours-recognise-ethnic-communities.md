The awards made in the New Year Honours list to prominent members of New Zealand's ethnic communities are being welcomed by Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter.

"My personal congratulations go to all this year's recipients. The government has been working very hard to increase the visibility of our many ethnic communities and recognition at the level is an indication that this is working," Mr Carter said.

Among this year's recipients were:

- **Daud Azimullah**, who was recognised for his services to the Auckland Muslim community, especially through his work at the Avondale Islamic Centre,
- Auckland Indian community leader **Harish Bajaj**, who was recognised for his service to the New Zealand Indian community, particularly the founding of Shanti Niwas Charitable Trust,
- Auckland educator **Song Lam**, who was recognised for her work as a bilingual school facilitator helping new immigrant students and liaising with their families,
- Waikato Chinese community leader **Barbara Lim**, who was recognised for her 16 yearof voluntary service with the Waikato Chinese Association and her work with the Te Awamutu Hearing Association,
- Chinese community leader **Lynda Park**, who was recognised for founding the Shunde Association and her work with settling new Chinese migrants, and
- **Robert Khan**, who was recognised for his long work with the Palmerston North and Wellington Indian communities.

"These individuals have all been recognised for their tireless community work. They have each made a significant contribution to strengthening the communities they come from, ensuring ethnic peoples maintain links to their own heritage, culture and mother tongue and integrate successfully into the wider New Zealand community. They have also worked to build links between ethnic communities and the wider Kiwi community."

In his role as Ethnic Affairs Minister, Chris Carter often speaks to ethnic communities about the importance of leadership and believes in recognising those who have taken up the challenge.

"I hope that the success of these outstanding individuals will inspire the many other leaders in our ethnic communities to continue to give generously of their time," Mr Carter said.
