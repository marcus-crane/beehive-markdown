Every major infrastructure, business and community decision has some connection back to census information and social statistics, Statistics Minister Clayton Cosgrove said today in encouraging all New Zealanders to fill in their census forms on census day, 7 March this year.

"The census is a national stock-take where we update our knowledge of how we are changing and what those changes mean to business, to our communities and to local, regional and central government," Mr Cosgrove said in launching the 2006 Census advertising and communication campaign which will run until census day.

"You can fill in your census forms for New Zealand, for your business or the community organisation you support, or you can do it recognising that the way statistics are used affects you every day," he said.

Statistics New Zealand is employing 6500 census collectors, and has printed more than four million forms, set up an internet form, contacted numerous community groups and developed a comprehensive communication and advertising programme.

The television advertising campaign starts tomorrow with advertisements featuring real New Zealanders, rather than actors, and links the collection of census data with the uses it is put to. Community programmes to publicise the 2006 Census have been in operation since late last year.
