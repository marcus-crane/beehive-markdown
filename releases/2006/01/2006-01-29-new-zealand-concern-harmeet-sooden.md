Prime Minister Helen Clark said that the thoughts of all New Zealanders will be with Harmeet Sooden's family today.

"Harmeet's family and the families of the three other hostages with him have had a long and worrying delay since they last heard news of their loved ones. This latest video shows Harmeet and his friends alive.

"The New Zealand Government continues to urge the captors of Harmeet and his friends to release them. All four were on a peaceful mission to Iraq, and were motivated purely by a desire to help the Iraqi people.

"Our government will continue to liaise closely with the government of Canada and other governments to support their efforts to secure the release of Harmeet and his friends. New Zealand officials are in close contact with Harmeet's family in Auckland," Helen Clark said.
