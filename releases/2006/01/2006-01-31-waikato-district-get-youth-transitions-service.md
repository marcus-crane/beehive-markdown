The new service will provide career training, job seeking advice, and information on educational opportunities for school leavers in the Waikato region.

"The Youth Transitions Service will be a hugely valuable resource for young people in Waikato," said David Benson-Pope. "It will ensure they get the support and guidance they need to make a good transition to a job or further education.

"The government has a goal, along with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs, of ensuring all 15-19 year olds are in work, education, or training by 2007. The pace at which the Youth Transitions Service is becoming a reality is evidence of just how seriously we're taking this goal."

Mr Benson-Pope says the Ministry of Social Development will work closely with mayors and councils as they work to get the service up and running. To date $9 million in funding has been provided to establish 14 Youth Transitions Services around New Zealand. In December last year a Youth Transitions Servive was launched in Hamilton.

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said she was delighted the service was coming to the region: "We have a lot of good collaborative arrangements between local government, employers, community organisations and government agencies and the new service will certainly enhance these," said Ms Mahuta.

"Youth Transitions Services follow up and work with young people who are at risk of falling out of the system. Helping our young people into appropriate work, education or training is vitally important. Helping youth make positive decisions about their futures will have spin-offs not only for those individuals but for the wider community."

Seven Youth Transitions Services have been launched since April 2005. Nationally, they are working with around 3,100 young people at varying levels, depending on the individual young persons’ need. To date, 570 young people have been assisted into employment or have commenced further education or training.

Waikato District was one of four new Youth Transitions Services recently announced, with the others being in Palmerston North, Hawkes Bay and Auckland City.
