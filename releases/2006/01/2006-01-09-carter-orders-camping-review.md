The Department of Conservation is to review the availability of family-friendly camping opportunities for New Zealanders, particularly in coastal areas, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

The review will consider making more public land available for camping if necessary.

"Camping is a vitally important recreation opportunity for families of more modest means, and a traditional part of the kiwi summer holiday," Mr Carter said.

"Like many New Zealanders, I have become increasingly concerned about the loss of family-friendly camping opportunities to rapid development, particularly on the coast of the North Island.

"This review will assess the true extent of the problem, whether [DOC's existing camping facilities](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Explore/003~Huts-Cabins-and-Campsites/Conservation-Campsites/index.asp) are sufficient to compensate for the loss of private campgrounds, and the best way of doing something about it if they are not," Mr Carter said.

The review will report back to the Minister in April and will explore:

- The extent to which there has been a change in the availability of family-friendly camping opportunities around the country
- Trends in demand for camping, and the relationship to the variety of campground types currently available
- Particular holiday areas where there is an acute shortage of camping opportunities
- The scope in those areas to use existing public land administered by DOC for new or enlarged camping opportunities
- Private sector interest in new campground initiatives
- The scope for tendering concessions for camping opportunities on public land to the private sector
- The opportunities for partnerships between central and local government, community groups, trusts and the private sector in maintaining existing camping areas or providing new ones.

"In conducting this review, I have asked DOC to work with the private campground industry, recreation groups, local government and tourism interests," Mr Carter said.

"The aim is not to compete with private campgrounds but to work alongside the camping sector to ensure the iconic kiwi camping experience remains available for as many people as possible."
