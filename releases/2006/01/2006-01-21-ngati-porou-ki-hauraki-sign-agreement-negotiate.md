Ngâti Porou ki Hauraki Trust and the Crown today announced the signing of an Agreement to Negotiate in respect of Territorial Customary Rights under the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. This day is significant as the signing will mark one of the first territorial customary rights negotiations under the Act.

The signing took place in the Coromandel at Matâora Bay, Waihi.

‘The signing of the Agreement to Negotiate is a culmination of almost a year of discussions and we would like to pay tribute to the Ngâti Porou ki Hauraki Trust for the positive and productive discussions the Crown has had with them, as well as the strong sense of collaboration and goodwill they have shown,’ Maori Affairs Minister Hon Parekura Horomia said today.

‘As this is new territory, there will be many challenges to come. In this regard the Crown will endeavour to ensure that the balance between recognising territorial customary rights and the rights of the public of New Zealand at large is achieved’, said the Attorney General Hon David Parker.

The Ministers believe that if the Crown continues to make good progress through these negotiations, a recognition agreement will be achieved and will reflect the understanding, good will and hard work of all involved.
