Northland and Rodney school leavers considering their future are being urged by Labour MP Dover Samuels to consider taking up a trade.

"Both the Northland and Rodney Districts need on-the-job-trained plumbers, printers and electricians, just as much as it needs dentists, doctors and lawyers," said Dover Samuels.

“I urge local school leavers and young people to seriously consider taking up a trade, where they can earn while they learn. A good starting point is the Career Services - www.kiwicareers.govt.nz”

The MP says trades training has proven to be hugely popular with all sorts of young people. In the year to September, Northland* had 579 Modern Apprentices and 5,779 Industry Trainees, and Rodney District* had 118 Modern Apprentices and 1,287 Industry Trainees.

Across the country, there were 8,298 Modern Apprentices and 115,554 Industry Trainees by the end of September.

"I’m a huge supporter of young people seeking tertiary education, whether it be at university or polytech level or trades-based. For those who lean towards practical rather academic skills – the region needs you! Sustainability of our regional economy depends on people taking up a broad range of job opportunities and every area offers advancement for well-trained people.

“It’s no good having architects designing houses if there aren't enough builders, plasterers and electricians," said Dover Samuels.

"And it’s proven that well-trained tradespeople can earn good money. Statistics NZ reports that the pay packets of agriculture and fisheries workers grew by 13.7 per cent; trades workers got an extra 9.5 per cent; and pay for wholesale, retail and plant and machine workers rises rose by seven per cent.

“Our Labour-led government is proudly committed to helping New Zealanders achieve their potential through the skills and qualifications they seek.

“Bright sparks are not only earning good money without having to pay student loans, but they are making an important contribution to our region’s economy and community,” Dover Samuels said.
