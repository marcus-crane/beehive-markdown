A treaty establishing clear and legal maritime boundaries between New Zealand and Australia comes into force today, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced.

The Treaty agreed in 2004 establishes the boundary lines between New Zealand and Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zones and the seabed (known as the continental shelf) in the Tasman Sea and adjacent areas of the south-western Pacific Ocean.

Mr Peters said the historic maritime boundary treaty was significant.

“For the first time, New Zealand has clear legal boundaries across the ocean areas under its jurisdiction.”

“These boundaries enable New Zealand to exercise its rights over these areas with certainty, including its rights to resources such as minerals and petroleum,” Mr Peters said.

Under international law, maritime boundaries must be established by agreement in order to achieve an equitable solution. In some places the agreed boundary extends past the 200 nautical mile New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. In these areas, the boundary entitles New Zealand to the undersea resources of the continental shelf.

“In the spirit of true Trans-Tasman cooperation, this boundary represents a fair and equitable outcome for both of us,” said Mr Peters.

Negotiations on the treaty began after a joint Prime Ministerial announcement in August 1999 that officials would work towards a boundary agreement.  
New Zealand will present the boundaries of the rest of its continental shelf to a special United Nations Commission in April. Australia lodged its boundaries with the United Nations in November 2004, and has undertaken to support New Zealand’s submission.
