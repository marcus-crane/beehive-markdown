Toa Fraser's movie 'No2', which is set in Mt Roskill, won strong endorsement from the local Kiwi community and film industry representatives at a special screening in Los Angeles, says local MP and Trade Minister Phil Goff.

This followed its success at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in Utah this week.

Mr Goff, in Los Angeles en route to trade and defence meetings in Europe, joined director Toa Fraser and actress Mia Blake at the screening organised by the New Zealand Consulate General in Los Angeles on Monday (Tuesday NZT).

"It was an excellent film. Everyone at the screening loved it," said Mr Goff. "It was quite something to be in Los Angeles, the movie capital of the world, watching Mt Roskill up on the big screen. Toa has longstanding family connections in Mt Roskill, which inspired him to set his movie in our local community.

"Toa has been delighted with the reception No 2 has received here. The newspaper reviews have been glowing and the film was met with a standing ovation at its premiere at the Sundance festival. It had three sell-out screenings there, while Toa and the film's star – American actress Ruby Dee – were given standing ovations as well."

Mr Goff said there was more good news for Fraser with No 2 having been accepted by the Berlin film festival – one of the most important in Europe.

"To be shown at prestigious festivals like Sundance and Berlin is a real coup. It's a remarkable achievement for someone making his debut as a director. It adds further to New Zealand's growing reputation for film making in the international film community."

No 2, an adaptation of Fraser's awarding-winning play, is a drama-comedy about an elderly Fijian matriarch who demands that her grandchildren put on a big feast at which she will name her successor as head of the family. It opens in New Zealand on February 16.

While in Los Angeles, Mr Goff has met with New Zealand trade, tourism, foreign affairs and immigration officials, as well as representatives of Fisher and Paykel, Zeacom and other New Zealand companies who have businesses based in California.

He heads to Europe later today (Wednesday) to attend a World Trade Organisation meeting in Davos, Switzerland, and a conference on Afghanistan in London.
