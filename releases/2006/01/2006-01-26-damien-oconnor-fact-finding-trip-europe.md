Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor is to embark on a fact-finding trip to Europe to look at new models of offender management.

Mr O'Connor is to lead a New Zealand delegation that will meet officials and visit corrections facilities in Britain, Finland and the Netherlands. He leaves on 28 January and returns on 10 February 2006.

"I want to see first hand new practises which are being adopted in other jurisdictions and to investigate whether they can be adapted to the New Zealand environment.

"New Zealand has a higher per capita prison population than many comparable countries. This visit will give me and my delegation the opportunity to view innovative ways to manage offenders, while at the same time ensuring the community is protected from dangerous violent offenders."

Accompanying Mr O'Connor will be Sensible Sentencing Trust spokesman Garth McVicar and Prison Fellowship of New Zealand director Kim Workman.

Mr O'Connor said significant progress was being made in managing muster numbers, with extra union beds coming on stream, but it was important to look for new ways to bring recidivism rates down to remove extra pressure from the system. That is what this trip is about.

National Party Law and Order spokesman Simon Power's persistent bleating was not helping the situation, with his cynical twisting of facts and figures as he desperately tries to boost his profile in order to get out of Don Brash's bad books, Mr O'Connor said.

"Simon Power's carping undermines the very good work being done by Corrections staff, who have to operate in a very challenging environment."

Mr O'Connor will also, in his capacity as Associate Health Minister, attend a World Health Organisation conference in Geneva on tobacco control. Health ministers from more than 100 countries, including the United States, Britain and Australia will attend the conference.
