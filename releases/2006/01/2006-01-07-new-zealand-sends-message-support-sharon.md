A message of support to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been sent on behalf of the government and the people of New Zealand, Duty Minister Chris Carter said today.

"Our [ambassador in Ankara](http://www.nzembassy.com/home.cfm?c=40&l=104&CFID=17972403&CFTOKEN=29068888), who is accredited to Israel, delivered a message of support to Ariel Sharon, his family and the Israeli people, from the government and people of New Zealand soon after Mr Sharon suffered a stroke this week.

"In December when the Mr Sharon suffered a minor stroke the Prime Minister sent her Israeli counterpart a message wishing him a full recovery.

"New Zealand was saddened to hear that Prime Minister Sharon's health has now deteriorated after a second and more significant stroke.

"Our thoughts are with Mr Sharon and his family and the Israeli people at this time," Chris Carter said.
