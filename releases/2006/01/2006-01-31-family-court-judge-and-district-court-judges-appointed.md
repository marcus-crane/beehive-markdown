Attorney-General David Parker has announced the appointment of a new Family Court Judge and two District Court Judges.

The Family Court Judge is Rosemary Riddell of Dunedin, who will be sworn in on 2 February and will sit in Hamilton. The District Court Judges are Kevin Phillips of Queenstown, who will be sworn in on 20 February and will sit in Invercargill, and Duncan Harvey of Palmerston North, who will be sworn in on 28 February and will sit in Whangarei.

Ms Riddell qualified and was admitted to the bar in 1992 after working for a number of years in broadcasting and public relations. In 1997 she moved from Auckland, where she had worked for Gaze Burt, to Dunedin, to join Gallaway Haggitt Sinclair and has been a partner of the firm (now Gallaway Cook Allan) since 1999. She has made a career in family law but also has experience in criminal, civil and employment law. A Council Member of the Otago District Law Society since 1999, Ms Riddell has chaired the Complaints Committee, Cost Revision Committee and Audit and Practice Committee. She is a former President of the Otago Women Lawyers Society. She is Deputy Chair of the Fortune Theatre Board and is actively involved in theatre as both an actor and director. She has also held leadership roles in a number of charitable trusts in both Auckland and Dunedin.

Mr Phillips was admitted to the bar in 1972. He first practised in Gore with Bannerman Brydone and Folster (as it was then known) becoming a partner in 1976. He moved to Queenstown in 1985. He joined the firm now known as Macalister Todd Phillips Bodkins in 1986 as a partner and head of litigation. While criminal work has dominated his practice over the last 10 years, nearly half of his recent workload has come from his role as solicitor for the Queenstown-Lakes District Council. He also takes on some general civil litigation, family law work and arbitrations and advises a number of clients involved in the road transport industry. Mr Phillips is on the Southland Crown Solicitors Prosecution Panel. Professional roles he has held include membership of the Council of the Otago District Law Society and the New Zealand Law Society Litigation Skills Faculty. Outside the law he has served on the Queenstown Primary School Board of Trustees and as a Trustee of the Queenstown Events Centre.

Mr Harvey was admitted to the bar in 1975. A sole practitioner since 1994, he has worked almost exclusively in the criminal jurisdiction and in family law since 1990. Earlier in his career he worked as a general practitioner in Raetihi, Ohakune and Waiouru, and was Senior Associate at Innes Dean in Palmerston North from 1990 1994. He is on the Palmerston North Crown Solicitors Prosecution Panel and a Courts Martial Panel Member. He was formerly a lecturer in Army Law (Courts Martial) for the Waiouru Military Camp and has served on the Council of both the Wanganui and the Manawatu District Law Societies.
