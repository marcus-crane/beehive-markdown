Conservationists are heading to [Fiordland National Park](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Explore/001~National-Parks/Fiordland-National-Park/index.asp) next week to search for any remaining kakapo left in the wild which could boost efforts to rescue the world's largest parrots from the brink of extinction.

There are just 86 birds known to be alive and a captive breeding programme is being hampered by low fertility, thought to be a consequence of inbreeding within the small remaining population.

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said any remaining kakapo found in Fiordland would be valuable additions to the kakapo gene pool.

"This month-long search is of great importance to the remaining kakapo. It will be led by [Don Merton](http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/people/merton.html), who has played a pivotal role in [kakapo recovery](http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/kakapointro.html) in his work with them over thirty years, DOC kakapo team leader, Paul Jansen, with assistance from DOC staff and keen volunteers.

"The team will search through some of New Zealand's most rugged and remote country to find two males left behind during initial kakapo removal operations in the 1980s.

"The long-lived nature of kakapo means that it is possible that the two known remaining males are still alive, especially since the last Fiordland kakapo, Richard Henry, is still alive and thought to be around fifty years old.

"There are more than thirty documented records of kakapo signs in the area, the last one of which was received just prior to Christmas from a hunter in Fiordland.

"Hopes of finding the birds are heightened by this year's prolific beech seeding, which triggers mating behaviour in kakapo, and increases the chances of finding the birds.

"Fortunately for the search team, the mating behaviour involves the distinctive kakapo vocalisations or "booming" behaviour, which carries over distances of up to 3km.

"I wish the searchers every success. Kakapo are unique in the world and New Zealand has a responsibility to ensure they survive and thrive for future generations to enjoy," Chris Carter said.

[**Kakapo Facts**](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Conservation/001~Plants-and-Animals/001~Native-Animals/Kakapo.asp):

- Kakapo are ground-dwelling parrots. They are excellent climbers, using their beak and claws to climb high into trees.
- Kakapo are essentially flightless, capable of no more than short, wing-assisted jumps.
- They are the world's biggest parrots, weighing up to 4 kg.
- In the breeding season, male kakapo swell up like a porcupine fish and emit a low booming sound that can travel up to 5km.
- Kakapo look like green owls and move on the ground with a rolling gait.
- Kakapo are nocturnal and solitary, gathering only to breed.
- The birds feed on seeds and fruits. It is believed that breeding is triggered by eating green rimu fruit.
- They are very long lived. Richard Henry, the last surviving Fiordland bird, is believed to be at least 50 years old.
- A female kakapo may lay a clutch of between one and three eggs. In exceptional years, for example in 2002, kakapo may lay two clutches in one breeding season.
- Kakapo take many years to reach breeding maturity. Males will take five years, and females, nine to 11 years.
