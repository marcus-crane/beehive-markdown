“Reports are emerging from Fiji of disagreements within the Republic of Fiji Military Forces”, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

"The New Zealand Government reiterates its position that all parties should remain calm and resolve their differences through dialogue."

New Zealand’s High Commission in Suva, which is closely monitoring the situation, is seeking more information from the Fijian authorities.

"I have no reason to believe that there is any current threat to Fijian citizens or New Zealanders visiting or living in Fiji,’’ Mr Peters said.
