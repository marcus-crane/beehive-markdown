Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor is challenging the newly appointed Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board to find ways to boost the number of qualified gasfitters and plumbers.

The new appointments will position the board well for the transition from reporting to the Health Ministry to reporting to the Department of Building and Housing in 2008, Mr O'Connor said.

The changeover also means the new board is in place for updated legislation currently being considered by the Commerce Committee (the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Bill).

The proposed bill will modernise the existing Act, include competency based licensing, enhance the disciplinary provisions, provide for infringement offences and other matters.

But most importantly, the board will be able to address the critical task of working closely with industry to boost our numbers of qualified plumbers, fitters and drainlayers, Mr O'Connor said.

"The board will need to work to build a strong relationship between it and the  
Plumbing, Gasfitting and Drainlaying Industry Training Organisation. In particular, it will need to focus on measures to improve the low pass rates for plumbers and gasfitters, which is exacerbating skills shortages in the plumbing and gasfitting trades.

"Plumbing, gasfitting and drainlaying are crucial trades to a wide cross-section of New Zealanders, from homeowners to large industry. The board plays a critical role in ensuring we are appropriately training and skilling sufficient New Zealanders in these trades to meet our current and future needs."

It is vital that organisations work together to train people with the skills the country needs, and match the government's commitment to overcoming skills shortages through industry training and the Modern Apprenticeships programme.

Mr O'Connor thanked the existing board members whose tenure ended this month, the majority of whom had served at least two terms.
