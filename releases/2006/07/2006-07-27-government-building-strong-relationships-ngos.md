Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today that government agencies have made significant progress in improving the framework for the care and protection of vulnerable children, including the way they work with non-government organisations.

He said that the first report of the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, to be released tomorrow, would set out the next stages for strong and co-ordinated action across the government and non-government sectors.

Mr Benson-Pope said it was regrettable that the views expressed in the paper released today, Care and Protection in New Zealand, did not give sufficient regard to the progress being made.

"The Labour-led Government has made excellent progress in developing partnership with NGOs, and the views in the paper don't reflect those of the wider NGO sector", Mr Benson-Pope said.

"We fund and partner with NGOs for many social services, and we're running capacity-building initiatives in areas like funding, workforce capacity, and co-ordination".

Mr Benson-Pope said his "door was always open" to NGO members who wanted to meet him.

"We depend on the knowledge and feedback of the community sector. I hope to meet with the paper's authors and discuss their concerns".

Mr Benson-Pope said it was important that the government and non-government sectors remain focused on their shared work in early intervention and preventing family violence.

"We must all work collaboratively, not competitively, towards our goal of safe families and safe communities".

Mr Benson-Pope said there was a range of indicators showing the improved work of CYF:

- Unallocated cases have reduced from 5,000 in September 2004 to 934 today.
- In the year to June 2006, CYF met all its standards for timeliness in investigations.
- Departmental funding for CYF has increased from $203m in 2000/01 to $403m in 2006/07.
