Energy Minister David Parker today released the terms of reference for the development of a New Zealand Energy Strategy (NZES).

Mr Parker said the strategy would identify priorities to achieve the government’s energy objectives of:

- reliability and resilience;
- environmental responsibility; and
- fair and efficient prices for energy for current and future generations.

“The energy options and environmental constraints we face in the years ahead make for complex decision-making. It’s important that we act now to provide the confidence and right signals for investment in New Zealand’s sustainable energy future. The security of our energy system is a priority for the government.

"The key challenge is to strike a balance between flexibility around the options we have and the uncertainties we face, while providing enough direction to provide a reasonable level of certainty that the strategic objectives we decide to pursue will be achieved."

The terms of reference set out the overall purpose of the strategy, the proposed approach to developing the strategy, and the process for engaging with stakeholders.

“I’m very keen to make sure all interested stakeholders get an opportunity to contribute to the development of the NZES. That is why I am releasing these terms of reference.

“Details of the engagement process will be announced shortly. These will include workshops on specific areas of interest, as well as widespread public consultation on the draft strategy, which is expected to be published during September.

“The government has implemented a wide range of [energy policy initiatives](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/resources/cabinet/cab-06-188.html) to support energy markets, manage security of supply, and promote energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy,” said Mr Parker.

“Across the world, countries are grappling with the challenges posed by dramatic price increases, constraints on fuels supplies, and the impacts of climate change. Consequently, energy is one of the most important issues we face today,” he said.

The terms of reference can be found on the Ministry of Economic Development’s website at [www.med.govt.nz](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____19431.aspx)

Mr Parker said the [National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy](http://www.eeca.govt.nz/eeca-library/eeca-reports/report/neecs-framework-paper-06.pdf) (PDF 110KB) was being revised at the same time, and would focus on how we manage energy demand. The NEECS is a key subset of the NZES.

“The NZES and the NEECS are integral to the energy sector [climate change work programme](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/resources/reports/climate-change-solutions-jun06/index.html), and will contribute substantially to New Zealand’s overall response to climate change.”
