Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched a book celebrating thirty years of supported employment provision through the Mainstream Programme by the State Services Commission.

Speaking at the launch, Helen Clark said that by taking the step thirty years ago to establish the [Mainstream Programme](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?NavID=85), New Zealand's Public Service led the way internationally towards new, and greatly improved, employment practice for people with disabilities.

Real Work for Real Pay describes the phenomenon of New Zealand’s Mainstream Programme and introduces some of the personalities involved, Helen Clark said.

“Mainstream is a unique disability-related scheme. Thirty years after it was founded, the programme is still leading the international field. Although other partial wage subsidy programmes have been introduced in a few countries in recent years, very few governments have been prepared to take the bold step embraced here in 1975.

“Nowhere else in the world does there exist a programme provided by, and for, the State sector, which deliberately seeks to assist those most disadvantaged by disability.

“The State Services Commission’s management of the Mainstream Programme directly links to its role in promoting the State Service as the employer of choice, while also increasing the diversity of its workforce.

“Delivering the Mainstream Programme also assists that objective of [New Zealand’s Disability Strategy](http://www.odi.govt.nz/publications/nzds/index.html) which seeks to remove barriers which inhibit participation in the life of the community by people with disabilities.

“Through the Mainstream Programme, disabled people can be provided with a step into the workforce and into paid employment. Mainstream participants also reap the associated benefits of higher self-esteem, self-confidence, and an improved standard of living.

“Research undertaken by the State Services Commission shows that 69 per cent of people who have used the scheme remain independently in employment and are not receiving a benefit. This is real work, for real pay, as the programme claims and is a tremendous achievement," Helen Clark said.
