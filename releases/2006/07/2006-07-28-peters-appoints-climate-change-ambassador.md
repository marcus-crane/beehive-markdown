Foreign Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Adrian Macey to the new position of Climate Change Ambassador.

“Climate change is widely recognised as one of the most serious and urgent problems affecting the world. It is a global problem that can’t be solved solely by those countries that have committed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol," Mr Peters said.

“Tackling climate change will require broad and balanced participation, especially from those responsible for most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.

“The Ambassador will be responsible for handling New Zealand's international negotiations on climate change, and for helping us make an effective contribution to international efforts. The position will allow us to increase cooperation with our key bilateral partners and international stakeholders.

"We need to ensure that any new agreement is effective in mitigating and adapting to global warming, and is fair and equitable to all countries. It must also take account of New Zealand’s own unique circumstances, including our high level of agricultural emissions relative to other developed countries," Mr Peters said.

New Zealand and other countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol have committed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008-2012. Over the next few years the international community has to decide on the arrangements that will work after 2012.

Mr Macey has recently returned from being Ambassador to France and the OECD. He was previously Director of Trade Negotiations Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Ambassador in Bangkok.
