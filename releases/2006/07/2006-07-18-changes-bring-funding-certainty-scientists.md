The announcement of new processes allowing scientists to negotiate longer-term funding contracts with the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology was welcomed today by Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

"This is a strong step towards a more stable funding environment for science in New Zealand," Steve Maharey said.

"For the first time science organisations with a proven track-record will have the opportunity to negotiate, rather than compete, for contracts.

"The ability to negotiate longer-term contracts will apply to up to 18 percent of the more than $1 billion invested by the government, through the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, over the next five years.

"While contestability will continue to be an important part of how we fund science, it is clear that too much contestability can affect the ability of our scientists and science organisations to carry out research and apply their ideas over a longer period.

"New Zealand currently has a higher level of contestability than any other OECD country. We need to achieve a better balance between contestability and stability of funding, to ensure our science system is able to make a long-term contribution to New Zealand's economy and society.

"The changes present opportunities for our research organisations to secure more long-term funding for projects of national significance."

The announcement follows six weeks of consultation with the science sector on Cabinet decisions aimed at providing greater certainty for longer-term research and science programmes.
