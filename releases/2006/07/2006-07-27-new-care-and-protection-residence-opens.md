Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services, paid tribute to the hard working staff at the opening of Whakatakapokai, CYF’s new care and protection residence today.

"Residential care is one of the toughest and most demanding social work environments. Because the work is difficult, a camaraderie and rapport develops between workers in a residence that you find in few other professions," she said.

"Being a residential social worker can also be highly rewarding, particularly when change for the better is seen in a young person over time," said Ms Dyson.

Other speakers at the opening included Manukau Mayor, Sir Barry Curtis and Ray Smith, CYF’s Acting Deputy Chief Executive.

Formerly known as the Northern Residential Centre, this new facility will increase the number of care and protection beds from 38 to 48 nationwide.

Four young people at the residence have been working towards the Young New Zealanders’ Challenge Award - one was awarded the Bronze Award by Sir Barry Curtis and the remaining three were given certificates in recognition of completing three of the four sections at Bronze level.

The opening of Whakatakapokai marks the culmination of a 10-year redevelopment programme to separate care and protection and youth justice campuses because of the differing needs of these two groups of young people.

The redevelopment has seen an additional 37 youth justice and 13 care and protection beds added nationally.
