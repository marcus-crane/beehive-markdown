The Climate Change Minister David Parker has rejected a proposal by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition for a Royal Commission on Climate Change.

Mr Parker says by far the majority of climate scientists in the world agree that there is no longer any doubt our climate is changing due to human activity, and it is now a matter of how quickly it changes, not if or when.

But Mr Parker said that even if climate change wasn't occurring, climate change policies would still make sense.

"Reducing the country's dependence on fossil fuels, insulating our homes, making sure our vehicle fleet is fuel-efficient, keeping our air clean, and maintaining our forest cover to protect soil and water quality, are all sensible measures that are good for our way of life and our health."

"They also ensure we preserve our unique environment for our children, and our children's children," he said.

"We will be taking action in these areas and others through the work programmes currently under development because they make good sense for New Zealand, not just because they satisfy our commitment to the global community."

"Therefore there is no need for a Royal Commission into Climate Change."
