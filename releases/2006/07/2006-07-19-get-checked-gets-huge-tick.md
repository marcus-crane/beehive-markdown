The numbers of New Zealanders on 'Get Checked' diabetes programme who are managing their disease well has more than doubled, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Earlier this month figures for the government-supported programme revealed a doubling in enrolments to 70,456 but the latest figures show that with that enrolment comes an acceleration in the number of people managing their disease well.

"There has been an almost eight-fold increase in numbers of Pacific people who are now managing this disease well," Pete Hodgson said. " Type 2 diabetes is a disease that can be controlled through day-to-day personal management, but getting into the programme means they also maintain a vital link with health services."

Between 2001 and 2005 the numbers of people on the 'Get Checked' programme with 'satisfactory or better' control of their disease have increased by:

·280 per cent for Maori  
·780 per cent for Pacific  
·210 per cent for All Ethnicities
