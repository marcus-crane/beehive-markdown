Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker officially opened the Fire Service's state-of-the-art National Training Centre in Rotorua today.

"Before I go any further I would like to congratulate the first recruits to graduate from the Centre. You are the future of fire and rescue services in New Zealand, and the government wants to be sure that you have the proper tools to operate in the 21st century," said Rick Barker.

"The National Training Centre will help meet fire service training needs well into the future. It is very well equipped, and includes a fully-functioning mock station, a specialised compartment fire training building, lecture rooms, and a library," said Rick Barker.

The site took just over 12 months to complete and cost over $11 million.

"It is not just a significant investment of money, but also an investment of knowledge and experience to be passed onto future firefighters.

"I’m happy to declare the National Training Centre open," said Rick Barker.
