Protecting kiwi communities against international organised crime and the threat of terrorism is the aim of a bill that gives New Zealand's border security measures a significant boost.

Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said at today's first reading of the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill that it would allow for greater collaboration between border control agencies and strengthen the ability of Customs officers to deal with risks at the border.

"This legislation recognises that New Zealand’s travel and trade landscape is changing. We are experiencing huge growth in the volume of people and goods crossing our border, and with it, increasing risks from threats such as illegal migration, identity fraud, terrorism, drugs and international organised crime. And while New Zealand may seem far away from the rest of the world, the reality is that global terrorism and crime know no boundaries.

"These provisions will help make New Zealand a safer place by enhancing our ability to address these risks at the border. A key component of this is being able to work in a more coordinated way across government agencies to target such threats effectively and with minimal disruption to legitimate trade and travel.

"The legislation also recognises that the volume and sophistication of organised criminal activity is rising, so our border control activities also need to advance to keep pace with this. Major drug seizures – such as the record $135 million drug bust in Auckland in May – indicate that our country continues to be a target of such criminal groups, and that we cannot afford to let our guard down.

"The Labour-led Government is committed to protecting our country and our way of life from these threats, and this Bill will help us to do that," Nanaia Mahuta said.

Key aspects of the bill include:  
·greater coordination between border agencies, such as Police, Immigration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to enhance security  
·strengthening and extending existing powers for Customs officers to cover new situations, such as people smuggling  
·ability to hold and refer at-risk goods and people of interest at the border  
·extending current powers allowing Customs officers to search for and seize false identity documents, and equipment used to produce them  
·the ability to restrict goods which may be used for inappropriate purposes, such as materials used for weapons manufacture or biological warfare.
