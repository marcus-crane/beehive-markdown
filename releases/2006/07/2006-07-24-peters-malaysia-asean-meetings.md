Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves for Kuala Lumpur tomorrow to attend the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

Mr Peters will also attend a Ministerial lunch on the East Asia Summit (EAS), the fourth South West Pacific Dialogue Ministerial Meeting, and hold a number of bilateral meetings with his counterparts.

The PMC process will see Mr Peters lead New Zealand's delegation in a Dialogue meeting with a number of ASEAN countries. He will also attend a lunchtime meeting with ASEAN Ministers and the other Dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.

“New Zealand has been an ASEAN Dialogue partner for over three decades.  
The annual Post Ministerial Conference and Regional Forum are important opportunities for us to engage with ASEAN on common economic, political and security issues," Mr Peters said.

"ASEAN is a key part of New Zealand’s broader relationship with Asia. Its members play a central role in developments that are shaping the future economic progress and stability of the Asia region. It is vital that we forge closer ties with them.

"Along with my ASEAN counterparts, I expect to endorse a new ‘Framework for Cooperation’ to guide the strengthening of New Zealand-ASEAN relations over the next few years. This is an excellent initiative, which will provide the impetus and structure to our cooperation and engagement with ASEAN.

"The East Asia Summit meeting will provide an opportunity to reiterate New Zealand’s commitment to the success of the EAS, and to talk about the direction of the Summit process," Mr Peters said.
