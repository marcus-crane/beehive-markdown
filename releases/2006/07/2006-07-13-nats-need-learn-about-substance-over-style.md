Foreign Minister Winston Peters says he is happy to leave megaphone diplomacy to the National Party while he gets on with his work.

"Murray McCully's angst over the lack of information about my forthcoming visit to Washington shows his preference for sound bites ahead of informed comment.

"It is a matter of record that I have said on several occasions recently that a trip to Washington will happen soon. Details will of course, as always, be made public before departure but frankly it is the substance of the trip that matters to me, not making a song and dance about it.

"National's agitation reveals how much they hate the fact that I am actively seeking to further improve New Zealand's relationship with the United States.

"In the meantime, Mr McCully ought to find an issue with a bit more substance if he wants any attention. Today's attack had all the impact of an ankle-biting Chihuahua," Mr Peters.
