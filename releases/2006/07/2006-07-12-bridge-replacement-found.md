Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker today announced that a temporary replacement for the Ngaturi Bridge has been found.

"Yesterday I visited Mangamahu and saw first hand the issues facing the community following severe flooding and the subsequent loss of the Ngaturi Bridge," said Rick Barker.

"Today I contacted Transit New Zealand who informed me that they have a bailey bridge available which they can design, engineer and construct on the Ngaturi Bridge site.

"I've since secured National Land Transport Programme funding to meet these costs.

"Yesterday I assured Mangamahu locals that the government would work as fast as we could to restore access.

"Within a day we have found a bridge and the money to pay for it. This is a great result," said Rick Barker.

The temporary bridge will be erected at no cost to the Wanganui District Council.

Work will continue on erecting a permanent replacement for the Ngaturi Bridge.
