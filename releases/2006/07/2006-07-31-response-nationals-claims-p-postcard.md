Jim Anderton Associate Minister of Health responded today to accusations of spending taxpayer funds on an anti-P pamphlet.

“Producing a pamphlet that tells people about the risks of methamphetamine (P) and where to go for information, help, and treatment must be one of the best uses of taxpayers’ money that I can think of, and I make no apology for it,” Jim Anderton said.

"Since this pamphlet went out I have had many requests for more. One business group has asked for 200, another organisation wanted as many as I could send, and there was also a request for the pamphlet from the National Party’s spokesperson on drugs own electorate office! So Mr Brownlee is belittling a measure even his colleague Tony Ryall, in the National Party is asking for,” Mr Anderton said.

"The anti-P pamphlet is the latest in a series of actions I have taken as the Minister responsible for this government’s national drug policy and methamphetamine action plan.

"Methamphetamine is now a Class A drug with a penalty of life imprisonment. Police and Customs enforcement powers in relation to this drug have been strengthened. 22 Community Action in Drug programmes have been established in the worst affected areas with 3 more to come, and I have chaired 11 public meetings around the country on P Alcohol and other Drugs.

“If Mr Brownlee knew anything about this issue and had been to as many public meetings on drugs as I have, he would know that the New Zealand public want information on “P”. They are not belittling this effort, they are not writing to me complaining about getting a pamphlet that tells them where to go for help, they are in fact doing the exact opposite, and according to the Alcohol and Drug Helpline they are using the pamphlet in exactly the way intended by ringing and seeking help.

"The use of a photo that had been used before was to save taxpayer money, money in the ballpark of $500-$2,500. It is also a good photo that appeals to youth, which is what you need if you want them to keep the pamphlet and use it.

"There is certainly nothing political about the photo and there is absolutely no reference to the Progressive Party anywhere on the pamphlet, which is in line with audit office direction in the past.

"If you want to play 'spot the difference', I think someone should remind Mr Brownlee that it was the National Party NOT the Progressive Party that was investigated by the Electoral Office after the last election in terms of misusing taxpayers’ funds. It was the National Party led by a former Reserve Bank governor, which “forgot” about the GST it owed and racked up $100,000 in unauthorised spending on television and radio advertising during the election campaign.

"In contrast, the Progressive Party was one of the few parties in Parliament that wasn’t subject to complaint or investigation for misuse of taxpayer funding, after the last election," Jim Anderton said today.
