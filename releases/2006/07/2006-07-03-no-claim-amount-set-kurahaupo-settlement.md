The Crown and three iwi from the northern South Island have agreed to enter Treaty settlement negotiations.

The three iwi:

- Ngâti Apa Ki Te Ra To,
- Ngâti Kuia and
- Rangitâne o Wairau,

have come together to form the Kurahaupo Ki Te Waipounamu Trust for the purpose of the negotiations.

Mark Burton said Terms of Negotiation had been agreed with the Trust and these set out how the parties would negotiate. The Crown recognised that Kurahaupo iwi had legitimate grievances and wished to begin negotiations to address them.

"No estimate has been done of the value of any redress that the Crown would provide, nor is it appropriate to speculate on the dollars involved.

"These matters are entirely the subject of the negotiation, to be worked through by the parties."

Kurahaupo chairperson, Richard Bradley, said he agreed with the Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations.

"Negotiations have not yet commenced, and it is rather ambitious to be speculating on an amount at this stage."

Mr Bradley said it was pleasing to note that the Minister had acknowledged the grievances of Kurahaupo.
