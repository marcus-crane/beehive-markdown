Judith Tizard the Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister today announced new appointments to the Board of Te Waka Toi, one of two arts boards operating under the Arts Council of Creative New Zealand.

New Board member Darrin Haimona of Waharoa (Tainui) is Chief Executive Officer of Te Hauora O Ngati Haua Trust. He has set up and run a local iwi arts management plan, and has worked on community housing and non-violence networks. Mr Haimona enjoys strong links with Mâori communities in Waikato.

The second new member, Ranui Ngarimu of Christchurch (Ngâi Tahu) is a weaver with a long background of managerial work in the public sector. She specialises in restoring cloaks for Mâori families and has designed and woven pieces for presentation and for use at major ceremonial events. Ms Ngarimu has judged national kapa haka competitions and recently co-authored a book on the art of Mâori weaving.

Both have been appointed for three-year terms from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009.

Sandy Adsett of Hastings, Suzanne Ellison of Karitane and Dr Patu Hohepa of Auckland have been re-appointed for two-year terms from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008.

Mr Adsett (Ngâti Kahungunu) is an acclaimed painter, carver and weaver, costume and stage designer. An influential Mâori art educator, he has been an arts and crafts adviser on national art education policies. He has served on the Historic Places Trust, art museums and tribal committees.

Suzanne Ellison (Ngâi Tahu) is a practising musician, and has taught kapa haka and waiata. A former strategic leader in the Ngai Tahu Development Corporation’s senior management team, she sat on the Christchurch Arts Festival Trust as a trustee and associate trustee, being involved with oversight of the Trust and its financial accountability.

Dr Patu Hohepa (Ngâpuhi) is a prominent orator, genealogist, waiata singer, spokesperson, teacher and writer. His extensive career in linguistics has included a Professorship in the University of Auckland. Dr Hohepa has worked as broadcaster, writer and Mâori language interviewer/frontperson over 30 years.

Welcoming the appointments, Ms Tizard noted that with the recent appointment of the new Chair, Dr Ngahuia Te Awekotuku of Hamilton, the Board would be up to its full membership of seven.

“I am very pleased at the commitment of the appointees and reappointees to serve on the Board. The combination of their wide collective knowledge of Mâori arts communities and the good balance of regional perspective and practitioners’ voices will provide a strong advocacy for Mâori artists and arts organisations,” she said.

Ms Tizard also paid tribute to the contributions of retiring Chair Elizabeth Ellis and retiring member Keri Kaa to the Board and to Mâori arts and culture as a whole. “On behalf of the government I would like to acknowledge their work and long-standing commitment which has been greatly appreciated,” she said.

Te Waka Toi is responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting Mâori arts in Aotearoa through the allocation of funding to Mâori artists, arts organizations, and arts projects.
