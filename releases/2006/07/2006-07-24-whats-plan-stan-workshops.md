Teacher workshops for the new What's the Plan Stan civil defence preparedness resource will be held over the next few weeks, Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today.

"It’s almost twenty years since the last civil defence teaching resource was developed and teachers have been asking for fresh, new material", says Rick Barker

"We've developed What's the Plan Stan with the support of teachers and civil defence staff, and these workshops will ensure that the teachers who will be using the resource are fully familiar with it and gain the maximum possible benefit.

"What's the Plan Stan is a fantastic resource. It uses role-playing, quizzes, an inter-active CDROM, stories and colourful cartoons to deliver messages about how to prepare for and survive tsunami, earthquakes and floods.

"The resource is aimed at involving students in an educational programme that focuses on disasters and emergencies to help them to prepare, and give them the skills to act in a safe manner. Increased student awareness and understanding of the risks may also act as a prompt for their parents and families to be better prepared.

"The response has been great, with over 400 teachers registering for the workshops.

"Local civil defence staff will also be attending the workshops to outline the role they play and discuss ways in which they can support schools, says Rick Barker.

Earlier this year the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management sent complimentary copies of the teaching resource to all primary and intermediate schools throughout New Zealand.
