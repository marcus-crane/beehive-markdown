Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope announced today that the Government had answered the call to relax the red tape around Enhanced Taskforce Green (ETFG) for farmers in South Taranaki, Wanganui, and Rangitikei.

Following a recent tour of rain-affected sites in the region, the Government announced that up to 50 ETFG workers would be made available to assist farmers with jobs like refencing and reinstating farm access.

Federated Farmers cleanup co-ordinator Brian Doughty welcomed the news, but also asked that the ETFG criteria be relaxed so farmers could get quicker access to workers and free up vital cash for repairs.

Mr Benson-Pope said today that the Government was very aware of and sympathetic to farmers' circumstances, and confirmed that ETFG workers did not need to have been registered unemployed or on stand down for 13 weeks.

Cabinet has authorised approval of up to $500,000 for ETFG to assist with clean-up activities resulting from the recent heavy rain across the country.
