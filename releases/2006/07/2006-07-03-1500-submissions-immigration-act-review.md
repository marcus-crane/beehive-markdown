About 1500 individuals and organisations made submissions on the Labour-led government's Immigration Act Review discussion paper, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"A tentative count made after submissions closed on Saturday showed there were more than 300 original submissions," Mr Cunliffe said.

"In addition, 29 identical submissions came from the Fijian community in New Zealand and 1158 identical submissions came from the broader Pacific community."

The review will now move to its next phase – a thorough analysis of the submissions by officials – in the lead up to the drafting of a new Immigration Bill to replace the existing, outdated 1987 statute.

“I have been delighted with how the submission period has gone since the release of the discussion document on April 5," Mr Cunliffe said.

“There were 19 stakeholder meetings nationwide in May and early June, attended by at least 650 people. I thank those who attended, showed an interest and lodged submissions."

After the submissions are analysed, a summary document will be released.  
Copies of submissions will be made available then.

“My aim is to have a bill ready to be introduced to Parliament by April 2007.”

Mr Cunliffe said the draft proposals in the paper represented the most comprehensive review of immigration law in two decades.

"The proposals are not government policy, but the submissions will inform the drafting of the new legislation later this year.

“This review aims to simplify and streamline the law to facilitate the entry of those migrants we want, and to enhance border security and tighten the law against those we don’t want in New Zealand," the minister said.
