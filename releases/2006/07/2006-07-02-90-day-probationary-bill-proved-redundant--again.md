Labour Minister Ruth Dyson welcomes the admission by the Employers and Manufacturers Association that Wayne Mapp's Probationary Period Bill is redundant. She is commenting on the statement from the Employers and Manufacturers Association that the proposed three-month probationary period for new employees would not be mandatory and would not occur unless both employer and employee chose to opt in.

"This admission is a wonderful vote of confidence in this Government's employment law which already allows for probationary periods to be entered into, but does not take away an employee's right to seek mediation or arbitration if they consider themselves unfairly dismissed, as Wayne Mapp's punitive bill would."

"Why do we need Wayne Mapp's Bill to reconfirm what is already provided for in the Employment Relations Act? Perhaps the National Party should spend more effort encouraging employers to use the provisions available to them currently, instead of championing superfluous and redundant legislation."

This vote of confidence coupled with the commendable OECD ranking of 4th place out of 155 countries for ease of employers starting or ending an employment relationship is a good reminder that in New Zealand we have stuck a good balance between fairness in employment relationships whilst ensuring high levels of flexibility in the labour market.

"Again I call on Wayne Mapp to stop wasting Parliament's time and taxpayers money by withdrawing his redundant bill, before he finds himself redundant."
