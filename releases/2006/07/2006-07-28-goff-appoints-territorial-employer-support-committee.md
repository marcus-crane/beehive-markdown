Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced the appointment of nine New Zealanders to be inaugural members of the Territorial Forces Employer Support Committee.

"The committee was established by the Volunteers Employment Protection Act 2004 and aims to increase the effectiveness of New Zealand's territorial military forces by gaining and enhancing the support of employers.

"The committee will consist of a Chair, six regional chairs, a trade union representative, an employer representative, an education / training representative, a local government agency representative and the Director General of Reserve Forces.

"Territorial military personnel work as part time members of the armed forces in addition to holding down full time jobs, other part time jobs or studying. The employer support committee will play a key role in educating employers about the benefits of part time military service to individuals and in turn to employers and also act as a valuable communications channel between employers organisations, communities and the military", said Mr Goff

The following were today appointed to the committee:

·David McGregor as a representative of the Auckland region;  
·Ted Dean as a representative of the Waikato / Tauranga region;  
·Mary Bourke as a representative of the Manawatu / Taranaki / Kapiti region;  
·Raymond Lind as a representative of the Wellington / Hawkes Bay region;  
·Sandra Manderson as a representative of the Christchurch / Upper South Island region;  
·Julian Smith as a representative of the Otago / Southland region;  
·Rodger Kerr-Newell as a representative of Business New Zealand;  
·Lindsay Taiaroa as a representative of the Vice Chancellors association;  
·Tim Brewer as the Director General of Reserve Forces

John Allen was appointed to the position of Chair of the Territorial Forces Employer Support Council in August 2005. Local Government and trade union representatives will be added to the committee in the near future.
