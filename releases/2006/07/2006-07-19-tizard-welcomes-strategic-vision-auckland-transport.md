Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed the launch of a joint central and local government project which aims to achieve a common strategic vision for Auckland transport.

Transport Minister Annette King yesterday released the terms of reference for the Auckland Transport Strategic Alignment Project.

"This is a significant step forward. We now have a process to develop an agreed programme for Auckland transport," says Judith Tizard.

"This Government recognises that Auckland, as our only city of international scale, needs the infrastructure to work well and efficiently."

"Our discussions at the Auckland Mayoral Forums have focused on finding an agreed way forward. This project provides that pathway."

"We all need to work together to resolve Auckland's traffic and public transport issues. And given that central government is expecting to contribute $8 billion to Auckland transport over the next 10 years, we need to agree on the objectives and the work programme."
