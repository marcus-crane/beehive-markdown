A community report which maps social services in Dunedin has been launched today by Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope.

The report identifies four key priorities for Dunedin, as well as strengths and gaps in social services throughout the district.

“The purpose of [Local Services Mapping](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/community-development/local-services-mapping.html) is to build on what’s already happening, to examine how we can do it better,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

Information for the report was gathered from a range of sources including surveys, public meetings and tapping into local networks.

Four ongoing priorities have been identified for attention in Dunedin. They are:

- low income, debt and social exclusion
- reducing the complexity of service provision to families and youth
- creating a stable outlook for people with disabilities and their service providers and caregivers
- managing the impacts of alcohol abuse and other addictions

Other issues were also identified including transport, employment, funding of services, provision of mental health services, care and protection issues, support for families and carers and respite care.

Information has been gathered from a range of sources including local Maori, social and economic statistics, a survey of service providers to families, the Dunedin City Council community plan and interaction with the community and stakeholders.

Strategies will be developed using the information gathered to address gaps in services for Dunedin families.

The Dunedin Community Report is published for the Dunedin community by Family and Community Services, Ministry of Social Development in conjunction with the Dunedin Strengthening Families Local Management Group and the Dunedin City Council.
