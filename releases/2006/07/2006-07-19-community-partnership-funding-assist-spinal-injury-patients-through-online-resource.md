Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban says that a $33,750 grant from the Digital Strategy’s Community Partnership Fund, will assist people recovering from spinal injuries with their rehabilitation.

The Community Partnership Fund supports national, regional, and community Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives. The New Zealand Spinal Trust was one of over 50 successful applicants throughout New Zealand.

The New Zealand Spinal Trust will use the grant to turn a handbook for spinal injury patients entitled 'Back on Track', into an interactive, online educational curriculum about spinal injury. Luamanuvao Winnie Laban visited the Trust in Christchurch today to congratulate them on their successful application.

"This project represents the essence of the Community Partnership Fund - developing exciting new initiatives where communities, business and government work together to realise community aspirations through innovative use of ICT," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"By using ICT to unlock content, all New Zealanders, including those recovering from spinal injuries, can freely and easily access knowledge, information and services about a wide range of topics important to them.”

The New Zealand Spinal Trust was formed in 1994 to address the unmet needs of rehabilitation, information, research, advocacy and support for people with spinal cord injuries throughout New Zealand.

This charitable trust works in collaboration with a number of different agencies and organisations throughout New Zealand to provide the resources required for people to take control of their own rehabilitation and therefore their lives.

Back on Track was developed as a ‘course curriculum’ for spinal patients in early rehabilitation by the New Zealand Spinal Trust and the Burwood Spinal Unit and officially launched in March 2005.
