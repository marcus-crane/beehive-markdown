Trade Minister Phil Goff welcomed the announcement today of retiring cabinet minister Jim Sutton's appointment as Trade Ambassador.

"Over the next two years, New Zealand will be involved in an intensified level of bilateral and regional trade negotiations and trade missions.

"Jim has over many years accumulated deep knowledge and a good reputation in international trade and agricultural policy.

"During his term as Minister for Trade Negotiations, he has developed an extensive network of high level international contacts.

"That makes him an ideal choice to assist at official and political levels in promoting liberalisation of trade between New Zealand and key trading partners. He will also be available to lead trade missions when I am not available.

"Jim's role will complement neatly at an official and political level the work of our Special Agricultural Trade Envoy, Alistair Polson, who I reappointed today for a further term.

"Alistair will continue to focus on agriculture, meeting farm, consumer and other non-governmental groups.

"Both are well suited to their jobs and will be remunerated on a similar basis. Mr Sutton will be paid for the number of days worked up to a maximum of $40,000 per annum.

"Jim is a well respected in trade and agricultural circles and I believe that retaining his skills and contribution to promoting New Zealand in this way will be widely supported", Phil Goff said.
