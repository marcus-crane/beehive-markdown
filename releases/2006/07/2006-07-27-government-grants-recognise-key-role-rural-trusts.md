Two rural trusts in the lower North Island are to receive government grants recognising their ongoing support of rural families, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

The Manawatu/Rangitikei Family Support Trust is to receive $30,000 and the East Coast Rural Support Trust $20,000, Mr Anderton said. The extra assistance will bolster the trusts' support to families affected by extreme weather events in July.

"The money will help the worst-affected farmers and their families in South Taranaki, Wanganui, Rangitikei and southern Wairarapa get their lives back on track.

"The trusts will allocate the money to those who need it most. As local organisations closely involved in their respective communities, they are in an ideal position to monitor developments and use the money accordingly."

Mr O'Connor said the grants are recognition from the government that rural trusts play a vital role in supporting rural families, particularly during adverse events.

"While this month's damage is not nearly as widespread as in 2004, some families have been hit harder this time around.

"The hardest hit are under significant pressure. The support and contributions of rural trusts, of even a few hundred dollars, can make all the difference to families in situations like this, both financially and psychologically."

The Government has already announced the availability of Enhanced Taskforce Green workers to assist affected farmers, Mr O'Connor said.
