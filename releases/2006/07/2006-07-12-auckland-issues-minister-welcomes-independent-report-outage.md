The independent report on last month's power outage in Auckland has been welcomed by Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

The report by Connell Wagner has been considered by Cabinet on Monday and released to the public by Energy Minister David Parker.

Judith Tizard says, "It's a useful report. It confirms that more could have been done to ensure security of supply into Auckland. It makes specific short term recommendations to reduce the risk of further outages at Otahuhu which the Energy Minister has also released.

"The report also helps chart a way forward. We’re also taking a longer term view and considering options to diversity Auckland's electricity supply."
