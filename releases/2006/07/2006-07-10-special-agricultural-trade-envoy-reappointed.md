Trade Minister Phil Goff today announced that New Zealand's Special Agricultural Trade Envoy Alistair Polson will be reappointed to the position for a further year.

"We are entering a period of increased activity in the trade arena on both the multi-lateral and bi-lateral trade fronts, the special envoy will have a valuable role to play in what will be a significant year for New Zealand agricultural trade.

"Alistair Polson has played a key role in representing New Zealand's agricultural trade interests to the world and his expertise will be invaluable to the sector in the year ahead, " said Phil Goff.

The position of Special Agricultural Trade Envoy was established in 1999 with the objectives of promoting and defending New Zealand's agricultural trading interests overseas with the non-governmental sector.

A farmer from Wanganui, Alistair Polson was appointed to the role in July 2005 and brings extensive experience both as a member of the agricultural sector and from time spent on the boards of leading agricultural sector organisations like Federated Farmers, Wool Equities and the New Zealand Veterinary Council.
