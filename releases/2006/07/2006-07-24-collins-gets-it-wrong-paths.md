Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope has corrected National MP Judith Collins' "grossly inaccurate" claims about the PATHS programme for Sickness and Invalid's Benefit clients.

"Mrs Collins knows from the Parliamentary Answer provided to her last week that 20% of the people who've started PATHS (Providing Access to Health Solutions) have moved off benefit altogether, while an additional 12% have reported earnings. For her to say 'just 0.1% of participants rejoin the workforce', as she did at the weekend, is grossly inaccurate".

"Thanks to PATHS, 235 New Zealanders are either no longer wholly reliant on benefit, or have moved off altogether", Mr Benson-Pope said. "That can't possibly be a bad thing.

"Every work placement means increased opportunity and better living standards over a person's lifetime, along with a stronger contribution to New Zealand's economy. If helping people into work is not good value for money, perhaps Mrs Collins could explain what is", Mr Benson-Pope said.

"If Mrs Collins is genuinely interested in the success of PATHS, she should talk to the young man with a back injury, who is now back at work after three years on the Sickness Benefit; the social worker who was back on the job just 11 weeks after being referred to PATHS; or the man who spent two years on Sickness Benefit with stress and depression, but is now working full time because he got the support he needed".

Mr Benson-Pope said PATHS was just one part of a much bigger programme of specialised, targeted support to help people with ill health or a disability return to the workforce. "We're providing employment support to a complex group with sometimes high needs – a group that received no assistance whatsoever under National. PATHS is a success for Sickness and Invalids Benefit clients, for the Government, and for the taxpayer", Mr Benson-Pope said.
