Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that families and mid-life and older New Zealanders will benefit from a series of new initiatives which come into effect on 1 July.

§Primary health subsidies are being extended to the 45 to 64 age group, meaning cheaper doctor visits and prescription charges are now available to all New Zealanders aged 45 plus and under 25 who are enrolled with a Primary Health Organisation.

§The government is increasing the maximum annual rates rebate from $200 to $500 and widening the eligibility for assistance to more households on low and modest incomes. For example, a single superannuitant on an income of $16,645, with rates of $1,000 or more will be eligible for the full rebate of $500.

§All superannuitants with a spouse or partner in long-term residential care will be eligible to be paid the single, living alone rate of New Zealand Super. This is an increase of up to $59 a week – or over $3000 a year - for those superannuitants living alone whose partners are not in unsubsidised care, and who have been paid at a lower rate.

§The next stage in the phase out of income and asset testing for people in aged residential care comes into effect on 1 July. Single people and couples with both partners in care will be able to keep up to $160,000 - up from $150,000 currently - in assets before they are used to contribute to the cost of their care. The exemption thresholds will increase by $10,000 each year, progressively removing asset testing.

§The removal of the ‘sharing expenses rule’ takes effect. In the past, this rule has prevented some single superannuitants from receiving the Living Alone payment if their families are helping with household expenses, such as rates. The government is also extending the period of time during which a person can continue to receive superannuation while they are working voluntarily for an aid agency overseas, from one to three years.

§Self-employed parents will be eligible for 14 weeks paid parental leave from 1 July this year, bringing greater flexibility and equity to the workplace and additional support for working parents. Paid parental leave for employees has been available since 2002, and will now be extended to a range of self-employed people, including farming families. The rate will also increase from a maximum of $357.30 (before tax) to $372.12 per week.

§Early childhood education centres will get a big boost to their funding rates from 1 July to enable them to employ more qualified teachers. The government is investing $30 million over the next four years as part of a drive to lift quality in early childhood teaching

"The measures taking effect from July 1 will give greater security to families, young and old," said Helen Clark.

“These are all measures which come into force because our Labour-led government believes in investing in opportunity and security for New Zealand families.

“Over the past six-and-a-half years, we have been prepared to invest back into services and support for families, young and old, as the economy has grown. We believe that the rising tide should lift every boat. Our 1 July initiatives are a practical demonstration of our philosophy in action," Helen Clark said.
