Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Hon Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of three new members to the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand.

The first new member, Kate De Goldi of Wellington, is an author and radio broadcaster. She has received several awards for her writing and was named an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate for 2001.

The second, Michael Prentice of Auckland, has extensive managerial and commercial skills. He chaired the Black Grace Trust for six years and is also Director of the Aotea Board of Management, The Edge, and a Trustee of the Auckland Opera Studio.

The third new member, Pele Walker of Wellington, will chair the Pacific Committee. Pele has a senior role at LEADR NZ, a non-profit membership organization set up to promote and develop mediation skills. She also brings knowledge of professional and community arts, cultural diversity and events management skills.

All three have been appointed to the Board for three-year terms from 1 July this year to 30 June 2009.

The Minister expressed her confidence in the new appointments.

“The impressive range of skills and experience of these new members will compensate for the retirement of three longstanding members of the Board, Marilyn Kohlhase, Helen Schamroth and Dr Lydia Wevers. I am confident that Creative New Zealand will be well served by these appointments.”

"On behalf of the government I would like to acknowledge and thank the outgoing Board members for their enormous contribution and commitment."

The Arts Board of Creative New Zealand promotes and supports the arts of all New Zealanders by developing art-form policy, allocating grants and carrying out initiatives that support the strategic direction set by the Arts Council.
