The extension of affordable primary health care to the 45-64 age group was the most successful phase of the Primary Health Care Strategy rollout to date with nearly 100 per cent of general practices on board by 1 July, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

The quick success means that over 690,000 New Zealanders in the age group will now have significantly lower fees the next time they see their family doctor or practice nurse. For the vast majority, the reduction will be $27 – the full amount of the government subsidy.

"The Labour-led government has invested heavily in making affordable health care a reality for all New Zealand families," Pete Hodgson said.

"The rollout of affordable doctors visits and prescription medicines to the 45-64 age group was not an easy process as it was important for everyone involved to make sure we got it right.

"We concluded the negotiations in time, but the real test was always going to be how many practices would be able to get on board for 1 July. Practices needed to quickly demonstrate that they met the new requirements negotiated by district health boards and primary health organisations.

"To see 750 practices come on board so quickly is testament to their commitment to the patients they serve and to the Primary Health Care Strategy."

All but three general practices in New Zealand have now met the requirements to obtain funding for the 45-64 year old rollout.

In previous years up to 20 per cent of practices were not eligible for funding by the 1 July start date.

With the full success of this year's rollout now clear, Pete Hodgson again called on the National Party to clarify their position of the future of the PHCS. National is currently on the record as opposing affordable health care for 25-64 year olds – a position that would save them over $500 million for their tax cut policy.

"Tony Ryall and the National Party had a lot to say about this year's rollout when they thought it might fail, but have said nothing since an agreement was reached three weeks ago. 700,000 45-64 year olds are now receiving cheaper doctors' visits and medicines – they have a right to know if National supports raising their fees."
