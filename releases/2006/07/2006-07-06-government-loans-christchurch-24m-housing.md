Housing New Zealand is to loan the Christchurch City Council $2.4million to build 20 new social housing units in Richmond for elderly and low-income people, Housing Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"This suspensory loan is another example of the Labour-Progressive Government's emphasis on forming partnerships with local government to deliver vital community infrastructure. We've done it for roads, drinking water, sewerage systems, and in this case, social housing.

"Christchurch has a long history of looking after its needy and homeless. It was the first local authority in New Zealand to provide social housing some 65 years ago, and that tradition is continuing today."

The council is to construct 20 new social housing units on council-owned land at Gowerton Place in Richmond at a cost of $4.8million. Half of the project will be paid for by the council, and half by a suspensory loan from Housing New Zealand's Housing Innovation Fund.

"The idea of the Housing Innovation Fund is to help councils, charitable trusts and community organisations all over the country get involved in providing social housing for the first time, continue their involvement or expand what they do," Mr Carter said.

"Many organisations already own land on which they could put new social housing, like the Christchurch City Council, or have funds that they want to put towards social housing projects. They just need a little assistance to get their projects up and running.

"The government is providing this assistance. We are seeking to combine state and community resources. This enhances the pool of social housing in New Zealand in the most cost-effective manner," Mr Carter said.

The loan for the Gowerton Place project is the second from the Housing Innovation Fund for projects in Christchurch. Comcare Charitable Trust has received a $1.5million loan for the construction of 12 one-bedroom units on three sites, which will be made available to people with a mental illness.
