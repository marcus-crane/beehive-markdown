Telecommunications Commissioner Douglas Webb has advised he will not be seeking reappointment when his current term expires in March 2007, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"I express my thanks and that of the government for the hard work he has done since 2002," Mr Cunliffe said.

The position of telecommunications commissioner was created under the 2001 Telecommunications Act.

"As the first commissioner, Mr Webb has had the additional and difficult jobs of defining the commissioner role, developing regulatory processes, building relationships and setting sector expectations – and I’m sure the industry would concur that he has done an excellent job in this regard.

"Mr Webb has indicated that he intends to see out his full term and I will be using the period between now and March 2007 to search for a replacement so that there is an orderly transition," the minister said

The search for a replacement will follow the process laid down in the State Services Commission appointment and induction guidelines.

The current Telecommunications Act amendments do not predicate or envisage any changes to the position description or role of the commissioner.

A decision has yet to be made on the details of the appointment process.
