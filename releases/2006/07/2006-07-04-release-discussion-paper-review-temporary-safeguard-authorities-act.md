Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced a review of the Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987, and has released a discussion document which details a range of proposals to improve the operation of the Act.

The Act provides for inquiries to be carried out by Temporary Safeguard Authorities into sudden increases in imported goods and for recommendations to be made to the Minister of Commerce about urgent temporary safeguard measures to be taken, normally in the form of an increase in import duty, to allow an industry to adjust to increased competition from imports.

"The proposals are designed to clarify ambiguities in the Act, bring New Zealand into line with the past decade of World Trade Organisation decisions, and to provide a more efficient and objective process for carrying out investigations and imposing safeguard remedies", said Lianne Dalziel

“The review will ensure that New Zealand’s safeguard regime is fully effective and I encourage people with an interest in the issue to make a submission", Lianne Dalziel said.

The closing date for submissions on the discussion paper is 4 September 2006.

Copies of the discussion paper can be downloaded from the Ministry of Economic Development website [www.med.govt.nz.](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____20591.aspx)
