Prime Minister Helen Clark today invited New Zealand war veterans to enter a ballot to select 32 veterans to attend the opening of the New Zealand Memorial in London.

The successful applicants will travel to London for the official dedication of the [New Zealand Memorial](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F24653) at Hyde Park Corner on Armistice Day, 11 November.

To be eligible for the ballot, veterans need to have enlisted as a member of the New Zealand Armed Forces and served in:

- World War Two with either New Zealand or British forces
- The British Commonwealth Occupation Force of Japan (2 NZEF Japan, J Force)
- Korea (K Force)
- The Malayan Emergency, Indonesian Confrontation or Thai/Malay Border campaigns.

Helen Clark said New Zealand and British forces participated in these campaigns together.

"It is fitting that a large contingent of veterans will be present for the ceremony at Hyde Park Corner. The London memorial will symbolise the contribution and sacrifice made by New Zealand during armed conflicts alongside the United Kingdom.

"We need to keep acknowledging the courage, determination, and loyalty of New Zealanders who served in, and supported that effort, as well as the accompanying grief, loss and suffering which New Zealand experienced.”

“The memorial is expected to become a particular focus for ANZAC Day commemorations in London each year," Helen Clark said.

Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand will make the selection after the ballot closes on Friday, 25 August.
