Judith Tizard Associate Arts Culture & Heritage Minister today expressed her condolences on the death of Dr John Money, the New Zealand-born philanthropist.

Dr Money, a Professor of medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University, died in Baltimore (USA) on Friday aged 85.

"John Money was one of our early philanthropists - he passionately supported the literary and visual arts both here and internationally," said Judith Tizard.

"He will best be remembered in New Zealand as a close friend and an early and instrumental supporter of Janet Frame.

"Money will also be warmly remembered for gifting his world-class art collection to the Eastern Southland Gallery in Gore, which attracts national and international visitors."

The Prime Minister Helen Clark opened the John Money Wing in 2003 which was made possible by Money's generous bequest. The collection includes Australian Aboriginal, African, and indigenous and contemporary American works, along with works by significant New Zealand artists, such as Rita Angus and Theo Schoon.
