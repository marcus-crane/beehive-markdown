Prime Minister Helen Clark today released the report of Mr Ingram QC into matters relating to Taito Phillip Field.

Mr Ingram was asked to enquire into whether any conflict existed between Mr Field's duties as a minister and his private interests.

"Mr Ingram has concluded that there was not such a conflict of interest. He reports that Mr Field was at all times co-operative with the inquiry.

"The inquiry has been time consuming and expensive. Its total cost amounts to $479,236 over nine-and-a-half months. Mr Ingram addresses the issue of the time the inquiry has taken in his report.

"Apart from the original allegations levelled at Mr Field, four separate allegations were made and each was referred to the inquiry. Inquiries had to be made in New Zealand and Samoa, and not all intended witnesses agreed to participate. Inevitably when full public inquiries of this kind are undertaken in such conditions, they will be both time consuming and expensive.

"While the report does not find wrongdoing by Mr Field, it does imply errors of judgment. The Labour Party leadership and parliamentary whips will be working with Mr Field on the issues raised, in particular on the need for a Member of Parliament to keep personal and professional distance from those being advocated for and on the adverse perception which may attach to the practice of lafo when gifts are received," Helen Clark said.

The full report of Mr Ingram has been released. On legal advice, some individuals have been identified in the report by their surname initial only, in order to protect their privacy interests and because there is no countervailing public interest in revealing their identity.
