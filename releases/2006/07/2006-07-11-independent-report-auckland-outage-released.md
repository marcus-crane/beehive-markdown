Energy Minister David Parker today released the [independent report on the Auckland outage](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____20815.aspx) by Connell Wagner.

He said the report, considered by Cabinet yesterday, provided a useful outside perspective on the matter, and he had referred the report to Transpower for its consideration.

"The report shows that more could have been done to ensure security of supply. The report makes four specific recommendations for short-term remedial work to reduce the risk of outages at Otahuhu, which are summarised in a [letter from me to Transpower](/parker/parker-letter-transpower070706.pdf) (PDF 10KB), which I am also releasing today."

Mr Parker said the Government was also considering options for the diversification of supply of electricity into Auckland.
