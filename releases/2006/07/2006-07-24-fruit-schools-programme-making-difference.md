Results from an interim evaluation of the Labour-led government’s Fruit in Schools programme are very promising, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

[Fruit in Schools](http://www.moh.govt.nz/fruitinschools) was launched last year as part of the wider [Health Promoting Schools initiative](http://www.hps.org.nz/mdl/). Schools taking part receive free fruit for three years as an incentive for schools to commit to policies encouraging healthy eating and physical activity.

"Developing good attitudes at an early age is one of the most powerful tools we can give our young people," Pete Hodgson

“While it’s early days, there are signs that Fruit in Schools is having a positive impact on children," Pete Hodgson said.

"Participating schools report students are showing a more positive attitude to healthy food and are being more physically active.

"Everyone involved in this programme gets my thanks."

According to the evaluation, the programme had an 85 per cent support rate from students and a 70 per cent support rate from staff. Around two thirds of schools reported medium to high effects on learning outcomes. The quality of the fruit was rated high or very high by the vast majority of schools.

“FIS is one of the primary prevention initiatives earmarked in the government’s [Cancer Control Strategy](http://www.moh.govt.nz/cancercontrol). The strategy identifies four health promotion areas – physical activity, food and nutrition, sun protection and smoke free as key areas to focus on in the prevention of cancer in the New Zealand population."

So far around 27,000 children in 114 low decile schools are taking part in the programme. The survey was conducted by an external organisation during school term 4 of 2005 and involved 27 first phase schools.
