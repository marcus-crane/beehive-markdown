Cabinet has approved a proposal to allow research or experiments on patented inventions to occur without the risk of patent infringement the Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

“The proposed experimental use exception will work towards reducing the uncertainty around whether or not research or experiments involving patented inventions is patent infringement in New Zealand,” Judith Tizard said.

The Ministry of Economic Development’s options paper, An Experimental Use Exception for New Zealand’s Patent Legislation was released in February 2006. Public submissions on the paper suggested legal uncertainty around patent infringement discourages some researchers from working in areas possibly covered by patents.

Judith Tizard said this could inhibit innovation in New Zealand, contrary to the aims of the patent system.

“The proposed exception is based on a recommendation made by the Australian Advisory Council on Intellectual Property, which has been considering the same issues. The exception will make sure research done for experimental purposes will not infringe a patent, as long as it does not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of a patent.

“The provision of an experimental use exception is a reflection of the government’s commitment to furthering economic growth through encouraging innovation.”

The proposed exception will be included in the draft Patents Bill which is expected to be introduced to Parliament later this year.
