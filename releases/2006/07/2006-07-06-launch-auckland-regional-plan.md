A regional plan focused on how to further create employment and build strong families and communities was launched in Auckland this morning by Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope.

“The work that the Ministry of Social Development is doing in the Auckland region is making a real difference to people and communities in the region,” said Mr Benson-Pope at the launch of the [Auckland Regional Plan](http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/publications/msd/regional-plans/auckland.doc) today.

[The Ministry of Social Development’s 2006/07 Regional Plans](http://www.msd.govt.nz/publications/regional-plans/index.html) explain how the Ministry intends to continue and further extend the work being done in regions. They acknowledge key priorities and outline the Ministry’s response to the individual needs, challenges and opportunities for the region.

There are three overarching themes that helped form the basis for the Regional Plans: economic transformation; national identity; and families – young and old.

“The 2006/07 Regional Plans put these themes into action. They set out how the Ministry will lead social development to create employment, build strong families and communities, and support New Zealanders of every age to achieve their potential,” Minister Benson-Pope said.

“Great things are happening in the Auckland region. Work is being done with local councils and other agencies to establish labour market opportunities in the region, and programmes like Industry Partnerships, Youth Transition Services, and seasonal co-ordination are all supporting the new work-focused approach that aims to get people into the right job right from the start.

“Programmes like Strategies with Kids Information for Parents and Family Start are supporting our families to be safe and strong and to look after all their members, and Working for Families is delivering financial assistance that makes it easier to work than to be on a benefit.”

Regional Commissioner for Social Development Isabel Evans said: "Our Regional Plan sets out our key priorities and responses to the needs, challenges and opportunities for the Auckland region. The heart of our key priorities for Auckland is about people, families, communities and working together.”

The Regional Plans draw together all the activities of all the Ministry’s business units. They are a whole-of-Ministry approach and look at the work being done by Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Benefit Integrity, and Senior Services.
