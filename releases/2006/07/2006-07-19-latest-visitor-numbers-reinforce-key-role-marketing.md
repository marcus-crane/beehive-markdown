A drop in visitor numbers this winter serves as a reminder of how crucial it is for Tourism New Zealand's overseas marketing campaign to hit its mark, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Short-term overseas visitor arrivals in June 2006 numbered 139,900, down 11 per cent on the same month last year, figures released today show. The June 2006 total was up 4 percent on June 2004 figures.

Mr O'Connor said the drop was predictable in that last year's total received a significant boost from visiting British Lions supporters.

But at the same time the fluctuation shows how important it is to constantly review and update the way New Zealand is marketed in all its key markets, he said.

"We're a small country with limited resources, so we have to make sure we get every cent's worth of value from our marketing budget.

"Our 100% Pure campaign has proven itself over and over again. But we need to be spot on every time in the way we apply it to ensure we get the best bang for our marketing buck."

Mr O'Connor said the challenge for the tourism sector was to constantly search for smarter ways to attract high-value visitors to New Zealand.

"The market never stands still and neither should we. I am confident we can rise to the challenge before us.

Mr O'Connor said the recent drop in the New Zealand dollar would lift the confidence of tourism operators.
