Foreign Minister Winston Peters has condemned the terrorist attacks on commuter trains in Mumbai, India, this morning as a coordinated act of cowardice.

Seven bombs killed more than 160 people and wounded hundreds in packed commuter trains and stations during rush hour. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, although suspicion has fallen on Kashmiri separatists who have mounted similar attacks in the past.

“New Zealand joins with the rest of the international community in utterly condemning this deplorable act of terrorism," Mr Peters said.

"No grievance can justify such a cowardly attack. The blasts were clearly coordinated in order to cause as many deaths and injuries as possible to innocent people," Mr Peters said.

“Our thoughts at this time are with the victims and families of all those affected – including those members of the Indian community in New Zealand who may have links with those who may have been killed or injured in the blasts.

"We can only hope that the Indian authorities will be able to quickly identify those responsible and hold them to account."

Mr Peters said it was too early to say if any New Zealanders had been caught in the blasts. However New Zealand’s Honorary Consul in Mumbai and staff from the High Commission in New Delhi were continuing to work closely with Indian officials to clarify the situation.
