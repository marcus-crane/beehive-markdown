"We are yet officially to receive a copy of the Massey University research into the Genetic Damage of New Zealand Vietnam war veterans.

"The government is open to new information and analysis which gives us insight into health effects of being exposed to a toxic environment in Vietnam.

"We welcome further work which adds to our knowledge of the effects of agent orange and adds to the international research we are currently relying on.

"We have in front of us the report of the Joint Working Group on the concerns of Vietnam veterans and over the past 10 weeks have been analysing and costing the recommendations of that report.

"We will be discussing those recommendations shortly with the Joint Working Group. It is important to ensure that the government is well informed about evolving research and analysis. It is likely to be a decision arising from the Joint Working Group report that the government remains open to responding to new evidence and information as it becomes available.

"The government's formal response to the Joint Working Group will be determined and announced following further discussion with the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association, the Ex-Vietnam Services Association and the chair of the Joint Working Group", said Phil Goff.
