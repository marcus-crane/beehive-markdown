Trade Minister Phil Goff today welcomed the formal notification by the European Commission that New Zealand butter currently in transit to Europe or held in bonded warehouses awaiting import licenses will be able to be sold.

"The Commission have formally advised New Zealand that 14,000 tonnes of butter will not be subject to any action that may prohibit it from being sold.

"New Zealand officials will work with the European Commission in the development of new regulations that meet the letter and the spirit of trade agreement reached mutually in 1995 under WTO conditions and binding on both parties", Mr Goff said.
