Foreign Minister Winston Peters will meet his Australian counterpart, Alexander Downer, in Adelaide on Saturday for the latest round of regular six-monthly consultations.

“The relationship between New Zealand and Australia is as close a relationship as can be found anywhere in the world,” said Mr Peters.

“These regular consultations are an important opportunity to survey and discuss key aspects of the bilateral relationship, as well as exchange views on regional and global issues of concern to both our countries.

“We will cover a wide range of issues this weekend, including our ongoing efforts to support good governance and stability in the region, particularly in the Solomon Islands and Timor Leste. Other topics on the agenda will be New Zealand and Australia's deepening engagement with Asia, and developments in security and counter terrorism,” said Mr Peters.

The Foreign Ministers’ consultations have been an established feature of the government-to-government relationship for over 15 years.

The venue alternates between the two countries, with Mr Peters hosting the last meeting in Wellington in February.
