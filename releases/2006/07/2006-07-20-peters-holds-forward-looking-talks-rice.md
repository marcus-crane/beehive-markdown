The bilateral relationship and a wide range of pressing international issues were discussed when Foreign Minister Winston Peters met United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington this afternoon.

“Clearly events in the Middle East were uppermost in the Secretary’s mind, but we also talked at some length about our bilateral relationship," Mr Peters said.

"I took the opportunity to underline to the Secretary my personal commitment to doing everything I can to strengthen links with the US.

"New Zealand's friendship with the United States goes back many years, and we have so much in common given our shared histories and values.

"The Secretary and I discussed opportunities to deepen the bilateral relationship further, including around the upcoming 50th anniversary of US/NZ cooperation in Antarctica.

Mr Peters said they had also talked about the many areas of cooperation between the US and New Zealand around the world.

“We obviously have a shared interest in promoting stability and prosperity in places such as Afghanistan, and in the broader Asia-Pacific region. We weIcomed the strong international reaction to North Korea’s missile tests. The Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last weekend will have sent a strong message.

"I also took the opportunity to update the Secretary on the range of challenges currently facing the South Pacific, and encouraged the US to continue its engagement in the region.

“The Secretary and I agreed that we want a forward-looking relationship and committed ourselves to strengthening that relationship.

"The objectives set for this visit have been met. I look forward to continuing my dialogue with the Secretary at upcoming international meetings,” Mr Peters said.
