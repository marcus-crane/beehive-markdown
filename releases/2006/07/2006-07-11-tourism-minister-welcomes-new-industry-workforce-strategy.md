Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor launched today in Wellington a workforce strategy that aims to meet head-on the challenge of overcoming future skill shortages in the industry.

The launch immediately followed a meeting of the Ministerial Advisory Group on Tourism, which is in the process of updating the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

Research shows that the tourism industry needs to employ 100,000 more people to maintain and grow the sector to the year 2010. The Tourism and Hospitality Workforce Strategy acknowledges this and provides a blueprint of ways to attract and retain more staff, Mr O'Connor said.

The workforce strategy document, which is the result of work over more than a year by industry associations, industry training organisations and government agencies, would act as a springboard, Mr O'Connor said.

"This strategy is a very encouraging initiative and demonstrates how the business sector and the government can work together to combat real issues facing our country.

"We are a small country competing in a global market, so to continue to do as well as we have it is essential for us to fully cooperate to overcome issues as they arise.

"A skill shortages squeezes growth and impacts on the industry’s ability to ensure a consistently high quality experience to visitors."

Tourism is a $17.2 billion tourism industry in New Zealand and directly and indirectly supports 172,000 full-time equivalent jobs.

The Labour-led Government is also boosting industry skills development through its very successful Modern Apprenticeships and Industry Training programmes, Mr O'Connor said.
