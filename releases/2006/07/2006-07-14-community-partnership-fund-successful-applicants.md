Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today announced the successful applicants to the new contestable Community Partnership Fund.

The Community Partnership Fund is part of the Labour-led Government's Digital Strategy – an initiative for all New Zealanders to have the opportunity to acquire the necessary Information and Technology connections, skills and knowledge to participate fully in an information-empowered society.

The fund aims to improve access to information and improve people’s confidence in using ICT, and 55 applications were approved for total funding of over $6.5 million.

"This Labour-led Government encourages the increased use of ICT – in fact we see the expanded use of digital technologies as vital to our economic transformation agenda," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

“The Community Partnership Fund will allow some exciting new initiatives to be developed which will have community, Government, business, and local government working together to realise community aspirations through ICT.

"Digital literacy is an essential life skill, akin to reading and writing, and more often than not a significant factor that allows us to take part in the fullness of community life.

“As well as having a wide range of applications covering a variety of projects it is pleasing to see that we have a wide geographic spread as well. The interest from communities has been outstanding and it is great to see that so many of these projects will have practical applications across our communities nationwide,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

The successful applications fall into three broad groups:

- Connection – using ICT in communities to meet community needs and skills
- Content – digitise and link relevant content for New Zealanders to access
- Confidence – to improve and build ICT capability and skills across the community.
