Five Broadband Challenge rural and under-served applicants have been approved and invited to finalise a funding agreement for their projects, Communications Minister David Cunliffe says.

The five applicants are in the "rural and under-served community category" of the [Broadband Challenge](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____14.aspx). Six applicants for the urban-focussed category have been given a further period to refine their proposals.

“I have been impressed by the level of interest and willingness of local communities to invest in partnership with the government, to help meet their own broadband needs.” Mr Cunliffe said.

The [$24 million](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23040) Broadband Challenge aims to provide seed funding to improve the availability and quality of broadband internet access. It aims to establish up to 15 urban fibre networks by 2009, and to develop broadband internet access solutions for rural and poorly served communities.

It is a key part of the Labour-led government's Digital Strategy and drive to transform the New Zealand economy.

Of the total amount, $1.4 million (GST exclusive) is set aside in Year One under the “Probe Extension” fund specifically for rural or under-served communities. This portion of the Broadband Challenge builds on the successful work in the government’s earlier partnership investment in broadband through Project Probe.

The five applicants approved and invited to finalise a funding agreement are:

- Tuhoe Education Authority ($500,000),
- Waikato 2020 Communications Trust ($47,000),
- Waitakere City Council (granted $175,000),
- WIKarekare Trust in West Auckland ($5000), and
- West Coast Development Trust ($600,000).

A sixth applicant, Tangimoana 2020 Communications Trust, was unsuccessful in this round.

The steering group has written to the six applicants in the urban category seeking further information. Those applicants have until 10 August 2006 to respond. The further information will be considered alongside the existing documentation before decisions are made.
