Associate Minister of Social Development and Employment, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, today launched the 2006/07 Wellington Regional Plans for the Ministry of Social Development.

“The work that the Ministry of Social Development is doing in the Wellington region is making a real difference to our people and our communities,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

The plans explain how the Ministry intends to continue and further extend the work being done in the regions. There are three overarching themes that help form the basis for the Regional Plans: economic transformation; national identity; and families – young and old.

“The 2006/07 Regional Plans put these themes into action. They set out how the Ministry will lead social development to create employment, build strong families and communities, and support New Zealanders of every age to achieve their potential,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

“Great things are happening in the Wellington region. Work is being undertaken with local councils and other agencies to establish labour market opportunities in the region, and programmes like Industry Partnerships, Youth Transition Services, and seasonal co-ordination are all supporting the new work-focused approach that aims to get people into the right job right from the start.

“Programmes like Strategies with Kids Information for Parents and Family Start are supporting our families to be safe and strong and to look after all their members, and Working for Families is delivering financial assistance that makes it easier to work than to be on a benefit,” said Luamanuvao Winne Laban.

Regional Commissioner for Social Development and Employment, Mike Bryant said that the Ministry’s plan for Wellington identifies six key issues: families and communities; empowering young people; supporting sole parents; assisting more Maori and Pacific Peoples into work opportunities; building on past success with migrant populations; and working closely with clients receiving a Sickness or Invalid’s benefit.

The Regional Plans draw together all the activities of all the Ministry’s business units. They are a whole-of-Ministry approach and look at the work being done by Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Benefit Integrity, and Senior Services.
