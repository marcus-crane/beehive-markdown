Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced details for the state farewell for Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright when she completes her term of office on Wednesday.

Dame Silvia's motorcade will arrive at Parliament from Government House at 11.30 am.

The 100-person tri-service guard of honour will comprise elements from HMNZS Philomel, RNZAF Base Ohakea, and the Royal New Zealand Army Logistics Regiment.

The central band of the Royal New Zealand Air Force will also be in attendance and the 16 Field Regiment from Linton will fire a 21-gun salute.

As the karanga commences, Dame Silvia and Peter Cartwright will be met by Mr John Tahuparae, kaumatua to Parliament and Te Atiawa.

Four taiaha warriors will flank the welcoming party.

The Maori leaders escort Dame Silvia and Peter Cartwright to be welcomed by the Prime Minister and the Speaker, after which Dame Silvia will take the Royal Salute and inspect the guard of honour. The official party then enter Parliament Buildings by the main steps and proceed to the Grand Hall before entering the Beehive banquet hall for the State Luncheon, where Dame Silvia will deliver her farewell address.

The Governor-General-designate, Judge Anand Satyanand will be sworn in at Parliament on 23 August. The Chief Justice, Dame Sian Elias, will act as Administrator of the Government in the interregnum.
