New Zealand has significantly increased the number of Working Holiday visas for young Americans, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Up to 5000 United States citizens aged between 18 and 30 will be able to gain the visas in 2006-07 – an increase of 4000 on 2005-06.

Mr Peters said the visas were a great opportunity for young Americans to work and holiday in New Zealand for up to 12 months.

“The increase in the quota reflects the strengthening of the relationship between the United States and New Zealand, and the fact that the scheme has been so successful since it began in 2004, that it has been over subscribed every year," Mr Peters said.

“Working Holiday visas allow young Americans to gain valuable experience in a different country while sampling all that New Zealand has a lot to offer – great natural beauty, friendly people, an engaging culture, a lively arts scene and a wide variety of outdoor pursuits and extreme sports.

"For New Zealand, the program offers the opportunity to augment our workforce with skills we need, and to broaden our experience through working relationships with talented people from the United States.

"Many Americans now consider working abroad to be a good career move that can provide a professional boost. An increasing number of US colleges and universities are encouraging international experience, and many employers value it as well," Mr Peters said.
