The Government and Auckland political leaders have launched a project aimed at achieving a common strategic vision for Auckland transport.

Transport Minister Annette King, releasing the terms of reference for the Auckland Transport Strategic Alignment Project, says she wants the project to develop a common Crown and regional vision for transport in the region.

“There is currently no systematic joint central/local government long-term transport planning in Auckland. Central government is expecting to contribute $8 billion to Auckland transport over the next 10 years, and before we go any further it’s essential that both central and local government are working toward the same objectives,” she says.

“This project will provide a common strategic view for political leaders to consider, including any key points of difference. It will also recommend actions needed to fulfil the agreed strategic view, and identify any funding pressures for both parties and recommend actions needed to manage such pressures.”

The project will be led by a joint (Government-Auckland) Steering Group, supported by an officials working group. The steering group consists of Peter Winder (CEO, Auckland Regional Council), David Rankin (CEO, Auckland City Council), Alan Thompson (Secretary for Transport), Wayne Donnelly (CEO, Land Transport NZ), Andrew Kibblewhite (Director, Policy Advisory Group, DPMC), and John Whitehead (Secretary to the Treasury).

Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard today welcomed the project, saying it reflects discussions held at the Auckland Mayoral Forum. “The Forum noted that there remained a significant gap between the expenditure planned to improve Auckland’s transport system, and the funds available for this. Having an aligned central and local government transport planning vision will assist agreement about the scale and scope of programmes and effective investments.”

Auckland Regional Council chair Michael Lee says the project will enable political leaders to reach a common 20 to 30 year strategic view of the development of the Auckland transport system, including the role of public transport and the rail network, and will also identify ongoing issues that will substantially impact on Auckland transport outcomes or long-term funding.

Terms of reference

Background

On 17 March 2006 the Auckland Mayoral Forum noted that “there remains a significant gap between the expenditure planned to improve Auckland’s transport system, and the funds available for this”. In response, Ministers requested an agreed set of cost and revenue forecasts for Auckland transport, including Auckland rail. The ensuing report, issued on 5 May 2006, identified a $12 billion funded programme, plus a $4.4 billion funding gap over 10 years.

On 9 May 2006, Ministers and the Auckland Mayoral Forum met to consider the report. They decided that, before decisions could be taken on funding issues, a common strategic vision for Auckland transport, including passenger rail --- agreed by political leaders of the Crown and the region --– was required.

Specifically, the following recommendation was approved:

Strategic alignment

\* note that the Crown’s and the region’s views of the long term development of the Auckland land transport system, including rail, are not well aligned;

\* agree that \[a high level steering group] seeks to improve this alignment by recommending:  
iactions for both parties to take to improve matters in the short term;  
iisystemic options (processes) to deliver a consistently higher degree of alignment over the medium term, within the context of the Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy.

This Terms of Reference gives effect to the above recommendation.

Objective

The objective of the project is to enable political leaders to reach a common (Crown-region) strategic view of the long-term development of the Auckland land transport system, including the role for rail. “Long-term” in this context means 20-30 years. The project will:  
a.articulate a common strategic view for political leaders to consider (or identify key points of difference should this prove not possible);  
b.recommend actions (if any are needed) to be undertaken by both parties to give effect to the agreed strategic view in the short term, and to maintain strategic alignment going forward;  
c.identify any aggregate funding pressures that can be expected to result from adopting the agreed view, both at a whole-of strategy and main component (e.g. state highways, local roading, public transport and travel demand management) level, including broad funding implications for the Crown and the region; and recommend actions (if any are needed) to be undertaken by both parties to manage such pressures.

The project should:  
·reach genuine agreement on the long-term strategic vision (compromise from both sides may be needed to achieve this);  
·go beyond the current Regional Land Transport Strategy to identify agreed intermediate level outcomes and strategic options (to ensure points of tension are not glossed over);  
·seek regular political level feedback and challenge throughout the process ---– rather than at the end ---– to ensure tensions are resolved as the project proceeds and not left to split recommendations at the end;  
·identify all ongoing issues that will substantially impact onAuckland transport outcomes or long-term funding (the Minister of Transport will provide the central clearing role from the central government perspective)  
·provide clear, understandable and short reports which can be readily absorbed by non-Auckland transport experts.

Context

Growth: The project needs to be set in the context of the Auckland region’s current and projected growth, and the strategies in place or being developed to manage that growth over the long term. It accepts as given the concept of a compact city with defined limits to urban development as set out in Auckland’s Regional Growth Strategy. It needs to recognise long-term inter-regional transport growth as well as transport growth within the region. It should also recognise the evolving nature of this growth context – a common strategic view must therefore be flexible enough to accommodate changing conditions, adaptable over time, and grounded in robust strategy development processes.

Legislation: The project should assume existing legislation, including the Land Transport Management Act 2003, the Local Government Act 2002 and the Local Government (Auckland) Amendment Act 2004. These cover, among other things, the permitted content of the Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy, the requirement that the Strategy contribute to a compact urban form and sustainable land use intensification, and the roles of ARC, ARTA, Auckland Regional Land Transport Committee, Land Transport NZ and Transit in relation to the Strategy.  
Funding: The project should take available funding into account (currently $12 billion over 2006/07-2015/16), but will not determine or recommend a funding level for Auckland transport. This recognises (a) the longer term horizon of the strategy (20-30 years) compared to current funding forecasts (10 years); and (b) the role of strategy in guiding (but not determining) decisions about the funding of individual transport projects.

Definition

For the purposes of this project, strategy and “strategic view” has the same meaning as used in the Local Government (Auckland) Amendment Act 2004, i.e. a transport strategy (a) may be loosely based around a set of indicative projects but does not determine whether such projects will in fact proceed or when; and (b) includes only those matters specified in the Land Transport Management Act.  
The focus of this project should therefore be on transport outcomes for the Auckland region, strategic options for achieving those outcomes. These include economic, social and environmental outcomes as set out in the Land Transport Management Act.

Relationship to existing transport strategies

The starting point for the project will be the relevant existing strategies – Regional Land Transport Strategy, rail strategy, cycling strategy, ferries strategy, and travel demand management strategy. However, the project’s main output (a common strategic view) need not be a “Regional Land Transport Strategy”. Instead, the project will propose a set of actions to give effect to the agreed strategic view (which may or may not include amending the current Regional Land Transport Strategy).

Scope

The following matters are relevant for the working group to take into account, but are not within its remit to formally review or make recommendations about:  
a.Other strategies: Matters that are the focus of other related strategies such as land use, urban form, growth, business location, economic development, and national transport strategy;  
b.Projects: Individual transport projects and their costs;  
c.Funding: Individual sources of funding, subsidy rates, scope for increases,and new funding tools;

The following matters are not the main purpose of the project, but the working group may recommend reviewing them if it considers there are compelling reasons for doing so in order to improve ongoing strategic alignment between the Crown and the region in respect of Auckland transport:  
a.Legislation: The current legislative framework for Auckland’s land transport strategy, including specified content, roles and responsibilities;  
b.Other roles and responsibilities: Planning, operational and funding roles of ARC, ARTA, Auckland territorial authorities, Land Transport NZ, Transit and ONTRACK.

Key related work

The project will need to take account of the following related work and draw on its output where relevant:

Economic Transformation: The Government is currently examining Auckland issues as part of an approach to fast-tracking New Zealand’s economic transformation – this will potentially include a transport infrastructure component.  
Long Term Framework: “Infrastructure” is a proposed theme under the Long Term Framework currently being developed by Auckland. Transport is expected to be a significant component of this work. The intention is that the framework will identify demographic projections for the Auckland Region and the resulting infrastructural requirements (including transport) over a 50 year horizon.  
Regional Growth Strategy: Auckland’s Regional Growth Strategy is currently being refreshed in light of current growth patterns and pressures.  
Metro Project: Following the recent Symposium, a joint Action Plan for Auckland is being developed (expected end July). This may include a transport component.  
Auckland Road Pricing: Results of the recent consultation are expected to be considered by Ministers in late June, and decisions taken about next steps at that time.  
Funding tools: In addition to road pricing, work is under way on regional petrol tax (Treasury/Transport), regional development levies (Internal Affairs/LGNZ), and development levies for state highways (Transport). A joint report to Ministers on these and other potential region-level funding tools is due by 31 October 2006 (Treasury/Transport/Internal Affairs). Outputs from this work will feed into Phase Two of this project as they become available.

Timeframe and deliverables

The project has two phases (as set out below). Phase One is expected to be complete within 3 months at most, and Phase Two within a further 3 months at most. Subject to the issues / points of difference encountered, it may be possible to progress both phases more rapidly than this.

Phase OneFirst deliverable: A brief report to Ministers and Auckland elected representatives which succinctly describes the current strategic (20-30 year) view for the Auckland land transport system as set out in the existing Regional Land Transport Strategy and other documents. This report will be primarily descriptive and should give a comprehensive picture.  
Second deliverable: A report to Ministers and Auckland elected representatives which provides a first draft of a common strategic (20-30 year) view, identifying key points of difference (if any) and proposing agreed positions on these points if possible.  
As much as possible within the timeframe, the report should also  
a.identify any aggregate funding pressures which could be expected to arise from adopting the proposed common view, both at whole-of-strategy and main component (e.g. state highways, local roads, public transport, travel demand management) levels,assuming current funding tools; and  
b.highlight any key strategic choices within the proposed common view that would need to be resolved in the short term.  
On completion of Phase One, Ministers and representatives of Auckland local authorities will meet to agree on a long-term (20-30 year) view for the Auckland transport system.

Phase TwoThird deliverable: In the context of developments/decisions affecting long- term funding tools (road pricing, regional petrol tax, development levies, etc.), a report to Ministers and Auckland elected representatives which:  
a.recommends any short term actions by either or both parties needed to give effect to the agreed strategic view;  
b.proposes changes to ongoing processes for developing/reviewing the Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy to ensure that central Government and the region continue to be strategically aligned;  
c.estimates where possible the likely quantum and timing of any long-term funding pressures, and notes any significant funding implications for the Crown and the region assuming current funding rules;  
d.any actions by either or both parties that are needed to manage foreseeable short- and long-term funding pressures likely to arise from adopting the agreed strategic view.  
On completion of Phase Two, Ministers and representatives of Auckland local authorities will consider the proposed actions, including steps needed to manage any outstanding short- and long-term funding pressures.

Steering Group

The project will be overseen by a senior-level steering group. Its key responsibilities are to set the terms of reference for the project; test the deliverables produced by the working group (see below) and resolve any escalated issues; ensure that all key parties are appropriately engaged; manage external communications; and keep political leaders in the loop throughout the process with a view to achieving an enduring result.  
The steering group will consist of:  
John Whitehead (Chair, Secretary to the Treasury)  
Secretary for Transport  
Wayne Donnelly (CE Land Transport NZ)  
Andrew Kibblewhite (Director, Policy Advisory Group, DPMC)  
Peter Winder (CE Auckland Regional Council)  
David Rankin (CE Auckland City Council)  
The steering group may invite other parties to attend meetings where relevant. Stand-ins are allowed if necessary but should be kept to a minimum to maintain continuity. The project manager of the working group will attend meetings of the steering group.

Working Group

A joint (Auckland-Wellington) working group will be responsible for carrying out the analysis, providing input to and drafting the reports described above, and commissioning further work if necessary. Its overall role is to generate the analysis required to achieve the project’s objectives, for the steering group’s and ultimately political leaders’ consideration.

The core project team, which is expected to undertake the bulk of the work, will include representatives from Treasury (including the Project Manager), Ministry of Transport, Land Transport NZ, Transit, Auckland Regional Council, Auckland Regional Transport Authority and Auckland City Council.

The core project team will be supplemented by additional working group members drawn from Ministry for Economic Development, Ministry for the Environment, Department of Internal Affairs, ONTRACK and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.The views of this group will be taken into account and reflected in the reports delivered by the project.

The working group will consult with other interested central government departments, Auckland local authorities and external parties as appropriate, taking their views into account in developing proposals. The working group will operate on a joint reporting / no-surprises basis. It should endeavour to reach a common view on all important matters, but may escalate defined points of difference to the steering group for resolution if necessary.

External engagement

A key role of the steering group will be to test proposals in both Auckland and Wellington as they are developed to ensure that the main objective of the project (a common view) is achieved.

The steering group is also responsible for overseeing and managing engagement with all agencies (government and non-government) with an interest in Auckland land transport strategy as necessary to ensure that a robust outcome is achieved. This will include Auckland local authorities, associated transport-related groups, and agencies responsible for strategy implementation (including Transit, ONTRACK and ARTA).

Reporting

The working group will provide joint progress reports approximately fortnightly to the steering group, identifying progress towards deliverables and any key issues or risks arising in the course of the project. These reports and minutes of steering group meetings will be kept confidential to enable a free and frank discussion of the issues by the steering group.The working group will provide periodic updates on progress for external release.

Looking ahead

Political agreement about the long-term vision (“Long-term” in this context means 20-30 years) will go some way towards overcoming the differences in view that are currently evident, but further work will probably be needed to resolve all substantial transport matters between the Crown and the Auckland region. In particular, once the long-term vision is agreed, further work will probably be needed to achieve agreement about the proposed projects that make up the strategy and/or the level of funding needed over the next 10 years. Agreement about the long-term vision is a necessary first step as it may have implications for the overall funding of Auckland transport over the long term. It is therefore of key importance and must precede consideration of specific short-term funding and timing details.
