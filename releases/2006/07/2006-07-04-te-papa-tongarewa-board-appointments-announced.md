The second new member, Bob Harvey (Waitakere City), has been Mayor of Waitakere City since 1992. A former deputy Chair of the New Zealand Film Commission, Mr Harvey has been extensively involved in developing the “Eco-City” concept and other pioneering work in local government.

Lorraine Wilson (Auckland), the third new member, is a consultant to the cultural sector. Her governance experience includes roles as a councillor on the Auckland Regional Authority and the Auckland City Council, in museum bodies and in not-for-profit organisations.

All three new members have been appointed for three-year terms from 1 July 2006.

Board member Glenys Coughlan (Wellington), who is being reappointed for a two-year term, heads a public relations consultancy. A director of Asia 2000, she is a past chair of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, and sat on the Ministerial Taskforce on tourism industry funding. Ms Coughlan was first appointed in 1999.

Mark Solomon (Christchurch), the second reappointee, is Kaiwhakahaere or Chairman of Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu in Christchurch. He will serve a further one-year term on the Board and is a trustee of Takahanga Marae in Kaikoura and of Te Waipounamu Wharekauri Trust.

Judith Tizard said she was delighted to welcome the new and reappointed members.

“These appointments will bring new talents and experience to the Board while ensuring continuity, experience and expertise,” said the Minister.

The Minister acknowledged the huge contributions and commitment of retiring members Dr Roderick Deane, Board Chair since 2000; David Gascoigne, who has served since 1996; and Jenny May, who has served since 2000.

"On behalf of the government I wish to thank them for their invaluable contribution in successfully making Te Papa a national icon and a key destination.

"As Chair, Dr Deane has helped build the profile of Te Papa while strengthening its foundations in research and scholarship".
