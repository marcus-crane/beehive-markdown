From tariff collection in the fledgling colony of the 1840s to protecting New Zealand's borders, the rich history of our oldest government department is now on show in Auckland.

Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the opening of a permanent display at the New Zealand National Maritime Museum, which charters the development of the New Zealand Customs Service since its formation more than 165 years ago. The display will officially be opened on Thursday (13 July.)

"New Zealand's history is bound to the sea. Our first tupuna (ancestors) were highly skilled mariners who traversed the Pacific in their waka to make Aoteoroa their home. Our European ancestors later travelled here in ships to set up a new life in the Pacific; so seafaring and maritime trade has always played a huge part in our culture, identity and economy," Nanaia Mahuta said.

The display focuses mainly on the maritime aspects of Customs' work at the border, which includes protecting 15,134 km of coastline – the ninth-longest coast in the world. It also gives New Zealanders an opportunity to learn more about how Customs' work protects and benefits the economy and its people.

Demonstrations of detector dogs and x-ray equipment will also be featured at the museum, mainly during the school holidays.

"Throughout our history, Customs has monitored the flow of goods, craft and people, as well as collected revenue and enforced government decisions at the border. It is important for that history to be preserved, as this work is as important today as it was in 1840," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"Customs' maritime protection role has developed over the years, to the point where the Service now undertakes patrols on behalf of and alongside other government agencies. Ten government agencies are working together to coordinate New Zealand's maritime surveillance through the National Maritime Coordination Centre, managing risks in a whole-of-government way.

"Customs has, over the years, provided the Government with a major source of revenue, which helps drive New Zealand's economy. It is forecast to collect over $9 billion in 2005/2006 – over 15% of Crown revenue," Nanaia Mahuta said.
