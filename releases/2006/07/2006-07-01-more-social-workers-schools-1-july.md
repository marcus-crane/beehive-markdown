Ten social workers will join the Social Workers in Schools Programme (SWiS) from 1 July as part of the final expansion of the programme, bringing the total number of social workers to 118, working in 330 schools across the country.

'Empowering families is key to the most successful social work interventions and this is what lies at the heart of the SWiS Programme,' says Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson.

'SWiS enables social workers to work closely with children and their families to identify and recognise their own strengths and abilities to plan their way through their problems.'

SWiS is an early intervention and prevention programme targeted at year 1- 8 primary and intermediate school children and their families in low decile schools. Led and financed by Child, Youth and Family in partnership with the Ministry of Education, it is designed to give early help to children and their families before problems become more serious and difficult to overcome.

In Budget 2004, the Government pledged $16 million over four years towards the programme in order to assist its continuing expansion.

Children and their families are able to refer themselves onto the SWiS programme and participation is voluntary. The latest findings show that an increasing number of families are self-referring – 17% in 2006 compared to 12% in 2002. The main referrals still come from school principals at 42%, followed by teachers at 25%.

Social workers are able to work with the child and family to assess and develop plans to meet the child’s and family’s needs and their role includes co-ordinating a range of services such as health, counselling and parenting courses. The programme will be independently evaluated during 2006-07 as part of reviewing its effectiveness.
