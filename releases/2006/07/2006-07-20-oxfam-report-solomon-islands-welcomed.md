Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed Oxfam's report on the challenges facing Solomon Islands society and said it highlighted issues which need to be addressed.

The 33-page report, produced by Oxfam New Zealand and Oxfam Australia, looked at the Regional Assistance to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) role in the Solomon Islands over the past three years.

"The report analyses the complex challenges facing the Solomon Islands and raises real issues which need to be dealt with. Officials will be looking at the report and talking to Oxfam to get more detail about its findings.

"New Zealand and RAMSI share many of the concerns set out in the report, including how to achieve broad based economic growth, how to heal the wounds caused by the conflict, and how communities can live together peacefully and securely."

Helen Clark said that while RAMSI had re-established public order it could not fix all the problems facing Solomon Islands and New Zealand did not agree with the report's tendency to look to outsiders, particularly RAMSI, for solutions.

"A critical element is to build accountability between the Solomon Islands government and its people, which Oxfam identifies as a problem.

"Oxfam also identifies the need for broader based economic and rural development to create jobs, improve incomes and food security, and support livelihoods.  
"We look forward to continuing discussions with the Solomon Islands government and our RAMSI partners on ways to enhance RAMSI’s impact, and to ensure that we are providing the best possible support to Solomon Islands," Helen Clark said.
