In future, the financial performance of all tertiary education institutions will be monitored by one government agency, Minister for Tertiary Education Michael Cullen announced today.

The Ministry of Education’s Tertiary Advisory Monitoring Unit (TAMU) will transfer to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) on 1 September 2006.

"The move supports the next stages of the tertiary education reforms. It will offer a more integrated view of institutions and their performance, with educational outcomes being monitored alongside financial, governance and leadership indicators," said Dr Cullen.

The decision to move TAMU to the TEC follows last year’s Education Sector Review.

"The review raised questions about how monitoring was divided between the Ministry of Education and the TEC as this was seen limiting the ability to have an integrated overview,” said Dr Cullen.

"After consulting with Tertiary Education Institutions, Ministry of Education staff and other government agencies on the issue, it was decided to transfer TAMU to the TEC. A priority will be to ensure the smooth transition of existing work programmes and staff to minimise disruption."

The specific functions transferring from the Ministry of Education to the TEC are:

·monitoring institutions’ finances, governance and management  
·advice on Ministerial appointments to institutions’ councils  
·governance and management capability building  
·lead responsibility for risk assessment and advice on intervention  
·implementation of the Minister for Tertiary Education’s decisions on interventions

The Ministry of Education will retain responsibility for advice and decisions on Crown property used by tertiary institutions and for whole of sector level monitoring and policy advice.

The Ministry of Education will also continue its role of monitoring and advising on central education Crown entities - the TEC, New Zealand Qualifications Authority, Teachers’ Council and Careers Services.
