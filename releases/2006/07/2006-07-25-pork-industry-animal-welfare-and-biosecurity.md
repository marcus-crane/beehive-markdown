Minister of Agriculture and Biosecurity, Jim Anderton said today at the Pork Industry Conference that the issues of biosecurity and animal welfare were now key considerations for those working in New Zealand's pork industry.

"Pork producers were responding very positively to the Code of Welfare for Pigs, which also matched growing consumer demand for high standards of animal welfare and food safety. The industry, like all our agricultural industries, is a strong contributor to the New Zealand economy and is worth $500 million a year.

"Domestic consumption of pork is up by 21 percent in the last three years and the innovation of Apple Tender, which is a moisture enhanced product will help to grow the industry even further. I know the product has received a rave reception from consumers who have tried it.

"Not only does the industry have to maintain market share on its own merits, competing against frozen pork sourced mainly from Australia, Canada and Sweden, it faces biosecurity risks posed by imports and the challenge of managing such risks," Jim Anderton said.

"Producers are the on-the-ground eyes and ears of the industry, identifying possible diseases. Biosecurity is about risk management and the industry has a shared interest in working with Biosecurity New Zealand on porcine respiratory and reproductive surveillance.

"The Surveillance and Incursion Response Working Group has been set up by MAF to work with the animal sector to develop the principles and tools for sharing the costs between government and industry when it comes to different categories of pests and diseases.

"As Minister of Agriculture, I support in principle the World Society for the Protection of Animals proposed declaration on Animal Welfare. The housing of pregnant and lactating sows are the most controversial issues in the development of the Code of Welfare for pigs and I strongly believe in taking the advice of experts in these areas.

"The Pork Industry Board has been responding to the challenges posed by the Code. I encourage the industry to continue to work collaboratively with MAF to evaluate group housing and I look forward to hearing about the continued growth of the pork industry," the Minister said in Taupo today.
