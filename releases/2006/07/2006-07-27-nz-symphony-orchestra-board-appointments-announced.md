Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of two new members and the re-appointment of four members to the Board of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO).

New board member Mark Barrow (Auckland) is Dean of Teaching and Learning at Unitec Auckland, with considerable governance experience in the tertiary education sector. Mark also has interests in musical education and performance, and has played in the Auckland Youth Orchestra and the St Matthews Chamber Orchestra.

Roger Taylor (Wellington), the second new member, has governance experience with public sector boards including the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council, the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, the Commerce Commission and the Wellington College of Education. He is an experienced chartered accountant and an independent financial consultant.

Both new members have been appointed for three-year terms until 30 June 2009.

Joe Pope (Wellington) has been on the NZSO Board for ten years. His reappointment for one year will help ensure continuation of the Board’s marketing and successful financial focus.

The following have been reappointed for two-year terms until 31 July 2008.

Bill Falconer (Karapiro) is a commercial lawyer and company director with considerable governance, commercial and legal experience. He has held numerous community positions and is a former director of Opera New Zealand.

Susan McCormack (Christchurch) specialises in commercial and corporate law and has business involvement as a director of Lyttelton Port Company and as a director and shareholder of Seaview Investments Limited.

Peter Rowe (Auckland), a senior partner with an Auckland law firm, has been involved with local corporate acquisitions and advises on governance and general corporate matters.

“I am very pleased to welcome two new members onto the NZSO Board”, said Judith Tizard. "Both bring a range of skills and experience which will add to the already strong artistic and business capacity on the Board. Mark Barrow brings a useful new perspective to the Board. Roger Taylor’s long-time commitment to the performing arts aligned with his financial skills will also add value.”
