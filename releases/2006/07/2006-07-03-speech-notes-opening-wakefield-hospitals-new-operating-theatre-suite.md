Greetings to the Board of Wakefield Health, Mr Barnes, honoured guests, ladies and gentlemen ……

It is with genuine delight and pleasure that I accept your invitation to open Wakefield Health's new operating suite.

In my brief tour of inspection, it's apparent to me that this is a very modern facility capable of providing top-quality healthcare to New Zealanders.

It's cost $8.5 million and, I'm told, came in ahead of time and under budget.

Would that we could say the same about the entire New Zealand health system…..

As a Health Minister and the Revenue Minister, I am acutely aware of the fiercely competing demands between what we want in terms of healthcare – namely, top class – and what it costs to get that care.

I am currently engaged in developing a national medicines strategy which has the aim of getting the best medicines available for New Zealanders and being able to afford them.

In that area, as in health generally, the demand for service will always outstrip our capacity to supply, so we have to be always thinking of new and more innovative ways in which we can meet the public's expectations.

Even though the government's health spending is at record levels, the expectation still remains for faster and better services, and waiting list numbers remain high.

That is why United Future made more intelligent use of all our health resources a key part of the confidence and supply agreement we negotiated with the Labour-led Government.  
We need to be utilising all the services available to us to help meet the mounting demand, including "appropriate private hospital capacity to reduce waiting lists where this is feasible."  
Wakefield Health has a proud history and has contributed much already to improving the health standards of New Zealanders, and this new operating suite is a further important step in the growth and development of the private hospital sector in New Zealand.

It is therefore with the greatest desire to see your new operating theatres used to their fullest extent that I congratulate you for your foresight in making this investment and I formally declare them open.
