The launch of a new draft school curriculum provides a major opportunity to debate and discuss the future of teaching and learning in New Zealand schools, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The consultation over the next few months provides an opportunity for teachers, parents, and employers to get stuck in and debate the core values and knowledge that we want at the heart of our school system," Steve Maharey said.

"Our education system must ensure that all students meet very high standards, can achieve to their potential and are set up for life-long learning.

"The new simplified document, which replaces the current seven volume curriculum, will provide a clear statement of the skills, knowledge and values that all students need in the 21st century.

"As well as setting the direction for what will be taught in schools, the document will create better opportunities for teachers to build teaching around the needs of their students.

"The curriculum also sets out the core values that go with our education system. Education is one of the main ways that people learn to be part of our society. It is therefore important that we are clear about the values we want to see in our schools and through our society."

The new curriculum comes into effect from September 2007, following consultation over the next three months. This is the first time the curriculum has been reviewed and revised in more than a decade.

The draft curriculum is built around five key competencies developed through a three year consultation involving more than 15,000 people from across the education sector. The five competencies are:

Managing self

Relating to others

Participating and contributing

Thinking, and

Using language symbols and texts.

The document also includes a new section on learning languages. Around 80,000 copies of the curriculum are being sent to schools today, with submissions due by November 2006. Feedback is being sought from teachers, principals, school boards, education sector bodies, employers, parents and the wider community.
