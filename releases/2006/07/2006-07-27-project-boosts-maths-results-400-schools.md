Results from a numeracy project released today are evidence that it is possible to lift numeracy standards for all students, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The study showed improvements in mathematics across the 400 primary and intermediate schools involved in the project over the last year. A pilot of the project in 43 secondary schools recorded similar improvements.

The project has been run in more than 1,600 primary schools since 2000 – reaching 80 percent of primary schools. A longitudinal study showed higher levels of achievement resulting from the project could be sustained over time.

Steve Maharey said the project also showed improvements in the quality of mathematics teaching, and a reduction in differences in achievement between Mâori and non-Maori students.

"This is further evidence that with a focus on effective teaching it is possible to lift numeracy standards for all New Zealand students," Steve Maharey said.

"While our highest achievers in mathematics are comparable with the best in the world, we need to be working harder to lift standards for all students.

"This study shows that if teachers have good professional support and tailor teaching to meet the needs of their students, they can have a significant impact on the achievement of every student in the classroom.

"There is still further work to be done, but it is clear that the most important factor in lifting achievement among students is effective teaching backed up by good professional development."

The Numeracy Development Project was established in 2000 in response to the poor performance among some New Zealand students in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The project was extended to 43 secondary schools last year, involving 450 teachers and around 12,000 students.

The government currently invests around $52 million a year in programmes to lift numeracy and literacy standards in schools, including $13 million for the numeracy development project. The results of a Literacy project across 85 schools, released earlier this year, showed similar lifts in achievement.
