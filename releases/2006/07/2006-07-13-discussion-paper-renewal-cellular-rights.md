The Ministry of Economic Development has released a discussion paper on the renewal of radio spectrum management rights for cellular services, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

In 2003, the government decided that, subject to a case-by-case review, replacement rights would be offered to commercial spectrum right holders five years before the rights expire.

“The decision to renew spectrum rights is aimed to ensure consistency with New Zealand’s international radio obligations and to maximise the value of spectrum to society. This will also provide certainty for investment and ensure a seamless transition from one term to another,” Mr Cunliffe said.

The discussion paper is part of a case-by-case review for management rights in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz spectrum bands, the main bands currently used for cellular services in New Zealand, which will expire in 2011 and 2012.

It seeks stakeholders’ views on such issues as the future of these bands, existing use of the spectrum, the appropriate renewal period, and the most appropriate pricing approach.

The paper is available at www.med.govt.nz/radio/cellular-rights/

Interested parties should contact the Ministry’s Radio Spectrum Policy and Planning group at radiospectrum@med.govt.nz.

Submissions close on 25 August 2006.
