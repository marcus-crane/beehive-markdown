Minister of Civil Defence Rick Barker visited the flood damaged Wairarapa today.

Rick Barker was briefed by Mayors from the Masterton, Carterton and South Wairarapa District Council's, and witnessed first hand the affects of the flooding.

"The situation faced by residents is severe. Although rain and river levels are receding there's still a lot of work to do in the recovery stage", said Rick Barker.

"I've been very impressed with the local response. It's been fantastic. Local people know the problems facing the region and have taken care of issues as soon as they've become known.

"While a civil defence emergency hasn't been declared I've informed local leaders that the government would provide whatever resources necessary to manage the situation," said Rick Barker.

The National Crisis Management Centre remains activated to monitor the situation.
