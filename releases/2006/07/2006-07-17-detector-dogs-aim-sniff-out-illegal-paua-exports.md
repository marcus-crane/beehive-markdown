A new breed of detector dog is being trained to help combat illegal export of paua from New Zealand.

“This activity poses a significant threat to one of our iconic species,” said Minister of Fisheries Jim Anderton, as he watched two trainee detector dogs demonstrating their paua detecting skills at Auckland International Airport today.

“It is big business, but not the kind we want for New Zealand. I am concerned about the threat such activity poses to the sustainability of this species and to our economic well-being.

“Paua means so much to New Zealanders and is part of our cultural identity. We are taking steps to stop those involved and shut down their routes for exporting what they have stolen.”

The detector dogs, Luke and Taz, have nearly completed their training period and will operate around the country at points where there is a likelihood of unlawful product leaving New Zealand.

“The value and reputation of our seafood export market needs to be protected as much as the sustainability of this species.

“High volumes of low quality illegal exports will reduce the reputation of our products and, along with the depletion of the stock, could have a devastating impact on the legitimate seafood industry.”

As part of a joint initiative between the Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the two-year pilot programme is one of a number of measures the government has funded to target black market and poaching activities.

“Illegal export of paua is just one part of the problem. We all need to take responsibility for ensuring that we use our marine resources in a sustainable way. People who steal from our seas are stealing from us all.”

### Background information

**Training approach**

- Luke (Black Labrador cross) and Taz (Golden Labrador), both males, are in training, learning to focus solely on detecting the target paua odour. Luke, who was found at the pound and was to be destroyed as an unwanted dog, is around 18 months old. Taz, was offered to MAF, and is a couple of months younger than Luke. Both started training in May.
- MAF Quarantine Services staff are training the dogs. They have completed three weeks of ‘scent association’ training to determine whether they have the required attributes to make good working dogs. Dogs are tested on their association and response to the target odour, which in the case of Luke and Taz is paua.
- This has been followed by basic training (10 weeks), learning to systematically search out, locate and indicate the target odour. Both dogs will be worked in a range of environments to keep the work fun and interesting for them.
