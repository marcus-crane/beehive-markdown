A $2.5m Home Ownership Education Programme goes nationwide this month and is free of charge, Housing Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"Buying a home is a major financial and emotional step. This new education programme aims to demystify the process by offering practical, balanced and detailed information to people," Mr Carter said.

"New Zealand's home ownership rate has plummeted from 75 per cent in 1991, to as low as 65 per cent today. As a result, the number of families with no experience or knowledge of buying a home has grown, particularly among lower socio-economic groups.

"[Budget 2005 foreshadowed the development of an education programme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23091) to tackle this problem. The programme has been trialled and from this month it has been rolled out nationwide through 22 providers," Mr Carter said.

The programme offers eight modules. These include how to decide if home ownership is right for you, what you need in a home, goal setting and budgeting, the home buying process, financing, maintaining a home, building a home, selling or re-financing a home, and building or relocating a house on to multiple-owned Maori land.

Mr Carter said information on the programme would be provided to every state house tenant as part of efforts to encourage some 6,000 state house tenants paying market rents to consider home ownership.

"The benefits of home ownership are considerable. People who own a home tend to do better financially over their lifetime compared with those who rent, and tend to participate more in society," Mr Carter said.

"Because of this the Labour-Progressive government is overseeing a broad push to lift home ownership rates, and increase the supply of affordable housing in the market for first homebuyers and modest-income families."

A number of initiatives are under development, but those already public include:

- The [Welcome Home Loan Scheme](http://www.welcomehomeloan.co.nz/), in which the crown essentially underwrites loans from banks for people on the margins of traditional banking criteria. This has helped more than 1500 households buy homes so far.
- The proposed use of crown land at Hobsonville in Auckland to provide up to 500 affordable homes as part of a 3000 home development.
