Police Minister Annette King says she is delighted the dilapidated and rundown old police station in Sydenham is to be replaced.

“Design work is about to start next month on a new station,” she says.

“A project director is being appointed, and Canterbury Police District staff will also be seconded on to a project control group to help design the station to ensure it meets present and future policing needs in Sydenham.

"This is great news. It has been a long time coming and I appreciate how patient Sydenham staff and the public have been dealing with considerably less than ideal conditions. By September 2008 at the latest they will have the modern facilities that they are looking forward to and that Sydenham deserves."

Ms King says by the end of this year 30 new or refurbished police stations will have been opened around the country since the Labour-led Government came into office.

“This huge investment in infrastructure for the police will continue with major developments like Sydenham. New police stations are not just about bricks and mortar. They are about providing tangible evidence of security and safety for the communities they serve.”

The Sydenham project fits well within the context of a high-level strategic property plan for Canterbury, she says.

“It will be a significant structure probably of 1500 to 2000 square metres, though the size will be determined by final design and business requirements.

“As soon as the design is completed, the project will go out to tender, and construction is expected to start by September next year and to be completed by September 2008.”

Ms King says she wants to pay tribute to the “hard work and strong advocacy” of Christchurch Central MP Tim Barnett and former Sydenham MP Jim Anderton in pressing the case for a new station.

“I am sure both of them are also well pleased today.”
