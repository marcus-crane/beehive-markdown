Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton was present tonight at the Young Farmers’ Grand Final contest held in Shantytown. He took the opportunity of the largely farming audience to praise the adaptability and innovation of the primary sector industries.

“It's a pleasure to be here to celebrate our Young Farmers. This competition has put on display the astounding skill of our young farmers. We need to celebrate that because our primary industries are the backbone of New Zealand’s prosperity. We've always had a talented and creative primary sector,” Jim Anderton said in Greymouth.

“Farmers are great innovators. They are also businesspeople. And as business people, they are increasingly consumer-led. Consumers around the world are changing their preferences, so our primary industries are responding. We have to.

“Consumers for example have different lifestyles. Not many families have someone who can be at home to cook a roast during the week these days. Quick-to-prepare and ready-to-prepare meals are a much greater market and much greater opportunity than they used to be. Consumers are experiencing the cuisines of the world - so we need to supply a wider range of products to meet this changing demand.

“Increasingly the world's consumers are becoming more sophisticated in their demands for products that are produced in a socially and environmentally responsible way. Fortunately for New Zealand, we have a great story to tell. We have some of the best environmental farming practice in the world. And we're becoming much at it.

“Successful businesses adapt to these changing market conditions. The successful Young Farmers we are celebrating tonight are leaders. It's clear from the calibre of participants that we have a generation of quality leaders. Their success will help to inspire others in the challenges of creating and managing successful primary industry businesses.

“The future success of farming is dependent on the continued vitality of rural communities. This vitality is dependent on the activities demonstrated by the very people on show at these awards. So I take this opportunity to congratulate the successful young farmers and to congratulate you on tonight's honours,” Jim Anderton said.
