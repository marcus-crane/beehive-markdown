New Zealand’s contribution to counter-terrorism efforts in Southeast Asia has been boosted by the creation of an Asia Security Fund, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Budget 2006 set aside $500,000 this year and $700,000 in future years for the fund, which will be managed by a steering group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“The Asia Security Fund aims to reduce the potential threat to New Zealand by improving the counter-terrorism capacity of nations in Southeast Asia," Mr Peters said.

“Events such as the Bali bombings have demonstrated that New Zealanders who travel in the region, and our interests there generally are at risk of terrorism. It is a global menace, and we share a commitment with our Southeast Asian partners to counter it.

“Effective counter-terrorism measures focus on the symptoms and underlying factors of violent extremism. Therefore the Asia Security Fund will support initiatives such as inter-faith dialogue, law enforcement, and training projects aimed at reinforcing universal values such as good governance, tolerance and multiculturalism,” Mr Peters said.
