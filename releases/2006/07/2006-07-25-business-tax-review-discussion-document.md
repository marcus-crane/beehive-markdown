Improving the ability of business to grow and compete in the global economy is the driving force behind the range of options identified in the business tax review discussion document released today.

"The government's goal, in line with its confidence and supply agreements with [United Future](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F24260) and [New Zealand First](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F24257), is to help transform the New Zealand economy through internationally competitive business tax rules," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

"If we are to build a high wage, high skill, knowledge-based economy we need business tax rules that encourage innovation, support business investment, encourage exporters to break in to new markets and help to build a more skilled workforce.

"The discussion document, therefore, suggests options including a reduction in the company tax rate, tax base changes and measures to reduce the cost of complying with tax rules. These are designed to increase competitiveness, improve productivity and so the potential for the economy to grow.

"As it will not be possible to go ahead with all of the options, we need businesses to tell us what they see as their priorities in relation to the options identified. We also welcome suggestions for other changes as well. This will help the government make informed decisions based on the obvious fiscal constraints we face.

"The business tax review aims to build on progress we have already made in fostering a supportive business environment. We are [recognised internationally by the World Bank for the ease of doing business](http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreEconomies/Default.aspx?economyid=140).

"But we can do better and we hope the document provokes meaningful debate. It is the first step in engaging with the public on how best to reform the business tax rules to achieve our economic goals.

"We have attempted, where possible, to estimate the annual cost of each option, being mindful of the fact that whatever mix is finally agreed upon, there will be a fiscal cost which could impact on government spending programmes.

Possible initiatives in the discussion document are:

Tax rate Estimated  
annual cost Dropping the company tax rate from 33% to 30% $540m Tax base Estimated  
annual cost Targeted tax credits for:  
R&D  
Export market development  
Skills improvement $45m - $350m  
Uncertain*  
Uncertain* Deferring losses from significant upfront expenditure Uncertain* Deduction for 'blackhole' expenditure, such as losses on buildings $150m - $300m Increased depreciation loading on new assets to:  
30%  
40%  
$120m  
$230m Decreased depreciation loading on new assets to:  
10%  
0%  
($120m)  
($250m) Aligning depreciation loading at 20% on new and secondhand assets $90m Tax compliance Estimated  
annual cost Increasing low value asset write-off thresholds (e.g. from $500 to $1000) $170m Reducing compliance costs for assets with low depreciated values Uncertain* Increasing the threshold for taxpayers allowed to submit an annual FBT return Nil

\*Until the detail of these initiatives has been designed it is not possible to give accurate costings.

"We acknowledge that company tax rate changes may have implications for the design of the wider income tax system. Changes to the system of personal income taxation are outside the scope of the Business Tax Review. Any changes in those areas will need to be considered within the context of the overall personal tax regime.

"We want to emphasise that, in changing the tax structure, the government is not interested in an ill-thought out, politically driven lolly scramble.

"Our concern is to lift the performance of the economy for the benefit of all New Zealanders," the Ministers said.

Submissions must be made by 8 September this year.

"We realise that the submission time is tight, but would point out that there is an extensive consultative and legislative process to be gone through. Tax law can take up to a year to pass. Best practice also suggests changes should apply from the start of a tax year, in this case, from 1 April 2008."
