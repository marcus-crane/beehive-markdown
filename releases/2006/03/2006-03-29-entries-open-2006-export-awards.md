Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the opening of entries into the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) 2006 Export Awards, and urged exporters to enter.

"This year the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Export Awards, sponsored by DHL, celebrate their fortieth anniversary. I'd like to encourage exporters to step up to the mark and enter. Winners will join a distinguished list of our exporting greats, dating back four decades.

"The first New Zealand Export Awards were presented in 1966 to ten companies selling products ranging from Tonka toys, books and motor mowers to ice cream and women’s fashion. In the ensuing four decades they have become recognised as the most prestigious awards given to New Zealand exporters."

The 2005 DHL Supreme Exporter of the Year was Rakon Ltd and other past winners include Tait Electronics, Bowron Sheepskin, Lion Breweries, Fletchers, Crown Lynn Pottery, Zespri and Tip Top Ice Cream.

Companies entering this year’s awards will compete in a range of categories, some of which were unheard of 40 years ago, such as biotechnology and information and communications technology.

"However, the overriding objective of the annual Export Awards remains unchanged.

"The Export Awards are an opportunity to celebrate our exporting heroes and give them the recognition they deserve.

"Exporters are crucial to the economic transformation of New Zealand as we work with business to create more firms that are globally competitive and can take on the best in world markets. For that reason the government has earmarked 2007 as Export Year in order to help increase New Zealand’s productivity and growth.

"If companies are being innovative, using clever strategies, achieving solid growth and excellent export sales volumes, then the 2006 Export Awards offer a chance to be recognised among their peers, throughout New Zealand and offshore.  
"Past winners attest to the positive impact of winning an Export Award. Other companies benefit from the best practice examples showcased and even the process of entering is beneficial as it provides a mechanism for companies to analyse their export performance," Trevor Mallard said.

Entries close on April 28 and entry forms are available at [www.exportawards.co.nz](http://www.exportawards.co.nz)
