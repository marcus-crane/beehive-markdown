Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her condolences at the death of pioneering heart surgeon Sir Brian Barratt-Boyes.

“Sir Brian leaves behind an immense legacy. He was recognised throughout the world as one of the greatest physicians of the twentieth century. Many of his peers, here and overseas, considered him the best practitioner in the world.

“Through his skill and immense talent, he built the heart unit at Auckland’s Greenlane Hospital into one of the most prestigious clinics in the world. He received an array of international fellowships, medals, and awards during his superb career.

“My deep sympathies are extended to Sir Brian’s family at this sad time,” Helen Clark said.

Sir Brian was awarded a KBE for his outstanding service to medicine in 1971.
