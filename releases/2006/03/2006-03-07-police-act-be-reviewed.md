The Police Act is to be reviewed comprehensively to bring the legislation up to date for the 21st century, says Police Minister Annette King.

The current Police Act (1958) is nearly 50 years old and does not reflect changes to communities and policing practice over that time, she says.

"Sound principles and practice honed from the past 120 years of New Zealand Police history need to be carried forward into this century, but new approaches are also needed to meet aspects of policing now and in the future that could not have been envisaged when the current Police Act was drafted.”

Ms King says the process of preparing new legislation will provide opportunities for local input and international ideas on policing to be discussed.

“A number of issues have arisen over the years which will be considered in the review and rewrite of the legislation.

They include:  
·The principles of policing.  
·Governance arrangements for police.  
·Human resource management.  
·Creation of a code of conduct for all police staff.  
·More effective public input into national and local policing priorities.  
·Maximum scope for flexibly deploying Police nationally and internationally.  
·Facilitating better use of forensic/technological tools to aid crime prevention and investigation.

Mis King says a wide consultation process is expected to begin later this year or early next year, with a public consultation paper on Policing Directions in New Zealand for the 21st Century, to ensure “we all have a stake in the future.

"The review of the Police Act will replace the need for the Police Amendment Bill No 2 which has sat low in the order paper for several years. It will also give an opportunity to take into account any matters that may arise from the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct, due on 31 May this year," said Ms King.

“Police give New Zealanders outstanding service, often in difficult situations. They deserve the best and most modern legislation we can provide.”

Questions and answers

What is the current Police legislation? The Police Act 1958 and the Police Regulations 1992. Both will be affected by this review.

What is the timeframe? The intention to have a draft Police Bill by November 2007 for introduction to Parliament in 2008.

What is happening to the Police Amendment Bill (No 2)? This full re-write of the Police Act replaces that Bill. This review involves a broader process covering fresh areas and entailing wider consultation.

What is wrong with the current Act?  
·It does not necessarily reflect modern policing practice.  
·The current Act creates an inconsistent human resource management environment.  
·The Act is silent on governance issues, relying on convention.  
·The Act does not provide for public input into policing issues in which we know communities have a great interest.

Who is leading the work? The work is being done by Police with a small multidisciplinary team at the Office of Commissioner. The project team will be supported by a formal advisory group aimed at bringing together a range of opinion leaders and influential stakeholders to act as a reference group.

What is the first product we will see from this work, and when will that happen? Three public consultation documents, a discussion paper, a public consultation paper and a draft of the Bill, will be produced. Timeframes are still to be finalised, but it is hoped the discussion paper and the public consultation phases will be completed by early 2007, with the draft Bill available by mid-2007.

Who will be consulted? The consultation phase will be open to the public.

Will the Bill be based on New Zealand or overseas ideas? Both. It is hoped to include a broad range of best practice, experience and thinking. Some international experts on policing will certainly be contacted for their views, as well as local interest groups and experts. At the end of the process the Act will reflec t the New Zealand way of doing things.

How does NZ policing compare with other countries? NZ Police operate in a way that has progressively changed over the past 120 years. The New Zealand policing approach may be considered as both unique and an amalgam of models of international policing practice. Our existing policing model reflects both New Zealand's own development and a mix of policing practice that is in part based on the British policing model, a colonial era view of justice, and more latterly other international policing developments from regions such as North America and Europe. Policing in New Zealand is as unique as New Zealand itself is as a country.

What does a Police Act do? It establishes the legal basis for the State to appoint a Commissioner and to appoint staff to perform the functions of policing. A key role of such legislation is to explain carefully how the permission to use force to uphold the law in the interests of State is passed to police staff. Other key features of such an Act may include the powers of police to do their job, the purpose and principles of policing, the method of funding police work, the separation between government influence on policy and Police independence in individual cases, conditions of service for police staff, a code of conduct, powers of the Commissioner to appoint, manage and transfer staff, human resource management, and protections for police in performing their duties.

Will the entire old Act be redundant? Modernisation of the legislative framework is not about throwing out all old thinking simply due to its age. The principles underpinning policing are as relevant today as they have been over the past two centuries. But in the past 50 years many aspects of New Zealand life have changed and new legislation can build on the best of the past while adapting for the present, and preparing NZ Police for the future.

Will a new Act reduce crime? Consultation during the development of the Bill has the potential to advance new ideas and programmes, including how criminal and anti-social behaviour can be tackled more effectively, how public confidence can be increased, and how better partnerships can achieve better outcomes.
