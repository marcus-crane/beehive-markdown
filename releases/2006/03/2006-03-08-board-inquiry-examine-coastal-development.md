A Board of Inquiry is to be appointed to review issues around coastal development and the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

The New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement is the only national policy statement issued under the Resource Management Act. It guides councils in their decision-making about what types of activities will be allowed, controlled or prohibited in coastal areas.

"There has been considerable anxiety expressed by communities around the country about the amount of development on the New Zealand coastal line, the impact this is having on the character of the coast and on the traditional kiwi lifestyle," Mr Carter said.

"Because of these concerns, I initiated a review of the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement shortly after becoming Minister. An independent review has been completed and policy development is under way. I expect to be able to release a new draft coastal policy statement for public consultation later this year, through a Board of Inquiry.

"The Board of Inquiry will consider public submissions and hold hearings nationwide. I intend to give it broad terms of reference to enable it to properly examine coastal development issues in the context of the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement," Mr Carter said.

"This process will give the people of New Zealand, local government, developers and others an opportunity to have a say on how they want their coast to look, and what type of development is appropriate. We have only one opportunity to get development on our coast right, and we need to ensure that the tools available under the Resource Management Act are used effectively."

The Board is likely to be appointed later in the year. Its terms of reference have not been finalised.
