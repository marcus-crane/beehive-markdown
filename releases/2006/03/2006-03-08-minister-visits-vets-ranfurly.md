Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker, spent the afternoon with veterans at the Ranfurly Veterans' Home and Hospital in Mount Albert today.

"On Monday, the Prime Minister and I launched the Year of the Veteran. The Year of the Veteran is about acknowledging sacrifice and saying thanks for the contribution that our vets made at home, in our communities.

"This isn't about flash memorials in big cities, it's about commemoration days in local towns, rededicating old war memorials or collecting the stories of our vets of posterity sake," he said.

Mr Barker's visit to the Vets home highlighted the significant role that Vets' homes and hospitals play in the later years of New Zealand Veterans.

"The war veterans homes provide service for a group within our communities who merit special consideration by virtue of their service to our Nation. As part of the Year of the Veteran, commemorative pins and Jelly bands will be on sale throughout the year with the proceeds of these sales going to three veterans homes including Ranfurly, Rannerdale and Monticello," he said.

A $1million Year of the Veteran contestable fund has also been established to provide funding that assists community organisations to undertake activities and events that support the Year of the Veteran theme. The fund will be administered by a Ministerial Working Party that will assess applications.

$200,000 has also been provided to assist with national level events.

Mr Barker said that "to recognise the fact that a number of members of the community, like some of those who give time to the management of the Ranfurley Home and Hospital, who give their time voluntarily, special commendations will also be awarded.

"This year is about simply saying thanks, so I came here today as a small way of me saying thanks too."
