MP for Te Tai Tonga is supporting an information campaign blitz aimed preparing Maori for a potential influenza pandemic.

The advertising started on Iwi radio today and is being supported by a campaign on Maori Television as part of the overall communications strategy.

"It is very important that Maori are presented with information so that they can look after themselves and whanau in an influenza pandemic," said Mahara Okeroa.

"While pandemic awareness is reasonably high, it is not enough. Therefore it is important all Maori know how to cope in such a situation.

"In the last 100 years there have been three pandemics of influenza, which killed millions of people worldwide. Although neither the exact timing nor severity of a future pandemic can be predicted, it is certain that we need to be ready for it.

"During the 1918 pandemic more than 2100 Maori died from the Spanish Flu. Reflected in today's population, significantly many more thousands of Maori could expect to perish. Clearly there are many situations and social gatherings where communities will need to keep this in mind.

This campaign is designed to ensure that whanau have solid information to make informed decisions in the event of a flu pandemic.'' Mahara Okeroa said.
