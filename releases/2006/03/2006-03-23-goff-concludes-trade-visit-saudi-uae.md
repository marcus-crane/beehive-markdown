Discussions in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates promoted bilateral trade relations and opened the door for stronger cooperation in new areas, said Trade Minister Phil Goff, who returned today from a visit to the two Gulf states.

“Saudi Arabia and the UAE are New Zealand’s two largest export markets in the Middle East, with two-way trade of over $NZ1.25 billion," Mr Goff said.

"Dairy and meat exports remain our strongest trading commodities. However, we are also expanding our trade into new areas such as information and communications technology, and education.

“Dubai is a hub for the region. In September last year New Zealand Trade and Enterprise opened a new technology beachhead programme there. Already a dozen New Zealand companies have established a presence and are having considerable success in the regional market.

"The beachhead includes medical technology companies such as Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, and Mercer Medical; hi-tech communication companies like 4RF, Argent and Telecom NZ, and education companies such as Intuto Learning Solutions.

“Over the last two years there has also been considerable success in attracting students to New Zealand, with several hundred students from countries such as Saudi and Oman being funded by their governments to study here.

"New Zealand is also developing markets in specialised manufacturing areas. Our timber frame construction industry, for example, has the potential to win a significant contract in the Palm Island development project in Dubai.

“New Zealand boat building also has a large market in the region. My visit coincided with the Dubai International Boat Show, where several stands showcased our marine industry expertise. Emirates Airline's sponsorship of New Zealand’s 2007 America’s Cup campaign has helped our profile in this respect."

Formal joint ministerial meetings were held in both countries.

In the UAE Mr Goff met with counterpart Sheikha Lubna al-Qasimi in the inaugural session of the New Zealand/UAE Joint Ministerial Commission. In Riyadh the growing trade relationship was formally reviewed during the second New Zealand/Saudi Arabia Joint Ministerial Commission, co-chaired by the Saudi Minister of Commerce and Industry Dr Yamani.

Mr Goff said both countries had encouraged New Zealand to enter into negotiations for a free trade agreement with the six countries constituting the Gulf Cooperation Council.

“I was accompanied in Saudi Arabia by representatives from New Zealand’s agriculture, telecommunications and education sectors who were able to engage with their counterparts and seek new opportunities in the Saudi market.

“Wearing my Defence hat, I also met with my ministerial counterpart Crown Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia, and with Prime Minister and Defence Minister Sheikh Mohammed in the UAE.

"These meetings focused on regional security issues in the Middle East and New Zealand’s involvement in peacekeeping missions there,” Mr Goff said.
