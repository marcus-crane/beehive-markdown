Prime Minister Helen Clark today presented the New Zealand Special Service Medal (NZSSM Asian Tsunami) to 29 New Zealanders who served in areas affected by the Boxing Day tsunami.

The medals were presented at a ceremony in Parliament's Grand Hall.

"New Zealanders responded to the disaster rapidly, professionally, and with great compassion," Helen Clark said.

"The NZSSM (Asian Tsunami) recognises service including locating missing New Zealanders, identifying victims, and other humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction work."

Helen Clark praised the dedication of the medal recipients, who had worked in some of the most difficult and hazardous conditions imaginable.

"The risk of aftershocks, the dangers of disease and infection, the extensive – and in some instances complete – devastation of affected areas, and the trauma of treating the injured, of recovering bodies, and identifying victims presented the most harrowing physical and psychological challenges."

Today's medal recipients were involved in relief efforts in Aceh Province (Indonesia), Phuket (Thailand) and Sri Lanka. They include personnel from the New Zealand Police, the New Zealand Defence Force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, civilians and representatives from aid agencies and New Zealand media.

The government announced the creation of the medal on the first anniversary of the disaster. The medal is awarded to New Zealanders who worked in areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami between 26 December 2004 and 26 December 2005. More people are likely to receive the medal in coming months.

The ceremony, also attended by Defence Minister Phil Goff, Police Minister Annette King and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters, concluded with a minute's silence for the victims of the tsunami.
