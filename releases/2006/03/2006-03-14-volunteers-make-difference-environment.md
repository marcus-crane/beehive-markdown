As New Zealand launches into Volunteer Awareness Week, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope says it is a good time to recognise those who give their time helping out in the environment.

“Volunteers who take action for the environment are making a difference for present and future generations.

“The contribution of volunteers in the community is invaluable and without these people, what has been achieved so far would simply not have been possible,” said David Benson-Pope.

The value of many of the initiatives that the Ministry for the Environment supports through its community initiative funds is greatly enhanced by the time and resources given freely by volunteers across New Zealand.

The Minister has called upon New Zealanders to acknowledge, through the Green Ribbon Awards, the members of our community who are making a difference for New Zealand’s environment. The Awards are a public acknowledgement of the initiative, dedication and sheer hard work of committed New Zealanders.

“Now is the time to send in your nominations for the Green Ribbon Awards to recognise the considerable contributions made by individuals and organisations for our environment,” David Benson-Pope said.
