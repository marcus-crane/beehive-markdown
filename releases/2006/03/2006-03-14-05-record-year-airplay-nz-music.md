New figures showing New Zealand music accounted for a record 20.8% of music played on commercial radio in 2005 – up from 18.6% in 2004 were welcomed today by Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

New Zealand music is also topping the charts with bands Breaks Co-op and The Feelers producing the top three-airplay songs on commercial radio in 2005.

"This is a fantastic result for the music industry, and it demonstrates what we've known all along – that New Zealanders want to tune into more of their own music," Steve Maharey said.

Airplay of New Zealand music has doubled since March 2002 when the government and the Radio Broadcasters Association launched a Code of Practice for New Zealand music content, agreeing to a target of 20% of local music by the year 2006.

"The fact that this target was reached last year, 18 months ahead of the target date, is evidence the New Zealand music industry is continuing to move from strength to strength.

"The latest figures are a huge jump from 1995 when New Zealand music accounted for less than 2% of music played on commercial radio. New Zealanders now enjoy 10 times more airplay than they did a decade ago.

"Radio broadcasters deserve to be congratulated for their commitment to growing New Zealand music and for their willingness to work together to achieve this result."

"We can all celebrate this important milestone, but we need to keep up the momentum. The government will keep working with broadcasters and the local music industry to help them achieve their goals both here and overseas."
