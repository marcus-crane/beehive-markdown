Jim Anderton, as Associate Minister of Health responsible for Drugs and Alcohol, opened a bookshop today in St Martins that is dedicated to providing a central point of reference for information on addiction.

"We know about addiction and the wide range of forms it takes; alcohol, illegal drugs, gambling and more. We also know addiction in one form or another affects every corner of life without discrimination, from parliament to prisons, from homes to workplaces, across races, ages, regions and time," Jim Anderton said.

"We also know the staggering costs of addiction. There are the financial costs of billions of dollars a year in treatment, lost production damage and other losses. There are social and human costs too, which matter even more. No one who deals with addiction issues professionally can be complacent.

"Offering treatment that works, understanding, hope and the real possibility of recovery are far more helpful to people than making judgements about them. This bookshop can help those desperate to know what is happening to them, as well as helping treatment providers, families and friends. Books, and the other information here, offer inspiration to those who are feeling isolated and alone because others have similar problems, which they have overcome.

"This is the only book shop in New Zealand that specializes in books solely dedicated to recovery from addictions and co-dependency with books and pamphlets covering Alcohol, P, Internet Addiction, Nicotine, Heroin, Marijuana, Depression, Co-dependency, Cocaine and other addictions.

"The original Source book shop was set up on the site of Hamner's Queen Mary Hospital in 1995 by Jere and Deb Bunn. Later Marie and Fred Lahood were asked to become partners in the bookshop. With the closure of Queen Mary Hospital the bookshop continued on as a mail order only service. However the need for a retail outlet was evident and the Familial Trust took over the shop in late 2005.

"In this bookshop, there is a resource that will help someone to help themselves and others to understand, to care and cope", said Jim Anderton in Christchurch today.
