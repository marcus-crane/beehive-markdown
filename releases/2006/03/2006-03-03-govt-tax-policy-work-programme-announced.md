Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced the contents of the government’s tax policy work programme over the next few months.

High on the list are the business tax review, measures to increase productivity and growth, and fundamental changes to savings policy and New Zealand’s international tax rules.

The work programme will be an interim one until the resource and policy requirements of the business tax review are clearer, Mr Dunne told the annual conference of the International Fiscal Association.

“The business tax review was one of several key projects that emerged from the confidence and supply agreements signed after the election,” Mr Dunne said. “The others were a new system of tax rebates for charities, a discussion document on income splitting, and a review of racing industry rules.

“The aim of the business tax review is to ensure that the tax system provides better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

“Related measures include reviews of the level of withholding rates in our double tax agreements and of the tax rules that govern outbound investment from New Zealand into foreign subsidiaries.

“The other major focus of the work programme is to encourage savings and improve the way they are used. Work here involves the introduction of KiwiSaver, relieving the over-taxation of people who save through New Zealand-managed funds, and applying consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares.

“Work programme measures to ensure that the tax rules operate smoothly, fairly and efficiently include reviews of the tax implications of the new International Financial Reporting Standards, new tax rules for both limited and ordinary partnerships, and completion of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.

“In a similar vein, the government is considering changes to the operation of the shortfall penalty for having an ‘unacceptable tax position’, details of which I hope to announce over the next few weeks.

“Revenue base maintenance is always an essential feature of the work programme, to counter tax avoidance and ensure the reliable flow of revenue to government. To this end, the interim work programme includes a timely review of the use of imputation credits”, Mr Dunne said.
