National MP Tau Henare today admitted the National government failed to invest sufficiently on Auckland roads during the 1990s.

Acting Minister of Transport Pete Hodgson welcomed Mr Henare's admission on Paul Holmes' breakfast show this morning.

When asked by Mr Holmes if Auckland's traffic congestion problems were caused by National's underinvestment in the 1990s, Henare said:

"You are absolutely right, you are absolutely right."

"As an Opposition MP in the nineties I watched an infrastructure deficit emerge under National. It's refreshing to have them admit it," said Pete Hodgson.

“When we came to office the value of big projects in Auckland that were underway or recently completed totalled $130 million. Today using exactly the same criterion, the big projects underway or recently completed total $1300 million. Startling isn’t it? It's a tenfold increase. It's the difference between talk and do."
