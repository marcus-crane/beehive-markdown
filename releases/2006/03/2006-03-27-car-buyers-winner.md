Car buyers are more aware of their rights under new consumer legislation according to a Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal report, released today by Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

The report comes hot on the heels of another report last week which reviewed the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003, and confirmed that car buyers are not only better protected, they are wiser about their purchasing rights.

The Adjudicator's report - an annual report to the Minister - says car buyers are more aware of their rights thanks to new information available about their entitlements and dispute resolution processes.

The report adds that the new laws also make it easier for purchasers to bring claims against traders under the Consumers Guarantees legislation, whereas previously both buyer and trader had to agree before claims could be taken to the Tribunal.

And consumers are getting a prompt hearing with most disputes being heard within a month of the application.

"I am delighted that consumers are the overall winners," says Judith Tizard.

In October the Ministry of Consumer Affairs is releasing a discussion paper which includes proposals to fine-tune the legislation. The report will be considered as part of that process.

"I welcome this information which will be fed into the review."
