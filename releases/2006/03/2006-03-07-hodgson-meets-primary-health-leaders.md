"Ensuring low cost doctors visits is central to the government's work to provide opportunity for all New Zealand families," Pete Hodgson said.

"New Zealand's primary health care sector is leading the world in efforts to reduce inequalities and in developing community-led disease prevention.

"Primary health care sector leaders met this morning to talk through the rapid changes in the way healthcare has been delivered and funded in the New Zealand since 2002," Pete Hodgson said.

"We had an open discussion around the need for transparency about how additional funding is being spent to ensure low GP fees. The meeting was also an opportunity to talk about trends and issues facing the primary health workforce."

Overall the government has committed to spending $2.2 billion in new money implementing the Primary Healthcare Strategy over the seven years from 2002/03.

In July 2004 and July 2005 funding was invested to improve access for everyone under 24 and everyone aged 65 and over. This year, increased funding will lower GP fees for 45-64 year olds.

In July 2007, lower GP fees will become universal with 25 to 44 year olds receiving the final instalment of new funding.

Pete Hodgson said this morning's meeting was his first opportunity as Health Minister to share with primary healthcare leaders his gratitude for the time, energy and ideas they've committed to implementing the Primary Healthcare Strategy.

"The government is committed to its investment in primary healthcare, and committed to maintaining the value of its investment. I'm pleased that we had such a productive meeting with primary healthcare leaders today and I'm grateful for their continued work to improve the health of all New Zealanders."
