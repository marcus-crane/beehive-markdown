Winners of this year's EECA EnergyWise Awards prove that committing to energy efficiency and renewable energy can have many benefits for individual organisations and New Zealand, Energy Minister David Parker said today.

The winners were announced at a function in Auckland tonight. The EECA EnergyWise Awards are judged on the benefits of the project (energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions), cost effectiveness, innovation, and sustainability.

“It is encouraging to see so many organisations targeting energy efficiency and using energy in a sustainable way," Mr Parker, who is also Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues, said.

“The Government is currently developing a National Energy Strategy that will provide direction and leadership for the energy sector, but we need commitment and engagement from the whole economy. Innovative and forward-thinking organisations such as today's EnergyWise Award winners can show others how it can be done.

"Climate change is accelerating and its costs and risks are increasing. Projects that encourage energy efficiency and use of renewable energy help New Zealand to reduce emissions and meet our international agreements," Mr Parker said.

“The combined total of carbon emissions saved by the EECA EnergyWise Awards winners is well over 100,000 tonnes. This demonstrates that everybody can make a difference to New Zealand’s drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"I would like to congratulate the winners for leading by example and showing that we can all make a difference, and that energy efficiency makes good business sense," Mr Parker said.
