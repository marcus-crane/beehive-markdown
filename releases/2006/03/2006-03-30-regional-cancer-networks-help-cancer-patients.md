Services for cancer patients will be greatly improved once regional cancer networks are established Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today at a meeting of District Health Boards (DHBs), non-government organizations (NGOs), cancer consumer organisations, and cancer clinicians.

"Establishing regional cancer networks is necessary to progress many more of the actions contained in the [Cancer Control Strategy Action Plan](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/abed0ba681a637e1cc256fbc006f22d7?OpenDocument) and this is a high priority action," Pete Hodgson said.

"Managed cancer networks have contributed to improvements in the provision of cancer patient care in the UK and parts of Australia," Pete Hodgson said.

Regional cancer networks will bring together organisations involved in the planning, funding and provision of cancer services, including consumers and their families and are a mechanism to ensure that all the points in the cancer patient's journey are joined up.

"Most DHBs in New Zealand already have informal clinical cancer networks but creating a formal network will recognise, expand and enhance the current systems in place."

"The networks will also improve the resources and support that are directed to populations who have poorer cancer outcomes because of geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities," Pete Hodgson added.

Those attending the seminar will hear from international and national speakers including the keynote speaker Professor Mike Richards, who is England's national Cancer Director and is responsible for the development and implementation of the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan.

Professor Richards has implemented regional cancer networks throughout England, which have also been modified and developed in Scotland and Wales due to their success.
