New Zealand is becoming an increasingly popular travel destination for German tourists, young people on working holidays and students, says Trade Minister Phil Goff.

Mr Goff was speaking in Berlin at the New Zealand Tourism Awards at Europe's largest travel show, the ITB, held in Germany over this weekend.

"Close to 80,000 people a year are now visiting New Zealand from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and this number looks likely to grow. Germany is the third largest economy in the world and as its economy recovers its people are forecast to become the most travelled in the world.

"The long haul market in particular is growing strongly and New Zealand needs to fully tap into the potential this offers us.

"A strong foundation for promoting New Zealand is the 98 per cent satisfaction rate by Germans returning from a holiday to our country.

"New Zealand's reputation for spectacular scenery, 100% Pure, its film industry, and world-beating food and wine appeal strongly to the German market.

"The Working Holiday Scheme has been a real success story. From a small start of just 200 places four years ago, applications are likely to exceed 4500 in the coming year, and international student numbers are also growing steadily, to close to 2000 a year.

"In a highly competitive world market, New Zealand can never afford to be complacent. However, the qualities on offer in New Zealand and the excellent promotional work done by tourist operators in Germany promise a good future for travel out of Germany to New Zealand," Mr Goff said.
