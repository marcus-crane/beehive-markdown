NZAID, the government’s international aid and development agency, has contributed $500,000 through the World Bank managed Reform Trust Fund for the Palestinian Authority, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“The Palestinian Authority is internationally recognised as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.

“This funding is a tangible demonstration of New Zealand’s commitment to improving the lives of ordinary Palestinians living in poverty. The contribution will assist the Palestinian Authority to enhance its ability to exercise sound and responsible governance for its people.

"As is the case for all of New Zealand’s international aid, accountability mechanisms are built into this funding,” said Mr Peters.

A caretaker government is in place following the 25 January elections which delivered a solid victory to Hamas. The New Zealand government contribution will be directed to the Palestinian Authority caretaker government.

Mr Peters said that once the new Hamas-led Government was in place, consideration would be given to whether or not any further support was appropriate.

“As I have said before, the New Zealand Government considers the recent election result reflected the will of the Palestinian people and must be respected.

“The international community is strongly of the view that Hamas must renounce violence and recognise Israel’s parallel right to exist. Hamas needs to get on with the task of forming a government and getting to grips with a range of pressing challenges, " Mr Peters said.

Economic and security conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories mean the Palestinian Authority is heavily reliant on donor funding to be able to function.

Other donors to the Trust Fund include the European Commission, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and France.
