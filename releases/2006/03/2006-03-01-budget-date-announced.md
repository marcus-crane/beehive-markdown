Finance Minister Michael Cullen will deliver his seventh budget on Thursday 18 May.

"Budget 2006 will underline the government's commitment to transforming the economy. We need more globally competitive firms and this budget will continue efforts towards building a more dynamic, knowledge-based economy.

"A more affluent economy is essential if we are to deliver more choice and security for families young and old." said Dr Cullen.

"The first budget of the new Parliamentary term will reinforce the good progress this Labour-led government has made."

However, Dr Cullen reiterated that restraint would be the watchword for Budget 2006.

"As I have been saying for some time there is very little room for significant fiscal loosening. This government entered the last election with the tightest fiscal policy of any party and we intend to remain fiscally responsible."
