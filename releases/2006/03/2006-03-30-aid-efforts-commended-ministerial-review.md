New Zealand’s foreign aid efforts are on track and being well managed by NZAID, the government’s international aid and development agency, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.

“The Review which I have released today confirms that NZAID has made excellent progress in developing an aid programme that New Zealanders can be proud of.

“When the world faces such a huge disparity between poor and rich nations, not least in our own region of the Pacific, it is important that New Zealand has a credible and effective aid and development agency.

“The findings of the Ministerial Review tell us that NZAID is just that,” said Winston Peters.

NZAID was established in 2002 with the aim to bring a distinct profile and discipline to New Zealand’s aid efforts, at that time Cabinet instructed that the new agency be reviewed to assess progress towards that aim. Dr Marilyn Waring was appointed to carry out the Review and did so during 2004 and 2005.

“Dr Waring’s review validates the Government’s decision to establish the semi-autonomous body, NZAID, and suggests New Zealand’s role in the global effort to reduce poverty is in good hands.  
“NZAID has a staff of committed and focussed development professionals who have, over the last three years, dealt with significant organisational change whilst still successfully managing a growing aid budget. Everyone involved with NZAID should be very proud of the findings of this Review.  
“There is much to be done in the fight against poverty and to ensure our international aid efforts do make a difference standards must remain high. To this end, all recommendations made in the Review are either under consideration or have been implemented,” said Winston Peters  
New Zealand’s international aid efforts were also reviewed and commended by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in 2005.
