The annual inflation adjustment of petrol excise and road use charges for vehicles weighing 6 tonnes or less will take place on 1 April, Transport Minister David Parker said today.

The annual indexation, which was announced in February 2004, allows for the portion of petrol excise credited into the National Land Transport Fund and road user charges for 1 to 6 tonne vehicles to be increased by the rate of inflation each year.

“This means an increase of 0.708 cents per litre for petrol excise and an increase of 74 cents per 1000 kilometres for road user charges for diesel and heavy vehicles weighing six tonnes or less," Mr Parker said.
