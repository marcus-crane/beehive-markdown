Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker experienced the diverse nature of Fire Service work when he pays a visit to the Auckland Central Fire Station today.

"I've been looking forward to this, getting to see first hand how fires are tamed by outright professionals both paid and volunteers," said Mr Barker.

The visit was the first by Mr Barker since taking on the Internal Affairs Cabinet post and he said that the visit would be the first of many as he hoped to get around to as many of the professional and volunteer services as he could over the coming parliamentary term.

During his visit, Mr Barker saw fire appliances used for a wide variety of work from crash rescue and aerial firefighting to hazardous materials and supply of breathing apparatus.

Auckland firefighters will also put on a show, using their mobile kitchen fire demonstrator to show how not to put out a burning pot.

The demonstrator is used widely at public events to educate people about the dangers of using water on a fat fire and of unattended cooking.

"I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the fire service in Hastings for their work on Sunday this past weekend. They had done a sterling job and were on the scene within 2 minutes of the first call being received, this is what we expect of our fire service, they deliver, every time," said Mr Barker.
