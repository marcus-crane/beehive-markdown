A collaborative partnership between the Government and the wool industry is the way forward into predicted tough times for the industry, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton told the Meat and Wool New Zealand AGM in Hastings today.

The call comes after the announcement of the Wool Industry Network, launched as a Major Regional Initiative in Canterbury at the weekend. The network aims to assist the industry to increase the competitiveness and value of wool exports.

"A partnership focuses everyone with a stake in the industry on the top priorities for development. It means the Government does a better job of getting stuck in and clearing away the barriers," Mr Anderton said.

Mr Anderton said preliminary discussions with wool industry leaders had already been held. Some important partnership steps were already under way. One of the issues identified was the fragmentation of the industry.

Currently, wool faces a tough outlook. Production is down nearly a third since 1990, and wool exports have fallen from ten percent of merchandise trade exports to only 2.2 percent last year, partly due to a 17 percent increase in lamb meat production.

Wool production to expected to be relatively flat for the next five years, with wool export volumes set to remain at about 175,000 clean tonnes, though higher oil prices are expected to impact on the production of synthetic wool substitutes, and weaker exchange rates are expected to support wool prices.

"Our future lies in the steps that lift productivity and increase the value of our exports – science and research, innovation, marketing and always working on being customer-focused are the keys to future success and a collaborative leadership approach is a big part of that," Mr Anderton said.

"There are other issues that demand a partnership approach, including environmental, animal welfare, biosecurity and technical trade barriers, which the Government is committed to addressing," Mr Anderton said.
