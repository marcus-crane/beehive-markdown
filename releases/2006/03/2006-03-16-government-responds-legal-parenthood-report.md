Justice Minister Mark Burton today tabled in Parliament the Government response to the Law Commission Report, New Issues in Legal Parenthood.

"A child's welfare and the significance attached to being a parent are the primary factors to be considered in thinking about any law change in this area," he said.

"We want to ensure that all families have the support and choices they need to be secure and have the opportunity to reach their full potential."

The Law Commission's report was published in April 2005 and recommended a number of changes to the laws that determine parental status.

The report and the government response would help inform any future reform in this important area of law, though Mr Burton stressed that more work was needed to help determine what future steps would be taken.

"Any steps taken by the government to review parenthood laws will be carefully considered and taken with caution, due to the range and complexity of the issues involved," he said.

The Government will consider undertaking further work to implement some of the Law Commission’s recommendations, but no final decisions have been made. These areas are:

- Extending the presumption of paternity – would avoid discrimination on the basis of marital status, and provides a more logical basis for determining paternity of a child born after a couple separate;
- Enacting a minimum framework formalising consent requirements for DNA parentage testing – is desirable where test results will be used in court or by government agencies. Any changes to parentage testing law will require careful consideration;
- Making court orders to undergo parentage testing enforceable – may be preferable, however further consideration is required on the extent to which it is appropriate to compel the taking of bodily samples;
- Transferring parentage to implement surrogacy arrangements – currently, surrogate mother (and potentially her partner) is (are) child's legal parent(s) and adoption is currently the only way to transfer parenthood to intending parents, but is often not used.

"This government is committed to ensuring that New Zealand's families are secure and able to prosper. To do that the law needs to cope with some of the complexities of modern kiwi families," Mark Burton said.
