Acting Prime Minister Dr Michael Cullen said today that he was deeply saddened at the tragic death of Christian Peacemaker hostage Tom Fox.

Dr Cullen said that Tom Fox, along with Harmeet Sooden and their two colleagues have been in Iraq for the sole purpose of helping the Iraqi people.

"To see the peaceful mission meet this tragic end is beyond comprehension.

"The New Zealand government continues to put its full support behind the Canadian authorities in their work to secure the hostages' release," said Dr Cullen.

"Our thoughts are with Harmeet Sooden, his colleagues, and their families at this difficult time."
