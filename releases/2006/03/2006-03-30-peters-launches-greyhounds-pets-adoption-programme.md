Racing Minister Winston Peters says he's pleased to launch New Zealand's first Greyhounds As Pets adoption programme this evening.

The programme finds greyhounds homes after their racing careers, and is the first programme of its kind for the New Zealand racing industry.

"This is a very honourable and worthwhile programme and tribute is owed to the selfless volunteers who make Greyhounds As Pets possible," said Mr Peters.

"The programme is another example of greyhound racing being proactive. As well as undertaking the task of finding greyhounds homes after their racing careers, Greyhounds As Pets also plays an important role in educating the public about greyhounds, and hopefully overcoming common misconceptions held about this breed and greyhound racing.

"I have no doubt that Greyhounds As Pets will provide huge benefits to the greyhound industry and to the people who adopt these dogs as pets," concluded Mr Peters.
