Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker took up an invitation to visit Youthline in Auckland today.

"This is fantastic, the work that is done by the people working for Youthline is so important. Youthline was created out of a need identified in the 1970s where young people were not utilising important health and social services.

"Now days, Youthline is not just a health and social services directory, it performs the function of being a Youth development organisation, one of which we are very proud to support," said Mr Barker.

Youthline has established offices throughout New Zealand, has 40 full time staff, employs 50 contractors and attracts around 500 volunteers in the Auckland region alone.

Capacity is improving in the delivery of service to clients with over 80,000 calls a year being made to Youthline across New Zealand, of which Auckland receives 45,000 of those. The introduction of new technology and the implementation of a 24-hour service now mean that Youthline has the capacity to assist more people as they need it.

Services provided by the centres include Crisis Response Services, At-Risk Programmes, Developmental Programmes, Training Services and provides Community Development Processes that all focus on youth in New Zealand.

"I'm pleased government agencies such as the Department of Internal Affairs are able to contribute to such worthy undertakings. I have three teenagers myself and I know the challenges our youth face in a fast, competitive and sometimes ruthless world.

"The work done by Youthline saves lives, equips young people with the tools to succeed in the world and contributes to our communities in a meaningful way. The assistance of volunteers in particular is heartening and I hope this continues.

"As a former Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, a portfolio now held by my colleague Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, I am especially excited by the numbers of volunteers Youthline attracts and think it is fitting to highlight their contribution a week before Volunteers Week next week," said Mr Barker.
