New Zealand will continue to lead the world in the battle against torture with the introduction into Parliament today of the Crimes of Torture Amendment Bill, says Justice Minister Mark Burton.

"The Bill will enable New Zealand to ratify the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture, which has a strong focus on preventing the occurrence of this illegal and repugnant practice,” Mark Burton said.

The [Optional Protocol](http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cat/treaties/opcat.htm) establishes a system of regular visits to places of detention carried out by complementary international and national independent expert bodies, such as the Ombudsmen and Police Complaints Authority.

"Despite being prohibited under international law for over fifty years, torture still continues in many parts of the World, particularly within places of detention. Practical experience has shown that visits to detention facilities are one of the most effective means to prevent torture," Mark Burton said.

"The [Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20060261.txt) sends a clear message to all those who commit torture and other forms of ill-treatment that New Zealanders find these practices abhorrent and intolerable. Compliance with the Optional Protocol will reinforce New Zealand’s reputation for its strong commitment to human rights and encourages other states to follow New Zealand’s lead and stamp out torture."

New Zealand played a crucial role at the United Nations in developing the Optional Protocol and in doing so further cemented its place as a leader in the protection and promotion of human rights globally.

"This Bill is another example of how this government defends and advances international human rights in the multilateral environment. Torture cannot be tolerated and, with the collective efforts of the international community, it can be prevented.

“I am confident that this Bill will ensure that for generations of New Zealanders, now and in the future, torture will remain a remote possibility in a country that treats this practice with the contempt it deserves,” Mark Burton said.

In New Zealand there is already strong protection against torture under the [New Zealand Bill of Rights Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2030424618&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BFA765CE0%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) and the [Crimes of Torture Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2030424618&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BAC85F0A5%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC). Compliance with the Optional Protocol further complements this framework and provides concrete steps aimed at preventing this practice from occurring.
