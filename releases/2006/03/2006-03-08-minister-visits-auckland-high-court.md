Minister for Courts Rick Barker today visited the High Court at Auckland and inspected recent construction work undertaken to enable the court to meet the needs of Aucklander’s now and into the future.

Over the past two years a number of construction projects have been completed within the Auckland High Court, all designed to address an increased need for meeting and administration space.

“It is important that we work to ensure the needs of the Judiciary and the people of Auckland are met to enable the court to operate effectively and efficiently, both now and into the future,” said Mr Barker.

A key driver for the construction work has been factors like Auckland’s growing population and the increasing complexity of cases being heard before the High Court, both of which contribute to the need to make the most efficient use of existing space.

Since 2004, administrative office space at the High Court has been increased, eight new interview rooms have been constructed, three new judges chambers have been built, a new conference room has been added and the registry area has been re-fitted.

Mr Barker also met with the judiciary and Ministry of Justice officials to discuss future requirements for the operation and accommodation of the court and court staff. These discussions are based on a recently completed Ministry of Justice future needs analysis which takes into account factors like Auckland’s growing population and the increasing complexity of some cases.
