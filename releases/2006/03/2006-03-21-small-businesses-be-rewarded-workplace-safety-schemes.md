Over 180,000 small businesses which put workplace safety plans in place will soon be able to ask for a 10 per cent discount on their ACC levies.

From 1 April the government will introduce an ACC levy discount programme specifically aimed at small business employers and the self-employed in the agriculture, forestry, construction, road freight transport, motor trades, and in-shore fishing industry sectors.

“I’m delighted to offer government help to small businesses in these sectors which take workplace safety seriously,” said ACC Minister Ruth Dyson.

“A large proportion of small businesses and self employed people work in high risk industries and they are less able than a bigger business to cope with someone being away while they recover from an injury.

“These changes recognise that small business owners can take a few fairly simple steps to improve workplace safety – and there will be a financial incentive for doing so,” said Ms Dyson.

Eligible small businesses may apply to join the programme and if successful will receive a 10 per cent discount on their Employers' Account levy and/or Self Employed Work Account. ACC is working with industry associations and organisations to make workplace safety training available that is specifically tailored to suit small businesses in the relevant sectors.

“If a small business can show that it has identified workplace hazards and thought about how to manage them, and has staff who are experienced in health and safety and in emergency procedures, then it is likely to be a far safer place to work.

“This will benefit the business by making it more productive and profitable. ACC also benefits in the long term from reduced worker injuries in small businesses, and will give the business a discount on ACC levies,” said Ms Dyson.

**Questions and Answers**

**Which small businesses are eligible?**  
To participate in the workplace safety scheme that provides discounted ACC levies, the small business or self employed person must work in one of the following industry sectors: agriculture, forestry, construction, road freight transport, motor trades, or in-shore fishing.

To participate in the workplace safety scheme, the business or self employed person must also:

- have 10 or less full-time equivalent workers or liable earnings of no more than $380,000 a year;
- show they have relevant capability in hazard identification and management, injury and incident investigation, emergency readiness, and in training employees; and
- allow a possible site audit by ACC approved auditors.

**Why have just six industries been chosen to participate?**  
This scheme aims to reduce accidents and injuries and the six industry sectors selected are those with the greatest risks of injuries. These six sectors cover 42 per cent of all small businesses in New Zealand but have 61 per cent of the accidents and injuries.

**What benefits does a small business get from participating?**  
There are numerous benefits for a small business in participating in the scheme, including:

- a 10 per cent discount on ACC levies
- improved health and safety practices that lead to fewer work hours lost to injury
- greater opportunities to do work for organisations that require a documented health and safety system
- assistance with meeting obligations under the Health and Safety in Employment Act

**Can a business do anything to ensure it doesn’t miss out simply because it isn’t eligible at the beginning?**  
The discount on ACC levies applies to the whole year’s levies regardless of when in the year a business starts participating in the workplace safety scheme. For example, a business that joins the scheme in December 2006 will have its ACC levy discount backdated to the beginning of April 2006.
