Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor says he has already called for an investigation into a reported incident at Rimutaka Prison.

"It appears there was an electrical fault in the door of one cell housing two prisoners but at no stage was a prisoner able to leave the secure unit where they were confined, let alone able to reach the perimeter fence.

"Any such incident is of concern but I am assured by the Chief Executive of the Corrections Department that the facility is secure and that prisoners were not able to leave the unit. I have, however, called for an investigation into the incident.

"I have been assured that public safety was not at risk and the Department will continue to work to ensure community safety,” Mr O’Connor said.
