Labour MP and Associate Minister of Housing, Hon Dover Samuels will open  
a newly renovated house at 85 Otiria Road, Moerewa on Tuesday the 7th of  
March at 12.00pm.

In 2003 Housing NZ Corp made available $1.5 million to Ngati Hine Forestry  
Trust to purchase and renovate existing houses and construct up to 15 new homes for  
potential whanau homeowners in the region on general title and/or papakainga land.

"The retro fitting programme will significantly help with better health and financial  
outcomes for each whanau household, because of improved insulation and upgraded  
building materials used in the retrofitting programme, said Mr Samuels

The aim of the funding was to safeguard and extend the stock of social housing  
that is available to those on low incomes and with special needs, the property at  
Otiria Road is the first house that Ngati Hine Forestry Trust has completed renovating.

At 11.00am before Minister Samuels opens the newly renovated house in Moerewa, he will  
visit a renovated whare at 13-17 Commercial Street, Kawakawa.
