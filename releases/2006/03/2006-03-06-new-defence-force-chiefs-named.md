Major General Jerry Mateparae will be the new chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, and be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Major General Mateparae will serve in the position for three years from 1 May, replacing Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, whose term is ending.

Helen Clark and Phil Goff also announced the appointment of Major General Lou Gardiner as Chief of Army, and Air Commodore Graham Lintott as Chief of Air Force, at the rank of Air Vice Marshal, to take over from Air Vice Marshal John Hamilton.

Rear Admiral David Ledson has had his term as Chief of Navy extended to 30 April 2009, to bring the appointment into line with the other senior roles.

Helen Clark congratulated all the appointees on their new positions.

“Major General Mateparae has had a distinguished career and will serve New Zealand well as chief of the New Zealand Defence Force. I also congratulate Major General Gardiner and Air Commodore Lintott on their appointments.

"I'd also like to thank Air Marshal Ferguson and Air Vice Marshal Hamilton for the outstanding service they have given to the Defence Force over many years."

Phil Goff said the new Chief of Defence will be responsible for maintaining the current high standards of operational performance while at the same time managing and driving ahead the Defence Sustainability Initiative.

“He will continue towards the vision initiated by Air Marshal Ferguson of the Defence Force as being 'Three Services, One Force'."

Phil Goff said the State Services Commissioner was instructed by the government to manage the recruitment process to ensure a merit-based and professional process.
