Prime Minister and Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark congratulated the New Zealand-based films which won Oscars at the 2006 Academy Awards.

Helen Clark said it was a vote of confidence in New Zealand's strong film industry that movies filmed here won four major awards at the Academy Awards ceremony this evening.

"Who could have imagined a decade ago that two of the major blockbuster movies released pre-Christmas world wide would have been made in New Zealand by New Zealanders?" Helen Clark said.

"The major international investments in King Kong and the Narnia film were secured with the support of the Large Budget Screen Production Grant Scheme set up in 2003.

"I look forward to the success of New Zealand-made films in the future with the continuation of this Scheme.

"Congratulations to Peter Jackson, whose film, King Kong, filmed in Wellington, won Awards for Visual Effects, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing.

"Richard Taylor has won his fifth Oscar this evening with King Kong's Award for Visual Effects. New Zealand sound editors Michael Hedges and Hammond Peek also won awards for their work on King Kong.

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, directed by New Zealander Andrew Adamson, won an Oscar for Achievement in Makeup."
