Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today he was pleased the Corrections Department has moved to enhance the range of rehabilitation programmes it offers.

The department is to replace the 70-hour Straight Thinking programme and the 100-hour Mixed Programme (MPRO) with new programmes.

"It's an operational decision that was carefully considered," Mr O'Connor said.

"The decision will enable the department to provide new impetus to its extensive range of programmes. These are a vital part of the corrections system, and in the longer term provide benefit to the wider community.

"The department should be congratulated for taking decisive action as soon as it became clear some of the programmes were not working as well as they could. It is not an easy decision, given the long-standing commitment of its staff, who do their best at all times to rehabilitate offenders."
