The government will invest $1.76 million over the next three years to help a further six early childhood education centres research innovative approaches to teaching and learning, Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"Centres of innovation are helping early childhood education services around the country trial innovative programmes to improve the quality of learning outcomes for children," Steve Maharey said.

"Feedback from the first six centres of innovation already shows an improvement in quality in those centres, and has attracted international interest.

"These results are being shared across the sector to benefit other services.

"The six new centres will receive support and funding to research innovative practice and to disseminate the outcomes of their research.

The practices being researched include:

The inclusion of children with special needs in a mainstream setting·  
Learning and teaching through story telling and drama·  
The transition from the family home to an early childhood education service·  
Teaching children to learn and interpret messages and express themselves in a range of ways, including through ICT·  
Schools working with early childhood education services to focus on children's competencies and interests ·Teaching children to ask questions in order to generate working theories.

The government is investing $523 million this year to lift quality and improve access in early childhood education. Funding has increased by 60% since the Early Childhood Strategic Plan was launched in 2002 and is forecast to increase by a further 57% by the conclusion of the plan in 2012.
