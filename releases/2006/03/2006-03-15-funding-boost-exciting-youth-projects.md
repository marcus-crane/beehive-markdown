Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced that 12 projects, led by territorial authorities around New Zealand, had been selected to receive grants totaling $766,000 from the Ministry of Youth Development’s annual Youth Development Partnership Fund.

The fund aims to attract and encourage young people to get involved in their communities, through inventive, youth-friendly projects which teach valuable work, life and learning skills. Each project must demonstrate clear and measurable outcomes for young people, and be supported by other agencies in the community.

Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated the territorial authorities selected for funding, in partnership with the Ministry of Youth Development.

“These projects are reaching young people from rural, metropolitan and provincial communities around the country," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"Opportunities for young people involved in the projects are almost endless, through activities that support enterprise, research, team challenges, participation, and development of youth resources.”

Those selected to receive grants include: Far North District Council, Papakura District Council, Rotorua District Council, Gisborne District Council, Hamilton City Council, Palmerston North City Council, Rangitikei District Council, South Taranaki District Council, Wanganui District Council and Wellington City Council, Upper Hutt City Council, and Dunedin City Council,

A multi-agency selection panel considered 19 applications for the fund, before recommending 12 candidates. The selection process was independently reviewed, with the Minister selecting the final projects.
