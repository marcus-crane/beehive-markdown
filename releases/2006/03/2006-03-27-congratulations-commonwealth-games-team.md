Minister for Sport and Recreation Trevor Mallard today extended his congratulations to the New Zealand Melbourne Commonwealth Games team.

"Congratulations to all our athletes who have trained so hard over the last year, and longer, to compete in the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. It takes a certain determination, commitment and a lot of hard work to get to where you are now, and I commend your efforts," Trevor Mallard said.

"There have been some very impressive performances and while we haven't achieved the results I had initially expected, overall we have achieved at a very high level. I am proud of our achievements.

"As is usual after an international sports event such as the Commonwealth Games there will be a post-games debrief, run by Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC). This will provide the opportunity to ask the important questions of why we didn't perform as well as we had expected and what can be improved in the future, in particular for the Beijing Olympics 2008 and the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in 2010."

The New Zealand team brought home 31 medals, including six gold, 12 silver and 13 bronze, finishing ninth on the medals table.

Trevor Mallard said there were many wonderful highlights during the games.

"Particularly memorable were Nick Willis's 3 minute 38 second 1500 metre win, Moss Burmester winning our first gold in the 200 metre butterfly and the netballers' finale to the games. There were also unforgettable moments when our women triathletes finished in second, third and fourth place and of course winning gold medals in the rugby sevens, shot put, and trapshooting.

"I would like to acknowledge the work of the New Zealand Olympic Committee, particularly the chef de mission, Dave Currie, and everyone else who was involved in helping get our athletes to the games and supporting them while they were there."
