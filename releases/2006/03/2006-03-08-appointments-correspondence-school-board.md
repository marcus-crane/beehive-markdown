Education Minister Steve Maharey today announced appointments to the board of trustees of the Correspondence School.

Patricia McKelvey has been appointed as a new chair of the board, and Roger Drummond as a new board member. Four current board members, Russell Ballard, Claire Hague, Polly Schaverien, Roger Taylor and former chair, Ian McKinnon, have been re-appointed for a further term.

"These appointments will ensure the Correspondence School continues to be led by a board with the skills and experience needed to secure its future," Steve Maharey said.

"The Correspondence School has greatly improved its financial performance and educational delivery over the last two years, but there is further work to be done.

"The reappointment of five current members, along with two new members with considerable financial and management expertise, will ensure the school is well positioned to implement the ongoing programme of improvements.

"The government is strongly committed to the ongoing provision of an excellent distance education service. I am confident that the new board will continue with the good work currently going on at the school, and I look forward to seeing the results over the next two years."

Current board chair Ian McKinnon has indicated that his other responsibilities, particularly as a City Councillor, require him to seek a reduced time commitment in other activities. But in the interests of maintaining continuity he is happy to continue to serve on the Board, albeit in a different role.

The appointments are for two years effective from 10 April 2006.
