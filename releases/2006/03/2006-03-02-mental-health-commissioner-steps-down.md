Mr Hodgson said Mr Henare had made an important contribution to measures to improve the quality of mental health services in New Zealand.

“Bob’s commitment to improving the quality of mental health services and the collaborative approach he has taken in his work have provided great leadership for those working in the field of mental health.

“He has chaired the National Mental Health Workforce Development  
Co-ordinating Committee, the Auckland District Health Board’s Mental Health Services Review as well as being involved in development of the Commission’s Blueprint for Mental Health. These particular contributions have been invaluable, as has his championing of Maori, Asian and Pacific mental health development.

“He also continues to make a valuable contribution to health services in the Wellington region as Chair of the Capital and Coast District Health Board and to mental health workforce development through his directorship on Te Rau Matatini at Massey University.”  
A process to find Mr Henare's replacement is underway.
