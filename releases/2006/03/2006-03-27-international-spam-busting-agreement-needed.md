An international anti-spam agreement could strengthen spam-busting laws in individual countries, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

Opening the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) meeting in Wellington today, Mr Cunliffe noted that governments around the world were taking an increased interest in Internet issues.

While he had an "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach to the Internet's development independent of governments, it was essential governments were concerned with the health of the Net.

"The challenge facing the whole Internet community is to engage with governments in those areas where public policy can make a difference, whether it is anti-spam legislation or promoting competition in Internet access services," Mr Cunliffe said.

"I would like to explore the idea of a complementary multi-lateral approach to some Internet issues. I think the time is right for a discussion on how, globally, governments and stakeholders can effectively tackle issues like spam by working together.

"A number of countries do have anti-spam legislation. New Zealand's is currently in the legislative process but I believe that an international agreement would add credence to this.

"Once New Zealand's legislation is passed, it is likely that we will want to engage bilaterally with other countries on reciprocal measures. A multi-lateral approach could be both more effective against spammers and a more efficient use of resources. It is a concept that I would like to develop further. "

Mr Cunliffe introduced the spam-fighting Unsolicited Electronic Messages Bill to Parliament last June. It is currently before the commerce select committee. Submissions close on 31 March with the bill scheduled to be reported back to Parliament by 13 June.
