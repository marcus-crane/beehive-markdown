Minister for Courts, Rick Barker praised the work of the Auckland Coroners during a briefing on their work at the Auckland Mortuary today. Auckland is served by two full time coroners, Ms Sarn Herdson and Dr Murray Jamieson.

Mr Barker acknowledged the role of the coroners in Auckland is demanding, noting that the Auckland coronial district covers an area from Wellsford in the north to Meremere in the south with a population base of around 1.3 million.

“A coroner is on-call at all times, available to doctors and police officers every day of the year. The mortuary operates routinely six days a week and the coroner must deal with questions and calls from police, doctors and family members inquiring about mortuary procedures on a daily basis” said Mr Barker.

Mr Barker also acknowledged the educational work done by Dr Jamieson and Ms Herdson with the medical profession and the community.

“Reduced numbers of cases reported to the coroners and post-mortem examinations in the Auckland area have been attributed to the enhanced communication provided by the coroners to general practitioners and hospital doctors on completing medical certificates of cause of death”, said Mr Barker.

A large proportion of the coroners’ time is spent in preparation for inquest hearings and writing up of findings. Inquests are heard weekly in South Auckland and Auckland Central, and once a month in West Auckland and North Shore. These include contested hearings. In 2005, there were 281 routine inquests and 20 contested hearings.
