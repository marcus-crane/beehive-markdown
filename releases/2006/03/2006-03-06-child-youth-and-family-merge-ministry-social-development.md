The Department of Child Youth and Family Services (CYF) is to merge with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), the Minister of State Services, Annette King, the Minister of Social Development and Employment, David Benson-Pope and the Associate Minister of Social Development and Employment (Child Youth and Family), Ruth Dyson, announced today.

Annette King said that the resignation of the CYF Chief Executive had provided the State Services Commission an opportunity to consider options including a merger.

Ms Dyson said: “We value the inherently difficult and challenging work undertaken by CYF staff in order to care, or protect, the most vulnerable in our communities and we are committed to supporting that work in the future. The focus on professional development for CYF staff will continue.”

The State Services Commissioner will appoint the chief executive of MSD, Peter Hughes, to be the acting chief executive of CYF, to manage any transitional issues and continue current initiatives. Ruth Dyson will continue as Minister responsible for CYF.

David Benson-Pope said: “We need to bring all the levers together around CYFs – policy, services, other social agencies – and back them with MSD’s organisation and support.”

Once the merger process is complete the State Services Commissioner has advised he does not consider that the change in the Ministry of Social Development chief executive role is of such significance so as to require re-advertising of the position.

“I would like to thank the acting Chief Executive for CYF, Shenagh Gleisner, for capably managing the department in this interim period,” said Ms Dyson.

The merger will take effect from 1 July 2006.
