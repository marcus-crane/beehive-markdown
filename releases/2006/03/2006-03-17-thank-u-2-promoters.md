Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard is delighted that U2 promoters will give a full refund to fans who cannot attend the rescheduled concerts.

"I want to congratulate the promoters and thank them for acting honourably. They have undertaken to refund the price of the ticket - as well as the service fee - to fans who cannot attend the rescheduled concerts".

"As Consumer Affairs Minister it is heartening to see that they have done the right thing by New Zealand consumers. The promoters deserve recognition for this."

"I also want to acknowledge Air New Zealand and Qantas for agreeing to transfer non-refundable flights to the concerts and waiving the change fees."

"Many hotels and accommodation-providers have also come to the party and are transferring bookings or refunding money. I strongly encourage other providers to do the same. So my advice to fans is to is to check the terms and conditions of their booking and then talk to their accommodation provider."
