Jim Anderton responded today to a petition with 7000 signatures which is due to be presented to Parliament today, calling for a select committee inquiry into the reclassification of party pills.

"I would like to tell National MP Jacqui Dean who is presenting the petition to stop spreading misinformation for short-term political gain. She has confused so many people, that only last week I saw a newspaper article quoting a South Island Mayor calling on the government to stop the sale of party pills to those under 18 years of age, which we have done already," Jim Anderton said.

"Ms Dean herself wrote asking that the government make funding available for research into BZP, when it had already been announced last year that government funding was already supporting three research projects.

"All 7000 signatories and all those other New Zealanders concerned about party pills, should be assured that this government has acted, is acting and will continue to act to ensure these products are appropriately dealt with.

"The Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs will reassess BZP party pills as soon as all the research has been completed, which I am advised will be between June to November this year.

"If the research evidence supports more regulation then we will put more in place. If it supports banning these products then I will immediately recommend that Parliament does just that.

"Re- assessment by an expert committee established by statute to consider the classification of drugs based on the evidence, is preferable in my view to a select committee inquiry.

"Even Ms Dean has been quoted as saying that “it was best if party pills were properly investigated so the decision (to ban) was sound”

"The fact is that party pills are on track to be properly investigated by experts and decisions based on research results will be made" Jim Anderton said from Wellington today.
