Labour MP Dover Samuels is calling on iwi organisations in Te Tai Tokerau to consider assisting their members by taking an active role in supporting the government's KiwiSaver scheme.

"There is scope for contributions from third parties and I encourage Iwi organisations to consider participating in the scheme."

"KiwiSaver is a scheme targeted at modest wage earners who are struggling to save for deposits to buy their first homes and their retirement. I am satisfied that KiwiSaver will be welcomed in Northland and with support and lateral thinking from a range of stakeholders it will help those at flax roots level," said Dover Samuels.

KiwiSaver members are required to put aside 4 or 8 percent of their gross salary to qualify for the scheme over five years. This could result in the government contributing $5000 for singles or $10,000 per couple toward the costs of buying a first home.

"Since becoming government in 1999 Labour has led a sustained attack on unemployment which has resulted in the lowest rates in the OECD, and the lowest Maori unemployment rate in history. While there is room for improvement we also want to boost homeownership rates, and saving which will also have a positive impact on whanau.

"We are serious about lifting Maori achievement rates and KiwiSaver is an important tool in addressing inequalities.

"Iwi organisations are set to control significant cash and assets from settlements and I encourage them to consider initiatives like KiwiSaver that can make a real difference for Northland whanau," said Dover Samuels.
