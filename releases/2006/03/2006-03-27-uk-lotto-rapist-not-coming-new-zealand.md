A London newspaper report that "Lotto rapist" Iorworth Hoare has been given approval to move to New Zealand is wrong, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Immigration officials can find no record of Hoare applying to come to New Zealand, Mr Cunliffe said.

"If he did apply, I am happy to give an assurance as minister that he would not be allowed to come here, whether to visit or settle."

The News of the World newspaper said yesterday that the British Home Office "and authorities in New Zealand" had agreed to let Hoare come here using a new identity.

"I ordered my officials to investigate that report as soon as I learned of it and I have been assured it has no foundation," Mr Cunlffe said.

Hoare, whose record reportedly includes rape, attempted rapes and indecent assault, was freed last year after serving 16 years of a life sentence. He is known as the "Lotto rapist" because he won £7 million from a Lotto ticket he bought while on day release from jail.

Hoare has to date not approached the Department of Labour, which manages New Zealand’s immigration services, Mr Cunliffe said. Nor was there any record of him having visited New Zealand.

"The department of Labour is liaising with UK officials to determine this individual’s status and identity.

“Once we’ve established his identity and confirmed his criminal record, we will put a red flag up against his name, which will come up if he tries to come into New Zealand. A person with this sort of criminal record is not welcome here.”
