"We know there are a huge number of people who are doing amazing work and we need to recognise that. The Green Ribbon Awards acknowledge the work done towards environmental sustainability.

"Everyday I hear about people, organisations and businesses making a difference to the environment. The Green Ribbon Awards are about celebrating these achievements and inspiring others to get involved.

"The Award winners show all of us how everyone can make a big difference through their commitment and hard work," David Benson-Pope said.

Categories for this year's awards include:

- urban sustainability
- rural sustainability
- caring for our water - fresh and seawater
- sustainable business
- young people making a difference
- community action for the environment

Nominations close on 31 March 2006. The winners will be announced at a presentation ceremony on 6 June 2006.
