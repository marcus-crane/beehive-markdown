The Minister of Statistics Clayton Cosgrove is reminding everyone in New Zealand that they must be counted by taking part in the 2006 Census today, Tuesday 7 March 2006.

The census is New Zealand’s official count of population and dwellings and relies on everyone participating.

"No matter where you are in New Zealand today you need to participate in the census, which provides a vital stock-take of this country's social and cultural makeup," says Mr Crosgrove.

"It is a vital tool for planning the country's future needs, for instance housing, infrastructure, business and community needs.”

If you are in New Zealand on Census Day but away from home, then census forms are available at hotels, motels and other commercial accommodation. Those people wanting to fill them out online can access the necessary PIN numbers there also.

"People can complete census forms on paper or via the Internet. The 2006 Census is the first time New Zealanders have the option of filling in census forms online at [www.stats.census2006.govt.nz](www.stats.census2006.govt.nz)," says Mr Cosgrove.

Visitors to New Zealand must also fill out 2006 Census forms but anyone out of the country today does not have to take part.

Around 6,500 census collectors have been delivering the census forms to households since 20 February. People who haven't received the forms can still telephone the toll-free helpline 0800 CENSUS (0800 236 787), and they will be delivered.

Census staff will be collecting the completed forms over the next 11 days, starting from tomorrow, 8 March 2006.
