The government today released for consultation the Auckland Road Pricing Evaluation Study, which looks at long term options for addressing Auckland's traffic congestion.

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister David Parker presented the study at the Auckland Mayoral Forum. The government commissioned the study in 2004 following recommendations from the Auckland Joint Officials Group, which looked at Auckland's transport issues.

Mr Parker said the study examines five potential road-pricing and parking levy schemes for addressing Auckland's traffic congestion long-term but does not make any final recommendations.

"The government has an open mind and has not taken a position on this. Depending on what comes out of the consultation process, the government may decide to look at the options further or decide to take no further action.

"That is why it is important that Auckland has its say because congestion is a major issue for the city, as it is in most large cities," Mr Parker said.

"The government is spending more than ever before on roads and public transport, but Auckland vehicle numbers and population are also growing. Current projections show that by 2016 congestion is unlikely to improve without additional measures. "

A six-week consultation period starts today and ends on 28 April. Submissions can be made to the Ministry of Transport, which will be consulting with local government, business groups, non-government organisations and the public.

The ministry will then report back to ministers on the outcome of the consultation.
