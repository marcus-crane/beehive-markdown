This year’s seasonal influenza vaccine has arrived in New Zealand on schedule allowing most clinics to begin immunisation this week, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

“I strongly urge people to get their seasonal influenza immunisation, particularly those who are most vulnerable and at high risk of complications," Pete Hodgson said. "For these people, influenza can be a serious and potentially fatal disease.

“Immunisation is our best protection. Being fit, active and healthy does not protect you against influenza – it's easily spread and anyone can catch it."

Influenza vaccination is free for high-risk New Zealanders - people aged 65 and over and those with long-term health conditions such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The subsidised immunisation programme is available until 30 June. The influenza virus changes each year so it’s important that people are immunised annually to gain protection from the strains most likely to circulate.

The new vaccines are expected to give the best protection against the strains of influenza, designated by the World Health Organization, likely to be circulating in New Zealand in 2006.

Immunisation against seasonal influenza is recommended by the Ministry of Health as part of its preparation for pandemic influenza.

National Influenza Strategy Group spokesperson and virologist, Dr Lance Jennings said recently that although seasonal influenza immunisation will not protect people from pandemic flu, it was essential that people were aware of the seriousness of influenza in light of the potential for a pandemic virus to emerge.

“By increasing the immunisation rates we can protect more people from seasonal influenza and ensure that systems for the use and distribution of influenza vaccines are able to operate on a large scale in the event of a pandemic,” Dr Jennings said.
