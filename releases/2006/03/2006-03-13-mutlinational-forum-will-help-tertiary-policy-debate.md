Leading tertiary education experts from six countries will be welcomed to New Zealand this week by Minister for Tertiary Education Dr Michael Cullen.

They are in Wellington for a three-day forum from 15 to 17 March 2006 to discuss current trends and issues, such as how to promote life-long learning, and what the balance between government, learner and employer funding for tertiary education should be.

"The forum is well-timed, given the progress that New Zealand is making with its tertiary education system and the thinking going on at the moment about the sector’s future," said Dr Cullen.

"The forum is a great opportunity for the sharing of experience and ideas. I am confident the outcomes of discussion will contribute towards ensuring tertiary education policy development across the world is well-informed, and delivers against different governments’ objectives for economic, environmental and social development.”

The forum, held at Te Papa Tongarewa, is being hosted by New Zealand's Tertiary Education Commission. It has attracted senior managers from public funding agencies, government policy departments and educational institutions from the USA, England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia and Canada, as well as New Zealand.
