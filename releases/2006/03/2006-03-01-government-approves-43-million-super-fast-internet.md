Funding of $43 million to establish the [Advanced Network](http://www.morst.govt.nz/?CHANNEL=IT%20INFRASTRUCTURE&PAGE=IT%20Infrastructure) - a super high-speed internet link between universities and research organisations in New Zealand and overseas - was announced today by Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

The Advanced Network will connect New Zealand universities and research institutes through a fibre-optics network that is 400 times faster than domestic broadband. The network will also provide a connection to international networks through links between New Zealand, Australia and the United States.

"An investment in infrastructure like the Advanced Network is crucial to ensuring New Zealand is able to attract and retain the best scientists and researchers," Steve Maharey said.

"The Advanced Network will significantly enhance the range and quality of research we are able to do in New Zealand. Our scientists and researchers will have access to new tools and techniques and will be able to participate in real time collaborations with colleagues around the world.

"The network will comprise an optical network 'backbone' linking Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin as well as connections to the Hawkes Bay, Nelson and Rotorua."

The Advanced Network will allow:

- Researchers to share computing power and high-cost instruments, as well as rapidly download huge quantities of data
- Real-time videoconferencing and video-streaming to deliver course material and lectures at a distance
- New Zealand scientist will be linked to international networks, for example engineers, geologists and geophysicist will be linked to the international [Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation](http://it.nees.org/) (NEESgrid)

The $43 million of funding announced today will cover the costs of the Network during the establishment period - expected to be around four years - after which the costs will be covered by users.

The Network is expected to be up and running by the second half of this year.
