New Zealand is to send ten election observers to Solomon Islands as part of an international observer mission for the coming elections, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

The observers will be part of a 50-member observer team coordinated by the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division at the invitation of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sir Allan Kemakeza and the Electoral Commission.

National elections will be held in Solomon Islands on 5 April, the first since December 2001.

“We wish the people of the Solomon Islands well in their elections,” Mr Peters said.

“These are the first elections since the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands was set up in 2003 to help stem the ongoing civil unrest and restore law and order.

“The fact elections are being held illustrates the progress being made in adhering to the principles of good governance there, and New Zealand is happy to support these efforts,” he said.

The New Zealand team will be joined by representatives from Australia, Japan, the United States, the Commonwealth and the Pacific Islands Forum.

The team includes observers from government agencies, non-government organisations and four MPs, Brian Donnelly, Metiria Turei, John Hayes and Moana Mackey.
