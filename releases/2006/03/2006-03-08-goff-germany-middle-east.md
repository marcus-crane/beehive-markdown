Trade Minister Phil Goff leaves for Hannover, Germany, tomorrow where he will support New Zealand companies attending CeBIT 2006, the world's largest international information and communications technology trade fair.

Mr Goff will then travel on to the Middle East to hold the latest round of regular bilateral talks with counterparts in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

En route to Hannover, Mr Goff will speak at a New Zealand Tourism awards dinner in Berlin, which coincides with the Berlin Travel Fair.

At CeBIT the Minister will welcome Lower Saxony's State Prime Minister Christian Wulff to the New Zealand Pavilion, and host an event promoting New Zealand's expertise in interactive technology.

"This trade fair is a tremendous opportunity for New Zealand's high-tech companies to show they are producing world-leading products," Mr Goff said.

"Last year CeBIT attracted over 6200 exhibitors from 70 countries, and nearly half a million visitors, including many investors and buyers from around the world.

"New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will also have a strong presence at CeBIT to reinforces its 'New Zealand, New Thinking' branding, which aims to build international recognition of New Zealand as creative, innovative and high-tech.

"NZTE's support for New Zealand exhibitors in Hannover underlines the government's commitment to helping high-growth, export-oriented companies establish strong positions in international markets."

In the Middle East, Mr Goff's talks will focus on trade opportunities in areas such as information and communications technology, agriculture, education, tourism, investment, marine technology, and construction.

He will meet a number of New Zealand companies working in the region, and visit the recently established Dubai Technology Oasis Beachhead, an initiative set up by NZTE in response to exporters' needs.

“The Dubai centre acts as a base for exporters trying to establish operations or build market share in the region. The first companies moved into it late last year and are already making gains from the Beachhead programme."

Mr Goff will also make calls on his Defence Minister counterparts in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
