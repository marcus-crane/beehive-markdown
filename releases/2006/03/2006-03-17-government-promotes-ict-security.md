Information and communication technologies must be protected from increasing security threats, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

Releasing a discussion paper today on ICT safety and security issues, Mr Cunliffe said there was a need for greater awareness and the taking of new security measures by all participants in the information society.

The Ministry of Economic Development discussion paper, [A Strategic Consideration of ICT Security and Confidence in New Zealand,](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____18167.aspx) has been produced as part of the ongoing work associated with the Digital Strategy, which the minister launched last year.

“Ensuring a high degree of safety and security, and therefore confidence, in the use of information and communications technologies is critical if we want all New Zealanders to use ICT, and to benefit from it," Mr Cunliffe said.

The paper takes a comprehensive look at current ICT safety and security-related issues in New Zealand, and suggests possible areas for further action. It seeks people’s views on what they see as the important issues, and what the Government should be focusing on in this area the next few years.

“Submissions will be used as input to the development of government policy in this important area,” said Mr Cunliffe.

The paper is mainly for key agencies and organisations in both the public and private sectors. However, anyone with an interest in these issues is welcome to make a submission.

It is expected that priority areas for further work and consultation will be identified following the analysis of submissions.

Submissions close on 13 April 2006.
