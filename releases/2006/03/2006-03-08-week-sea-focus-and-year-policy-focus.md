Environment Minister David Benson-Pope is encouraging New Zealanders to get involved in the range of activities taking place around the country during Seaweek (5-12 March).

“The sea is a very important part of life for many New Zealanders, and a resource which has to be protected and enhanced,” David Benson-Pope said.

“Seaweek is an opportunity for everyone to think below the surface to our oceans; including the creatures, minerals, plants and seascape and about how we can protect this precious environment.

“The Ministry for the Environment has created pages on its website for children to read about our oceans and to ask questions during Seaweek and beyond, so they too can understand the value of our ocean environment.

“Events are taking place around the country and include guided snorkeling events, photography competitions, carnivals, sand sculpture competitions, and talks on aspects of the marine environment.”

Mr Benson-Pope said the government has restarted work on forming an Oceans Policy to manage New Zealand’s entire marine environment, from the shoreline to the edge of the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and to the continental shelf beyond.

“In July I will take the policy proposals to New Zealanders to discuss how they feel our oceans can be best managed.

“There are currently 18 agencies working with different demands and laws for our oceans, but we don’t have a national direction for future management. It is now imperative to set up a more strategic approach to managing this resource.”

The government intends to complete the policy by the end of this year.

“I want the Oceans Policy to be a flagship of sustainable development in action, and a means of optimising the value of our oceans to New Zealand,” said David Benson-Pope.
