The outrageous abuse hurled at Tony Blair by Tau Henare is a further example of National's undisciplined and inept attitude towards foreign policy, says Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

Speaking on Newstalk ZB yesterday Mr Henare, now seemingly a self appointed foreign affairs spokesperson, called Mr Blair an "absolute liar" and a man that he "couldn't stand" (despite admitting that he had never met him) among other insults.

Mr Henare's outburst was so appalling that Paul Holmes asked him if he had "lost his marbles".

Mr Henare's commotion follows on the back of novice MP John Hayes' misinformed and bizarre attack on the Tokelau's and Nuie earlier this year.

"Some might say that because in this instance the culprit was the attention seeking Mr Henare, who is not taken seriously by anybody on any issue he speaks about, no harm was really done.

"But it is about time the National's so-called Foreign Affairs spokesperson Murray McCully took some control of his party's direction on foreign affairs, before his rogue colleagues do some permanent damage.

"These uncontrolled outbursts by maverick MPs do not auger well for Mr McCully as he tries to build some credibility in his portfolio by following me around the Pacific with his leader in tow. He would be best advised to get his caucus under control and to get them singing from the same song sheet first," concluded Mr Peters.
