The Minister for Transport Safety, Hon Harry Duynhoven, today welcomed Parliament’s passing of the Land Transport Amendment Bill last night under urgency.

The legislation will allow passenger service drivers who have had their passenger endorsements expired due to convictions for comparatively minor sex offences to apply to the Director of Land Transport to have their endorsements reinstated.

“The legislation will also allow new applications for Passenger endorsements to be made in the future by those with convictions for specified offences, although these will be considered against tight criteria,” said Mr Duynhoven.

The legislation passed last night:

- Extends the ability to apply for passenger endorsement reinstatement to those with convictions for sex offences who were not sentenced to a period of imprisonment of more than 12 months; and
- Allows new applications for passenger endorsements from people with offences specified in section 29A of the Land Transport Act, as long as they were not sentenced to a period of imprisonment of more than 12 months.

“I am confident that this legislation strikes the right balance between ensuring the safety and security of the travelling public and the ability of those with convictions for less serious offences to apply to have their endorsements reinstated,” said Mr Duynhoven.

“It is also appropriate and consistent that those with what could be viewed as more minor offences should be able to apply for passenger endorsements in the future. However, it should be noted that the criteria that the Director will consider when considering people with these sorts of convictions is very tight, and the risk to public safety is the primary criteria in making a decision.

“Now that the legislation has been passed, I look forward to the Director making some swift decisions in respect of those applying for reinstatement so that, if cleared, those affected can go back to driving passengers,” Mr Duynhoven said today.

People who will be affected by this legislation will be advised as soon as possible regarding the appropriate process for applying to the Director for consideration.
