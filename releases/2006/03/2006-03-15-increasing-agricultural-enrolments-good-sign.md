A large jump in agriculture and related land-based course enrolments at Lincoln University is a sign of faith and increasing confidence by young people in the sector, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton says.

Enrolments in agriculture science and agriculture courses at Lincoln were up 20 percent last year over 2004, and are up again this year by about 24 percent over 2005.

"Enrolments in agriculture and related land-based courses always act as something of a barometer of confidence in the industry, and of the industry's ability to provide rewarding career paths for young people," Mr Anderton said.

"The backbone of our economy is based on primary industries, and over the last 15 years agriculture, forestry and related industries have outperformed the rest of our economy. There are huge opportunities in this country for talented young people. These figures are a sign that young people have faith in the future of their country."
