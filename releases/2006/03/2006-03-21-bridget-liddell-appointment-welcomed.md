The appointment of New Zealand businesswoman Bridget Liddell as chair of the United States Beachheads Advisory Board was welcomed today by Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard.

The Beachhead Programme, run by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), is aimed at helping exporters into their key markets overseas. It offers a customised programme that includes input and expertise from New Zealand and offshore. The advisory boards comprise highly successful local business leaders who have developed a wealth of knowledge and are committed to assisting New Zealand companies to succeed in the offshore market.

Bridget Liddell is based in Seattle, Washington, and is the principal of consulting firm, Antipodean Equity, which offers advisory services to New Zealand and Australian businesses seeking access to the United States market.

Trevor Mallard said confirmation of Bridget Liddell’s appointment by the NZTE board was excellent news for businesses coming into the Beachheads programme.

"Securing the support of business people of this calibre for our Advisory Boards is critical to the success of the Beachheads Programme.

"Having access to Bridget’s enormous expertise and experience will give companies entering the United States market a real boost and will build on the outstanding work done by the previous board."

The Beachheads Advisory Boards provide mentoring, feedback and monitoring to selected high performing companies seeking growth through entry to offshore markets. Advisory Boards are already operating successfully in the United States and United Kingdom and are being introduced progressively to other Beachhead locations.

Seventy New Zealand companies are on the Beachheads programme, with 35 joining in the last year, and including 25 companies on the US Beachheads Programme. The programme, which began in 2002, aims to accelerate the growth of New Zealand companies by linking them into global connections and supporting them to establish and expand their offshore operations. Beachheads are in key locations around the world including Singapore/Asia, UK/Europe, US/Canada/Sth America, Fort Lauderdale-Marine, Dubai, Tokyo/Japan and further expansion is planned to meet the increasing demand.

Comment from Bridget Liddell and other background information follows.

Bridget Liddell - chair of United States Beachheads Advisory Board

Bridget Liddell has been a director of New Zealand public companies, Sky City Ltd and Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Ltd. Her other past governance roles include Industry New Zealand, Competitive Auckland Ltd. and Auckland Uniservices Ltd. She has also held a variety of management positions including general manager of Carter Holt Harvey Plastic Products.

Prior to her departure from New Zealand in 2003, Bridget was chief executive of University of Auckland Development and a former member of the University of Auckland council. Bridget holds post graduate degrees in english and economics and is a qualified chartered financial analyst. She was awarded a Harkness Fellowship in 1999.

Bridget is also chair of the US Friends of the University of Auckland and a director of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

"I am delighted to be taking up this key advisory role as we focus more on the importance of international linkages to New Zealand’s future. There are significant opportunities in the US market for high growth New Zealand companies who have access to the right advice and assistance," Bridget Liddell said.

"The US market is a complex one characterised by some very powerful barriers to new entrants, particularly in terms of access to ‘clever capital’ and core business networks.

"Capital and networks cleverly deployed are hugely important strategic weapons – networked capital can create partnerships and synergies with others at adjacent points in the value chain. Conversely lack of access to the right networks can render even the most attractive entry strategy and the most innovative customer value proposition ineffective.

"As the US Beachhead Board, we are dedicated to utilising our networks and expertise to help find the optimal entry point for New Zealand companies selected for the programme and to providing support during and after the entry phase.

"Globalisation is a race and only the best prepared will succeed."
