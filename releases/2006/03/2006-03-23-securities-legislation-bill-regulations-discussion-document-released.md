Minister of Commerce Lianne Dalziel said submissions on the content of proposed regulations under the Securities Legislation Bill are being called for by the Ministry of Economic Development.

The Securities Legislation Bill is designed to encourage investment in New Zealand’s capital markets by strengthening the regulatory framework embodied in securities, securities trading, and takeovers laws. It is expected that the Bill will be passed into law later this year.

Regulations will be required once the new securities legislation comes into force to ensure the new regime is sufficiently flexible and able to be updated to address new developments in securities markets, particularly relating to insider trading and market manipulation exemptions which deal with market efficient conduct.

A discussion document has been published, which seeks feedback on:

- whether regulations should be made requiring investment advisers and brokers: to make additional disclosures; meet a minimum level of professional indemnity insurance; and comply with certain content requirements or requirements prescribing the form of disclosure; and whether there should be exemptions from compliance with the disclosure obligations in certain circumstances (for example, where advice is given over the phone or in a public forum);
- whether exemptions should be given from the new insider trading and market manipulation regimes in order to prevent market efficient behaviour from being inadvertently caught under the regimes, particularly exemptions for passive index funds, market stabilisation arrangements, short selling and other matters; and
- minor amendments to the current Substantial Security Holder Regulations to make them consistent with the changes contained in the Securities Legislation Bill.

The deadline for submissions on the discussion document is 21 April 2006. It is available on line at: [http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC\_\_\_\_18247.aspx&lt;\\a&gt;](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____18247.aspx)
