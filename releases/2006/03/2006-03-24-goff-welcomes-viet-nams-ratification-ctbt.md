Viet Nam’s ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has brought the world a step closer to a ban on nuclear explosions, Disarmament Minister Phil Goff said today.

“The entry into force of the CTBT is a priority for New Zealand, and Viet Nam is one of the states whose ratification is needed before that can happen," Mr Goff said.

The CTBT, which has over 170 signatories, prohibits all nuclear explosions. However the Treaty can only enter into force after all 44 states regarded as having nuclear capabilities – as listed in Annex 2 of the Treaty – have ratified it.

There are now ten Annex 2 states remaining to ratify the Treaty.

“Viet Nam’s ratification has now brought us one step closer to having the ban on nuclear explosions in force under international law. Viet Nam has set an important example for those states that have yet to ratify the CTBT.

“It is particularly satisfying that a state in our region has chosen to ratify the Treaty. I would urge all states especially those listed in Annex 2 to follow Viet Nam’s lead and to do their part to bring the Treaty into force,” Mr Goff said.

Annex 2 states that have ratified the Treaty:  
Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Democratic People’s Republic of Congo, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Viet Nam.

Annex 2 states yet to ratify the Treaty:  
China (signed in 1996), Colombia (1996), Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt (1996), India, Indonesia (1996), Iran (1996), Israel (1996), Pakistan, United States (1996).
