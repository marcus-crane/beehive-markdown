Rt Hon Winston Peters today announced the appointment of Warren Bell and Alistair Sutherland, and the reappointment of Thayne Green and Jim Wakefield to the governing body of the New Zealand Racing Board.

Messrs Sutherland, Wakefield and Green are appointed on the nomination of the racing code bodies - New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing, Harness Racing New Zealand and the New Zealand Greyhound Racing Association, respectively.

Mr Bell was appointed on the advice of the statutory nomination advisory panel, convened in accordance with the Racing Act 2003.

Mr Peters said Mr Bell, the chairman of Hallenstein Glasson, would bring a great deal of commercial expertise to the board table and the code-nominated appointees would collectively bring considerable racing industry knowledge as well as additional business skills.

“These appointments, together with the incumbents, will ensure that the New Zealand Racing Board has members of the highest calibre. The Board has a great opportunity to be at the forefront of the revitalisation of New Zealand racing,” said Mr Peters.

Other members of the New Zealand Racing Board governing body are chairman Warren Larsen, Julie Crengle and Alan Jackson. Their terms expire at the end of the current racing season, and they are eligible for reappointment. The process for making appointments to these positions will commence soon.
