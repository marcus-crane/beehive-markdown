New Zealand’s information technology has impressed both German hosts and other exhibitors at the world’s largest trade show, CeBIT, in Hanover, Germany, says Trade Minister Phil Goff.

Mr Goff hosted State Prime Minister Christian Wulff at the New Zealand exhibition this week.

“The Prime Minister was impressed both with the creativity and innovation in New Zealand’s ICT sector and the performance of New Zealand’s economy.

“New Zealand’s unemployment at 3.6 per cent is not only the lowest in the OECD but also less than a third of that in Germany.

“Prime Minister Wulff was familiar with the economic changes which have been made in New Zealand and is keen to visit New Zealand which he sees as a role model for Germany and his own state of Lower Saxony.

“New Zealand’s reputation in Germany is based on its efficient productive and high quality agricultural production. Our exports to Germany are predominantly in this sector.

“But CeBIT provided the opportunity to also showcase New Zealand’s world-class technology sector,” Mr Goff said.

“Sponsored by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, the New Zealand exhibition enables small and medium-sized ICT companies to promote their products, network and develop partnerships with leading ICT players.

“Good business has been done this year and last. Prolificx, a New Zealand company dealing in integrated in-vehicle computer management systems has entered into a multi-million dollar partnership with Oracle Corporation.

“Provenco, a global supplier of smart technology to the fuel industry has secured a big contract with Shell for the supply of outdoor payment terminals for its retail service station network.

“ICT in New Zealand is now a major industry and exporter earning $5.6 billion or 5.1 per cent of GDP. It employs over 44,000 employees.

“CeBIT was the opportunity to develop further sales opportunities to contribute to the already fast growing ICT exports from New Zealand and significant job growth.

“NZTE and the 13 New Zealand exhibitors deserve credit for the growth and innovation that will play a key role in the transformation of New Zealand’s economy, and for the professionalism of their presentation,” Mr Goff said.

Exhibiting at CeBIT are: Human Interface Technology (HITlab), Mako Networks, Maximum Availability, Next Window, Prolificx, Provenco, SimWorks, Unlimited Realities, Vcomms, Immigration NZ, Investment New Zealand, Real Recruitment, and Phitek.
