The West Auckland painted apple moth and Mt Wellington fall webworm moth populations have been declared eradicated, Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

He thanked Aucklanders for their patience during the programmes.

"Both pests could have cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars if they became widely established. I certainly appreciate the support and understanding shown by the people of western Auckland, Mt Wellington and surrounding suburbs.

"This campaign has been supported by a huge amount of science and is a credit to the many people involved, including those who have developed the tools to assist ongoing monitoring and determine the origin of any moths that are detected in the future, Mr Anderton said.

Declaring an eradication requires that no pests from the original population are detected for two years. No moths linked to the original populations have been detected in these areas for two years.

"There have been new finds of individual moths in other parts of Auckland over the past two years. These are likely to have been new arrivals, and thus far do not indicate evidence of any established populations warranting action.

"Even with our best efforts there is still a possibility these pests could continue to arrive in the future. Tools developed during the campaign, like stable isotope testing, DNA analysis, sterile insect techniques and moth population models will be invaluable," Mr Anderton said.

[Painted apple moth](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/pest-and-disease-response/pests-and-diseases-watchlist/painted-apple-moth/) was first found in West Auckland in 1999 and aerially treated 69 times between 1999 and 2003. It is native to Australia and feeds on a wide variety of plant species, posing a risk to native and plantation forests, crops and amenity plantings.

MAF estimated its potential economic impact at between $58 million to $356 million over 20 years if it became widely established, not counting potential impacts on market access or the conservation estate. It cost $ 62.4 million to eradicate.

A colony of [Fall web worm moth](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/pests-diseases/forests/fall-webworm/), a significant pest in North America also found in Europe and Asia, was detected in Mt Wellington in March 2003 and ground treated. MAF estimated its potential economic impact at between $19 to $83 million over 20 years, with likely impacts on amenity plantings, horticulture, erosion control and shelter species. It cost $6.7 million to eradicate.

The announcement means that all vegetation controls that were in place will be lifted from midnight tonight. Trapping and monitoring will continue.
