Conservation Minister Chris Carter is to lead New Zealand's delegation to COP 8, the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Curitiba, Brazil.

The meeting, which occurs every two years, provides a crucial forum to discuss ways to improve the protection of the world's biodiversity. Over 50 ministers attended the convention's meeting in 2004.

Mr Carter will take part in the ministerial segment of the meeting, and co-chair a session. He will also co-host and speak at a High Level Side Event on island biodiversity with the President of Palau. The aim of this event is to promote discussion about what New Zealand has achieved in island restoration, and the opportunities this offers for island conservation around the world.

"The UN Convention is the most important convention on biodiversity in the world," Mr Carter said.

"New Zealand has traditionally maintained a high involvement and profile within the Convention's processes. We have used the Convention as a forum for promoting our expertise in biodiversity protection and for encouraging increased cooperation between countries. I will be seeking to take our efforts up a notch at this meeting."

Mr Carter will undertake a range of bilateral meetings throughout the conference, including with the Brazilian Environment Minister, Marina Silva, and Argentina’s International Whaling Commissioner, Eduardo Iglesias. He will also visit the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world, to examine the unique intersection of biodiversity protection, agriculture and tourism that occurs there.

He will be away from the March 24 to 4 April.
