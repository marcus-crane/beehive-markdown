The government is to provide funding for the establishment of the Wool Industry Network - a Canterbury-based Major Regional Initiative aimed at boosting wool export success, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"The Wool Industry Network will bring regional partners together with the aim of focusing their efforts on developing strategies for the production of high quality, high value wool products for overseas markets. The network will be a consortium of funding agencies, the wool production, supply and processing sectors and key wool sector service providers," Trevor Mallard said.

"The New Zealand wool sector adds more than $1 billion annually to the New Zealand economy, and has been one of the mainstays of the New Zealand economy for many years. It has the potential to generate significantly more export revenue, through the creation of high value, high quality products that are in demand internationally.

"New Zealand wool is already used to produce premium garments (suiting, sportswear, next to skin and fashion) and interior textiles (carpets and upholstery), and we believe there is even more that can be done to add value to this very important industry.

"The government is supporting this public-private sector initiative because it fits in well with our commitment to work with business to transform the New Zealand economy into an export-led innovative high value economy. It is only by doing this that we can lift the standard of living for all New Zealanders.

"The Wool Industry Network will assist the industry to develop a strategy to increase the competitiveness and value of wool exports. It will also help industry players tap into offshore markets and grab the attention of international consumers in what is a very competitive global market place."

The Wool Industry Network will receive $2 million in government funding over three years as a Major Regional Initiative (MRI). The funding will be matched by $3.175 million in funding from Meat and Wool New Zealand over the same time.

One of the key platforms of the network will be the development of an integrated strategy to encourage increased collaboration and innovation within the industry. This will enable the industry to respond effectively to the needs and changing requirements of international consumers.

The Wool Industry Network will be based in Canterbury in recognition of the province’s significant wool production and existing capabilities in wool processing, research and development and off-shore marketing.

"Under the initiative wool farmers, processors and exporters will work closely with a wide range of organisations including regulatory authorities, economic development agencies, textile manufacturers and educational institutions," Trevor Mallard said.

Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton welcomed the initiative.

"Over the last 10 - 15 years the wool industry has undergone significant changes. In the period 1990 - 2005, wool production decreased by 32 percent. Wool exports fell from 10 percent of exported merchandised trade to just 2.2 percent for the year ending 2005. Other wool producing countries are facing similar problems.

"While this is significant, wool is, and will remain, an important contributor to the economy and to farm businesses. There are many examples of success and innovation in the sector and the opportunities provided by this initiative will build on these successes and add value.

"A coordinated and strategic approach will ensure investment effort will be to the best effect. Key areas are likely to be research and development, workforce capability as well as market support and intelligence."

**Questions and Answers - The Wool Industry Network**

Q. Why is this initiative important for the wool industry and the New Zealand economy?  
The New Zealand wool sector contributes around $1billion annually to the New Zealand economy. In recent year’s low prices for wool in domestic and international markets has been a significant challenge. The Wool Industry Network (WIN) will assist the industry to meet this challenge.

While sheep numbers have declined since the 1980s, the national flock size has stabilised and it is forecast to grow 1-2 per cent over the coming season. Therefore, the volume of wool produced is expected to remain consistent or increase marginally. This initiative will provide the wool industry with confidence going forward.

New Zealand wool is used to produce premium garments (suiting, sportswear, next to skin and fashion) and interior textiles (carpets and upholstery). Furthermore, wool has the potential to contribute significantly more to the New Zealand economy if it is used to create high value, high quality products that are in demand internationally.

**Q. How did the Wool Industry Network come about?**  
The Wool Industry Network has arisen as the result of a sector-wide review which included extensive consultation with industry groups. The review highlighted a need to bring the many industry participants together and give them a single focus: to improve the value of their products and find high-value overseas markets in which to sell them.

**Q. Who will be in the Wool Industry Network?**  
The Wool Industry Network will be a public/private partnership comprising funding agencies, the wool production, supply and processing sectors and key wool sector service providers. These parties and organisations include wool growers, wool brokers, wool scourers, wool exporters and wool processors/manufacturers, Meat & Wool New Zealand, Canesis Ltd (formally the Wool Research Organisation of New Zealand WRONZ), the New Zealand National Council of Wool Interests, Wool Equities Ltd, Wool Research Inc, Textiles New Zealand, the Foundation for Research Science and Technology, the Tertiary Education Commission, the Apparel and Textile Industry Training Organisation, Sustainable Farming Fund (MAF), New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the Canterbury Development Corporation as the regional economic development agency.

Contracted staff will perform management functions initially reporting to an establishment Steering Committee. The members of the Committee are: chairman Mike Petersen (Meat and Wool NZ deputy chairman), Robin Mann (University of Canterbury chancellor), Michael Dwyer (NZ Wool Services managing director), Chris Pickrill (Canterbury Development Corporation CEO), Dann Olykan (NZTE) and Mark Jeffries (Meat and Wool NZ CEO).

**Q. Why will the Wool Industry Network be based in Canterbury?**  
Canterbury is New Zealand’s largest and most diverse wool production region. Many of the country’s most significant wool enterprises are based in Canterbury and as such it is logical that the network be based there. There are 7.5 million sheep (20 per cent of the national flock) in the Canterbury region. The commercial base of the NZ wool industry is in Canterbury.

**Q. What will the Wool Industry Network do?**  
The role of the network will be to prioritise market-led development within the wool sector under a shared industry strategy. In executing this strategy the network will create cluster projects that will bring together different parts of the industry. These projects will have specific, defined outcomes towards optimising added value driven by industry advisory groups.

**Q. What is meant by cluster projects?**  
The Automotive Group Project is a good example. It has involved bringing together wool producers, suppliers and product manufacturers with the objective of using wool in high value automotive transport products such as car upholstery. The project leverages on New Zealand’s competitive advantage in sustainable wool use.

**Q. How will the Wool Industry Network be created?**  
The network will be created in three stages.  
First the legal, structural and operational framework will be created. It will be governed by a steering committee and will be supported by Meat & Wool New Zealand staff.  
The next stage will be the refinement of a strategy. The key activity of this stage is the pulling together of the three advisory groups (R&D, Skills & Education, Market Support & Information) and using them to develop a cohesive industry strategy.  
The delivery stage will see the development of an R&D Consortium and the attraction of significant investments. The key activity of this stage will be delivery of the outputs defined in the network’s strategy.

**Q. What is the role of Meat & Wool New Zealand in this initiative?**  
**Meat & Wool New Zealand has acted as the facilitator for the network proposal process.**

Meat & Wool New Zealand is responsible for the industry-good development of the New Zealand wool industry on behalf of New Zealand wool growers but recognises that it cannot do it alone. The network is a vehicle through which this can be delivered through partnering with industry and government.

**Q. Which groups were consulted?**  
Wool brokers, exporters and processors were consulted in the initial instance. Consultation meetings were also held with wool growers in key regional towns in both the North and South Islands. Federated Farmers, Ngai Tahu), the Canterbury Development Corporation and key government agencies have lent their support to the initiative.

**Q. What will the economic benefits be?**  
Benefits to both the Canterbury economy and national economy resulting from a stronger more internationally competitive and viable wool industry will include improvements in industry productivity, commercialisation of new technologies, higher value employment opportunities and stronger export receipts.

**Q. Why has the Major Regional Initiative (MRI) model been used?**  
MRIs are developed based on regional competitive advantage and require firm industry-based support. Canterbury is the home of the wool industry. The province’s economy has been founded on primary industries, and the MRI supports a strategic development of the wool sector that is inextricably linked to the regional economy.

**Q. How will the success of the Wool Industry Network be measured?**  
A robust economic impact assessment of the network will take place in 2008. An analysis of the growth achieved as a consequence of the network’s initiatives, and the potential for further gains will form part of this assessment.

**Q. Specifically how will the government's investment be used?**  
It will be directed at activities that support the establishment and operational activities of the network, including initially:

- supporting the independent board
- development of the shared industry strategy
- communications
- support staff
- support for the industry advisory groups
- development of industry partnerships and clusters
- project management

NZTE will also support the network via its existing international connections.
