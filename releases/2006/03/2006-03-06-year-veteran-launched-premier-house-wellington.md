Prime Minister Helen Clark and Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker today launched the "Year of the Veteran" by presenting veterans with certificates and lapel badges in recognition of New Zealand's appreciation for their service.

"I am very pleased to formally launch the ‘Year of the Veteran’, a year for New Zealanders to express appreciation for the contribution made to our nation by the service and sacrifice of our veterans," Helen Clark said.

"The Year of the Veteran will provide all New Zealanders with the opportunity to honour the courage and sacrifice of those who have served. The government is committed to honouring and supporting veterans, and to enabling a greater public understanding of the service they undertook on behalf of New Zealand.

"The Year of the Veteran will see some nationwide activities and initiatives taking place, as New Zealand as a country takes the opportunity of the year to honour and commemorate the service of New Zealand’s veterans and our nation’s proud service history.

"The key aim of the Year of the Veteran is to provide opportunities for local communities to focus on providing ways of recognising the veterans in their community.

"To that end, the government has established a one million dollar contestable Community Grants Fund. Those eligible to apply for funding for projects will include local authorities, ex-service associations and other community organisations such as schools and local museums which seek support to organise commemorations of New Zealand's servicemen and women.

"In addition, $200,000 is being made available for events with a nationwide focus, which will be planned in conjunction with the RSA.

"The government will also present a special Year of the Veteran Certificate of Appreciation and Lapel Badge, as an expression of appreciation to those who have served New Zealand in a recognised war or emergency. Every veteran of a recognised war or emergency is eligible for this recognition of New Zealand’s enduring appreciation and gratitude for their service.

"Year of the Veteran Commendations will also be offered to volunteers who have given generously of their their time, skills and effort for the benefit and support of our veterans. The service recognised could include volunteer welfare work, or maintenance of cemeteries and memorials.

Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker said the Year of the Veteran is a very timely opportunity for communities to recognise the service of veterans and show their appreciation.

"The emphasis of the Year of the Veteran is on communities and their veterans.

"Community initiatives will be supported by the government through the Community Grants Fund.

"The Year of the Veteran is the time for all communities to stand up and say "thank you" to veterans," said Mr Barker.
