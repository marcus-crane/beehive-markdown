US Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Christopher Hill, will be arriving in New Zealand over the weekend for a short visit to Wellington.

“I welcome the opportunity to meet Chris Hill in New Zealand,” said Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

“The last time we met was in the margins of the Foreign Ministers' meeting at APEC in Pusan last November. I look forward to talking to him about New Zealand’s bilateral relationship with the United States as well as foreign policy issues of importance to both countries.

“As well as the bilateral relationship, I expect our discussions will also cover developments in Asia, the Pacific and New Zealand’s contributions to the global campaign against terrorism,” Mr Peters said.

Assistant Secretary Hill will also call on the Prime Minister.
