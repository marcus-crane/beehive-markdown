Jim Anderton today launched PPS-Frank (NZ) in Christchurch, a company pioneering a new technology for New Zealand. The company is producing large diameter polyethylene pipes for big engineering projects such as sewers and storm water drains and uses environmentally friendly technology. It is a New Zealand-German partnership.

"It's not often we take time to acknowledge the contribution that's made to our community's standard of living by the people who provide basic infrastructure, we simply expect things to work and we only notice when they go wrong. But life would be unthinkable without services such as drains and sewerage lines," Jim Anderton said at the plant opening in Bromley today.

"If we look around New Zealand today, there is increasing demand for improving and upgrading our infrastructure. This is partly because the first generation of sewerage and drainage systems have begun to reach the end of their economic lives. It is often easier for councils to say they will hold rate increases to zero by putting off maintenance or depreciation and the costs don't show up until later. In New Orleans this year there was a spectacular example of what can happen when there is systematic under-investment in major capital works.

"I know there is are serious efforts to address infrastructure issues going on right now in many councils around New Zealand. And as a happy result for this company the demand for its product is likely to be strong. The technology in these pipes has been used in New Zealand before - but only because New Zealand has imported them. PPS-Franks will now be making them in Christchurch, so this is a technology transfer to us here.

"It's worth noting that this company also brings a significant environmental benefit. The pipes are fully recyclable and then reformed into pipes again. The days are long gone when concern about the environment was a marginal issue. It's now something we all care about - and increasingly our businesses are introducing new environmentally responsible practices. I welcome the evolution of this awareness and congratulate PPS-Franks (NZ) on their innovative and responsible approach.

"As New Zealand develops, we will need to ensure we have the infrastructure in place, from our roads and energy, to our water, drains and services. They all contribute to our economy and to our quality of life. We enjoy a very high quality of life in New Zealand and the success of this business will contribute to improving it still further. PPS-Frank (NZ) is making a significant contribution with jobs, in services and to our environment," Jim Anderton said.
