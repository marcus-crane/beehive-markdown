Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard today congratulated Auckland on its groundbreaking first world plan to get public transport networked and moving.

The Auckland Regional Transport Authority's draft plan released today proposes a linked Passenger Transport Network and aims to double public transport use over the next 10 years.

"I am excited by this plan – for the first time we can see some detailed proposals for a first world public transport system which will give Aucklanders some choice about how to get to work and play," said Judith Tizard.

"This Labour-led government has made a commitment to Auckland - to remove the infrastructure constraints which hold back world class performance in Auckland, our only city of international scale."

"Auckland cannot realise its potential as a world class international city if people and goods cannot move rapidly through it. Auckland must be able to compete with Sydney, Singapore and others for New Zealand's economy to deliver for a better future for every New Zealander."

The government has been working closely with the transport agencies, local government, and Auckland stakeholders and communities to meet the goals it has set for major improvements over the next decade

"But the government can't fund blank pages. This plan will help provide the detailed information we need. Auckland and the government will need to work together to fund a plan like this."

ARTA's plan will take Auckland through to 2046 when the population of Auckland is projected to reach over 2 million people. It recognises the need for reliable and frequent direct journeys that are coordinated, use a simple fare system and can be easily understood.

"Recently we've made progress with express bus routes and record train passenger numbers. But I applaud this big-picture view after National's underinvestment in the 1990s."

"When Labour came to office the value of big projects in Auckland that were underway or recently completed totalled $130 million. Today that total is $1300 million – a tenfold increase. We're walking the talk", says Judith Tizard.
