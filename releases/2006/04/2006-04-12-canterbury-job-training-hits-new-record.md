Canterbury is enjoying the benefits of another Labour-Progressive promise kept, with more people participating in Industry Training and Modern Apprenticeship schemes.

Associate Minister of Tertiary Education and Wigram MP Jim Anderton says the release of Tertiary Education Commission figures today shows 14,400 people were in job training in Canterbury* on 31 December 2005, up 22.3 per cent on the year before.

Canterbury had 877 [Modern Apprentices](http://www.modern-apprenticeships.govt.nz/rendered/home.html) and 13,549 [Industry Trainees](http://www.tec.govt.nz/education_and_training/industry_training/industry_training.htm) in 2005, compared to 791 and 11,000 in 2004.

"These figures show the government is more than delivering on its promise to raise skill levels in the workforce," said Jim Anderton.

"Job training schemes have been a key part of our government’s aim to improve productivity across the region so we can play our part in transforming New Zealand into a high wage, higher value-added economy. But the best part is that trainees can earn while they learn."

In announcing the nationwide figures, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said more than 161,000 participated in industry training throughout 2005, substantially beating the target for that year of 150,000.

Across the country, the total number of Modern Apprentices increased 17 per cent to 8,388. The government has committed $38 million to train 11,000 Modern Apprentices by the end of 2007. Over a thousand people have now successfully completed their Modern Apprenticeships.

Industry Training provides workers with structured training on-site and off-site linked to the National Qualifications Framework. Industry contributes about 30 per cent of costs. Total funding for Industry Training increased from $58.6m in 2000 to $129m – an increase of 120 per cent.
