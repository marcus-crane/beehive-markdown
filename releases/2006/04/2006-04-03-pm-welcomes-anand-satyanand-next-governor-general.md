Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the announcement that the Queen has approved the appointment of Judge Anand Satyanand to succeed Dame Silvia Cartwright as Governor-General of New Zealand.

“Judge Satyanand will bring many personal strengths to the role of Governor-General, including a broad knowledge of the workings of government and the law, as well as a deep appreciation of the different groups and communities which make up contemporary New Zealand.

“Judge Satyanand has had a multi-faceted career as a lawyer, a judge, and an ombudsman. Throughout his working life Judge Satyanand has made a substantial contribution to legal reform and legal education.

“He has been active in a range of community, cultural and sporting groups, and maintains an abiding interest in international affairs and New Zealand’s relationships with other countries.

“Judge Satyanand has close ties to Asia and to the Pacific. He is of Indian descent and his parents moved to New Zealand from Fiji.

“The role of Governor-General in the 21st century is a demanding one. New Zealand is extremely fortunate to have a person of Judge Satyanand’s calibre and background who is prepared to serve as New Zealand’s next Governor-General.

“The government conveys its best wishes to Judge Satyanand and his wife, Susan.

“Dame Silvia Cartwright will complete her term on 4 August 2006 and Judge Satyanand will be sworn in as Governor-General at a date to be determined thereafter,” Helen Clark said.
