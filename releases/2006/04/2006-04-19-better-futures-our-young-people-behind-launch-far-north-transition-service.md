The Far North Youth Transition Service will lead to better futures for young people, their families and the wider Northland community, says Minister for Social Development and Employment David Benson-Pope.

Speaking at the launch today Mr Benson-Pope says the new service is about working to ensure young people make a good transition from school into adult life.

“Around 1800 students per year are eligible to leave Far North district schools, and up to 15 percent of these young people may be at risk of becoming unemployed. The Youth Transitions Service will provide support and guidance for Northland’s young people.”

Far North District Council has worked together with the Ministry of Social Development and the community to bring the services to Northland. Service providers Ngati Hine Health Trust and Tai FM will provide career and job seeking advice, information on educational opportunities and customised support for at-risk school leavers.

"We want to see all our young people on a firm path towards economic independence and long-term opportunities,” said Mr Benson-Pope. "We don’t want to see any young person suffering the impacts of long-term unemployment, inadequate education and low income.

"The approach of the Youth Transition Services is to treat young people as important members of their whanau, peer groups and their communities. Young people are strong agents for their own positive change. They may have issues and problems that they need help with, but they also have strengths.

"Far North Youth Transition Services will be owned by the whole of the community. One of the reasons the government decided to establish the services here was the drive, commitment and vision of the local government and community sector," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Far North Youth Transition Services is the tenth service to be launched. A total of 14 services will be rolled out as part of a $56.9 million package to help meet the government's goal of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education or training by 2007. Youth Transition Services is funded by the government and implemented in partnership with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs.
