"I have never doubted that potential and today we should celebrate another step towards its full realisation," Mr Anderton said.

The Council has evolved from the East Coast Forestry Group, which owns 180,000 hectares of forest and five processing plants in the Wairoa-East Coast area. Mr Anderton said the move was indicative of a brightening future for the industry, and he was looking forward to the seeing the benefits of its new collaborative approach.

"The challenge we face is to transform the performance of the wood industry beyond the level that would be achieved if everyone did their own thing. Our timber industry was developed as a way to grow as many trees as efficiently as possible and sell as many as we could. We never did enough to add value creation to that process. We have been price takers trying to compete on price because we can grow trees quickly. The Council's revised strategy will change that commodity-based approach," Mr Anderton said.

"There is enough wood growing in the East Coast region to support a substantial expansion of the local economy. If market conditions are right, the volume of wood harvested from this region could increase threefold by 2010," he said.

"The key to economic success, however, is gaining the highest added value possible from this increase in raw material. The Eastland Wood Council aims to increase by 60 percent the number of logs which are harvested on the East Coast which will be processed locally within 10 years. If we can do that, the impact on the regional would be dramatic. Officials estimate regional GDP could increase by as much as 25 percent. This would represent an additional $6000 in per capita income for the region.

"To do that we need to complete essential access requirements that I got started under the regional development roads programme, and keep investing in processing and staff. It's about central government, local government and the community working together and improving productivity," Mr Anderton said.
