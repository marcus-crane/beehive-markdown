Associate Minister of Health Damien O'Connor today announced an annual funding pool of $200,000 to encourage innovation in the rural health sector.

Mr O'Connor, who is also Rural Affairs Minister, made the announcement at the Rural General Practice Network annual conference in Christchurch.

"Any rural primary health care professional will be able to put forward a proposal for one-off funding to enable his or her practice to develop a innovative approach to the way they deliver care," Mr O'Connor said.

"Often just a small amount of capital or support makes the difference to whether a project gets off the ground or not."

The details of the new fund were being worked through with the Ministry of Health, and would be posted on the ministry's website when completed, he said.

Mr O'Connor said he envisaged innovative projects getting some one-off funding to assist with such projects as IT support, management support, or staff training.

"I encourage rural health professionals to put forward proposals. I know there are many innovative people out there in the rural health sector and we want to encourage others to follow where the bold and the creative have gone before."

Other government initiatives in rural health the past year include:

Allocation of $110 million of new primary health care funding to come on line from July 2006 to reduce the cost of visits to the doctor for the age group 45 to 65.

461 rural GPs qualified for a rural bonus, ranging from $3000 to $20,000 for those in the most isolated areas. In total, that came to $4.23 million.

The NZ Locum Service provided nearly 200 rural GPs with short term locums, and recruited 19 overseas GPs to New Zealand rural practices in the last year.

46 PHOs shared $8.23 million in rural workforce retention funding.

Funding has been made available for the initial training of 180 rural GPs and nurses and 120 refresher courses in rural trauma response.

Funding for 10 rural scholarships to medical school, 20 rural rotations for trainee doctors, and 44 rural primary health care nursing scholarships.
