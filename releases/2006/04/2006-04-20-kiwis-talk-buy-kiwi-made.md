Business, union and other interested groups from around the country have been invited to meet with MP Sue Bradford over the next nine days to talk about how to get the country buying Kiwi-made.

Ms Bradford was last year appointed to take on the role as Government Spokesperson on Buy Kiwi-Made as part of the post election cooperation agreement between the Green and Labour parties.

As part of this agreement, the Government committed to support a Buy Kiwi Made programme.

“In the first three months of this year I have met with many interest and stakeholder groups and individual firms to discuss the design of such a programme. There are a number of consistent themes developing from these consultations. Along side this officials from the Ministry of Economic Development have been undertaking the work necessary to develop the underlying policy.

“These regional workshops will enable the widest possible number of organisations, unions and firms to have input into the programme and to respond to some of the conclusions that we are reaching.

The workshops, which are by invitation, are being held in Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin and Christchurch.
