Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced that artist and moko expert Derek Lardelli will be the first recipient of a new artist in residence programme to be based near the Gallipoli peninsula.

Helen Clark said the new residency will provide an opportunity for New Zealand artists to create a fresh way of looking at the Gallipoli campaign.

"The aim is for the artists in residence to produce work which projects a new perspective on the site of a battle which was a seminal event in shaping the nationhood of both Turkey and New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

“Derek Lardelli is a superb choice as the inaugural artist in residence. His talents as a visual artist include multimedia, sculpture, composing, Kapa Haka and graphic arts. A leading tohunga tamoko (ta moko expert), he also teaches at Tairawhiti Polytechnic in Gisborne. Derek’s expertise in researching whakapapa and in tribal history greatly influences this work and has contributed to the high national regard he has attained.

“In 2004 Derek received a New Zealand Arts Foundation Laureate award. Most recently he created the motif that is woven into the Zambesi-designed Air New Zealand uniform and the design that will soon be incorporated with the koru on the tail of the Air New Zealand fleet.

“He was the composer of the words and actions for the new All Black haka “Kapa o Pango” and created the design worn by our Commonwealth Games team in Melbourne this year. His iwi affiliations include Ngâti Porou, Rongowhakaata, Ngâti Kanohi (Ngai Te Riwai) and Ngâti Kaipoho (Ngai Te Aweawe).

“Derek's father fought in the First World War in Egypt and France as part of the 5th Maori contingent that left New Zealand on the 29th of July 1916. Other relations were part of the contingent that fought at Gallipoli.”

"Artists from all fields will be eligible for the residency in future and it is hoped results of their work will be performed, exhibited, and published on their return to New Zealand. Canakkale University has agreed to host to the artists chosen and the programme will be administered through Creative New Zealand.

"This new artist in residence programme will help to increase public understanding of the Gallipoli experience, through a fresh perspective on the campaign," Helen Clark said.
