You know a party is in real trouble when its leader puts out a press release claiming he is 'pleased' with a government initiative, in this case its recently announced immigration review, and the party's spokesperson rather belatedly puts out a contradictory press statement a few hours later, says Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

"We thought they were only having issues with rogue foreign affairs spokespeople, but clearly the problem is more endemic," Mr Peters said.

"What makes this even more farcical is Brash's claim that these changes are the result of his latest Orewa offering. Everybody knows who put immigration issues in the political spotlight and who has a track record on this matter.

"A few obscure words in an otherwise turgid speech, with absolutely no action consequently is as 'underwhelming' as National's immigration spokesperson's contradiction of his leader.

"There is a good reason the majority of New Zealanders rejected National at the last election. They wanted constructive parties that would get on and solve the real problems this country is confronting – and that is what they have got. The contradictions and negativity coming out of National highlight why it can't even be an effective opposition, let alone a government in waiting," concluded Mr Peters.
