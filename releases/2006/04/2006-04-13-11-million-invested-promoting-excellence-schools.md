Highly effective schools will receive $11 million over the next four years in the first phase of an initiative developed to encourage schools to continue their high standards and share best practice across the sector, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"The government is committed to ensuring all schools are good schools. The Extending High Standards initiative is designed to promote excellence across schools by identifying highly effective schools and allowing them to share their best practice," Steve Maharey said

"The first group of 126 schools involving just under 58,000 students will be given $11 million over the next 4 years, which they will use to drive improvement in areas such as numeracy, literacy, effective teaching, and making use of new technology with the goal of improving student achievement."

"These schools have demonstrated both significant improvements in student achievement and the ability to help other schools achieve success by sharing the things that have made the difference are involved in the first round of the project,"Steve Maharey said.

"Extending High Standards Across Schools gives all schools, both rural and urban, the opportunity to be recognised for improving schools and student performance and will affirm excellence in schools across all deciles."

The successful schools in the first group will begin their projects in Term 2. A further announcement concerning a second group of EHSAS schools, which will start their projects in Term 3, will be made in June 2006.

The government approved funding of $28.5 million over four years through the 2005 Budget for the [Extending High Standards Across Schools programme](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=10278&data=l).
