The governments Working for Families package will assist Maori to address the inequalities that have been identified in the release of Tatau Kahukura (the Maori Health chart) today.

For the first time data and information has been gathered and published in one publication to give a profile of Maori health as compared with non-Maori.

"The publication confirms what we've known for sometime and to that end we have already responded with a number of measures aimed at reducing inequalities like Working for families, KiwiSaver, income related rents, PHO's (cheaper health care) and targeted assistance to those communities with the most need," said Dover Samuels.

"This Labour led government is serious about addressing issues raised in Tatau Kahukura (the Maori Health chart), ensuring information is relevant and updated is key to this, and as part of that, information will be continually updated, the chart book exercise will be repeated every three years to show any changes and progress towards improving Maori health.

“This publication is an important exploration of Maori and non-Maori differences in health data and can provide important clues to understanding the causes of disease and will contribute to primary prevention initiatives,” said Dover Samuels.

In all areas of health we act upon an evidence base. Internationally and nationally the evidence says that when providers and workers deliver services from relevant communities, they are likely to be more effective than if they are delivered via the mainstream.

"I welcome this report because it will act as a repository for a large number of organisations who are making a meaningful contribution in improving Maori health," said Dover Samuels.
