Real progress has been made towards achieving the goals of the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy, but there is still work to be done, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

The Minister's comments follow the release of a formative evaluation into the Implementation of the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy – the strategy's year one progress report.

"The evaluation has found that the Strategy is regarded as an excellent framework which has encouraged injury prevention activities," Ms Dyson said.

"This Labour-led government is committed to providing a strategic direction for improved collaboration between community groups, non-government organisations and government agencies to achieve injury prevention goals.

"Many participants commented positively on the influential role of ACC in leading the developlment and implementation of the Strategy. We must continue together to raise awareness about injury prevention issues in the workplace, the community and the home.

"None of this will be easy and we'll certainly never be able to say the job is done. But the success we've had since 2000 gives me every confidence that New Zealanders are up for the challenges we face."

The Strategy has indentified six national injury prevention priority areas which collectively account for 80% of serious injuries and deaths in New Zealand. The priority areas are: motor vehicle traffic crashes, suicide and deliberate self-harm, falls, workplace injuries and diseases, assault and drowning.

Six agencies are leading the development and implementation of strategies for each of these priority areas.
