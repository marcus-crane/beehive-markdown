Justice and Local Government Minister Mark Burton today announced the names of local councils who have been allocated funding to assist with the development of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) projects.

When implemented the projects will see the roll-out of a range of crime prevention approaches, such as better surveillance; improved lighting and signage; and safe access to public transport stops and stations.

"Crime prevention initiatives like these contribute to a stronger sense of security and safer communities," Mark Burton said.

"Crime and the fear of crime can affect people's quality of life, for instance people may avoid going out at night or stay away from certain areas. One effective way of helping to reduce crime in public places, for example violent crime, is to change the physical environment.

"Places that feel safe are vibrant. They attract people and activity and higher pedestrian numbers have obvious spin-offs for business.

"This Government is committed to ensuring that families and communities are safe and secure so that all New Zealanders can reach their full potential."

"Integrated urban planning and space management strategies can deliver numerous social and economic benefits in the long-term," Mark Burton said.

A total of $259,495 was provided to the following councils to assist in the completion of CPTED assessments and plans:

Auckland City Council  
(three separate projects) $26,000 Christchurch $10,000 Dunedin $9,750 Far North $6,000 Franklin $10,000 Gisborne $5,000 Hamilton $10,000 Hastings $10,000 Hutt City $10,000 Kapiti $6,000 New Plymouth $10,000 North Shore $10,000 Palmerston North $9,850 Rodney $4,995 Rotorua $5,000 Selwyn $9,900 South Waikato $10,000 Taupo (two separate projects) $20,000 Tararua $5,000 Timaru $5,000 Waimakariri $10,000 Waitakere $10,000 Wanganui $10,000 Western Bay of Plenty $9,000 Westland $10,000 Whakatane $9,500 Whangarei $8,500
