Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard is to lead a second education mission to India, aimed at promoting the New Zealand international education and research industry to Indian institutions and students.

Trevor Mallard will be accompanied by the Deputy Secretary for Education Rob McIntosh, senior representatives from New Zealand universities, Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics and the Education New Zealand Trust.

"This education mission follows my visit as Education Minister in 2005, and is important in the development of the New Zealand international education industry - which is worth about $2 billion annually to our economy. In 2005, the Indian market was estimated to be worth around $60 million, compared to $19.5 million five years ago. In 1998 there were around 164 Indian students in New Zealand compared to more than 3340 last year," Trevor Mallard said.

"The delegation will build the understanding in India around the programmes for international students that are available from New Zealand educational institutions. It is also aimed at supporting and raising awareness of New Zealand education initiatives and consultancy work in India. Creating or extending opportunities for collaboration on research between New Zealand and India will also be a focus.

"Discussions between our governments, officials and sector representatives will also help deepen our knowledge of policy and market trends in Indian education.

"A key part of the visit will be the signing of an agreement between AUT and an institute in Bangalore to deliver AUT’s MBA programme in India. The visit will also provide an opportunity to commence joint education work, as reflected in the New Zealand-Indian government agreement, Arrangement on Education Cooperation, that was signed during the first visit in 2005. This agreement aims to strengthen and deepen the ties between our education institutions, and academics," Trevor Mallard said.

The mission will visit some of India’s leading universities, and tertiary institutions in Chandigarh, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

Trevor Mallard departed today. The education mission runs from 30 April to 4 May. As Associate Finance Minister, Trevor Mallard will then attend the Asian Development Bank meeting in Hyderabad, India from May 5 to 7.
