Diplomat Jennifer Macmillan will be New Zealand’s next Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“Jennifer Macmillan will represent New Zealand at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has the key role in the UN in dealing with nuclear non-proliferation.”

“This posting comes at a time when these issues are attracting increased international attention,” Mr Peters said.

The New Zealand Mission in Vienna is responsible for promoting New Zealand’s nuclear non-proliferation interests under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Mr Peters said New Zealand participates fully in the work of the IAEA, including on the transport of radioactive materials. New Zealand also participates in the work of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty provisional secretariat.

“In addition New Zealand contributes to the two Vienna-based export control regimes, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement.”

Jennifer Macmillan joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1988, and is currently working in the Environment Division.

Her previous postings include Singapore, Solomon Islands and the New Zealand Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. She was also a private secretary to former Associate Foreign Affairs Minister and Disarmament and Arms Control Minister, Marian Hobbs.

Jennifer Macmillan will take up her assignment in August 2006, replacing Barbara Bridge, who will be retuning to Wellington.
