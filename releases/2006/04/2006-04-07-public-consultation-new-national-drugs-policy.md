From today, people with an interest in drug policy, including treatment providers, NGOs, public health organisations and researchers, get the chance to have their say on a new draft National Drug Policy looking ahead to 2011.

The draft National Drug Policy 2006-2011 was developed by the Inter-Agency Committee on Drugs and builds on the first [National Drug Policy](http://www.ndp.govt.nz/) produced in 1998. The Policy outlines how the Government deals with problems caused by the use and abuse of drugs, and covers tobacco, alcohol, illicit and other drugs. It takes into account evidence and trends that have become apparent in the last five years such as the emergence of "party pills'' and increasing concern about methamphetamine.

"This policy recognises the need for action across government and wider society to prevent and reduce the harms caused by drugs in this country,'' said Associate Minister of Health, Jim Anderton.

"New Zealand has undergone some major changes in its "drug culture" over the past five years with the growing use of methamphetamine, the availability of party pills and increasing concern about young people’s drinking. We need to make sure our policy is up to date and that the most appropriate responses in dealing with drug-related harm are made.''

The draft policy is divided into five sections. One section sets a direction for the next five years and highlights areas from regulation and law enforcement to health promotion and education. Other sections look at features of New Zealand's approach to drug policy and provide a summary of the issues related to common and/or problematic recreational drugs in New Zealand, including alcohol and tobacco.

Mr Anderton said detailed action plans would be developed once the Policy is in place. The Policy covers over-arching approaches to preventing and reducing drug-related harm and helps guide community and Government responses to address this harm.

The National Drug Policy produced in 1998 aimed at minimising harm from the use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit and other drugs. It was based around controlling or limiting the supply of drugs, reducing the demand and managing any drug-related problems that do occur. This new NDP builds on that basis but has a broader, more intersectoral focus than the first, which had a strong emphasis on health objectives.

Mr Anderton said it is vital that those interested in and affected by drug policy have the opportunity to provide comment. Feedback from the consultation process would be analysed and incorporated into the final version of the policy.

Written or emailed submissions will be invited and 13 public meetings are planned starting this month. Five regional meetings will be held in Auckland, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Separate hui, with a focus on issues for Maori, will be held in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Whangarei, Gisborne and Rotorua.

Fono are planned for Auckland and Wellington.
