Foreign Minister Winston Peters today congratulated Solomon Islands on the peaceful and orderly election held there.

“Elections are the essential means by which the people of a country participate in the government of their country, and this election was particularly important for the Solomon Islands," Mr Peters said.

“The last election in 2001 was held in troubled circumstances. Since then the Regional Assistance Mission has brought peace and stability, but many challenges remain. This election was an opportunity for the legitimacy of government in Solomon Islands to be renewed in the eyes of its people."

Mr Peters said that New Zealand was especially pleased to contribute to the civic education programme leading up to the elections and to be part of the international team that observed the elections.

He urged the new members of parliament to act on the expectations of the people as they worked towards forming a new government.

“New Zealand looks forward to working with the new government, once it is formed, and I hope to be able to visit Solomon Islands soon,” concluded Mr Peters.
