More New Zealanders than ever before enjoyed the benefits of Industry Training and Modern Apprenticeships in 2005.

"The government and industry aimed to get 150,000 workers in the Industry Training system by the end of 2005 and we have done far better than that," Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

His comments follow the release of latest Tertiary Education Commission figures showing that over 161,000 people participated in Industry Training in 2005, up 16 percent on 2004.

“These figures show the government is more than delivering on its promise to raise skill levels in the workforce. We need to do that if we are to improve productivity and continue transforming New Zealand into a high wage, higher value-added economy," said Dr Cullen.

Industry Training includes the Modern Apprenticeships programme that also had a successful year in 2005.

Total numbers of Modern Apprentices in 2005 increased 17 percent to 8,388. The government is backing Modern Apprenticeships with funding of $38 million for up to 11,000 Modern Apprentices by the end of 2007. Well over a thousand people have now successfully completed their Modern Apprenticeships.

Total funding for Industry Training has increased from $58.6 million (GST exclusive) in 2000 to $129 million – an increase of 120 percent.

Industry Training provides workers with structured training on-site and off-site linked to the [National Qualifications Framework](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/framework/). Industry contributes about 30 percent of costs.
