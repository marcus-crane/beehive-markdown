Australian Health Ministers, and New Zealand's Health Minister Pete Hodgson are gathering in Wellington today to attend the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference. New Zealand's presentation will focus on childhood obesity.

This is the first time the conference will be New Zealand-based, and Pete Hodgson’s first time as its host. Previously the conference has only been held in Australia.

“These forums provide us with an opportunity to discuss issues of common interest and for bilateral meetings to be held with state and federal ministers.

“New Zealand and Australia share an urgent concern around childhood obesity. Improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, and reducing obesity are vital for all of us – but especially for our young. I look forward to some of the innovative community programmes that we have here in New Zealand being showcased to our neighbours. ” said Pete Hodgson.
