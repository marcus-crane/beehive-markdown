New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Turkey will be career diplomat Hamish Cooper, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“New Zealand and Turkey enjoy a warm relationship, at the heart of which sits our shared Gallipoli experience,” Mr Peters said.

“I am pleased that Mr Cooper will represent New Zealand in Turkey at a time when both countries are seeking to further strengthen political relations and expand cooperation in areas such as agriculture and education".

After attending the 90th anniversary ANZAC day commemorations at Gallipoli last year Prime Minister Helen Clark completed a bilateral visit to Ankara. Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Erdogan visited here in December last year.

"Turkey plays a central role in the Middle East, a region of critical importance to international security. New Zealand’s Ambassador in Ankara also takes responsibility for New Zealand’s links to Israel, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

“While the Middle East Peace Process is of crucial political and security interest, there are also good opportunities for New Zealand to broaden bilateral relationships, particularly in trade," Mr Peters said.

Mr Cooper joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1985 and is currently Private Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was Private Secretary to the previous Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Hon Phil Goff, and has had postings in Tokyo (twice), London and Osaka.

He will take up his post in August, when Ambassador Jan Henderson returns to Wellington.
