Prime Minister Helen Clark said tonight that the New Zealand police officers in the Solomon Islands were working with local police to restore law and order in Honiara.

Helen Clark said civil unrest had arisen today in Honiara, following the election of Snyder Rini to the position of Prime Minister.

“The participating Police Force of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is working closely with the Royal Solomon Islands Police to restore law and order,” Helen Clark said.

“Earlier this evening they evacuated the new Prime Minister from parliament, where he and other government members of parliament had been barricaded for several hours by a violent crowd.

“The situation in Honiara remains uncertain and the New Zealand High Commission there is monitoring events closely.

“We are seeking more clarity around what lies behind today’s actions.”
