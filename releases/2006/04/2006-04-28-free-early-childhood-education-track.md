The government is on track to meet its commitment to provide 20 hours a week free early childhood education from 1 July 2007, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Speaking to the Early Childhood Annual Conference in Rotorua, Steve Maharey [outlined further details of the 20 hour free policy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25563), saying that he was confident it would meet the needs of parents and service providers.

"The policy is being developed in a way that will ensure we continue to have a range of early childhood services that meet a variety of needs, from full-day services, to kindergartens to home-based care," Steve Maharey said.

"In line with existing funding rules, there will be a six hour a day cap on free provision. Early childhood services can ask parents for donations, but will not be able to charge for any of the first 20 hours.

"Parents will need to enrol children in a licensed early childhood service in order to access the free hours."

Steve Maharey said the Early Childhood Advisory Committee, which included representatives from across the sector, would continue to work through details of the policy.

"Input from the early childhood sector will be vital to ensuring this policy is workable and practical for both parents and the providers of the service.

"[High quality early childhood education](http://www.ecd.govt.nz/) makes a significant difference to how children learn and develop later on in life. The 20 hour free policy will help to put quality early childhood education within the reach of all New Zealand families."

Steve Maharey said the government would invest around $500 million in early childhood education in the 2005/2006 financial year, an increase of $234 million since 1999. Funding for the 20 hour free policy was the subject of a Budget proposal.
