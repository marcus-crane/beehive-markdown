Foreign Minister Winston Peters will represent the government at four ANZAC Day commemorative events taking place in London today – a dawn service at the Australian Memorial, the Gallipoli Association ceremony of remembrance at St Paul’s cathedral, a wreath laying ceremony at the Cenotaph, and service of commemoration at Westminster Abbey.

“Ninety one years after the Gallipoli landings ANZAC Day is as much a part of the national identity of New Zealanders as it has ever been. On this day we honour the memory of our compatriots who served in peacetime and in times of war, in particular those who gave their lives to defend their country, and secure the freedom and prosperity that New Zealanders enjoy today," said Mr Peters.

“We also honour the heroism and enormous losses suffered by our Australian allies, and by our former enemies. The Gallipoli campaign is of central importance in Turkey’s history, as well as New Zealand’s. From this shared, tragic experience has developed what is now a warm and cooperative relationship between New Zealand and the Republic of Turkey.

“As we commemorate ANZAC Day in London it is particularly appropriate to reflect also on the losses suffered by the United Kingdom and its other allies in the Gallipoli campaign, during the rest of the First World War, and in the other conflicts in which New Zealand and the United Kingdom have fought together. This history of sacrifice binds New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and underpins what is a very close partnership in the twenty first century.

“This enduring partnership, as well as New Zealand’s contributions over many years to the defence of interests and values shared with the United Kingdom, will be highlighted when the New Zealand Memorial opens in London later this year,” Mr Peters said.

From London Mr Peters will travel to Ireland to meet Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern and undertake Racing portfolio calls. He will return to New Zealand on Sunday 30 April, having completed a two-week visit to Europe that has included consultations with the European Union Presidency, and bilateral visits to Austria, Russia and Ukraine, as well as the United Kingdom and Ireland.
