Work to introduce an objective noise test to combat noisy vehicles is nearing completion Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

“Officials have completed a workable test methodology for the objective noise test, based on the international ISO 5130 tailpipe noise test which has been tailored specifically for New Zealand conditions and the vehicle fleet,” said Mr Duynhoven.

Test providers have also been identified and transport officials are working with this group to finalise test sites, training and support for testing officers.

Land Transport NZ has put out a tender seeking proposals from suppliers of noise measuring equipment suitable for the tailpipe test. The special purpose noise equipment will measure exhaust noise using a microphone placed 0.5 metres away from the tailpipe of the vehicle.

“Once the tender is complete, the rollout of the objective noise test will proceed. In the meantime, my officials will continue to work with the test providers to prepare for the launch of the objective noise test,” Mr Duynhoven said.

A gazette notice (under regulation 29(7) of the Traffic Regulations 1976) to provide for an objective noise test for measuring exhaust noise levels of vehicles, will be issued by the Director of Land Transport NZ a month before the objective noise test goes live.

“To further reinforce objective noise testing and allow for the ongoing review of maximum allowed noise limits, my officials are progressing an amendment to the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Equipment 2004. I expect the proposed amendment will be released for public consultation by the end of this year.

“The government is committed to taking action to address noisy vehicles. We will continue to work with NZ Police and vehicle testers to ensure that this problem is attacked from all sides – both on the roadside and at vehicle compliance via WoF/CoF and ‘Entry’ (vehicles first being registered in NZ),” said Minister Duynhoven today.
