Acting Transport Minister Pete Hodgson today announced the appointment of members to the new Ministerial Advisory Group on Roading Costs to examine costs in the roading sector.

“This is a multi-disciplinary group with a great deal of knowledge and experience," Pete Hodgson said. "I expect they’ll have constructive recommendations for how we can improve value for money in roading."

Clive Tilby will chair the group, which also includes Jo Brosnahan, Alan Isaac and Stuart McKenzie.

Mr Tilby, a consultant to the infrastructure industry, is a professional engineer with knowledge of the construction industry. He also has project and financial management skills.

Ms Brosnahan, also a consultant, has extensive public and private sector experience. Mr Isaac is the recently retired CEO of KPMG’s Wellington and Auckland offices and Mr McKenzie, previously a professional engineer working in the construction industry, is currently a partner in Endeavour Capital, Ltd, a venture capital firm.

The group will consider ways of moderating cost increases in the roading sector by looking at construction and maintenance costs including design and technical standards, procurement processes, and the cost of materials and other inputs.

The group will be supported by advice from the Ministry of Transport, other transport agencies and Treasury. It is expected that the group will meet with key industry stakeholders, Crown entities and local government bodies in its work.

The Terms of Reference will be released once they are finalised. The group is expected to report to the Minister in July 2006.
