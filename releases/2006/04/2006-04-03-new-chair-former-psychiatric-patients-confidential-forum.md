Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Judge Patrick Mahony is to be appointed the new chairperson for the Confidential Forum for Former Psychiatric In-Patients.

“Following the announcement today of Judge Satyanand as the Governor-General designate, he will be stepping down from his role as current role as chair of the Forum.

“I am very pleased that Judge Patrick Mahony, a former Principal Family Court Judge, has agreed to take over the role. It was important to ensure that a high calibre chairperson would continue and complete the work of the Forum.

“The Forum is designed to give patients who were in psychiatric hospitals before November 1992 an opportunity to talk about their experience in a non-critical and confidential environment. The Forum began hearings in July 2005 and has not completed its work,” Helen Clark said.
