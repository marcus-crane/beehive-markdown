Historically the conservation community between New Zealand and Australia has very close ties. Over the last twenty years many New Zealand conservators have been trained in Australia firstly at Canberra University and more recently at the Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation at the University of Melbourne.  
This is the only course available in the southern hemisphere and highlights the opportunities that emerge when Australia and New Zealand join forces – each country has strengths they can offer each other.  
In New Zealand’s case, aligning with a strong professional body like the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material Inc (AICCM), Australia’s national organisation for conservators and people interested in the preservation of cultural material, is of great benefit.  
The different strands of this conference cover the preservation of paper, books and photographic materials in Australia and New Zealand. Looking at the agenda for the next two days I see sessions ranging from technical methods of preservation through to a discussion on why artists chose certain materials and techniques and how they influenced the artworks themselves.  
In these works on paper, the materials, techniques, and the creator’s intention are interwoven, proving these are cyclic processes which extend across generations and across communities and cultures.  
We must always remember that the fundamental purpose of developing and looking after documentary heritage collections is for them to be used by individuals and communities, in other words “preservation for access”. Preservation of collections is fundamental; without preservation there would be nothing of value for people to access.  
For iwi, documentary heritage collections have been of increasing importance since the Waitangi Tribunal came into being in the ‘70s. Decades of Treaty claims have resulted in new taonga coming to light and many iwi are recovering little-known aspects of their past through the information buried in these collections.  
The Government itself recognises the importance of documentary heritage for the way it helps us, as New Zealanders, to understand where we came from and how we have developed as a nation. The Treaty 2 U exhibition touring New Zealand at present with facsimiles of the Treaty is an example of why something so fragile as the Treaty of Waitangi (essentially ink on paper) should be preserved.  
The Treaty must be preserved so present and future generations of New Zealanders can see and understand their history although we may have different viewpoints and interpretations. Conserving documents, photographs, books and manuscripts preserves our past and builds our national identity.  
There are considerable challenges in terms of institutions having the capability and infrastructure to make the most of technological developments. Outside of the major Crown documentary heritage collections like the National Library, few New Zealand institutions are well placed in terms of staff, equipment, technical knowledge and skills to deal with digital preservation and the digitisation of existing material and that is why this symposium is so important.  
Conservators are a very specialised body of people that look after our material culture. It is heartening that both countries have professional organisations that are able to highlight conservation issues for both countries, expand professional expertise as well as determine the ethics of conservation.  
Many important collections throughout both countries are being digitised as a way of making collections more accessible. Interestingly worldwide digitisation has made for an increased demand for people to see the original. Therefore the demand for conservators will increase markedly.  
Many significant collections in Australia and New Zealand are seriously at risk because of the small numbers of trained conservators.  
Conferences of this kind are important for learning from one another especially in relationship to some of the unique problems that face New Zealand and Australian moveable cultural property.
