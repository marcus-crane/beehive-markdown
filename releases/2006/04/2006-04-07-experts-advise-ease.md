“Methylone is a substance that occurs in a product called 'Ease' which came to my attention late last year as a product that is being promoted as part of a so- called “clinical trial” by a company called Stargate International,” Jim Anderton said.

The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) has tested a number of products found to contain methylone, and is of the view that this substance is an analogue of a Class B controlled drug called cathinone, and is therefore subject to the analogue provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

This ESR evidence was presented to the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs (EACD) at its meeting last Thursday.

“It appears that 'Ease' is not the only product out there containing methylone, and I have asked for more information on these other products.

“The formal written report from the EACD is still to come, and although there has been considerable uncertainty around the legal status of this substance prior to these recent tests, Dr Ashley Bloomfield has told me today that the EACD agreed with the ESR conclusion that methylone is a controlled drug analogue.

"On this basis, the so-called “clinical trial” being conducted via the Stargate website might well be a breach of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and accordingly the Police have been informed,” Jim Anderton said.
