Associate Health Minister, Mita Ririnui today released Tatau Kahukura: Maori Health Chart Book prepared by the Ministry of Health, a publication he described as a ‘must have’ information tool for anyone working to improve Maori health.

For the first time data and information has been gathered and published in one publication to give a profile of Maori health as compared with non-Maori.

"The Labour led government has already identified some of the issues and responded. [Primary health care](http://www.moh.govt.nz/primaryhealthcare) is now cheaper, [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz) is a direct attack on child poverty and [KiwiSaver](http://www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/) will all contribute to whanau ora or family wellness," said Mita Ririnui.

“As an evidence based report Tatau Kahukura can provide important clues to understanding the causes of disease and contribute to primary prevention initiatives.

The chart book will be repeated every three years to show any changes and progress towards improving Maori health.

“Maori have on average the poorest health status of any ethnic group in New Zealand and with our population expected to grow another 20 percent by 2021, Tatau Kahukura has obvious value in terms of helping Maori communities and the health sector identify patterns and trends, plan ahead and measure results.”

Since the introduction of He Korowai Oranga and Whakatâtaka: Maori Health Action Plan 2002-2005 in 2002, analysis suggests there’s now a firm foundation for the health and disability sector to improve Maori health outcomes, support whanau ora and reduce inequalities. The 2006-2011 second action plan is now being developed and is expected to be released for public comment soon.

Mita Ririnui said high quality monitoring is a key part of Maori health development and it’s essential that initiatives to resolve Maori health issues continue to be based on accurate information.

### Background Information

*What are health indicators?*  
Health indicators are summary measures that provide and indication of wider health concerns and serve to focus attention on key issues. Indicators were selected for this chart book using conventional criteria relating to their ability to signal wider health concerns, to focus on health issues, to be reliably and validly monitored, and for their responsiveness to change.

In particular, indicators were chosen to relate to [Mâori health](http://www.moh.govt.nz/maori.html) priority areas as identified in He Korowai Oranga and the New Zealand Health Strategy. Additional indicators were selected to align with those already in use in annual monitoring at a national level.

It is not the intention or purpose of this publication to provide in-depth interpretation and discussion of results. However, users should consider any inequalities in Mâori health outcomes and individual risk and protective factors within the context of the broader determinants of health, including inequalities in the distribution of and access to material resources, as well as institutional racism and historical influences.

*What do the indicators as evidenced in Tatau Kahukura describe?*  
The report shows that compared to non-Mâori, Mâori have poorer health status, are more likely to be exposed to risk factors for poor health, and experience barriers to accessing health services. More detail is provided in the report over a wide range of key indicators covering socio-economic determinants, risk and protective factors for health, health status, health service utilisation, and the health system.

Mâori have on average the poorest health status of any ethnic group in New Zealand. The report also considers other high-level measures of inequalities such as the incidence of infectious diseases, avoidable hospitalisations and avoidable mortality, and more specific outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes as well as risk factors.

The chart book reports key socioeconomic determinants of health (such as education, housing, deprivation, and employment) that have been shown to have the greatest influence in promoting and protecting health.

In the health and disability sector, the focus is to remove barriers that inhibit the effective use of, and increased access to, health and disability services by Maori, Pacific people and other population groups in need. Health service utilisation by Maori is also described.

The report is vital as it provides the type of evidence underpins the sector’s response to the greater health need of Mâori.

*Who are the main audiences that this report is targeting?*  
It is intended that Tatau Kahukura: Mâori Health Chart Book is a means disseminate information on key indicators to a wide audience. In addition to being accessible to funders and providers, the chart book is intended to be of use to the wider community.

*How can the information in the report be used?*  
The information in the Chart Book will allow the Ministry of Health, DHBs and other agencies, to update its strategic directions and action plans to improve Mâori health. The information will contribute to needs assessment, prioritisation, resource allocation, and the development and evaluation of policies, programmes and services. It will be used to identify gaps in services available, and point towards appropriate points for future intervention.

*Who is responsible for improving Mâori health outcomes and reducing inequalities?*  
All parts of the health and disability sectors are responsible for improving Mâori health outcomes and reducing inequalities. The key players, the Ministry of Health, District Health Boards and the Mâori health sector need to continue to engage with each other and other sectors to improve Mâori health outcomes and reduce inequalities.

Mâori adults were as likely as non-Mâori adults to report having a usual health practitioner. For both Mâori and non-Mâori, the most common type of usual health practitioner was a GP or family doctor.

Almost 14 percent of Mâori adults had seen a Mâori health provider in the last 12 months. The level of satisfaction with Mâori health providers was high among both males and females, with 95.3 percent of Mâori females and 94.4 percent of Mâori males reporting they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their Mâori health provider.

Estimated funding specifically for Mâori health providers accounts for only about 3 percent of health and disability expenditure with the overwhelming proportion of health and disability funding going to mainstream providers (Ministry of Health 2005b).

Maori health providers play crucial roles in improving Maori health status by:

- delivering effective targeted health services to Maori
- demonstrating leadership and innovation, which can be transferred to mainstream service delivery
- developing a Maori workforce (Health and Independence Report 2004)

*How is the health and disability sector working to improve Mâori health outcomes and reduce inequalities?*  
The Government and the Ministry of Health have made it a key priority to reduce the health inequalities that affect Mâori. If Mâori are to live longer, have healthier lives, and fulfil their potential to participate in New Zealand society, then the factors that cause inequalities in health need to be addressed (Ministry of Health 2002).

**He Korowai Oranga: The Mâori Health Strategy** (Minister of Health and Associate Minister of Health 2002a) sets the direction for Mâori health development in the health and disability sector for the next five to ten years. The strategy provides a framework for the public sector to take responsibility for the part it plays in supporting the health status of whânau. At the heart of He Korowai Oranga is the achievement of whânau ora, or healthy families. Accompanying the strategy is Whakatâtaka: Mâori Health Action Plan 2002–2005 (Minister of Health and Associate Minister of Health 2002b), which outlines what the health and disability sector will do to implement the strategy (including programmes, policies and interventions).

Key lessons learnt from Whakatâtaka 2002-2005 include indications that both He Korowai Oranga and Whakatâtaka have established a firm foundation for the health and disability sector to work towards improving Mâori health outcomes, supporting whânau ora and reducing inequalities between Mâori and non-Mâori. However, this foundation is only a beginning and it needs to be consolidated and built on.

Whakatâtaka 2006–2011 is currently under development. The draft action plan identifies a concerted series of actions and focuses the sector on four priority areas are:

- building quality data and monitoring Mâori health
- developing whânau ora based models
- improving Mâori participation at all levels of the health and disability sector, particularly workforce development and governance
- developing primary health care.

One key vehicle for reducing health inequalities is the Primary Health Care Strategy The strategy was launched in February 2001 by the Minister of Health, the Primary Health Care Strategy provides a clear direction for ensuring that primary health care services play a central role in improving the health of New Zealanders including Mâori.

The Primary Health Care Strategy builds on the population health focus and the objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy and the [New Zealand Disability Strategy](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/), and outlines how a new direction to primary health care will improve the health of all New Zealanders through:

- a greater emphasis on population health, health promotion and preventative care
- improving accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of services
- improving coordination and continuity of care
- community involvement
- involving a range of professionals and encouraging multidisciplinary approaches to decision making
- providing and funding services according to the population’s needs as opposed to fee for services when people are unwell.

The first phase of the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy, from 2001 to the present, has focused on establishing Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) and implementing low cost access to health services. The next phase up to 2010 is focusing on achieving the desired outcomes of the Primary Health Care Strategy.

Another important strategy is [Healthy Eating – Healthy Action](http://www.moh.govt.nz/healthyactionhealthyeating) (HEHA), where nutrition, physical activity and obesity prevention are integrated into one framework and implementation plan.

*Why was this publication released?*  
The purpose of the report is to provide reliable and easily accessible information on key Maori health indicators. It describes and analyses recent data and provides easy-to-use statistical information and explanations to show key results. It will help identify priorities and assess progress towards reducing inequalities. It is a stocktake of the health needs of Mâori that will help to identify priorites and assess progress towards reducing inequalities and working towards whânau ora.

The chart book is part of a series of monitoring reports on the current health status of the New Zealand population and the first comprehensive review of Mâori health data presented all in one document.

During consultation in 2004 on a monitoring framework for He Korowai Oranga, a key finding was that Mâori want easy access to a wide range of health information that is presented in varied formats. Tatau Kahukura: Mâori Health Chart is an output that seeks to address this by providing an easily accessible document that can be used as an information tool.

*Who was involved in writing this publication?*  
The publication Tatau Kahukura: Mâori Health Chart Book was prepared by the Ministry of Health, in particular Public Health Intelligence Unit of the Public Health Directorate along with Te Kete Hauora (Mâori Health Directorate).
