The Te Arawa Lakes Settlement Bill was introduced to Parliament today.

The Bill gives effect to the Deed of Settlement, signed in December 2004, to settle all the historical claims of Te Arawa in relation to 14 lakes in the Rotorua district.

The settlement package contains a formal Crown apology, cultural redress including title to 13 lakebeds in the Rotorua district, and financial redress of $2.7 million.

Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton today welcomed the bill's introduction.

"This is an important milestone in the process to address historical grievances in the Rotorua area," he said. "I urge all members to support the passage of this bill into legislation."

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised, and addressed in a peaceful and constructive way.

"Treaty settlements strengthen the relationship between the Crown and iwi and lay the foundation for us to build a strong and confident nation.

"Over the past three years we have seen six deeds of settlement reached and thirteen groups have entered negotiations – five of those in 2005 alone. Three settlement bills were passed last year, and I expect three to be introduced this year. Currently, the Government is in negotiations with over 20 groups, covering several hundred claims."

This is the eighth settlement bill since 2000.

"This government is committed to working toward putting these grievances behind us so that we can pursue an economy that provides opportunities and a unique quality of life for all New Zealanders."

The bill is expected to have its first reading when the house sits, after which it will be referred to Select Committee.
