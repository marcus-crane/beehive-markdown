Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today welcomed the appointment of New Zealand's first Governor-General of ethnic extraction.

"I am delighted with the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday. Anand Satyanand will make an excellent Governor-General for modern, multicultural New Zealand. He is an impressive, dignified man, with a broad understanding of the law and people," Mr Carter said.

"As an Indo-Fijian, and the first Governor-General from an Asian community, his appointment is an important symbol to ethnic people that New Zealand is truly a diverse society, but Mr Satyanand is also an important example to wider New Zealand of the kind of contribution ethnic people are making to our country. I wish him well in his work."
