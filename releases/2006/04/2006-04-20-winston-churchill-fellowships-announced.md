Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, today announced the nine new fellowships being awarded by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.

The fellowships give recipients the opportunity to undertake intensive research projects overseas in 2006.

Administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, the trust has granted over 600 fellowships to New Zealanders since it was set up in 1965 as a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill. Sir Winston was a great believer in people going overseas to develop a particular area of expertise and then bringing the knowledge and experience home to their communities. Community sectors that benefit from the programme include arts, disability, environment, law and order, trade and industry and youth.

"I look forward to seeing the fruits of the fellows’ research. This work provides exciting opportunities to develop and enhance strong, sustainable communities," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"Not only are the fellows contributing to New Zealand communities, they are taking New Zealand knowledge to the world."

Each fellowship is worth between $5000 and $7000 and enables fellows to travel overseas to gather information, look at new models and learn from the examples of other countries. On their return, fellows provide the department with a report, which is then made available to interested people and organisations.

Former Churchill fellows include Dame Catherine Tizard, entertainer Mika, broadcaster Sharon Crosbie, actor Miranda Harcourt, and writer and performer Jo Randerson.
