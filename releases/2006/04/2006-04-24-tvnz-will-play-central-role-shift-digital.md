TVNZ will play a central role in the shift to a jointly run platform for digital television, expected to occur later this year, says Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

[Speaking to media studies students at Victoria University](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25546), Steve Maharey said the government had asked TVNZ to explore a cooperative approach with other broadcasters to make the transition to digital.

"TVNZ has coordinated a group of free-to-air broadcasters to develop proposals for a jointly run digital platform called 'Freeview'," Steve Maharey said.

"This is based on the successful BBC-led model featuring a package of existing channels and new services."

Government decisions on these proposals were expected to be taken within the next couple of months, with the shift to digital to occur later in the year.

"This is a priority area for government. The transition to digital broadcasting, and the convergence with other technologies, is an essential part of New Zealand’s broader economic transformation.

"We need to ensure we are creating the infrastructure and technological savvy that will keep us on a par with other OECD countries.

"A 'joined-up' approach to digital provides the best opportunities, not only commercially, but also in giving expression to our shared cultural identity."

Steve Maharey said the government would continue to place a priority on developing TVNZ as a public broadcaster.

"TVNZ has made a major shift in focus over the last couple of years with the introduction of its charter. This is increasingly reflected in the quality of programming, including more high quality local content. Alongside this, they are continuing to provide a good commercial return and lead the ratings. In fact 48 out of the 50 top-rating programmes in the half year to December 2005 were screened by TVNZ.

"As we move into the digital era, New Zealanders should be looking for more from their public television broadcaster, not less."
