Every year I am amazed and touched by the thousands of New Zealanders that turn out in force to commemorate the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli. This year marks the 91st anniversary of that landing and a chance for us to pay tribute to those who fought and lost their lives in battle.

Maori Televisions coverage of ANZAC day ceremonies was unprecedented and has already received glowing reviews from not only other media personnel but also members of the general public who enjoyed the presentation of the day’s events immensely. I am proud that I was a part of a team that supported Maori Televisions implementation and congratulate them on a job well done.

The Labour-led Government has designated 2006 as the “Year of the Veteran”, so that we all can express our appreciation for the contribution made to our nation by the service and sacrifice of our veterans. And equally to acknowledge the impact that this service had on their loved ones, their families and their communities.

Labour is committed to ensuring that our older New Zealanders receive the respect and support they deserve. We have worked hard over the past six years to ensure that all New Zealanders are able to maintain active, fulfilling lives in their later years, and participate fully in our communities.

We have lifted living standards by reversing the previous National government’s cuts to New Zealand Superannuation; ensured lower cost doctors' fees and standard prescription charges for all older New Zealanders and ensured more affordable housing for older tenants in state houses. We are phasing out asset testing for older people in residential care, and we have guaranteed New Zealand Superannuation for the future.

And there is more to be done this term. Labour is making significant improvements to the rates rebate scheme, so that up to 300,000 New Zealanders on low and modest incomes will be eligible to have up to $500 deducted from their annual rates bill, and abolishing the mandatory driver licence test for those aged eighty and over. Currently there are around 47,900 people in the Southern region now receive state-funded superannuation– these people especially will be likely recipients of the rates rebate scheme.

The quality of life for many thousands of older New Zealanders will improve dramatically with Labour’s commitment to fund 7,500 extra cataract operations and 10,000 extra hip and knee operations over the next three years. And we have also committed significant extra funding for residential and home-based care.

So the challenge this year, in the Year of the Veteran, is to go beyond just remembering. Let us engage with, learn from and celebrate our veterans and their legacy. And go beyond that even and celebrate our older New Zealanders. They have a lifetime of wisdom and experience so take the time to sit down and listen to their stories. You will be surprised at the lessons you may learn over a quiet cuppa.
