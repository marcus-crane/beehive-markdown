New Zealand, France and Niue have today signed an agreement to fund a new multi-million dollar government administration block as part of reconstruction efforts following Cyclone Heta.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the agreement was an important step for Niue’s rehabilitation following the cyclone which devastated much of the country in 2004.

The agreement was signed by Niue’s High Commissioner to New Zealand, HE Mrs Sisilia Talagi, France's Minister for Overseas Territories, Mr François Baroin, and Mr Peters.

“The construction of a new government administration building, to replace the one partly destroyed by Heta, was a key recommendation of a whole of government review which committed to ongoing support for Niue,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand and Niue have long had a special relationship, and this project is an example also of France’s cooperation in the Pacific."

Today’s agreement includes France’s contribution of €530,000 to fund the construction of the building.

New Zealand will provide additional funding and support for the completion of the project of up to $2 million under the 2004 Halavaka ke he Monuina Agreement for strengthened cooperation between the two countries.

The Government of Niue is to identify and release land necessary for the project.

Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974.
