Professor Linda Holloway is the new Chair of the National Health Committee, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

She has recently retired as Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Health Sciences at Otago University and takes up her new position this month.

“Linda Holloway brings invaluable experience and expertise to the National Health Committee which helps to guide decision-making in complex and often controversial areas.

"She is perfectly placed to lead them in developing informed and independent advice in what is often a highly charged environment,” Pete Hodgson said.

Professor Holloway has been a member of the National Health Committee since 2002. She replaces Dr Robert Logan who was a member of the National Health Committee for seven years and became chairman in 2000.
