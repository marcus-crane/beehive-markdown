Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today he had received advice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its dealings with Harmeet Sooden’s family.

“I am satisfied that at all times in this process, the Ministry has acted to maximise the chances of Harmeet’s safe release.

“Concern has been raised about the Ministry’s alleged involvement in ‘chequebook journalism.’ I am satisfied that at no time did MFAT advise the family to deal exclusively with any media organisation, except in relation to the recording of a video appeal with Harmeet’s mother in early December. That advice followed consultation with other government agencies, and was based on the belief that TV3’s international broadcast connections through its Canwest ownership might improve the chances of it being broadcast. The advice was agreed to by the family.

“Subsequently, the family chose to negotiate a deal with TVNZ. This was the family’s choice – the Ministry was obliged to respect their decision and did so. I am satisfied that the Ministry did not try to undermine that deal.

“I see no merit in making matters more difficult for them by perpetuating media debate on this issue,” Mr Peters said.
