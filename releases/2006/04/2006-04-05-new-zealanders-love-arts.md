The government's $86+ million investment into the creative sector has been vindicated by a survey which found that nine out of ten New Zealanders are involved in the arts says Associate Minister of Arts, Culture & Heritage Judith Tizard.

The survey, released today by Creative New Zealand, found that 87.5% of New Zealanders either participate in or attend arts events. It also found that New Zealanders believe that arts contribute positively to the economy and help define who we are as New Zealanders. There was also a high level of support for public funding of the arts

"We fulfilled an election promise and injected a substantial amount into the arts sector. We had a vision of a vibrant arts, cultural and creative sector which all New Zealanders can enjoy. Today's results vindicate our investment – we're getting the payoff," said Judith Tizard.

"The arts reflect and confirm who we are - as individuals and communities - and as a nation. This Government believes that our creative industries can provide not only profile for New Zealand internationally, but also jobs, growth, economic returns and exports.

The report also suggests that the Ministry of Education's Arts in New Zealand Curriculum is having a very positive impact on this age group and that investment has been worthwhile.

This research shows that New Zealanders are leading the world in their uptake of opportunities in the arts. We are a multi-cultural society on a bicultural base and the overlaying of European, Asian, Pacific and Maori arts is interpreted in a way that is ours alone.

"As MP for Auckland Central and Minister for Auckland Issues, I am delighted the survey finds that Aucklanders recognise that our cultural diversity is a driving force in the arts and our point of difference to the rest of New Zealand. I am proud to read that the annual Pasifika festival is the arts event that makes them most proud to be an Aucklander."
