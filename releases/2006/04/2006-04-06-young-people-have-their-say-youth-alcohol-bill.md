Young people have ensured their voices are heard after addressing a select committee considering the minimum age for purchasing alcohol, Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said today.

The Minister commended the young people aged 15-21 from the Ministry of Youth Development's Activate/Youth Advisory Group, after they presented their submission yesterday to Parliament's Law and Order Select Committee, on the Sale of Liquor (Youth Alcohol Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill. The proposed legislation suggests raising the minimum alcohol purchasing age from 18 to 20 years.

"It's great to see young people exercising their democratic rights by standing up and making their voices heard by government decision-makers on important issues which affect them.

"It is also fantastic to see young people being supported by the Ministry through the Activate Group to get involved in the decision-making process and feel that they can make a difference."

Ms Mahuta said the Activate group was one of a number of initiatives set up by the Ministry to get young people's voices heard in government policy, and by leaders and key decision-makers.

Ms Mahuta said a healthy democracy was one in which all people felt that they could make their views heard.

"I would like to encourage all young people who are passionate about issues affecting them to get involved in the decision-making process, whether its through groups like Activate, or their local youth council, school, youth group or community."
