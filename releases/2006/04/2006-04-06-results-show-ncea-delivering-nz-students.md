The latest statistics on the performance of secondary students demonstrate the strengths of the NCEA system, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"This information provides the most comprehensive picture yet of students’ strengths and achievements under the NCEA," Steve Maharey said.

"The results paint a very positive picture of NCEA. They demonstrate that it is contributing to a lift in standards across all students, and more students achieving qualifications overall.

"They also show that variability between standards, a key concern in 2004, has significantly reduced. This is a tribute to the work NZQA has done to improve the process and ensure it is fair for all students.

Highlights from the results include:  
·Over the last year the percentage of students gaining level 1 literacy increased from 69.9% to 72.5%, and level 1 numeracy from 75.7% to 78.8%  
·The percentage of students in lower decile schools achieving NCEA qualifications has increased, in particular, year 11 and 12 students in decile 1-3 schools.  
·An increase in the number of Maori and Pacific Island students achieving NCEA qualifications.  
·The percentage of Year 11 students on the school roll achieving level 1 went from 52.5 per cent to 56.4 per cent.

"This information will contribute to the ongoing work to improve and refine NCEA and ensure it continues to help lift standards for all New Zealand students."
