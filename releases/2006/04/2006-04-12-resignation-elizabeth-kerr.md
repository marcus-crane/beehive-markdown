Today I have been advised of the resignation of Elizabeth Kerr, Chief Executive of our arts development organisation, Creative New Zealand.

I am grateful for the six years which Elizabeth has given to Creative New Zealand. They have been hallmarked by a clear vision – to make New Zealand arts excellent, distinctive and essential in the lives of all New Zealanders. Today Creative New Zealand is a focused and energetic agency.

I have appreciated her contribution to our cultural and creative landscape – both at the grassroots and at the national level. She has made a real difference.

I am particularly excited about the recent survey results she commissioned which found that a staggering nine out of ten New Zealanders actively participate in the arts. This information will provide a solid basis on which to progress further policy and audience development work.

I am delighted that Elizabeth will continue to work in the sector as she has accepted the position of Manager of the New Zealand String Quartet – one of New Zealand's most successful musical ensembles, nationally and internationally.

I wish her well in her new role.
