Associate Minister of Health, Mita Ririnui today launched Raranga Tupuake, a 10-15 year plan designed to build a competent, capable, skilled and experienced Maori health and disability workforce.

Developed by Te Kete Hauora, the [Maori Health](http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz/2004/index.php) Directorate of the Ministry, Mita Ririnui says Raranga Tupuake is a timely document, coming soon after a recent call by health sector groups for the Ministry to be more active in guiding them through looming workforce challenges.

Raranga Tupuake has three goals. They are to:

- increase the number of Maori working in the health and disability sector
- expand their skills and qualifications; and
- ensure that have equitable access to training opportunities.

Mr Ririnui says increasing Maori workforce numbers will focus on promoting health career options to secondary school leavers, mature Maori and Maori who have had careers in other sectors.

“An expanded skill base will ensure Maori have a rich depth of expertise to see them working at all levels and in all professions across the sector and whether rural or urban based, Maori will have equal access to job training opportunities.”

Mr Ririnui says the key to Raranga Tupuake was collaboration within health and also with the education sector.

The contribution of organisations from both sectors to Raranga Tupuake was the beginning of a shared effort he wants grow over the 15-year life of the plan.

Mita Ririnui says Raranga Tupuake recognises there are a number of workforce activities and plans already underway in the health sector.

The plan also recognises regional workforce diversity among DHBs and Maori provider organisations. Mita says the Ministry, DHBs, Ministry of Education, other funders and providers will be expected to prioritise its implementation within their current funding.

The Ministry of Health is the lead agency monitoring the numbers of Maori in registered health occupations. The New Zealand Health Information Service ([NZHIS](http://www.nzhis.govt.nz/)) undertakes this activity.

Other parts of the Ministry of Health will work with the NZHIS, and other collectors of Maori health workforce data, to improve the quality of Maori health and disability workforce information.
