Anzac Day, 25 April, is one of the most important dates on our national calendar.

On this day we recall what happened in 1915, when New Zealand soldiers first landed on the rugged Gallipoli peninsula, at the beginning of a campaign which would cost many of them their lives.

More broadly, we remember and pay tribute to all New Zealanders who have endured warfare on behalf of the country we live in.

Large numbers of our servicemen have died on overseas battlefields, or as a result of wounds sustained there.

Many of those who survived conflict returned home maimed in body. All brought back memories that others cannot imagine.

We who have not gone to war must find ways of recognising the service and the sacrifice of those who have.

This Anzac Day falls during New Zealand’s Year of the Veteran. Activities throughout this special year enable us to show our appreciation of the contribution made by our veterans, and promote a greater public understanding of what they have experienced.

Let us today, and every day, further honour the service of our veterans by our continued commitment to peace in the world.
