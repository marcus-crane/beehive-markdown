Minister of Women's Affairs Lianne Dalziel today paid tribute to the work of the National Council of Women of New Zealand (NCWNZ) as the NCWNZ marks 110 years of working for women and their families.

The women who successfully campaigned for Universal Suffrage formed NCWNZ in 1896 as a forum for women to debate issues. The NCWNZ celebrates Founder's Day on April 13 and the 110th anniversary will also be celebrated at a dinner during the NCWNZ's National Conference in Invercargill between September 28 and October 1.

The anniversary of such a key event in New Zealand's history is a time to reflect on what has been achieved and what is still to be done in the many areas of policy that influence the status of women, said Lianne Dalziel.

"I have been an advocate for the Ministry of Women's Affairs as I believe it plays an important role in making sure the impact on women is considered when policy is developed by government departments," said Lianne Dalziel.

"The NCWNZ has been influencing policy for 110 years and has achieved much in local, national and international forums. I have no doubt that the NCWNZ will continue to play an important role in New Zealand society and I wish it well on this important anniversary," said Lianne Dalziel.
