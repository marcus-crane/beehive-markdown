Tourism industry leaders are to meet later this month to take stock of the sector and help guide its continued strong performance, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The Tourism Strategy Group, made up of senior figures in the private and public sectors, is to meet in Wellington on 27 April.

Mr O'Connor said the group, which he would chair, would spend the day outlining the scope of the upcoming mid-term review of the 10-year New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

"It's timely that we have a good look at where the industry is going and whether we can improve the way we do things," Mr O'Connor said.

"Tourism plays a vital role in New Zealand's economy, accounting for one in 10 jobs and bringing in $7.4 billion in foreign exchange earnings. This is an opportunity for the main industry players and groups to get together and find consensus for the way forward."

Mr O'Connor said group discussions would set the scene for the review, which is to be carried out by the Ministry of Tourism later this year. The review would:

·Measure the success of the strategy so far.  
·Assess what has changed in the domestic and global tourism market since 2000/2001.  
·Identify new challenges and ways to meet them.  
·Determine where the sector should be in 2010.
