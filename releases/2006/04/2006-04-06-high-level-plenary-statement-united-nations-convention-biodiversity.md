It is my privilege to make this statement on behalf of the New Zealand Government.

My thanks to Brazil and President Lula for hosting COP8, and my congratulations to you Maria Marina Silva for being such an excellent chairperson.

The theme of this year's COP, island biodiversity, is a major issue for New Zealand. We are an island country, a country of islands. Our country is made up of 2 large islands, 4 middle-sized ones, and hundreds of small islands spread over the 4th largest EEZ in the world.

New Zealand's biodiversity is amazingly different, reflecting the fact that we split off from the continental landmass some 80 million years ago. We have a great variety of species of birds and plants that are unique to our country. Renowned biologist Jared Diamond describes the study of New Zealand biodiversity as being "as close as we will get to the opportunity to study life on another planet!"

Protecting this heritage for present and future generations is a significant challenge. To give one example of our commitment, over a third of our land area is public and completely protected. We have done this in order to preserve our forests and mountains, wetlands and rivers for all time. New Zealand's many islands each require special attention to maintain their biodiversity and to counteract the damage caused by alien species introduced either accidentally or deliberately during the colonial era.

Beyond New Zealand's own land and waters, we recognise the importance of island biodiversity to our neighbours in the island countries of the South Pacific. I am delighted that many representatives from the Pacific are able to be with us today, I applaud the work of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia and Kiribati on the conservation initiatives that they have taken at this Conference of the Parties. I greet them in the spirit of friendship and cooperation that exists within our region.

New Zealand is happy to work with our Pacific countries in collective efforts to protect regional biodiversity. We particularly commend the work undertaken by the South Pacific Environment Programme (SPREP), and we pledge our ongoing support for these collaborative activities.

New Zealand is a very conservation minded country. One issue that we feel very passionate about is the conservation of the great whales that swim through the earth's oceans. New Zealand deplores the actions of the three rich developed countries which continue to slaughter whales in large numbers. We are especially sad about Japan's actions in the Southern Ocean which kill whales that migrate through New Zealand's waters.

I hope that the delegates from Japan, Norway and Iceland take a conservation message home and persuade their governments to stop killing the world's whales.

Madam President, you will have gathered from my comments that New Zealand's approach to protecting biodiversity is essentially a practical one. We are a pragmatic and conservation minded country, and our focus is on getting a job done rather than just talking about it. We are looking for the CBD to provide sensible, realistic and achievable outcomes that will help all countries in their efforts to preserve biodiversity, including those of us from the Pacific region.
