Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that New Zealand would participate in the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai.

“Our participation at the 2005 World Expo in Aichi, Japan was regarded as very successful. The experience we gained from that event will stand us in good stead for the next World Expo in China.

“There will be a considerable degree of interest in the 2010 World Expo, given China’s considerable economic progress and its increasing importance as a global player and the world’s fastest growing consumer market.

“China is currently our fourth largest trading partner and growing. We have a good reputation in China and it is important that we build on that.

“The World Expo in Shanghai will be an opportunity to show New Zealand to a massive market with an estimated 70 million visitors expected to visit the Shanghai Expo.

“We will look to showcase New Zealand as a progressive, dynamic, vibrant country with a natural environment second to none.”

Helen Clark said New Zealand Trade and Enterprise would manage the project and look to involve New Zealand companies involved in trade with China as well as to showcase New Zealand tourism, innovation, and culture.
