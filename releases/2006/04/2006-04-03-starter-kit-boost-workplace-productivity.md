A ["starter kit"](http://www.dol.govt.nz/workplaceproductivity/resources/tools/diagnostic.asp) to assist small and medium-sized businesses to boost workplace productivity has been launched by Labour Minister, Ruth Dyson.

The kit was developed as part of the government’s [Workplace Productivity Project](http://www.dol.govt.nz/workplaceproductivity/index.asp). Improving workplace productivity has been identified as one of the biggest challenges to New Zealand’s long-term, sustainable economic growth and prosperity.

“New Zealanders currently work more hours than their counterparts in the USA, Canada, the UK and Japan but workplace productivity is about getting New Zealand businesses to work in smarter ways, not longer hours,” said Ms Dyson.

"Productivity is central to achieving the high-wage, high-skill, high-value economy New Zealand needs to become. We need to focus on the many factors that influence how well people work."

The kit also contains a number of case studies showing New Zealand businesses that are already dramatically raising their productivity.

“The case studies are impressive examples of what is possible when workplaces start thinking about these issues,” says Ruth Dyson. “Workplace productivity benefits everyone associated with a business – employees, managers and customers.”

The [user-friendly kit](http://www.dol.govt.nz/workplaceproductivity/resources/tools/diagnostic.asp) contains questionnaires, information and business case studies. It was developed by the [Department of Labour](http://www.dol.govt.nz/) in collaboration with the [Workplace Productivity Reference Group](http://www.dol.govt.nz/workplaceproductivity/about/wpwg-team.asp) which comprises representatives from [Business New Zealand](http://www.businessnz.org.nz/), [Chambers of Commerce](http://www.nzchamber.co.nz/) and the [Council of Trade Unions](http://www.union.org.nz/). The kit will be distributed to businesses at seminars throughout the country.
