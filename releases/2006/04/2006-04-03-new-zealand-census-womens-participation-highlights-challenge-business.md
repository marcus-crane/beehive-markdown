Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel says she hopes the New Zealand Census of Women's Participation 2006 is a catalyst for change in New Zealand's boardrooms.

The Census released today by Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Dr Judy McGregor shows that just 7.13 per cent of the directors on the boards of the major companies in New Zealand are women, up from 5.04 per cent in the first Census in 2004.

To put it another way, New Zealand's top 100 companies have 645 directors and only 46 of them are women.

"No one is advocating that women should to be appointed to boards just because they are women. But global research I monitor as Minister of Women's Affairs is increasingly backing up the common sense view that successful companies have boards that tap a broad range of perspectives.

"There are plenty of suitably qualified women available and willing to serve on company boards as evidenced by the number of women on Crown company boards. The Nominations Service of the Ministry of Women's Affairs has been an excellent resource in this regard," said Lianne Dalziel.

A stocktake by the Ministry of Women's Affairs found that 41 per cent of ministerial appointments to state sector bodies and committees were women. The Action Plan for New Zealand Women released by the Ministry of Women's Affairs in 2004 has a target of 50 per cent by 2010.

"It is my hope that the women gaining experience on state sector boards will make the transition to private sector boards," said Lianne Dalziel.
