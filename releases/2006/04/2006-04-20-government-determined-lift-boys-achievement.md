Education Minister Steve Maharey today told the PPTA Annual Conference that the government had rejected a call for it to teach boys and girls differently.

"The government is determined to lift boys' achievement, and the way to do this is to continue our focus on effective teaching for all students," Steve Maharey said.

"A one-size fits all approach isn't the answer to dealing with differences in achievement between boys and girls, anymore than it's the answer to dealing with achievement gaps between ethnic groups.

"This doesn't mean we shouldn't debate issues around boys achievement. It means we need to understand that most boys are doing well, while some boys are not and ensure extra help is reaching those who need it.

"We know that issues such as reading and writing, engagement at school and emotional literacy can sometimes get in the way of achievement - and we have policies to address this.

"But we believe that overall, boys' achievement is largely related to effective teaching. We know that when teachers have high expectations of all students, strong subject knowledge, and a strong relationship of care with their students, the quality of teaching is high."

Steve Maharey said the government was making major investments to support effective teaching in all schools, including around $32 million a year in programmes to lift literacy standards and more than $90 million a year on professional development for teachers.

Steve Maharey's comments were in response to a speech by Dr Paul Baker, outlining an achievement gap between boys and girls, and advocating a change in the way boys are taught.

Mr Maharey said that overall achievement levels had increased for both boys and girls over the last five years, however, some subject-based differences occurred as boys and girls go through secondary school. The area where there tended to be a gap in achievement for some boys is in subjects which focus heavily on reading and writing.
