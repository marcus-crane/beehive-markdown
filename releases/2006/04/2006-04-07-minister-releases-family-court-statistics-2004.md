Courts Minister Rick Barker today released Family Court Statistics 2004, a new collection of statistical data about the Family Court compiled by the Ministry of Justice.

Mr Barker said, "The publication marks the first time that Family Court data has been published in this manner and the 2004 report is the first of what will become annual publications."

The statistics presented are based on applications made to the Family Court in 2004. Some historical data has also been included to illustrate trends in Family Court activity from 1998 until December 2004.

As part of an upgrade of information technology support for courts, a new case management system (CMS) was introduced in April 2003. The new CMS has not only made management of cases within the courts easier but it also provides a rich source of data from which these annual documents can be compiled.

The complexity and volume of CMS data means that developing a comprehensive set of Family Court statistics will take some time. The 2004 report contains a selection of statistics highlighting some of the key areas of court business and providing an overview of a year in the life of the Family Court.

Key findings within the report are:  
·The number of guardianship cases has decreased between 2003 and 2004.  
·The number of domestic violence cases dealt with in the Court has decreased.  
·Care and protection case continue to increase but at a slower rate than previously.  
·Mental health and relationship property cases are increasing.

The report can be fund online at: http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2006/family-court-statistics-2004/index.html from 2.30pm today.
