New Zealand and China are to boost their collaboration on scientific and technological research in areas with significant economic potential, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey and his Chinese counterpart Minister Xu Guanhua today agreed on actions and areas of collaboration that recognise the importance of China as a science and technology partner.

“A joint commission on science and technology will be set up at the government level to plan and monitor future opportunities," Steve Maharey said.

“We agreed that there is potential for much greater collaboration in a number of areas of scientific research, including biotechnology, environmental sciences, renewable energies and nanoscience.”

"With science playing an increasingly important role in our economy it is vital that we build on these opportunities to expand international collaboration."

Steve Maharey said the agreement would also help to build on are where New Zealand researchers were already working closely with their counterparts in China.

Current areas of collaboration include earthquake and seismic modelling; researching biomedical products between HortResearch and Chinese research institutes, and exploring new fish species that can be farmed in New Zealand coastal waters between NIWA and the Yellow Sea fisheries Research Institute in Shandong.

China is New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner, with annual exports to China valued at more than $1.5 billion.
