A new Hutt Valley Youth Transitions Service will be a valuable resource for young people, their families and the wider Hutt Valley community, says Minister for Social Development and Employment David Benson-Pope.

Speaking at the launch today Mr Benson-Pope said the new service was about working to ensure young people made a good transition from school into adult life.

"Today’s young people are the scientists, business people, parents, workers and leaders of tomorrow," said Mr Benson-Pope. "Young people who aren’t in work, training, or education are missing much that life has to offer. Inactivity squanders young people’s talent, potential and energy.

"The Youth Transition Service being launched today shows that the government and the local community are taking this problem seriously. The Service will provide the support and guidance that the Hutt Valley’s young people deserve.

"Young people, rather than being problems to solve, are strong agents for their own positive change. This strengths-based approach is vital to Youth Transitions Services. Young people may have issues and problems that they need help with, but they also have strengths."

Upper Hutt and Hutt City Councils have worked together with the Ministry of Social Development and the community to bring this service to the Hutt Valley. Service provider VIBE will provide career training, job seeking advice, information on educational opportunities and customised support for at-risk school leavers.

"Hutt Valley Youth Transitions Service will be owned by the whole of the community," said Mr Benson-Pope. "One of the reasons the government decided to establish a service here was the determination of Mayors Wayne Guppy and David Ogden, the City Council and local groups to do something to help young people in the City.

"I'm confident that this community has the strength and the leadership to achieve a successful, innovative Service."

The Hutt Valley Youth Transitions Service is the eighth service to be launched. A total of 14 services will be rolled out over the next three years as part of a $56.9 million package to help meet the government's goal of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education or training by 2007. Youth Transitions Services are funded by the government and implemented in partnership with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs.
