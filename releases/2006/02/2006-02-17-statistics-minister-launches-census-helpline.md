Getting advice on the census is now just a phone call away, following the official launch this morning of the 2006 Census Helpline.

The Statistics Minister, Clayton Cosgrove launched the service at one of the four call centres Statistics New Zealand is using to provide assistance for the public.

"It's a vital service to ensure everyone can understand and fill in their Census form. Census information is critical for New Zealand businesses, community organisations, and for all New Zealanders, and we need everyone to participate," he says.

The Minister met staff answering the 0800 CENSUS (0800 236 787) number.

The Census helpline is open 24 hours, 7 days week, providing assistance in English and Maori. For speakers of other languages, which include Samoan, Tongan, Hindi, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean, the line will be open between 7am and 10pm. It is expected the line will receive over 295,000 calls during the census period.

The 2006 Census Helpline will also provide assistance to people completing their forms on the Internet. "The on-line option is an exciting advance, reflecting New Zealand's adoption of new technologies and the growth of the digital world," he says.

"It is expected that around 15-20 per cent of the population will complete their forms on-line rather than writing them out by hand."

Other help services include a DVD for the deaf community, a braille form and screen reader for the visually impaired, plus a range of information pamphlets in 20 languages.

Census Day is 7 March 2006. Today's launch of the telephone helpline is in preparation for the delivery of forms to all New Zealand households and places of residence starting from 20 February.
