Bee industry members who have concerns about a proposed new Import Health Standard for bee products have until 20 February to make submissions to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton said he was aware of concerns held by some members of New Zealand’s bee industry.

“There is a view that the draft Import Health Standard currently out for submissions is a fait accompli. This is not the case," Jim Anderton said today.

"Import Health Standards are often modified as a consequence of submissions made by industry groups. I am certain that MAF officials have an open mind on this matter and will be receptive to relevant arguments,” Minister Anderton said.
