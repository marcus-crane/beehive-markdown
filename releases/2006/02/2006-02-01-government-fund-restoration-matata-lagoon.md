The government is to spend $225,000 funding restoration of the natural values in and around Matata Lagoon, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"Matata's western lagoon was a wildlife management reserve before it was destroyed by floods and debris in June 2005," Mr Carter said.

"The western lagoon was an important asset to the community, providing a social benefit to the area. Cabinet has recognised this fact and sought to fund restoration work."

The restoration work will be carried out by the Department of Conservation in conjunction with the local community.

Mr Carter said work on the lagoon reserve was a further addition to a government response and recovery package that included direct assistance from Cabinet of $3 million and total government assistance of over $20 million for the area.
