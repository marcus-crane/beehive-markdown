Information-sharing to meet common labour market challenges was the theme of a meeting between New Zealand and Thai labour officials in Wellington today, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said.

“Thailand has one of the most dynamic, fastest-growing economies in our region, and this was an exciting opportunity to identify ways in which we can learn from them, and they from us," said Ms Dyson

The meeting was the first part of the [Arrangement on Labour between New Zealand and Thailand](www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/labour.html), signed last year in tandem with the [Closer Economic Partnership agreement with Thailand](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/thaiindex.html).

“Thailand and New Zealand have a shared commitment to their growing economic and political relationship and to promote sound labour practices in their respective countries.

“One aim is for the countries to work together in areas of mutual interest and help each other meet shared challenges - such as improving labour productivity," Ms Dyson said.

The next step in the process is expected to be a meeting in 2007 between the New Zealand and Thai Labour Ministers to review how the Arrangement is working.

The Department of Labour is the New Zealand agency responsible for implementing the Arrangement. Further information about the Arrangement is available online at: [www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/labour.html](www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/labour.html)
