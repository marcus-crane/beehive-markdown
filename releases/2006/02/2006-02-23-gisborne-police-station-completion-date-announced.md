The new Gisborne Police Station is due for completion in the first half of 2008, Police Minister Annette King announced today.

Work is being undertaken on costings and the budget is yet to be finalised, she says

Ms King says a comprehensive building programme for police stations has been in place since this Government came to power.

"So far, 20 police stations have been built and 48 have been fully refurbished.

"I am particularly pleased that provincial and rural New Zealand is receiving it's share of the Police capital budget, with new stations opened or being built in Palmerston North, Masterton, Taupo Ohakune, Richmond, Oamaru, Morrinsville, Invercargill and Whangamata."
