Jim Anderton is opening the University of Canterbury's biomass gasifier today.

"With the energy challenges New Zealand has to meet in the future, there are some hard issues everyone agrees we need to confront. Our energy needs are rising as our economy grows and we need to be respectful of our natural environment. We need to maximise our use of renewable energy sources," Jim Anderton says.

"As a small country far from the rest of the world, we are always going to have to meet a large proportion of our energy needs from our own resources.  
The project we are here to open today offers real potential for gains in all these priorities. It will transfer overseas knowledge to New Zealand. And it will develop technology for use with our own domestically produced radiata pine residues.

"Wood is a potentially significant source of renewable energy. It doesn't increase atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Wood fuels are domestically controlled, renewable and, at least potentially, an environmentally-friendly source of energy.

"So New Zealand is fortunate to enjoy a significant resource of so-called 'woody biomass', particularly waste wood - which comes from wood harvesting and processing. If we're going to realise this renewable resource to create a more sustainable energy system, then we need the technologies to convert biomass to energy.

"The technology is attracting interest in a number of countries because of its potential. This research program has been set up at the University of Canterbury to transfer Biomass Gasification technology to New Zealand.  
The goal of the University’s programme is to develop a system which is economically feasible and reliable to run. The wood and forest industries potentially stand to gain the most benefit over the coming five to eight years. The aim will be to realise the potential for the sector to be energy self-sufficient.

"This gasifier and the research it supports are important parts of New Zealand’s move towards greater use of bio-energy," Jim Anderton says at the opening of the 100kW laboratory – scale rig today.
