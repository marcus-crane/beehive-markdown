Minister of Commerce Lianne Dalziel has announced the re-appointment of Jane Diplock as Chair of the New Zealand Securities Commission for a second term through to 2011.

The Minister made the announcement at a function in Wellington last night to welcome delegates to meetings of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in New Zealand.

"Jane Diplock has established the Commission’s reputation in the New Zealand marketplace as an effective enforcement body, built the Commission’s organisational capability and gained international recognition for New Zealand’s financial market regulation," Lianne Dalziel said.

Jane Diplock has chaired the Securities Commission since 2001. During that time She has overseen a body of securities law resulting from reforms the government commenced in 1999. She is the current chair of the IOSCO Executive Committee.
