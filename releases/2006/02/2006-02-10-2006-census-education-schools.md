The Minister of Statistics Clayton Cosgrove will today launch a census education programme for schools, to encourage children to get involved in the 2006 Census.

The 2006 Census Education Resource will be officially launched at Northcote Primary School in Christchurch at 1.30pm.

The resource contains activities that explore how census data is used, what it can tell us about our society, and the ways to gather, process and interpret information. It also explains how having accurate data on population, migration and cultural diversity for example, is essential for long term planning.

"It's important school children are aware of the census, as the information it provides will be used to plan for their future," says Mr Cosgrove.

"Last census we learned that in many households children were instrumental in getting forms filled in, after learning about it. The resource kits also provide a valuable opportunity to use a real social context for students to explore and develop understandings about themselves and the society they live in," he says.

"This is one where kids count, as every person in New Zealand, no matter how young, needs to have a form filled in for them on March 7," says Mr Cosgrove.

The teaching resource is targeted at primary, intermediate and lower secondary school students. Alternative education providers, youth workers and libraries around New Zealand can also use the resource.

It is available for schools, upon request. Any school not yet registered can phone Michelle Butters on 04 931 4703, or email education.services@stats.govt.nz
