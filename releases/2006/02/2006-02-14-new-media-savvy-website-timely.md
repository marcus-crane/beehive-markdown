A new online resource aimed at helping New Zealanders develop a better understanding of the media was timely given recent debate around the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"The events of recent weeks have reinforced the huge impact media can have in our society," Steve Maharey said.

"If there was ever a time to increase our media literacy as a nation it is now.

"The Mediascape website is a great tool for parents, children and students who are interested in becoming more media savvy. It will help people to make more informed and critical choices about media and is destined to become a key feature in our virtual and media landscapes."

Developed by the [New Zealand Broadcasting School](http://www.cpit.ac.nz/schools/broadcasting/) - in partnership with the [Broadcasting Standards Authority](http://www.bsa.govt.nz/), the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.co.nz/) and the [Families Commission](http://www.familiescommission.govt.nz/) – the website includes tips on media use for families along with information and advice on media content, and discussion on key issues.

It also explains the broadcasting and advertising codes of practice and how to protest about content.
