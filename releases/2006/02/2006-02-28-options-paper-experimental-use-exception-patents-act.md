The Ministry of Economic Development has released an options paper, *An experimental use exception for New Zealand’s patent legislation*, Associate Minister of Commerce Judith Tizard said today.

Judith Tizard said the paper proposed an explicit exemption within New Zealand’s patent legislation for experimental use.

“There is uncertainty as to whether research or experimental work involving patent inventions is considered patent infringement in New Zealand. This uncertainty may discourage researchers from conducting research in areas covered by patents, and could inhibit innovation in New Zealand. This could have significant implications.”

This question was also being looked at in Australia, Judith Tizard said.

“The [Australian Law Reform Commission](http://www.alrc.gov.au/) (ALRC) and the [Australian Advisory Council on Intellectual Property](http://www.acip.gov.au/) (ACIP) have both investigated the issue and have recommended that Australia amend its patents legislation to incorporate an “experimental use exception”.

Under such an exception, the use of patented inventions in research or experimental work would not be patent infringement. This makes it all the more important that New Zealand considers this issue.

“The options paper builds on the work carried out by the ALRC and the ACIP and presents possible options for implementing an experimental use exception in New Zealand’s patent legislation. The consideration of this issue is a reflection of the government’s commitment to facilitating economic growth through innovation.”

Submissions on the options paper will close on 7 April 2006. If, after considering the submissions, a decision is made to include an experimental use exception in New Zealand’s patent legislation, the exception would be included in the draft Patents Bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament later this year.
