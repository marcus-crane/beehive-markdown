Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui is calling for Maori health scholarship applications, designed to increase the skilled workforce for the Maori health sector.

Applications open on Monday for the Ministry of Health 2006 Hauora Maori Scholarships.

"This year around 500 scholarships are available to assist those undertaking or completing a New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) accredited course in health and disability studies, with a particular focus on Maori health," said Mita Ririnui.

As part of the scholarship programme, each year a small number of John McLeod Scholarships are given to applicants who have achieved outstanding academic success, within health.

Malcolm Dacker is one of last year's John McLeod Scholarship recipients. He's currently studying a Bachelor of Dental Surgery at the University of Otago and has already completed a Diploma in Dental Therapy and the second year of a dental hygiene degree.

One of the priorities of He Korowai Oranga, the Maori Health Strategy is oral health and Malcolm Dacker says oral hygiene and its practice is important for Maori.

"Getting the message out about oral health to whanau and tamariki is just so important."

Mita Ririnui agrees and says these scholarships will ensure capacity in the Maori health sector increases, "that is why I am encouraging applications from a wide range of people who share that vision."

"With Maori still languishing in negative statistics it is important we adopt a proactive approach to increase participation in the Maori health sector.

"The government has identified Maori health as a priority and scholarships of this nature that assist us in meeting those needs will have a positive impact in reducing the inequalities that currently exist," said Mita Ririnui.
