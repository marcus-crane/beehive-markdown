The formation of a new Trans Tasman authority to oversee medicines and medical devices will open up new sales opportunities for New Zealand natural products companies, Associate Minister of Health Damien O'Conner said today.

Damien O'Connor was speaking to natural products industry members at the industry's annual summit in Nelson.

The Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority, which will be in place by the middle of this year, will regulate medicines and medical devices including complementary medicines in New Zealand and Australia.

Mr O'Connor said it would allow the industry to better meet consumer safety and quality expectations and would boost marketing opportunities.

"Having a sound regulatory scheme that is recognised internationally will help to remove barriers to trade and open up new export opportunities for New Zealand manufacturers."

New Zealand's natural products industry accounts for an estimated half a billion dollars in domestic and export sales.

The authority was announced jointly in December by Food Safety Minister Annette King and her Australian counterpart, Christopher Pyne.

Mr O'Connor said he hoped natural products companies in New Zealand would continue to have an input into the development of the new regulatory scheme.

"Officials will shortly be releasing a detailed consultation plan and I encourage industry members to further contribute to the process to help ensure that the scheme is as good as it can possibly be."
