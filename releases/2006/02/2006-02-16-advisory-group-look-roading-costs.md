A new Ministerial Advisory Group will examine costs in the roading sector, as part of the government’s commitment to its roading programme, Transport Minister David Parker announced today.

"The group will consider ways of moderating cost increases in the roading sectors by looking at construction costs, design standards and processes, tendering processes, and the cost of materials and other inputs,” Mr Parker said.

“I want to ensure that taxpayers get value for money from our roading projects and that means making sure that cost increases are moderated where possible.”

The Advisory Group will report to the Minister. Its membership will draw on private sector and industry expertise. It will be supported by advice from Transport agencies and Treasury. The group’s Terms of Reference will be made public soon and Mr Parker said he expects members to meet within the next month.

“While we are spending more than ever on roading, higher petrol prices have reduced forecast fuel tax revenue. Increases in road maintenance and construction costs, and growth in passenger transport will continue to put pressure on funding.

"The government will ensure that the $20 billion forecast to be spent on land transport over the next decade is spent wisely.”
