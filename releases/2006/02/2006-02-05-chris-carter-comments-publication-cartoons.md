Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter expressed disappointment today that some New Zealand media had chosen to publish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, which had created strife and tension offshore.

“Freedom of the press is very important to a democratic society like ours, and I acknowledge the deep commitment members of the New Zealand media have to it. But press freedom also comes with a sense of responsibility," Mr Carter said.

"It is hard to see why the publication of cartoons known to be deeply offensive to Muslim communities is such an important point of principle to the New Zealand media who have published them," Mr Carter said.

"Yesterday, the Secretary General of the United Nations expressed his belief that press freedom should be exercised in a way which is respectful of religious beliefs, and that misunderstandings between people of different beliefs should be overcome through peaceful dialogue and mutual respect.

"Unfortunately, the publication of these cartoons in New Zealand will do nothing to advance understanding between the faiths in our country," Mr Carter said.
