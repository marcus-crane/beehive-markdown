Thirty-five high calibre organisations submitted plans to the Government's Broadband Challenge Fund and 13 have been asked to put in detailed applications, Communications Minister David Cunliffe says.

“We are pleased to see communities from the length and breadth of our country rising to the challenge," Mr Cunliffe said. "We look forward to working closely with them to deliver faster, cheaper broadband.”

The Digital Strategy Steering Group assessed the 35 expressions of interest and invited 13 organisations to submit applications to the $24 million fund.  
Full applications will require a significant amount of work and investment by the applicants to be complete by the May 16 deadline. The applicants will be supported by the Digital Strategy Secretariat, which is planning several workshops to bring experts and applicants together.

Unsuccessful applicants who submitted eligible applications are being encouraged to submit expressions of interest in a future round.

The aim of the Broadband Challenge Fund is to improve the availability of broadband internet access by providing seed funding to establish up to 15 Urban Fibre Networks, and providing network access to rural and poorly served communities.
