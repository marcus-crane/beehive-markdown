Entries targeting obesity and diabetes feature strongly among the 25 finalists for the [2006 New Zealand Health Innovation Awards](http://www.healthinnovationawards.co.nz).

Beverages Guidelines developed by Waitemata District Health Board use a ‘traffic light’ system to indicate the healthiest drinks schools can stock for their students.

Other finalists include an exercise campaign encouraging West Coasters to ‘get up and get moving,’ a Ngati Porou programme to beat diabetes that involves the East Coast rugby team and a popular Pacific lifestyle programme getting great results in the Hutt Valley.

The awards are a joint initiative between ACC and the Ministry of Health, to promote excellence in health treatment and rehabilitation services. They recognise and reward those working in the health sector to develop better products, services and processes.

“Tackling obesity and diabetes are top priorities for me,” Health Minister Pete Hodgson said. “It is very encouraging to see such effective programmes being put into place right across New Zealand. All these finalists are excellent examples of health professional recognising what is needed in their particular area and acting proactively to doing something about it.”

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said: “Yet again the finalists for the Health Innovation Awards demonstrate the quality and diversity of work which is contributing to better health care and recovery for all New Zealanders. It is great to be able to recognise, through these awards, the innovative thinking and ingenuity of people who care.”

Last year’s overall winner was Auckland’s Healthy Housing programme, a project to reduce the risk of housing-related diseases among families living in Housing New Zealand Corporation properties.

The finalists were chosen from 111 Expressions of Interest in November and have now submitted formal applications for evaluation and judging. The New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation manages the independent evaluation process, using international criteria.

The winners will be announced on June 29, 2006, at an awards dinner and presentation in Wellington. The Supreme Award winner receives $15,000, with cash prizes of $8000 each for the best entries in other categories.

Profiles and contact details for the 25 finalists are attached.
