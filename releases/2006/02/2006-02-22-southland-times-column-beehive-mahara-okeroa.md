We are back into it. Parliament opened this week with the Prime Minister outlining a vision for New Zealands future. A programme that insures economic transformation, security for families’ young and old, a programme that insures that pride in our national identity continues to grow here at home and on the international stage.  
Last year New Zealanders on balance voted for those who would keep building on the solid progress our country’s been making over the last six years; growing the economy; dropping the level of unemployment to the lowest level in the western world; investing heavily in the critical services of health, and education, and policing; promoting our rich culture and unique identity; protecting our environment; and maintaining our nation’s reputation as principled, independent, and nuclear free.  
Labour and the Progressive Party are not in government to manage the status quo – there is still so much to do. We want all our families, young and old, to enjoy more opportunity and security, and sharing in the progress the country makes.

We want to build pride in the unique national identity of New Zealanders, and to celebrate the achievements and successes of our people past and present who have brought great credit to our country.

And we need a strong economy to deliver the living standards, the services, and the quality of life which the citizens of our first world country expect, deserve, and are prepared to work for.

A strong economy in turn needs healthy, well educated, highly motivated, and confident people to drive it to ever-greater achievements. That’s why the deregulated labour market and underinvestment in health and education of the 1990s could only ever deliver a low wage, low skill, low value economy.

There’s a world of difference between Labour’s ‘New Zealand way’ of promoting higher wages based on higher skills, innovation, productivity, and sustainability – and the right wing parties’ standard prescriptions of slashing the tax base and public spending, cutting back on employees’ rights and protections, sacrificing the environment, and deregulating and privatising. That was the agenda New Zealanders revolted against in 1999, and have rejected ever since.

Maori also make a strong contribution to the economic, cultural and social fabric of New Zealand society. We want to enhance and strengthen Maori potential for the future.

A progressive, modern international economy, in which Maori have a leading role, can grow from a solid base of fast rising education achievements, together with Maori asset and enterprise development.

Everything we do now must be measured for the contribution it makes to the future of our people as achievers, secure in our culture and operating at the forefront of our national and international life. I'd like to see us as a nation build on the success we have all worked so hard to achieve.

Managing and leading the growth of our assets and people is of benefit not just to Maori society - but also to Aotearoa-New Zealand as a whole. We are a country and a people with huge potential.

New Zealand in 2006 is in many ways a work in progress. Our country is beginning to move away from the old economy to a new one; improving the health, education levels, and living standards of all our people – and the services which support our needs; and building a nation from an increasingly diverse population.

Our government’s task is to provide leadership and sound policy to support that journey. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities 2006 will bring as MP for Te Tai Tonga and Minister for Social development and Employment, Conservation and Arts Culture and Heritage
