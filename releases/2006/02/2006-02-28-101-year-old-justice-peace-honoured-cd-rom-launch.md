Associate Minister of Justice, Clayton Cosgrove today paid tribute to New Zealand’s oldest and longest serving Justice of the Peace – 101 year old Malcolm (Mick) Goldsbro’ from Hamilton. The minister spoke in Hamilton today, as part of his official launch of a new CD-ROM training package for JPs.

"Mick" Goldsbro’ was born in 1904 and appointed a JP on 28 August 1940. He actively served until the late 1960s and at 101 years old, having been warranted as a JP for 65 years, he is both New Zealand’s oldest and longest serving JP.

Mr Cosgrove had planned to launch the CD-ROM in Wellington but in researching JPs in New Zealand he had been so impressed by Mr Goldsbro’s longevity of service and dedication that he wished to honour him personally.

“Justices of the Peace perform an invaluable role throughout New Zealand. Mr Goldsbro's dedication the people in his communities is outstanding and humbling, and his commitment to his fellow citizens serves as an inspiration to all New Zealanders,” says Mr Cosgrove.

Mr Goldsbro' assisted the Minister in today's launch of a CD-ROM based computer training package for all new JP’s. They were joined by the one of the country's youngest JPs, 33 year-old Karen Hattaway from Auckland, in marking how this new technology will help train the next generation of Justices of the Peace.

Created by the Ministry of Justice in conjunction with the Royal Federation of NZ Justices Associations, the CD-ROM provides new JPs with a self-paced training package covering all basic aspects of the JP role.

“The CD-ROM is a standard nationwide package that will compliment the existing system where senior JPs in each region train new JPs. It provides greater consistency in JP training and also means JPs in remote areas who had trouble accessing training, or those who could not attend due to time constraints, can now get trained when and where it suits them,” says Mr Cosgrove.

The CD-ROM contains five modules that explain the role and history of JPs, as well as proper procedures including the witnessing of documents, declarations, affidavits, summonses, warrants of arrest and search warrants. There are case studies and video clips to illustrate points, and each module finishes with a quiz for the trainee.

Mr Goldsbro' was presented with a framed photograph of Rangitoto Island which as a young man in Auckland, he had visited many times and which still occupies a special place in his heart.

Representatives from the Police, Corrections, the Ministry of Justice, the Royal Federation of Justices' Associations, and Hamilton residents joined Mr Goldsbro's family and friends for the occasion.

Today's event precedes the Royal Federation of NZ Justices Associations 78th national conference in Greymouth from 3 – 5 March, 2006.

Background information:

Mick Goldsbro  
Malcolm Patteson (Mick) Goldsbro’ was born on 26 September 1904 and appointed a JP on 28 August 1940 in Kawhia where he was working as the county clerk. At that time the local policeman used to carry out duties on horseback. In following years Mr Goldsbro’ held a variety of positions with local government organisations in Otorohanga and Hamilton. In Otorohanga, cases would come before him involving sly-grogging in the “dry” King Country district, and on occasion he had to preside as the Coroner.  
In Hamilton, Mr Goldsbro’s office was very close to the Courthouse and the Police station. Consequently, he was generally first to be called when the services of a JP were required at either. In every town and city he worked, Mr Goldsbro’ served on the bench of the local courts and carried out other JP duties, finally retiring from active JP work in the late 1960s. Mr Goldsbro’ was active in his community, being involved in a variety of Waikato sporting and community groups.

Justices of the Peace  
New Zealand's first Justice of the Peace was appointed in 1814 at the Bay of Islands and regular appointments started to be made after 1840. JPs hold a warrant from the Governor General and are entrusted to uphold the law and serve the community. JPs perform two types of duties - Ministerial and Judicial. Ministerial duties involve witnessing documents, certifying documents, taking declarations and affidavits, issuing summonses and issuing search warrants. Judicial duties involve deciding issues relating to remands and bail, hearing undefended cases in court, presiding over defended trials and conducting preliminary hearings of indictable offences.  
There are approx 10,700 JPs in New Zealand, 65% are male and 35% female.
