A joint New Zealand/Australia campaign to lift workplace safety standards is another step towards meeting the goals of the Workplace Health and Safety Strategy, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Department of Labour inspectors will visit at least 40 demolition sites between now and 31 March to ensure that employers understand how to manage asbestos and demolition risks, and to raise compliance levels. The campaign aims to improve safety for workers, the public and the environment and reflects the government's strong commitment to health and safety.

"It's encouraging to see such a proactive approach to promoting safety practices, an approach which directly supports New Zealand's Workplace Health and Safety Strategy to 2015," Ruth Dyson said.

"We know this campaign is necessary because around 100 workers each year die as a result of occupational injury in New Zealand. This initiative contributes to the strategy's second outcome - encouraging preventative workplace cultures and ensuring workers participate effectively in processes for improving workplace health and safety."

The emphasis of the campaign is on the proactive management of hazards – to identify and minimise them, and to eliminate them wherever practicable.

"So let's get the word out, and lift our workplace health and safety performance - because New Zealand deserves to have healthy people in safe and productive workplaces."

This is the second joint health and safety project between New Zealand and Australia following the 2005 campaign on falls prevention.
