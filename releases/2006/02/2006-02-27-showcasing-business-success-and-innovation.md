Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the launch of newthinking06, a week showcasing innovation and success in business.

The week, which runs from Monday through to Thursday 2 March at Sky City Convention Centre, is focused on key sectors where New Zealand is creating competitive advantage, including information and communications technology, biotechnology and the creative sectors.

"The Labour-led government is committed to transforming the New Zealand economy into a high-income high-value economy that is export led. To create higher standards of living for all New Zealanders our country needs more firms that are innovative and that can successfully compete at the leading edge in offshore markets.

"New Zealand’s future will be determined by the way in which we commercialise our innovations and take them to the world. newthinking06 is designed to provide entrepreneurs and businesses with tools and networks to achieve this," Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealand needs more globally competitive firms and the seminars, exhibitions and business partnering forums taking place this week will help our companies make the right connections to fast-track their growth."

Newthinking06 brings together activities organised by NZ Bio, Incubators New Zealand, Kiwi Expat Association, the Design Institute of New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Capital, Connect New Zealand and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

"All the organisations involved in the week are passionate about growing internationally successful New Zealand companies. They also understand the critical importance of developing global connections that will help increase New Zealand’s export success."

New Thinking ’06 encompasses seminars, exhibitions, workshops, and panel discussions as well as three awards presentations, the NZ Bio Awards, the Telecom New Zealand Incubator Awards and the World Class New Zealand Awards.
