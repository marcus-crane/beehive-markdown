Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker met with Northland's Civil Defence and Emergency Management group today.

"Since taking on the challenging role as Minister of Civil Defence, I have had somewhat of a baptism of fire with flooding events around the country and the finalisation of assistance to the Matata area.

"From what I have seen already though, Civil Defence and Emergency Management groups around New Zealand are well organised and focussed on their task of management," he said.

Mr Barker met with representatives of the group to outline his work programme for the Civil Defence portfolio.

Mr Barker said that "there is a large programme of work underway with my Ministry and one of these pieces of work will be the introduction of the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan."

New Zealand's dynamic physical environment and level of technological development means that we are now exposed to a wide variety of hazards.

"Flooding, earthquakes, fire and other disasters are being exacerbated by our propensity for development. Work is underway to ensure that we have the capacity to effectively deal with these events," said Mr Barker.

The new National Plan, which comes into force on 1 July 2006, provides for the civil defence emergency management arrangements necessary to prepare for and manage emergencies arising from New Zealand’s hazards. This includes provisions for supporting the management of local emergencies.

A guide that is being developed, to deal with nation civil defence emergencies, will accompany the plan. Other emergencies, such as pandemic or bio-security events, are dealt with by their respective lead agencies under those agencies' own plans. However, aspects of such emergencies, such as evacuations, will be supported under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act and the Plan.

Another significant piece of work included the release of two Tsunami reports “the two reports gather together all we know about the tsunami threat. It’s bigger than we had thought, but effective preparation by New Zealanders can greatly reduce the risk of death or injury,” said Mr Barker.

The reports, commissioned by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management from the government-owned research agency GNS Science, note that preparedness can reduce the risk of death and injury from tsunami by 90-95%. But if tsunami strike communities there could be significant numbers of deaths, comparable to those predicted for earthquakes.

Mr Barker says work is underway to improve monitoring for tsunami, so there will be better alerts and more warning time for people to move to safety.

"Meeting with the Northland Civil Defence and Emergency Management group today has given me an opportunity to reinforce the importance of this work, but it has also highlighted to me the strength of work already underway in the regions of New Zealand.

"The collaboration between agencies such as Local Government, Police and other central and local government agencies has been a breath of fresh air and I am looking forward to continuing to support these groups.
