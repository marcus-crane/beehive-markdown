Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today accepted an inaugural AccEase Accessibility Tick Accreditation award, for the CommunityNet Aotearoa website ([www.community.net.nz](http://www.community.net.nz)).

The awards recognise websites that demonstrate best practice in accessibility, significantly exceeding New Zealand and international mandatory standards.

The CommunityNet Aotearoa website was chosen as one of three to receive an award, from over 150 websites audited by AccEase, a web accessibility consultancy.

As a digital Minister, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said having access to information and technology was vital for people with disabilities and for the community sector where many organisations could not afford new, fast computers.

“Many people who use CommunityNet Aotearoa have disabilities or live and work in small communities. Other users of the site work with or in organisations providing vital social services for people with disabilities and communities that are under-served by technology”, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

“Internet access is hugely enabling to individuals and communities that may otherwise be quite isolated, allowing them to play a much greater role in society.

"I am delighted that CommunityNet Aotearoa, which was designed with accessibility as a priority and a focus on the community, has been recognised in this way," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

CommunityNet Aotearoa is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, and guided by an Advisory Group of community representatives. It aims to improve on-line access to information for community and voluntary groups and citizens, and promote information sharing between groups. The Department is taking a lead role in delivering community aspects of the Government’s Digital Strategy.

“CommunityNet Aotearoa is a part of that strategy that is visibly delivering value 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Over time, the strategy will make a big difference to the quality of people's lives and their ability to participate in the economic and social development of our nation”, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.
