Courts Minister Rick Barker visited the Whangarei Courthouse today and praised the sustained improvements in the management of cases achieved at the Court.

Recent figures demonstrate that the Whangarei District Court has continued to make significant progress in reducing the time cases await hearing over the last year.

·There has been a 34% reduction in the median age of criminal summary defended cases on hand (from 179 in January 2005 to 118 days in January 2006)  
·In the Youth Court, the median age of cases on hand has more than halved (from 68 in January 2005 to 30 days in January 2006)  
·There has been a 26% reduction in the median age of depositions (from 73 in January 2005 to 54 in January 2006)

This flies in the face of Lawyer Dave Sayes' comments April last year that "It's not going to solve the problems, it's just a waste of money", Mr Barker says that continued and incremental improvements to the Court have enabled this significant and positive progress.

"I'm not saying it's perfect, but I am saying that officials have worked with me in a positive and progressive way to deal with caseloads across jurisdictions. We will continue with these improvements and the results will continue to evidence our success," said Mr Barker.

The management of older cases will continue to be given particular focus over the next year through the work of the Ministry of Justice’s Service Improvement Programme, a programme to implement the recommendations of the 2004 Baseline Review of the Ministry.

In another positive development for Whangarei, the recent appointment of Judge Duncan Harvey will bring the number of resident Judges at Whangarei District Court to its full complement of four. Judge Harvey will take up his appointment in April.

The Minister’s visit to Whangarei coincides with the first week of the Ministry of Justice’s Collections field enforcement campaign, an intensive period of nationwide enforcement aimed at fines defaulters over the next month.

“Last year 330 cars were clamped or seized in one month of intensive enforcement action and we are looking at the same again over the next four weeks,” said Rick Barker.

As at 31 January 2006 in Whangarei there was $11.9 million dollars in unpaid fines, of which $4.9 million is overdue.

Offences relating to motor vehicles make up the largest percentage of fines imposed, and men are by far the main offenders.

Clamping or seizure of cars, seizure of property and attachment orders on wages, salaries and benefits are included in the range of enforcement action the Ministry is able to undertake to collect unpaid fines.
