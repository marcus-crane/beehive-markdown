In his first major speech on the economy this year Finance Minister Michael Cullen reminded business leaders not to talk themselves into a recession the country does not need to have.

"We have an economy that has come off the boil after an extended period of very strong growth. However, to talk, as some have, of falling into recession is both naïve and a little dangerous," Dr Cullen told a business seminar at Chen Palmer and Partners in Wellington.

"The slowing in growth reflects cyclical factors rather than structural changes to New Zealand's outlook. Indeed we should be very proud of an economy that will still be growing at around 1.6% per annum at the trough of the economic cycle.

Dr Cullen warned of the dangers of using business confidence surveys as an indicator of where the economy is heading long term.

"One leading economist has pointed out that business confidence in the last five years averaged negative 16 per cent while GDP growth has been running ahead of trend at an average of 3.7%."

Dr Cullen noted that the economy was well prepared to manage its way through any dip in the cycle. "The smart money is on a return to strong growth in the medium-term."

Dr Cullen reaffirmed the government's commitment to building the platform for long-term growth through its economic transformation agenda, detailing plans for critical infrastructure investments, telecommunications regulation and business tax reform.

Dr Cullen also reminded the state sector that the government expected a pay-off from the significant investments it has made in that sector in recent years.

"State sector CEOs need to be aware we expect that dividend to emerge starting from this year and that one of the implications of that will be careful management of labour costs."
