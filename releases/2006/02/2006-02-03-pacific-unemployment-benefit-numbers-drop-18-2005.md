Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today welcomed the decrease in the number of Pacific people on the Unemployment Benefit.

"Figures released by the Ministry for Social Development show that the number of Pacific people receiving the Unemployment Benefit dropped from 12,317 in 1999 to 4,075 in the year to December 2005, a drop of 8242 or 67 per cent," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"And in the last year the number of Pacific people receiving an Unemployment Benefit fell by a further 905, or 18 per cent over the year to December 2005.

“These figures are very encouraging, as we’re seeing definite results from the government’s focus on helping people off benefits and into work.

“Pacific people make an important economic contribution, and participating in the workforce strengthens families and contributes to the wellbeing of wider communities.

“This government is committed to supporting economic development for Pacific people, and the contributions they make to a strong economy and vibrant communities,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.
