The Minister of Mâori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia is looking forward to celebrating the 166th Anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

"I believe we are on the eve of a new stage of development, which rejects the notion of Mâori as a marginalized tribal group clinging to the past," says Parekura Horomia.

"Everything we do now must be measured for the contribution it makes to the future of our people as achievers, secure in our culture and operating at the forefront of our national and international life. I'd like to see us as a nation build on the success we have all worked so hard to achieve.

"Managing and leading the growth of our assets and people is of benefit not just to Mâori society - but also to Aotearoa-New Zealand as a whole.  
"We are a country and a people with huge potential. We are committed to working with each other to realise this.

"Waitangi Day is a day for us all. Many events make up Waitangi Day and they all contribute to a strong sense of our nation’s identity and purpose, and draw our communities together.

"I hope everyone in Aotearoa-New Zealand is able to celebrate Waitangi Day in some way and in doing so celebrate the uniqueness of our nation and the wealth and talent of our people, I intend to.
