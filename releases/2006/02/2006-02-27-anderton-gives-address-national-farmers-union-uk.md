Jim Anderton is giving a keynote address at the National Farmers' Union in the United Kingdom, as New Zealand's new Minister of Agriculture. In his speech he praised New Zealand farmers because they had developed excellent, innovative products as well as overcoming immense disadvantages in distances from markets.

Jim Anderton highlighted the challenge facing all agricultural producers today of being customer focused. “New Zealand and British farmers must meet the same high standards because we have the same customers. Both are well placed to provide evidence that they meet these expectations and earn customer loyalty.”

On the international trade front, Jim Anderton reaffirmed that New Zealand recognises the substantial commitment that the EU has made towards the elimination of export subsidies. Likewise, the EU CAP reforms have been substantial.

“But New Zealand is looking to the EU to improve its offer on market access as well – their must be a real improvement in trade from the negotiations. At the same time we are we not asking for ‘give, give, give’ on the part of the EU. The US needs to do more on domestic subsidies and a number of developing countries should take more responsibility for reducing non-agricultural tariffs.”

"We all have an interest, and a duty as good global citizens, to ensure that this ‘development round’ lives up to its promise. There has never been a time when the messages from our communities have been clearer that we need to do more to lift countries out of extreme poverty, Jim Anderton said.

Success in this Round is critical for the development agenda, for farmers, companies and consumers -- and for the long-term health of the multilateral trading system. There is a lot at stake," the Minister of Agriculture concluded in Birmingham.
