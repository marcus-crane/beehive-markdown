New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Bangkok will be career diplomat Brook Barrington, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“This will be an important year for our relationship with Thailand. The two countries will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations and I look forward to advancing the strategic partnership between New Zealand and Thailand,” Mr Peters said.

“I am delighted that Dr Barrington will be at the helm as New Zealand continues to build its already close relationship with such an influential player in the region, especially given new regional initiatives such as the East Asian Summit.”

“New Zealand’s links with Thailand have grown rapidly over the last decade. A Closer Economic Partnership agreement was concluded last April. A Joint Ministerial Commission will deal with issues outside the Closer Economic Partnership is likely to meet for the first time later this year.

“We are honoured that Crown Princess Sirindhorn, a much respected member of Thailand’s Royal family, will visit New Zealand to mark the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations,” said Mr Peters.

Other events planned for the year include a New Zealand Festival to be held in Bangkok.

Dr Barrington joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1990 and was most recently the Foreign Policy Advisor in the Prime Minister's Department. His previous overseas assignments have included Canberra and Brussels.

He will take up his assignment in July.
