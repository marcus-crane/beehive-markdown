Mr Peters' programme will include a meeting with Fiji’s Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and consultations with Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola.

“This will be my first visit to the Pacific in my role as Minister of Foreign Affairs, reflecting the key place of Fiji in the region and the importance New Zealand places on our relationship with Fiji,” Mr Peters said.

“The visit will continue New Zealand’s process of active engagement with the Fiji Government and other key players in Fiji. New Zealand will continue to provide support in the lead up to elections due later this year.

“New Zealand is also supporting a fair and transparent election process in Fiji through our bilateral aid programme. New Zealand is making a substantial contribution towards technical assistance, including training, to the Elections Office.

“The development assistance that New Zealand provides to Fiji is an important element in the bilateral relationship. I intend to discuss the aid programme with Fijian counterparts, and visit housing and health-related projects funded by NZAID,” Mr Peters said.
