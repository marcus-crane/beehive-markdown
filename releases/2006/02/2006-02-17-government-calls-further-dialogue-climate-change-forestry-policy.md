Ministers Jim Anderton and David Parker said today that the position taken by a number of forest industry associations over climate change policy dialogue was unfortunate.

“It is a shame that the forest industry has chosen to break-off dialogue with the government; we certainly are keen to keep discussing climate change matters with the industry" the Ministers said today.

On 21st December 2005, Jim Anderton acknowledged there were a number of challenges with existing policy as it relates to climate change. These include an inequitable treatment of forestry compared with other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, and a lack of strong signals to encourage landowners to keep their land in forests and establish new forests.

"At that time the Government stated that it needed to take another look at the treatment of deforestation. That is what we are doing," Ministers said.

The Ministers also acknowledged how important forests, and in particular commercial forests are in helping New Zealand absorb greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the effects of climate change.

"In December, the Government acknowledged the forest industry’s desire to have certainty on these issues as soon as possible and made a commitment to deliver that. However, these issues are complex and the options to address climate change issues across the economy are strongly interlinked and they need to be considered together," said the Ministers today.

“The industry associations are now saying the Government should ring-fence the forestry sector and make decisions in advance of every other sector. However, the Government's response to climate change policy needs to be coordinated across sectors and the whole economy. We are working towards this now and invite the forestry sector to engage with us constructively on the issues.

" We welcome their input to this important area of work," the Ministers said.
