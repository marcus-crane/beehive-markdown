The Royal New Zealand Navy will being seeking proposals for disposal of the decommissioned frigate HMNZS Canterbury within the next few weeks, Defence Minister Phil said today.

"Based on experience from the previous disposal of warships, the Navy anticipates that responses will range from buying the ship for scrap metal to proposals for sinking it as a dive wreck," Mr Goff said.

"Each proposal will be assessed on its merits, and at this stage no options have been discounted.

"It is anticipated that most responses will come from New Zealand, although some interest from overseas is also likely," Mr Goff said.
