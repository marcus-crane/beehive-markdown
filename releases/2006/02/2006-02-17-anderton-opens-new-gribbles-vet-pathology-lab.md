"Animal health is a truly important sector for New Zealand. It is no exaggeration to say New Zealand depends for our natural advantage on the excellence of our animal health programmes, Jim Anderton said.

"We can't have a viable primary sector without the vital work done in surveillance of animal diseases. Our primary industries have been the backbone of the New Zealand economy for more than a century. We remain dependent on them today, as the level of sophistication rises and we learn to extract more value. And the animal health sector has both a proactive and defensive role in that development.

"It has a defensive role in keeping our existing stock free from disease. And there is a proactive role in developing innovative, high value and high skill new businesses. Our export base depends on high quality surveillance of animal health. We need to be able to establish that we are free of notifiable diseases.

"The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry first set up a network of regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories to deal with the issues more than a generation ago. Gribbles came into the scene from Australia in 2002. Today Gribbles has laboratories in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Invermay and Lincoln," Jim Anderton said.

"The important role the labs play can be seen in the recent diagnoses it has made of diseases that have required a strong response from MAF. For example, it found mycoplasma mycoides subspecies in calves and goats  
This is a microorganism that causes pneumonia in cattle and goats. It's also discovered trichinosis in backyard pigs, which is a food borne parasite that can affect people.

"We only need to think of the current fears about the risks of bird flu to reflect how important it is to have a strong animal health surveillance programme in place. I know Gribbles has alerted MAF several times to suspect exotic diseases in poultry. If the bird flu disease reaches here, it may likely first be diagnosed in one of these facilities. If the disease does mutate into a form that could start an epidemic in humans, then the work of this laboratory and others like it will be crucial to saving lives.

"The stakes are high and these laboratories are in the front line of our defences against incoming threats. New Zealanders have long set a high standard in our animal health management.

"I want to urge this business, as I urge all of our agri-businesses, to seek new ways to leverage our expertise. The government is ready to work closely in partnership with industry in developing innovative, high-value, and high skill products that we can take to the world," the Minister of Agriculture said.

"The role of this facility and the people who work here is crucial for our primary industries, the health of the New Zealand economy and the living standards of New Zealanders. I congratulate you on this new centre and I wish you all the best with it in the future," Jim Anderton said at the opening today.
