A further 19 Prime Minister's High Performance Coach Scholarships have been awarded to support New Zealand’s top coaches this year, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The 19 additional recipients announced today are on top of the 95 scholarships announced in December 2005.

"These scholarships give coaches the opportunity to further develop the skills and experience necessary to become a world class coach," said Trevor Mallard.

"This government is committed to developing coaches so we continue to get the very best results. We have enjoyed a wide range of sporting successes over the last year and the fact is that behind most great athletes is a great coach. Investing in coaches is a smart way to enhance our top athletes of tomorrow."

The scholarship programme, now in its fifth year, gives coaches the opportunity to gain the knowledge and experience needed to inspire our athletes.

The recipients being announced today include hockey coach Sue McLeish and yachting coach Matt Davies who were both awarded Prime Minister's High Performance Coach Scholarships, worth up to $10,000.

Sue McLeish will use her scholarship to travel to Rome alongside the Hockey High Performance Team. She will be mentored by the National Women's Head Coach Ian Rutledge at the Hockey World Cup Qualifying Tournament for teams ranked 6 - 18th in the world. If New Zealand qualifies for the 2006 Hockey World Cup, Sue will then travel to Madrid for further development and mentoring.

Matt Davies plans to use his scholarship to gain knowledge in the Paralympic discipline of sailing. Matt will travel to Australia to meet with the vice president of the International Foundation for Disabled Sailing Phil Vardy, as well as entering in to a mentoring arrangement with 2004 Olympic Games sailing coach Dan Slater.

Trevor Mallard said the government has committed $1.15 million to the 2006 programme.

The programme is administered by SPARC’s (Sport & Recreation New Zealand) high performance network, the New Zealand Academy of Sport.
