Minister of Mâori Affairs, Parekura Horomia is pleased to see yet another drop in the number of Maori receiving unemployment benefit.  
"The number of Maori receiving the unemployment benefit dropped from 44,378 in 1999 to 18,655 in the year to December 2005, a drop of 25,723 or 58 percent," says Parekura Horomia.

"And in the last year the number of Maori in receipt of an unemployment benefit dropped by a further 4033 or 17.8 percent.

"The reducing figures reflect determination and an engaging economy.

"As I've said before the path for Mâori from dependency to development is through education, employment and enterprise; Mâori have the ability to steer their own economic development and the primary responsibility for successful Mâori development lies with Mâori.

"Maori are responding to that challenge, and the declining number of unemployed Maori demonstrates this commitment.  
"This government shares that commitment. We have a unity of purpose and we are all focused on the contribution that Mâori make to a strong and growing economy," says Parekura Horomia.
