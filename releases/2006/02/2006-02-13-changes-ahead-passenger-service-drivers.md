Legislation is being introduced to Parliament this week to allow passenger service drivers, whose passenger endorsements expired on 16 January under the [new provisions of the Land Transport Act 1998](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2453560334&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1998-110%2Fs.29a&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1998-110/s.29a), to apply for reinstatement.

The proposals will allow the drivers to apply to the Director of Land Transport, who can approve reinstatement where satisfied that issuing the endorsement would not be contrary to the public interest.

The legislation also allows for new applications by those currently not eligible to apply for a P endorsement, and expands the criteria used by the Director of Land Transport to make decisions.

Under changes to the Act, which came into effect on 16 January 2006, people convicted of murder, sexual offences punishable by seven or more years’ imprisonment, and specified serious violent offences, cannot hold or apply for a licence to drive passengers in a passenger service vehicle (a P endorsement). For P endorsement holders with a past conviction under section 29A of the Act this provision automatically removed their endorsement.

Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven said the proposed new legislation is intended to fix the problem for former P endorsement holders whose offences were at the minor end of the scale.

“We want to make sure the Act allows people, where appropriate, to continue their employment as passenger service drivers without compromising public safety and security,” Mr Duynhoven said.
