Thirty Timaru families will receive a free heat pump or wood pellet burner for their home over the next month, as part of the government's Warm Homes trial, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

The Timaru initiative is the second trial of the government’s Warm Homes project and is being run by the Ministry for the Environment and Environment Canterbury, and is supported by the Timaru District Council. The Ministry for the Environment has contributed $50,000 for the new heaters.

More than 50 per cent of Timaru houses are currently heated with open fires or old wood burners. These release soot into the air which causes air pollution and health problems, particularly during winter. With new heaters, residents will not only save energy but will also enjoy a clean, warm and healthy home.

Homes will be selected in the next few weeks based on the type and age of their heating appliance, with open fires and old wood burners at the top of the list.

"Timaru has a serious air quality problem," said Mr Benson-Pope. "The town exceeded the fine particles National Environmental Standard 40 times last year. The main contributor to this problem – over 80 per cent – is home heating, open fires and old wood burners.

"There are heating alternatives for residents of Timaru, which are healthier, more comfortable and may be even cheaper than an open fire or wood burner," he said.

Environment Canterbury chairman Sir Kerry Burke says Timaru has a serious air pollution problem, with 34 to 53 high pollution days a year over the past seven years.

"The National Environmental Standards for air quality say that we can’t have more than one high pollution day a year by 2013," said Sir Kerry. “We are about to consult with Timaru ratepayers about a subsidy programme to help residents convert to clean heat, so we are very pleased to be have this government-sponsored trial take place first."

The trial will build on the existing South Canterbury ‘Healthy Homes’ programme which has been insulating and adding energy efficiency measures to older houses in Timaru. A similar successful trial was run in Tokoroa in the North Island last year.
