Jim Anderton welcomes the 'P' march arriving at Parliament on 23 February.

"Raising awareness about the devastating effects of this dangerous drug is necessary to curb the demand for this drug and I welcome all efforts in this regard," Jim Anderton said

"As Minister responsible for this government’s drug policy, I have toured the country chairing “ P” Alcohol and other Drug forums. I have secured funding in each budget for more treatment, more research, more community programmes to raise awareness, as well as tougher legislation to increase police powers and penalties against drug pushers and I will continue these efforts," he said.

"But the illicit drug trade is not an issue that a government can counter alone, there must be support from within the community and every effort like this one will help to deliver the message that “P” is a very dangerous drug and should be left alone," Jim Anderton said.

“Information on 'P' is available on various government funded websites, the Alcohol and Drug Helpline, and the community action youth and drugs programmes (CAYADs) which are located in the worst affected areas. I am concerned that Ms Cotter appears to have had difficulty accessing this information and have asked officials to investigate the matter and report back to me,” Jim Anderton said today.

"Unfortunately, I am not able to meet the marchers as I will be overseas for ten days on Cabinet business from Thursday 23rd February. I have written to Ms Cotter to advise her of this. My colleague Hon. Nanaia Mahuta, Minister of Customs and Youth affairs and a member of the Ministerial Committee on Drugs, will meet the marchers and brief me on my return."
