The forestry industry today gets a vote of confidence today with the opening of the new City Forest's sawmill in Milburn in Otago. "The Dunedin City Council's investment into wood processing gives the right signal to the region and the forestry industry as a whole. It is a forward-looking and positive investment in the region's future and will add to the regional development successes of this important part of New Zealand," says the Minister of Forestry, Jim Anderton at the opening of the City Forests sawmill in Milburn today.

"The City Forests' decision to move into wood processing was a significant step for the company. I acknowledge that this development is taking place against a background of difficult market conditions for the forestry industry.

"Industry leaders need to take a longer-term view of the forestry sector. Wood processing moves New Zealand up the processing chain and adds value to production. We can earn better returns by manufacturing high quality timber products that we can be exporting raw logs.

"Added value is the only way for the New Zealand economy to develop and it is crucial we use our creativity and talents to maximise the returns from our raw materials. We must create finished products for which there is market demand," says Jim Anderton.

"I am here to give a very positive signal to this region that the industry has a Minister who is passionate about the future of New Zealand's forestry industry and who has great pleasure in seeing this new plant at Milburn open," says Jim Anderton.
