Justice Minister Mark Burton today announced the location of a youth residential home in Hamilton.

The Te Hurihanga residence will be located at the Te Ara Hou Village on Morrinsville Road on the outskirts of Hamilton alongside other community and social services offered within the village. This is in keeping with a unanimous recommendation made by a locally appointed site selection steering committee in July. Following the committee's recommendation, former Justice Minister Phil Goff requested a community consultation process, which was carried out by the Justice Ministry from early August through to October 2005.

Over 750 letters and submissions and a petition were received as part of the consultation process. Around a third of all the letters and submissions the Ministry received were supportive of locating the site at the Te Ara Hou Village while the remainder expressed concerns with the site.

"I thank all those residents and organisations who provided their feedback as part of the consultation process. In coming to my decision I carefully considered the views of the community, the recommendation of the site selection committee, and the advice of Ministry officials," Mr Burton said.

"I am pleased that a significant level of support was expressed for the aims and approach of the Te Hurihanga programme, though I do appreciate that some residents have concerns about the programme being set up in this location. I am confident that any concerns about Te Hurihanga will be addressed by the measures that will be put in place to ensure the safety of the community.

“It is important that the community has an ongoing involvement in the programme. Youth Horizons, the lead organisation delivering the Te Hurihanga programme, will be inviting local people to join a Community Liaison Group to have input into the development of the residence’s operating procedures, and to have an ongoing role in monitoring the impact of the Te Hurihanga residence on the community.

“The Justice Ministry has already had expressions of interest from members of the community wanting to be involved in the Community Liaison Committee. The Ministry of Justice is committed to ongoing engagement with the local community and will continue to respond to any queries or concerns that are raised,” Mr Burton said.

“The Te Ara Hou Village’s location on the outskirts of Hamilton and its co-location with the other community and social services offered within the village meant the site was viewed by the site selection steering committee as a suitable location for the residence. In making my decision I have accepted this view," Mr Burton said.

The Te Hurihanga residence will resemble a large family home with ‘house parents’ creating a homelike environment. There will be a maximum of eight young people (aged 14 to 17 years) living in the house at any time.

"The programme provides a mix of education and life skills training as well as health care, aimed at providing the skills that will help young people to turn their lives around, re-integrate within their communities and curb further offending before it leads them to prison. Once in place Te Hurihanga will be of significant benefit to Hamilton and will help make the city a genuinely safer community," Mr Burton said.

Background Information

Te Hurihanga, loosely translated as ‘the turning point’, is an intensive therapeutic programme designed to help young male offenders turn their lives around to become positive members of their community. Most of the programme is delivered in the community in the young person’s home, but during the first phase of the programme the young person lives in the Te Hurihanga residence. Youth Horizons run similar programmes to Te Hurihanga around the country. The Hamilton programme is being developed as a model for communities across New Zealand.

The Anglican Diocese of Waikato, which owns the site in the Te Ara Hou village, put the site forward to the site selection committee because of its support for the programme and the belief that it would fit well with other social services provided there. The site is supported by all the social service providers in the village.

Young people who have committed very serious offences, such as murder and manslaughter, or sexual offences, will not attend Te Hurihanga.

The Ministry of Justice actively consulted with the local community about the proposed site and worked with interested groups and individuals to address any concerns they raised.

The Te Hurihanga Site Selection Steering Committee was chaired by Hamilton City Councillor Daphne Bell and comprised representatives from the Hamilton City Council, the Ministry of Justice, Youth Horizons, Maatua Whangai, the Police and local Member of Parliament Martin Gallagher.

Local residents were informed of the Minister's decision through a mail drop with letters scheduled to arrive in letterboxes on Friday afternoon.
