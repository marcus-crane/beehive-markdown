Agriculture, Biosecurity and Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton today visited the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Investigation and Diagnostic Centre at Wallaceville, Upper Hutt.

"This Centre is a vitally important part of MAF’s ability to investigate and diagnose suspect exotic animal diseases in New Zealand, such as foot and mouth disease and avian influenza. Staff at this facility played a key role in last year’s foot and mouth disease hoax on Waiheke Island.

Today is Minister Anderton’s first opportunity to visit the Wallaceville campus since taking up his portfolios after the 2005 General Election.

“MAF has had a presence at Wallaceville for 100 years and the science credentials of this facility are impeccable and internationally renowned,” Minister Anderton said.

“Wallaceville has New Zealand’s only Physical Containment 3+ laboratory, which is a critical part of its ability to diagnose exotic diseases.

“MAF will soon team up with AgriQuality, AgResearch, and ESR to establish the National Centre for Biosecurity and Infectious Disease at Wallaceville. This initiative will be New Zealand’s largest concentration of microbiologists and epidemiologists focused on human and animal diseases. It will become a centre of excellence in this area of importance for all New Zealanders,” Minister Anderton said.
