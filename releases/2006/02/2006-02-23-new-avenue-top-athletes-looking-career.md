A new initiative announced today will create career opportunities for top athletes in sports-friendly workplaces, Minister for Sport and Recreation Trevor Mallard said today.

The Avenues programme helps match top athletes looking to develop a professional career with employers who can accommodate the rigorous training and competition schedules that athletes face.

"This is a great initiative that will help athletes be better prepared for when they retire from sport, as well as taking some of the financial pressure off athletes while they are training and competing," Trevor Mallard said.

"This government wants to support our top athletes so they can succeed in the sporting arena, while also developing a career. We believe it is important to build pride in our unique national identity - supporting our sporting successes and stars through initiatives like Avenues is a significant part of that."

The programme is administered by Sport & Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) and is supported by human resources company Adecco and the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC).

Silver Fern Jodi Te Huna is the first athlete to be appointed through the programme, having recently accepted a position in Accident Compensation Corporation's (ACC). Jodi will start work with ACC after the Commonwealth Games.

Trevor Mallard congratulated the Silver Fern on her appointment.

"Avenues is a great way for companies to support top athletes like Jodi Te Huna and get behind New Zealand sport. It is a wonderful example of how New Zealand really backs its athletes – making sure we support them every step of the way," Trevor Mallard said.

Other companies involved in Avenues include NZ Post, Meridian Energy, Telecom, Westpac, Vector Network and Vero Insurance.

The programme has been piloted through Netball NZ and Hockey NZ. It will be rolled out to all performance National Sport Organisations post the Commonwealth Games, in March.

Questions and answers and comment from Jodi Te Huna and Netball NZ are attached.

Comment from Jodi Te Huna

"It’s very exciting to be starting work with an employer who understands the pressures of being an athlete, I’m really looking forward to it," Jodi Te Huna said.

"The programme will be a great help for top athletes who often struggle to find time for both their work and sporting commitments."

Comment from Netball NZ

Netball NZ CEO Shelley McMeeken:

"This is an excellent opportunity for Jodi to be able to pursue her career  
whilst performing at the top level of netball. This supportive initiative  
ensures that our elite athletes remain available to our sport for longer."

Questions and Answers - Avenues

What is Avenues?  
Avenues is the name of SPARC’s Athlete Employment Programme. This programme is to help :

- top athletes prepare for and find careers with employers that understand the pressures of being an athlete.
- retiring athletes to enter the workforce following a career in sport.

Why is Avenues necessary?  
As top athletes take on rigorous training and competition schedules, there is often little time left to juggle a career outside of sport.

It is important that top athletes are able to train and compete while not excessively compromising their long-term career opportunities or their ability to support themselves during their competition years.

How much is being invested in Avenues by SPARC this financial year?  
$100,000

What can Avenues provide athletes?

- Access to employment opportunities that recognise the lifestyle needs of an elite athlete.
- Access to employers who understand that top athletes need flexibility while they train to reach their potential.
- Access to specialist consultants at human resources company Adecco free of charge.
- Career planning, psychological and general profile screening.

What can Avenues provide employers?

- Access to employees who not only have the necessary skills and experience to make a great contribution to a workplace, but who, as top athletes have enormous determination and drive to succeed in whatever they do.
- A way to support sport and athletes in New Zealand.
- Employees who raise morale and act as examples of high achievement to staff.

Will the athlete be appropriately qualified for the job?  
Like any other candidate for a job, the athlete will go through the employers recruitment process. For the athlete to get the job, they need to be appropriately qualified and have the necessary experience - just like any other candidate.

Which athletes can use Avenues?  
To be eligible athletes must be carded under the SPARC carding system.

Which organisations are currently supporting Avenues?  
The founding businesses that are currently committed to Avenues are:

Westpac  
Telecom  
Meridian Energy  
Vector Network  
Vero Insurance  
NZ Post

Avenues is also proudly supported by the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) and Adecco.

What is Adecco’s and the NZOC’s role in Avenues?  
SPARC has been working closely with the NZOC (New Zealand Olympic Committee) and human resources company Adecco on assisting athletes with career opportunities.

Adecco works with the IOC (International Olympic Committee) to run an athlete career programme that has assisted some 2000 Olympians from 17 countries to find career paths that are appropriate to their needs.

Through the NZOC’s close connection with the IOC, the Adecco Athlete Career Programme has been brought to New Zealand to benefit athletes in Olympic sports.

The Adecco programme works with athletes from Olympic sports, while Avenues works with carded athletes in performance sports.

Addeco also supports Avenues athletes with access to specialist consultants free of charge.

How many athletes have been placed through Avenues?  
Jodi Te Huna (Netball) is the first athlete that SPARC has placed through the programme. The programme is initially being piloted with two sports - hockey and netball and SPARC will roll out to other sports following the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Over the next year SPARC is hoping to place as many athletes as possible.

How many athletes are currently registered with Avenues?  
Five athletes are currently registered, with more expected to register when the programme is rolled out to all performance National Sports Organisations. The conclusion of the Commonwealth Games is also expected to attract more athletes - who have been fully committed to the games up to now.
