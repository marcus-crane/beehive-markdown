Ms Mahuta says Real Work: a report from the national research project on the state of youth work in Aotearoa, released today, provides an important snapshot of the valuable work done by youth workers across New Zealand – many of whom go unrecognised for their efforts.

“This research acknowledges the tremendous work done by the many people working tirelessly and passionately to make a difference for young people. Many of them contribute huge amounts of volunteer hours and are constantly finding creative ways to work with young people, often on a limited budget and with few resources.”

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban also welcomed the release of the research. This project was supported by the Ministry of Youth Development, the Department of Internal Affairs and the JR McKenzie Trust.

"The report is aimed at strengthening the sector and identifying and removing barriers to its professional development," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

Among findings of the research are that youth development is an issue for the whole community, not just young people “at risk”, and that more work needs to be done on defining youth work and improving job security for youth workers.

Both Ministers said that government agencies involved in supporting the youth work sector would examine the findings in more detail and continue to work closely with it on issues the research had identified.

Summary of Findings and recommendations from Real Work: a report from the national research project on the state of youth work in Aotearoa.

Findings  
·Youth development should be valued as an issue for the whole community, and not just for young people who are “at risk”.  
·There is a need to define youth work and promote what youth workers do.  
·Further research into effective approaches to the support and development of New Zealand youth is required.  
·Job security for youth workers and resourcing for community organisations needs to be improved.  
·Development of the role of youth workers alongside professionals in other social service sectors, such as education, welfare, employment, justice and community development needs to be encouraged.  
·Tensions between raising standards of professional practice and maintaining the currently high level of “grassroots” community involvement in youth work needs to be negotiatated.  
·More research into the needs of Asian young people is required, as well as recruitment of more Asian youth workers.  
·Good practice in youth organisations needs to be clarified and promoted. These standards also need to be linked to evaluation and funding.  
·Schools should be recognised as an important setting for youth work, and funding for youth workers in schools should be developed.  
·Local youth worker networks should be recognised as a key to developing safe and ethical practice, and resources provided for them to operate effectively.  
·Current youth work courses should be linked into degree programmes, and New Zealand based post-graduate research into youth development should be promoted.  
·The role of the National Youth Workers Network should be recognised and resourced .  
·Volunteerism in youth organisations should be promoted and rewarded.

Recommendations  
The report makes over 40 recommendations based on the findings listed above. The key recommendations are that government should:

·Fund research into the needs of Asian young people (especially foreign students), and work with community organisations to recruit more Asian youth workers.  
·Work with the Ministry of Education to investigate current practice and develop funding to support the involvement of youth workers in schools.  
·Conduct more research into improving evaluation of youth development outcomes for young people. Assistance should also be provided to youth and community organisations to develop their own evaluation and reporting practices.  
·See the relationship with the National Youth Workers Network as a key to rolling out information and policies to the community sector.  
·Promote the role of volunteers in youth organisations, by working with the National Youth Workers Network to develop a pilot for a New Zealand version of Americorps - a scheme where young people coming out of secondary school can give a year of voluntary service with a community organisation, in return for a grant towards their tertiary study fees for the following year.
