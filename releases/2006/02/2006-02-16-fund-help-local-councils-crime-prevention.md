Justice and Local Government Minister Mark Burton today announced the availability of a contestable fund worth $250,000 for local councils to strengthen crime prevention through environmental design.

"One of the most effective ways of reducing crime in public places, for example violent crime, is to change the physical environment," Mark Burton said.

The funding is part of the implementation of National Guidelines for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), which were released in November last year. Approaches envisaged include better surveillance; improved lighting and signage; and safe access to public transport stops and stations. Total funding of $250,000 is available for grants to assist in the completion of CPTED assessments and plans.

"Effective urban planning, design and space management strategies can reduce the likelihood of crime and deliver numerous social and economic benefits over the long-term," Mark Burton said.

"Places that feel safe are vibrant – they attract people, activity and positive social interaction. Popular places are better for business, with high pedestrian numbers resulting in higher turnover, employment, profit and investment."

Territorial authorities are now invited to submit expressions of interest in conducting CPTED projects. Smaller and rural territory authorities and those with no existing work or experience in crime prevention through environmental design are especially encouraged to apply.

"Crime and the fear of crime affect people's quality of life – people may avoid going out at night or stay away from certain areas. Strategic and integrated crime prevention initiatives can contribute to creating a sense of security and help build safer communities," Mark Burton said.
