By Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter

Over the past five years, there has been a lot written about immigration and the changing cultural mix in New Zealand. To read much of it, a stranger would get the impression that New Zealand is a deeply divided nation, torn asunder by the arrival of new faces at our borders.  
But over the next few weeks, we will again make a lie of this impression. From January 29 to February 15, New Zealanders will celebrate Chinese New Year, and I say New Zealanders quite deliberately, because Chinese New Year has become much more than just a celebration for the Chinese community.  
Auckland's Lantern Festival, now one of the city's six signature events, attracted about 140,000 people last year, a great many of whom were not Chinese or Asian.  
In Wellington, tens of thousands turned out to watch a fireworks display paid for by Beijing, and a Chinese New Year cultural programme. Once again, many of those attending were not Chinese. They were families from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, couples pushing buggies and shepherding children.  
It is the same story in Christchurch. The Lantern Festival there attracted up to 40,000 people at its maiden outing last year, and will likely do so again this year. Dunedin is on to its fifth Chinese New Year celebration, attended by about 10,000 people and rising.  
Intriguingly, the popularity of Chinese New Year is spreading outside of the major metropolitan centres. New Plymouth will stage its second Chinese Lantern Parade and schools programme this year, and the Queenstown Lakes District Council will hold its first at Arrowtown.  
In many respects, the Chinese cultural contribution to New Zealand is starting to bloom, bringing to the fore at least 150 years of history the Chinese have quietly forged here since they were first lured by the Otago goldfields.  
The contrast between the situation today and the way early Chinese settlers were victimised by the Poll Tax is stark. It says much about the maturity of our society, and the growing confidence we have in our own identity, even if we can't always articulate it.  
But trying to pinpoint exactly what has caused the increasing popularity of Chinese New Year is tricky.  
Certainly, the Chinese community has now reached a critical mass where its interaction within society is such that an ever-wider range of relationships is being formed. The number of Chinese businesses in New Zealand has grown dramatically. There has been a 100 per cent increase in exports to China itself over the past five years, and a rapid increase in the number of Chinese tourists and students visiting our shores.  
Added to this is the fact that Kiwi's love a good party, especially when it features pageantry and theatre. Trying something new is just a part of our nature.  
But I'm not convinced these reasons alone explain the Chinese New Year phenomenon. It is my view that much of the credit lies with the proactive efforts of Chinese New Zealanders themselves. By working with central and local government, and organisations like the Asia New Zealand Foundation, the Chinese community has worked hard to reach out and share their cultural traditions.  
And I can't help but think there are lessons in this for other ethnic groups in New Zealand, as well as lessons for the future well being of our country.  
If there is one thing I've learned since becoming Minister for Ethnic Affairs, it is that ethnic groups tend to become internalised when international events turn against them or someone starts criticising. It is the nature of being in a minority; feeling the need to be discrete.  
In many situations though, the best way to tackle misunderstanding is to be more open not less. The Chinese have had the confidence to be so, and the New Zealand public has responded.
