Three out of five New Zealanders think New Zealand is taking the threat of an influenza pandemic 'seriously enough' while nearly two-thirds have seen information on how to prepare for a pandemic, according to figures released by Health Minister Pete Hodgson today.

The TNS global phone survey of almost 1000 New Zealanders – commissioned by the Ministry of Health – included a series of questions on public awareness and the level of preparedness for a pandemic.

"It's clear that the majority of New Zealanders have access to good information about a possible flu pandemic," Pete Hodgson said. "It's also good to see that New Zealanders are digesting the information in a calm, reasoned way.

"I'm pleased that the combined work of communities, business leaders and public health officials has led to a well-informed public discussion on the threat of a pandemic."

The data also shows that while public awareness is high, most New Zealanders have not taken steps to prepare themselves for a pandemic. Around 32 per cent of those surveyed have made preparations, with the majority of prepared households having stocked an emergency supply kit.

"While most people have seen or heard information about pandemic planning, we need to encourage people to start putting some of the simple measures that will make a difference into place, like having an emergency supplies kit."

The Ministry of Health will be stepping up its public awareness campaign over the next few months. The campaign began with public health messages on radio stations and will be extended to television commercials on TV1, TV2 and TV3.

Family Health Diary, which screens on TV1 and TV2, will also feature information on how to prepare from March 19. The advertising will emphasise the simple things people can do to try and stop the spread of influenza, like basic hygiene and stocking of emergency supplies.

There will also be a nationwide mail out to 1.4 million households, which starts on March 20 and will include a brochure covering the key messages and a magnet (with the ministry's 0800 number and website details).
