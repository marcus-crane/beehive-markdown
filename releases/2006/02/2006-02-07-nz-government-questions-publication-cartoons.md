Helen Clark said today the decision of some New Zealand media to publish cartoons caricaturing the prophet Mohammed was gratuitous and regrettable.

“This is not a question of press freedom: it is a question of judgment. Media in New Zealand have an absolute right to publish, subject to defamation laws, and that is not at issue here. But I believe it was ill-judged of some outlets to publish these cartoons when there was no compelling public interest argument to do so and there were clearly significant downside risks to New Zealand from doing so.

“Every day the New Zealand news media exercise judgement in deciding whether or not to publish certain items. Better judgment should have been exercised by those who published these cartoons.

“Neither the publication of the cartoons nor the violent reactions to publication which have occurred contribute to building the understanding between faiths and communities which the world sorely needs. We need to be talking to each other across the faiths, not past each other.

“New Zealand, its government, and its people generally stand for tolerance and respect for each others’ beliefs. That is how we bring communities together.

“Governments overseas are well aware that the New Zealand Government respects all religions and faiths and works hard in its own community and in the Asia-Pacific region to that end.”

Helen Clark noted the example set by other media organisations which had covered the issue without republishing the cartoons.

“New Zealand has been dragged unnecessarily into this furore through the unfortunate decision of some media outlets to publish,” Helen Clark said.
