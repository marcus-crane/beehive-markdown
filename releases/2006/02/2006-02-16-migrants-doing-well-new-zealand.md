A survey of new residents in New Zealand shows immigration is working to benefit both migrants and our country, Immigration Minister David Cunliffe says.

The Department of Labour survey found 93 per cent of the skilled migrants interviewed were happy in their first months as residents in New Zealand, and 79 per cent either "very satisfied" or "satisfied" in their new jobs.

The survey comes immediately after a survey of employers, which showed employers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the migrants they had hired.

“These findings suggest skilled migrant policy is working well," Mr Cunliffe said . "We are attracting people who settle well into our communities and contribute to the Government's key goal of economic transformation by bringing their much needed skills to New Zealand.

“It also highlights the importance of targeting migrants likely to fit into New Zealand easily and having good settlement support once they arrive here."

The Government launched its $62 million Settlement Strategy in 2004 to help migrants adjust and feel welcome in New Zealand.

"Starting out in a new country is a challenge, regardless of your background. This Government recognises this, and is committed to making the transition as easy as possible for all new migrants."

The strategy includes the nationwide establishment of the Settlement Support New Zealand initiatives, which will give migrants earlier access to the information and support available from government and social services in their area.

"The quicker and better migrants can settle, the better the experience for them and their families and the sooner they can contribute to New Zealand," the minister said.
