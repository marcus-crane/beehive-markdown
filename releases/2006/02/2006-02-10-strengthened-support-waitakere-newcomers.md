New migrants and refugees in Waitakere will benefit from improved settlement assistance - thanks to a nationwide initiative called Settlement Support New Zealand, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

“Settlement Support New Zealand is being rolled out in 19 areas nationwide to help new migrants and refugees to access information and services they need to settle in their community,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe launched Waitakere's Settlement Support initiative, led by Waitakere City Council in West Auckland, at 3pm today.

“This is in direct response to Goal Three of the 2004 New Zealand Settlement Strategy – for migrants, refugees and their families to access appropriate information and responsive services that are available to the wider community.

“We know that the first two or three years of settlement are the most challenging for migrants and refugees. A lack of local knowledge can mean that people miss out on the support and services which are available to them.

“Not only will Settlement Support Waitakere provide a vital first point of contact to help direct newcomers to the services they need – it will also build on existing connections between government agencies, local service providers, migrant and refugee communities and the people of Waitakere.

“Migrants have come to New Zealand to improve their lives and want to make meaningful social and economic contributions to their new homeland.  
“We all benefit from the skills and resources that migrants bring to New Zealand, but in order for them to be able to contribute to our communities and our economy they need to be able to settle quickly into good jobs and healthy communities, intact.

“By coming here, migrants and their families make a commitment to the future of New Zealand. We need to respond to this commitment by helping them settle in their new community.

“I’m confident that Settlement Support New Zealand will make a vital difference in the settlement experiences of those migrants and refugees who have come to live in Waitakere. We all stand to benefit from this initiative,” Mr Cunliffe said at the launch.
