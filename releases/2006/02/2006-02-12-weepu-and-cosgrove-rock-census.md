All Black and Hurricanes' halfback Piri Weepu and Statistics Minister Clayton Cosgrove will join up to five thousand young people in Christchurch today to kick off the message that everyone needs to participate in the 2006 Census.

Between 3,000 and 5,000 young people are expected to attend the MANA 2006 festival, to see top bands including Nesian Mystik and Soulfuric perform, and to see displays and crafts. The 2006 Census stand will have autographed brochures and posters to give away.

The free event is being held at the Nga Hau E Wha National Marae in Pages Rd. Piri Weepu will be there to help explain the importance of the census.

Clayton Cosgrove says he is very pleased to have Piri Weepu's support for the census, because the data collected has direct benefit for all young people and it is important they all get counted.

"Piri's sporting success has made him a role model especially for young Maori, so I’m sure his backing of the census will help all kids realise why they and their families need to fill out the forms," he says.

This promotion follows Friday's launch of a census education programme for schools by the Minister, also aimed at teaching young people about the 2006 Census.
