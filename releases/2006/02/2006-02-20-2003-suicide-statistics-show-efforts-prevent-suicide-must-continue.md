A rise in the latest suicide rates reinforces the need to continue efforts to tackle this complex issue, Associate Minister of Health, Jim Anderton said.

Mr Anderton made the comments while releasing the [latest suicide figures](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/73e3bfa32a91341fcc256fae0081db73?OpenDocument) today. They show that 515 people died from suicide in New Zealand in 2003, (a rate of 11.5 deaths per 100,000 population), compared to 465 people in 2002 (a rate of 10.8 deaths per 100,000 population).

While suicide numbers and rates have increased from 2002 to 2003, Mr Anderton said long-term trends indicated that average suicide rates were now leveling off after a general downward trend since peaking in the late 1990s.

“These latest statistics indicate that we need to maintain our focus on finding out as much as we can about what causes suicide and what is effective in helping to prevent it,” Mr Anderton said.

“We cannot forget that we are talking about lives, not just numbers.

“Suicide has a huge impact on friends, family, whänau and the wider community. Every suicide is a personal and community tragedy. We must all try to create an environment that prevents people from seeing suicide as their only option.”

Mr Anderton said there was a lot of suicide prevention work underway by government, service providers, and community organisations – and these efforts needed to continue and grow. Among initiatives already underway are:

- Developing a [national project to raise awareness of depression](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/wpg_index/About-suicide-national+depression+initiative), and to aid early recognition, appropriate treatment and recovery.
- Rolling out training on suicide prevention guidelines for emergency departments and mental health services.
- Expanding the Kia Piki community development sites to address Mâori suicide.
- Finalising the all-age New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy.
- Delivering, through Lifeline, the ASIST ([Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training](http://www.yspp.org/training/asist.htm)) – a two day skills-based workshop that equips caregivers for an effective suicide intervention role.
- Providing information on suicide prevention, through SPINZ (Suicide Prevention Information New Zealand), which is part of the [Mental Health Foundation](http://www.mentalhealth.org.nz/).
- Continuing the development of the ‘Support for Families’ initiative – a package providing support for people who have been bereaved by suicide or affected by the suicide attempt of a friend or family member.

Two new documents released by Mr Anderton today also aim to provide support for people and community agencies following a suicide. The documents are part of a package of information and support being developed by the Government.

*Guidance for community organisations involved in suicide prevention* aims to help community organisations that are providing support to those bereaved by suicide. The document provides information about how organisations can go about establishing a community initiative, as well as suggesting some activities that a community initiative could be involved in.  
*After a suicide: practical information for people bereaved by suicide* helps people deal with practical issues following a suicide and suggests some ways of answering difficult questions, coping with grief and caring for yourself.

Mr Anderton said the reasons for someone taking their own life were complex, but a major risk factor was mental illness, particularly depression.

The complex nature of suicide also meant there was no single “quick fix” to address the problem.

“This is an issue that affects every New Zealander. We all need to work together to help those affected by or at risk of suicide, at individual, community, regional and government levels.”
