Quality work, affordable childcare and more involvement in leadership are key to enhancing the well-being of Pacific women, according to research undertaken by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MWA) launched today.

The findings of the Pacific Women’s Economic Well-being research were released at an event at Parliament to celebrate Pacific women jointly hosted by the Minister of Women’s Affairs, Hon Lianne Dalziel, and the Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"The genesis of the research project was a meeting between the MWA and Pacific women in 2001, as part of the development of the Action Plan for New Zealand Women, which highlighted economic issues as a major concern for women in Pacific Island communities within New Zealand," said Lianne Dalziel.

MWA led the project, with support and assistance from the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology and the Ministry of Economic Development. The research involved both analysis of existing data and a qualitative study commissioned from Koloto and Associates on Pacific Women’s issues and priorities in relation to their economic well-being.

The key themes from the research, in conjunction with the analysis of overall trends for Pacific women, highlighted a number of issues for consideration in policy development across the government sector.

"Prominent themes to come out of the research included how the role of the family, the church and the community were central in the lives of Pacific women and how these significantly influenced decisions made in relation to work and other activities," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Both ministers expressed concern that participants in the project identified barriers such as a lack of qualifications, experience and confidence in accessing employment opportunities.

"There is no question that this must remain the focus of the government's attention and it ties in very well with initiatives that are already underway," Lianne Dalziel said.

The Pacific Women’s Economic Well-being summary report identifies the three particular areas of:  
·access to quality work (enabling Pacific women to earn more from the work they do);  
·availability of high quality and affordable childcare; and  
·increasing the representation of Pacific women in leadership roles.

"This says to me that the government is on the right track. However, we need to continue to ensure that programmes are inclusive of Pacific families," said Lianne Dalziel.

"As Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, I am committed to economic development for Pacific women," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"This Government's vision is for Pacific women to develop a clear economic strategy that will transform our economic well-being into deliverable actions, which will benefit our families, our communities and New Zealand as a whole.

"I am keen to work with a key group of Pacific women, who represent all of the key stakeholders, to develop an economic development action plan for women within the broader 'Pacific Economic Action Plan'," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

The ministers said the report will also help government departments developing policies relating to Pacific economic and business development, Pacific capacity building, social assistance and reducing inequalities.
