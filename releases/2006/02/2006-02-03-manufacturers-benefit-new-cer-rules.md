New rules that further liberalise trans-Tasman trade, support competitiveness and reduce compliance costs for exporters have been agreed with Australia, Trade Minister Phil Goff and Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

"The new Rules of Origin (ROO) agreement under CER is the result of nearly a year of negotiation between Australia and New Zealand. They will enter into effect on 1 January, 2007," Phil Goff said.

“The agreement provides significantly more liberal rules for New Zealand producers and exporters to qualify for preferential entry into the Australian market under CER and will benefit many New Zealand businesses.

"Rules of Origin determine whether or not a good qualifies for preferential entry under CER. If traded goods meet the criteria, they can enter duty-free."

Lianne Dalziel said the new rules were largely based on satisfying a ‘change in tariff classification’, or CTC, rather than the current 50 percent ‘regional value content’ threshold.

"New Zealand manufacturers have sought this change for the last decade.

"The new CTC approach means that for the majority of tariff lines, an exporter need simply satisfy the condition that there has been a change in tariff classification between any imported inputs from third countries and the completed good that are being exported to Australia/New Zealand.

"By shifting the focus from the origin of inputs, manufacturers will have a greater choice of materials. This will help increase efficiency and competitiveness, and significantly reduce the need to keep financial records to support ROO claims.

"One area is not subject to the change. Our aim was to obtain liberalisation for all sectors, and we are very disappointed that this was not wholly achieved in men’s and boys’ apparel," Lianne Dalziel said.

Under the agreement, exporters have the option of using existing rules until 2012.
