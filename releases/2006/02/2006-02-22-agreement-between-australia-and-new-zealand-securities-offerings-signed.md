Agreement between Australia and New Zealand on securities offerings signed

New Zealand Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Australian Treasurer Peter Costello today signed an agreement underpinning a regime for mutual recognition of securities offerings between the two countries.

The ministers said the new regime would remove unnecessary regulatory barriers to trans-Tasman securities offerings. This means that only one prospectus will be needed in most cases.

"This will promote investment between Australia and New Zealand, enhance competition in capital markets, reduce costs for business, and increase the choice for investors."

Ms Dalziel and Mr Costello welcomed the regime as being "one of the major achievements in the last few years under the Memorandum of Understanding on Business Law Coordination between Australia and New Zealand”. It has been widely supported by businesses on both sides of the Tasman.

"A mutual recognition regime will reduce the costs of raising capital in both Australia and New Zealand while maintaining investor protection through appropriate disclosure."

The details of the regime will be implemented through each country’s legislation or regulations. It could be in force by the end of this year.

Background  
What is the current situation?  
Currently, New Zealand and Australian issuers cannot use their home jurisdiction offer documents when making a trans-Tasman offer of securities. The issuer must comply with the relevant fundraising requirements in both jurisdictions, unless operating under an exemption in the other jurisdiction.

What does the mutual recognition regime do?  
The regime allows an issuer offering securities or managed investment scheme interests to the public to extend an offer that is being lawfully made in one country (the home jurisdiction) to investors in the other country (the host jurisdiction) using the same offer documents and offer structure.

The issuer would not be required to comply with most of the substantive requirements of the other country’s domestic fundraising laws. Instead, issuers who wish to operate under the regime will have to comply with some minimal entry and ongoing requirements agreed between the two countries and prescribed in each country’s law.

History of the regime  
In October 2001, the Australian Government invited New Zealand to work toward a regime for coordination in the recognition of securities offerings. After deciding on the broad parameters of the mutual recognition regime, New Zealand and Australian officials developed detailed proposals for the regime in 2003.  
A discussion paper released in May 2004 described the current position for Australian and New Zealand issuers making trans-Tasman offers of securities and then discussed the proposed mutual recognition model.  
Taking into account submissions on the discussion document, officials agreed on the final details of the regime and negotiated the text of an agreement. Both governments approved the agreement, which has now been signed.  
The regime will come into force when both countries have completed the necessary legislative processes. There will be consultation on the detail of the regime, and it is anticipated that this regime could be implemented by the end of this year.
