Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson has returned from a fact-finding trip to Europe to look at labour and employment relations issues.

Ms Dyson led a tripartite New Zealand delegation to meet officials and visit labour and employer groups in Finland, Ireland and England.

"I wanted to see first hand how labour issues are being handled in other countries and to investigate whether there is anything New Zealand can learn from their examples – either in terms of initiatives to implement, or what not to do."

Ms Dyson said the trip confirmed that New Zealand's employment relations compared well to other countries.

"In fact most of the organisations in the different countries we visited were envious of the co-operative tripartite union-employer-government relations that we enjoy here in New Zealand."

Accompanying Ms Dyson was Business New Zealand President Stephen Collins, Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O'Reilly, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson and Secretary of Labour James Buwalda.

Ruth Dyson also attended the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) 95th International Labour Conference in Geneva, along with labour ministers from most of the ILO's 178 member countries.
