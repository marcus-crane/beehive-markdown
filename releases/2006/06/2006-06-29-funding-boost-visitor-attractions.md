Five nationally significant visitor attractions are to receive grants totalling more than $136,000, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

The funding, to help provide or improve tourist facilities, comes from the Tourism Facilities Grants Programme, a discretionary annual fund of $300,000 set up to enable overseas visitors to learn more about New Zealand.

Mr O'Connor said the grants would help non-commercial tourism operations develop new displays, signage and other facilities so that tourists can get the most out of their visits to New Zealand.

"In an increasingly competitive international tourism market, it is important that tourists continue to see New Zealand as a special place to visit.

"Our unique mix of cultures and the stories we tell is a big part of New Zealand's attraction. These grants will assist innovative Kiwis with finding more dynamic and creative ways to tell our stories to the world."

The successful recipients, out of 14 that applied, are:

The Classic New Zealand Wine Trail – $21,068 to pay for route signage for a wine trail from Hastings to Marlborough.

New Zealand Marine Studies Centre (Dunedin) – $7,111 for an interactive touch-screen computer kiosk as part of the ‘Big Squid’ exhibition.

New Zealand National Maritime Museum (Auckland) – $68,092 to develop and implement an audio guide system at the Museum.

Ngai Tahu Maori Rock Art (North Otago) – $17,778 for the development of the Takiora Maori Rock Art site.

Upokongaro Jetty Wanganui River (Wanganui) – $22,222 for the development of a jetty at Upokongaro.

To be eligible for a grant, projects must look to enhance a nationally significant tourism facility, deliver a clear public good, not compete with an established commercial operation and fit in with regional tourism themes.
