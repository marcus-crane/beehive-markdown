Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson has welcomed the release of the New Zealand Construction Industry Health and Safety Strategy as a way to bring down this country's workplace injury toll.

"Construction is the third most dangerous industry in New Zealand. In the year to June 2006 construction fatalities have risen to 12," said Ruth Dyson, at the launch in Parliament's Grand Hall.

Led by the Construction Industry Council, it is the first industry-developed health and safety strategy specifically aimed at addressing New Zealand's high injury rate on construction sites. The new strategy complements the Department of Labour's Workplace Health and Safety Strategy.

"This work toll is an unacceptable cost, to the workers, to their families and to the industry. The Construction Industry Health and Safety Strategy is vital to reducing this toll, and because it is industry-driven and industry-developed, it has a greater chance in succeeding in reducing worker injury and death rates."
