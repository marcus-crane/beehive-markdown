Boost for biotechnology industry

The biotechnology industry will receive extra government funding of $1.2 million over the next three years to help its continued growth and exports, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

NZBio, the industry body established in 2003 under the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework Sector Taskforces, will receive $400,000 each year until 2009 to lead growth in the biotechnology industry.

"NZBio represents the kind of high potential, value-added industry the Labour-led government is targeting under our agenda to transform the economy into a high-wage, innovative and export-led economy," Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealand has a long and successful history in biotechnology, with ground-breaking work in areas such as medicine, agriculture and horticulture.

"NZBio delivers a range of services to the industry and it is important that the organisation's capability is maintained to enable the industry to continue its contribution to New Zealand’s economic growth."

NZBio has received $1.35 million in government funding to date to assist its work. The organisation, which has significant industry backing, supports regional biotechnology networks and has led policy initiatives on a number of issues. It also aims to work to generate valuable intellectual property and to create a favourable operating environment for commercialisation, as well as developing business connections and promoting industry development.

"A number of companies have made good progress developing products for global markets and the industry as a whole is going from strength to strength," Trevor Mallard said.

New Zealand has one of the world’s fastest growing biotechnology sectors. The income from biotechnology for the 2004-05 financial year was $811 million, compared to $675 million in 2003-04 and $475 million in 2002-03.

In the five years to June 2004, 348 biotechnology-related patents were granted compared with 156 between 1994 and 1999; and in 2005 the sector employed 2,424, 160 more than in 2004.

The government's Growth and Innovation Framework identified the biotechnology, information communications technology and creative sectors as the three areas with considerable growth potential and also potential spin-offs for the economy as a whole.
