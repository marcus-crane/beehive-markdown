Minister of Foreign Affairs, Winston Peters, will lead a delegation of New Zealand Ministers, MPs, business representatives, NGOs, officials and media to Vanuatu and the Cook Islands from 5 - 11 June.

It will be his third visit to the region since taking up the role of Minister of Foreign Affairs and reflects the continuing emphasis he is placing on the Pacific in New Zealand’s foreign policy.

While in Vanuatu the Minister will open New Zealand’s new High Commission building, and a new TB Ward at the Port Vila hospital, funded by NZAID and Rotary. The delegation will also meet with the Council of Traditional Chiefs and visit the University of the South Pacific law campus.

"Vanuatu is an important Pacific partner for New Zealand. We have a wide range of common interests in the Pacific region and New Zealand has long standing ties with Vanuatu. This visit provides the opportunity to build our contacts.  
“The visit will provide a basis for New Zealand representatives to develop their knowledge of Vanuatu and to meet with public and private sector counterparts. The delegation will gain a first hand understanding of New Zealand’s aid programmes and will see how they may work to support New Zealand’s development strategy for Vanuatu," said Mr Peters.  
In the Cook Islands, the delegation will visit schools supported by New Zealand's International Aid and Development Agency (NZAID), and will meet with the Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce.  
The Minister will also be meeting with the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers.  
“We aim to reaffirm New Zealand’s continued support for the Cook Islands’ development, prosperity and security,” Mr Peters said.
