Foreign Minister Winston Peters began his visit to Vanuatu this morning by opening a craft house in Port Vila.

The craft house, built with the assistance of New Zealand's international development agency NZAID, is part of a project to beautify Port Vila’s waterfront.

The building will house women entrepreneurs who until now have been selling their goods out of tents.

“Economic development, particularly of small and medium-sized businesses, is one of the key areas of NZAID’s work in Vanuatu," Mr Peters said. "The craft house will enable the women that sell their goods here to operate in a stable and attractive environment.”

The craft house is built in traditional style using natanggura palm, and is intended to attract the increasing number of tourists visiting Port Vila.
