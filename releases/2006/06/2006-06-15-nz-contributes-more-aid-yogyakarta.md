New Zealand is to contribute a further $500,000 to relief and reconstruction efforts following the Yogyakarta earthquake in Indonesia, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

The money comes on top of the $500,000 that New Zealand gave to the Red Cross in the wake of the May 27 earthquake that killed 5700 and left hundreds of thousands more homeless.

Mr Peters said the new money would be targeted at reconstruction efforts, as a result of an assessment of the situation by Indonesian-based staff of New Zealand's international aid agency, NZAID.

“While saving lives is still paramount, the focus is turning to the future and the new money is targeted at recovery and reconstruction," Mr Peters said.

“The resources required to rebuild Yogyakarta and to restore essential services there are significant. New Zealand will support three well-established Indonesian NGOs to carry out projects focussing on health, shelter and sanitation needs.

“NZAID will also fund New Zealand expertise to help the local government in Yogyakarta to improve its ability to prepare for and respond to disasters.

"A team from Natural Hazards New Zealand with a range of technical expertise, including in earthquake engineering and building codes, will visit Yogyajarkta next month,” Mr Peters said.

"It is likely that New Zealand's assistance will focus on the district of Sleman, which was the third-worst affected area after the earthquake and which also covers part of the region currently threatened by the active Mt Merapi volcano.
