A positive parenting programme that provides information and strategies for parents of young children is to receive $14.8 million over the next four years.

The Minister of Social Development and Employment David Benson-Pope today praised the SKIP – Strategies with Kids Information for Parents - programme as a superb example of Government and community partnership to improve family life in New Zealand.

SKIP is designed to provide practical information and strategies to parents and caregivers of children under five. It focuses on positive parenting, which uses love and nurture and limits and boundaries to guide children, rather than physical punishment.

“Of all the work the government and non-government sectors are doing for families, eliminating family violence is probably the most challenging and difficult. It is also the most urgent,” Mr Benson Pope said. “SKIP is making a huge difference to families because community groups understand where parents are and what support they need.”

Over the past two years SKIP has funded 110 innovative community projects throughout New Zealand. Mr Benson-Pope confirmed that Budget 2006 is investing a further $14.8 million over the next four years for SKIP to fund more community-based projects.

"SKIP is in workplaces, on marae, in kindergartens and childcare centres, Plunket rooms and on local radio programmes letting families know how to access their services," he said.

Visiting South Auckland today to take part in a community discussion on family violence, Mr Benson-Pope pointed to the Mangere East Community Learning Centre, which had gone along to several major festivals this year to give out parenting information and talk with thousands of parents, as a wonderful example of the reach of community-based providers.

“We want every family to be safe. We want to see every family raise healthy, confident children. We want to see every community provide the support and protection that families need,” Minister Benson-Pope said.

“The earlier we act to support families the less chance there is of problems developing or escalating. Budget 2006 is a Budget not just for families today, but for the families of future generations."
