"I am pleased to announce that David John Ambler has been appointed temporary Judge of the Mâori Land Court," Minister of Mâori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.  
"David Ambler has expertise in Mâori Land Court matters and with Treaty of Waitangi issues," Parekura Horomia said.  
"He demonstrates not only high calibre legal ability, but outstanding personal character, empathy and intelligence as well as fluency in te reo me ôna tikanga. He will make a fine addition to the Mâori Land Court.  
Judge Ambler’s appointment as temporary Judge commences on 1 June 2006 and is for two years. A temporary Judge is required because Mâori Land Court Judge Spencer of the Taitokerau district is currently on sabbatical leave.  
The Mâori Land Court assists whânau, hapu, and iwi with the retention and effective use, development and management of Mâori land. This is integral to realising Mâori aspirations about their land. It is vital that its judges have the skills, ability and experience to carry out its work and to preserve its integrity.  
The role of the Mâori Land Court has increased under the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004 and the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004.  
Judge Ambler will initially preside in the Taitokerau district in Judge Spencer’s absence.  
Judge Ambler was sworn in this afternoon at Tangatarua Marae, Waiariki Institute of Technology, Rotorua.
