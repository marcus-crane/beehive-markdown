Thank you for inviting me to formally open the National Burn Centre.

I would particularly like to congratulate all the management and staff from Counties Manukau DHB who, over a number of years, have had the vision and persistence to advance this project.

Particular congratulations must also go to your CEO Stephen McKernan on his appointment this week as Director General of the Ministry of Health. Stephen, you are widely respected throughout the sector, and I wish you all the best for the transition.

New Zealand has had a burn care network of four regional units, situated here in Middlemore, and at the Waikato, Hutt and Canterbury hospitals.

Staff from all four regional burn centres have been working closely together to ensure the smooth transition to a new network linked to a National Burn Centre here at Middlemore.

There are many individuals who and organisations which have either made financial contributions or helped with fundraising to ensure that the National Burn Centre could be opened here.

First, the community, through the South Auckland Health Foundation, has contributed $2.5 million for the facility and equipment. I understand a group of Auckland firefighters took part in a unique fund-raising effort through a ladder-climb display at the Viaduct, resulting in more than $20,000 being raised for the Centre.

The Crown has also provided $4.7 million to pay for the capital costs of the National Burn Centre.

The Accident Compensation Corporation is ensuring operational funding arrangements so that this particular service is funded in a sustainable manner.

Burn patients do best when they are treated in suitably designed specialist burn facilities, particularly those with isolation rooms and the infrastructure to support critically ill patients.

A complex burn injury is said to be the most severe form of trauma which is survivable. Burn patients have unique requirements in terms of wound management, infection control, and rehabilitation, which make it far less than ideal to care for burn patients on a general ward.

This facility which houses the National Burn Centre has now been completed, and patients will be treated here from next week. There is still some work to be done before the premises can fully function as the National Burn Centre:

·The state of the art facilities in the units are to be complemented by an Intensive Care Unit, co-located here, due to be completed in early 2008.

·Progress is being made in building up the unit’s full staffing complement in a number of vital areas, including nursing, allied health and other burn related staffing groups. Specialist burn surgeons are much sought after and Counties Manukau DHB is still actively recruiting for more. It will take some time yet to fill the vacancies. I thank all the burn specialists who have worked towards the establishment of this Centre.

There will be much to celebrate when the Intensive Care Unit is completed, and all staffing positions are filled. Counties Manukau DHB will then be able to deliver a comprehensive national burn service. For now, we celebrate the opening of this Centre, and wish it every success in its vital work of treating burns patients.

New Zealand’s three regional burn centres in the Waikato, Hutt, and Christchurch hospitals will continue to play a vital role in our nationwide burn care network.

Until the National Burn Centre is able to accept all complex burn patients from anywhere in New Zealand, the other regional units will work closely with the Centre here to manage referrals of patients from around New Zealand.

I understand that the first draft business case for a burns centre such as this was put forward around 27 years ago by Professor Liggins. Today's opening is therefore the culmination of many years of aspiration and planning.

It is now my pleasure to declare the National Burn Centre officially open.
