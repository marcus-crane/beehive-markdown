Jim Anderton gave a speech tonight at the Ballance Farm Environment Awards in Rotorua, where he praised the eight regional winners as innovative, business people, who were integrating the environment into farming practises.

"We see the skills of our land-based primary industries, at their best. The talent and creativity shown here tonight tells us why our primary industries are the backbone of our economy – and will remain so into the future.

"The diverse entries this year, from a fifteen-hectare vineyard to a hundred thousand hectare high country station, reveal the adaptability of New Zealand's agricultural and horticultural sector. These entries extend well beyond the traditional mainstays of New Zealand's primary industries of sheep, beef, dairy and deer.

"There is diversification into areas such as farm tourism to take pressure off the natural resources of the farm, using integrated farming systems for weed control, and farm waste for fertiliser or compost.

"Examples of land use well matched to land type and utilising the strengths and weakness of the soil are highlighted. Environmental practises conserving wetlands, preserving native bush and encouraging wildlife are also awarded.

"Staff retention is a crucial issue and these entrants have excellent management skills, providing staff with training and development. The entrants also tend to be involved in local volunteer services and are involved in community land care and catchment groups.

"I am taking this opportunity to congratulate the entrants and wish them all the best with the future successes of their businesses," Jim Anderton said.
