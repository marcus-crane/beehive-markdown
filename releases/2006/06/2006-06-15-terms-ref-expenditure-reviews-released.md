Associate Minister of Finance Trevor Mallard today released the Terms of Reference for the expenditure reviews that the government commissioned across the public sector.

"The reviews, announced in February 2006, are aimed at further enhancing and strengthening public services for New Zealanders by assisting government to move resources to where they have the greatest impact within an agency," Trevor Mallard said.

"Terms of Reference for each of the reviews have been developed by the agencies involved, with input from the three central agencies - State Services Commission, Treasury and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet."  
The reviews are:

- Defence sector capital asset management practice
- Review of employment relations in the state sector
- Enhancing productivity through people management practices in the state sector
- Government ICT spending
- Immigration fees review
- Review of business assistance programmes (terms of reference for this were released in May)
- Capital asset management
- Review of Central Agencies' role in managing the performance of state services
- Sustainability of the care and protection system (two terms of reference are released to cover the two distinct components)
- Value for money in the land transport sector

Two expenditure reviews announced in February 2006 are not included:

- Ministry of Social Development service provision. This was an existing review that has now been completed. The results will be released once the findings have been discussed with MSD staff and stakeholders.
- Health Sector: Lifting productivity and improving performance management processes in specific health areas. As planned, the Terms of Reference for this review have not been finalised to allow an opportunity for the incoming director general of health to be consulted.

The Cabinet Committee on Government Expenditure and Administration (EXG) oversees the reviews, and most will report in September/October 2006.
