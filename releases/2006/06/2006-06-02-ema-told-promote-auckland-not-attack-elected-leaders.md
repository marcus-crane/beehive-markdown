Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard suggests that the Employers and Manufacturers Association would be better off promoting Auckland as a place to do business rather than attacking democratically elected leaders.

The Minister's comments are in response to repeated attacks by the EMA on Auckland Regional Council Chair Mike Lee.

"This government is happy to continue to work with the democratically elected Chair of the Auckland Regional Council," says Judith Tizard

"Mike Lee is a vehement advocate for Auckland and makes no bones about his belief that we need a better public transport system along with better roads."

"This has not happened before now because no one has had the guts to put a scheme together and then find the revenue to pay for it. This government will work with Mike Lee and the ARC, as well as local councils to deliver on this."

"We are working together to develop an agreed package of properly investigated projects which are top priorities to get Auckland functioning effectively."

"I don't expect to agree with everyone all the time but we all agree on the need to work towards a better Auckland otherwise New Zealand will suffer too."

"Mike Lee has been democratically elected to this position – and the Employers & Manufacturers Association need to respect the democratic process."

Auckland, as New Zealand's largest city, plays a key role in this government's economic transformation strategy. It’s vital that Auckland has a world-class infrastructure and is an internationally competitive city.

But Auckland must also remain a great city in which to live, work and play.

"These are issues which require both local and central government input."
