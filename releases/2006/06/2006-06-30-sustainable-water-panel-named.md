A group of experts who will advise the government on improvements to freshwater management in New Zealand has been named today by Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

The Group will underpin the successful delivery of the Government's [Sustainable Water Programme of Action,](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/prog-action/index.html) which aims to improve both water quality and provide for growing demands for water.

The twelve members of the group are leaders in their fields relevant to water, and represent a cross-section of New Zealand sectors and regions. The group will hold its first meeting next month.

“The Group will provide leadership and expertise in water management, as well as access to broad local government, industry, Maori, environmental and community networks. Members will advise on water quality and water allocation issues and will suggest methods to address those issues,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

"The government has signalled that it wants to take a greater leadership role in freshwater management and will do this by working closely with groups with a significant interest."

Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton says the members will work to identify opportunities and risks to New Zealand’s economic transformation because of the way water is currently managed.

"By developing a strategic and nationally consistent approach to managing our valuable freshwater resources we will ensure that economic growth occurs in a sustainable way, with our environment protected," said Mr Anderton.

The advisory group will, among other tasks:

- prioritise freshwater issues and solutions
- examine the need for, and content of, national ways to manage water, including national policy statements and environmental standards
- encourage engagement from sectors and groups with an interest in water
