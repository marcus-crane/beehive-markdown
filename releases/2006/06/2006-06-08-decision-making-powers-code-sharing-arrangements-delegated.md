Transport Minister Annette King has delegated responsibility to Cabinet colleague Pete Hodgson for considering an application from Air New Zealand and Qantas for approval of their proposed ‘Tasman Networks Agreement’, under section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act.

This delegation is made under the authority of section 7 of the Constitution Act 1986.

“I have delegated responsibility to Mr Hogdson to avoid any perception of conflict between my role as MP for Rongotai, and the responsibilities of the decision maker on this matter,” says Ms King.

“I am conscious that, in my capacity as MP for Rongotai, I had made public statements on the matter before I was appointed Minister of Transport.”

Members of the Wellington business community, including Wellington Airport, have been been active in the public debate on the proposal.
