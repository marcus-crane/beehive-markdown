"It's confirmed – Aucklanders love the arts and value the city's cultural diversity!" says Auckland Central MP and Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard commenting on survey results released by Auckland City today.

"The survey found that 9 out of 10 Aucklanders are actively involved in the arts and the same number feel it's important for Auckland to be known as a place that supports great arts events and activities".

Auckland City partnered with Creative New Zealand to find out more about Aucklanders' attitudes, attendance and participation in the arts. The findings will be used to help guide both policy making and support of the arts in the Auckland region.

"I'm proud to read that 40% of Aucklanders said Pasifika was the event that made them feel proud to be an Aucklander."

"And over a third perceive Auckland's cultural diversity as its greatest strength in the arts and see it as our point of difference from the rest of the country".

The Auckland results also found that:  
§82% think that that arts help define who we are as New Zealanders;  
§76% agreed that the arts contribute positively to the economy;  
§there is also strong support for public funding of the arts (81%) and for local councils to give money to support the arts.

"The results reflect Auckland city's commitment to and investment in the arts and into developing a strong creative economy based here in Auckland".

"I congratulate Auckland City for taking this initiative to gather robust data that will continue to make Auckland a great place to live, work and play."
