Sixteen young people from across New Zealand will represent New Zealand at the first Pacific Youth Festival being held in Tahiti from 17-22 July.

The festival will bring young people and NGO’s from 21 Pacific countries together to meet, talk, think and work together on issues and challenges facing young people in the Pacific.

The six days will consist of conferences, workshops and cultural evenings. The festival is based around four pillars: fair globalisation, sustainable development, cultural diversity and conditions of peace.

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says she is delighted there is a young New Zealand delegation attending the festival.

“This is an excellent opportunity for young people to work with their Pacific peers to develop a united voice. Young Zealanders will contribute to the development of a Pacific Youth Charter which will be presented at the UNESCO World Youth Festival”.

The Global Education Centre is leading the New Zealand delegation attending the festival. About half of the delegation come from ‘Just Focus’, a new project for young people, by young people, to engage with issues that affect young people in New Zealand, the Pacific, and globally.

The diverse delegation includes New Zealand’s Commonwealth Regional Youth Caucus Representative, a young Christchurch filmmaker, a member of the Peace Foundation and three young Chatham Islanders from the Hokotehi Moriori Trust.

Elise Broadbent a 23 year-old student from Wellington is one of the New Zealanders attending the festival. Elise is passionate about anything that promotes peace, diversity, and acceptance of all people. She believes the festival will be a unique opportunity for young people to share their voice, tell their stories and work together.

“As a passionate campaigner for global justice issues, I am excited about networking at the festival with other like-minded campaigners from around the Pacific”.
