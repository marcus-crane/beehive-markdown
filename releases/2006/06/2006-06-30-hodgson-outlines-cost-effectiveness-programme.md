Work to improve cost-effectiveness in health over the coming financial year will focus on providing more and better health services for New Zealanders, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

In his first major speech on the topic, Pete Hodgson outlined areas that need to be progressed over the next 12 months and dismissed National Party calls for cost-effectiveness as code for cuts to health spending.

"The Labour-led government is pursuing cost-effectiveness in health because we want to provide more and better services for New Zealanders," Pete Hodgson said.

"New Zealand already has one of the world's most cost-effective health systems, but we know we can still do better. I've made improved cost-effectiveness one of my top priorities for the financial year that starts tomorrow and I intend to see real results over the next 12 months."

Pete Hodgson outlined four initial areas that need to be advanced to achieve greater cost-effectiveness in the 2006/07 financial year:

- More **central procurement** by district health boards, such as purchase of insurance, consumables, vehicles and communications products
- Significant improvements to the **interface between primary and secondary care**, with specific attention paid to improving elective services
- Greater use of **simple interventions** like immunisation, statins and retinal screening
- Examination of hospital **systems and designs**, including patient flows and working arrangements

"You'll notice that what I'm not calling for is budget cuts and the demonising of public servants.

"When Labour talks about cost-effectiveness we mean it – we know there are ways we can work smarter and we know we can make real improvements to get even better value money in health."
