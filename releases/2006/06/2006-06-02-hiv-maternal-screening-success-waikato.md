Since 20 March 1,600 women had been screened and none had been found to be HIV positive.

"There has been 99 per cent uptake of the screening which represents overwhelming buy-in from GPs, nurses, midwives and prospective parents," Pete Hodgson said from the United Nations high-level meeting on AIDS in New York.

"If detected early an HIV pregnancy may result in a healthy HIV-free child. The implications for this are just wonderful. There will always be emerging health challenges for our society – but here is the potential to have a generation of children born without HIV." Pete Hodgson said.

Within the next three years all 21 DHBs will have completed the necessary work to enable them to offer a high quality screening service. The HIV screening will be incorporated into existing tests for pregnant women at between 8 and 14 weeks, which include:  
Full blood count, Rhesus factor, Rubella, Syphilis and Hepatitis B. HIV is currently uncommon amongst pregnant women in New Zealand, however it is increasing so it recommended the test be offered universally. Currently any woman who believes she is at risk can have the test.
