The safe use of LPG cabinet heaters is the focus of this year’s LPG winter safety campaign Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

“LPG cabinet heaters are used in hundreds of thousands of homes and provide an instant, efficient and safe form of heating, if they are used correctly and safely. But consumers need to remember that like with any energy source they need to use LPG wisely,” said Mr Duynhoven.

The 2006 ‘hot tips’ campaign builds on the work, from last winter, of the Energy Safety Service, the LPG Association and the Environmental Risk Management Authority who jointly ran an LPG winter safety campaign.

“I am pleased that they are again working together to bring important LPG safety messages to consumers,” said Mr Duynhoven.

This week almost half a million safety message ‘swing tags’ have been sent to over 550 LPG filling stations around New Zealand, so they can be attached to LPG cylinders when people have their cylinders refilled.

“Everyone who uses an LPG cabinet heater should take note of the campaign’s messages and take action on how to keep warm but safe,” said Mr Duynhoven.
