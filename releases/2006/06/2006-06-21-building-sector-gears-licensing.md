Building Issues Minister Clayton Cosgrove says he welcomes the roofing industry's moves to raise the level of its own qualification standards, in preparation for the government's introduction of a licensing regime for the building sector.

Mr Cosgrove made the comment during his speech this morning to officially open the Roofing Association of New Zealand 2006 Conference being held in Christchurch. Around 250 roofing industry members are attending the three-day event.

Mr Cosgrove said the Association's current review of the National Certificate in Roofing, in conjunction with the Industry Training Organisation and the Waikato Institute of Technology, demonstrated its commitment to professionalising the sector. The Association also plans to develop additional roofing codes of practice to mesh with the introduction of a trade licence class for roofing.

"The Roofing Association has conveyed to me its strong support for the new licensing regime recently announced by the government," he said. "It is extremely pleasing to see work already underway to raise the bar in preparation for that."

Mr Cosgrove said the roofing industry was also considering an advanced qualification likely to fulfil the competency and supervisory skill requirements of a Licensed Building Practitioner.

A specialist roofing licence will be one of 13 licence classes being rolled out over the next five years. The scheme sets quality benchmark standards for building, design and certain building trades, to ensure buildings are built right the first time

Mr Cosgrove told the conference the government was on track for finalising licence standards and assessment criteria, and had received valuable input from industry workshops held three weeks ago. Work on the assessment tools and guidelines for selected licence classes will begin in September.

Currently 314 students are enrolled in National Certificate in Roofing courses.

Licensing is part of a suite of measures the Labour-led government is introducing to transform the building sector, including reforms to the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service, an accreditation and auditing scheme for Building Consent Authorities, the review of the Building Code and the certification of building products.
