The Labour-led government will continue its historic hospital building programme with a $66 million capital investment announced today by Health Minister Pete Hodgson.

The investment – approved this morning – will allow for redevelopments of both Wanganui and Wairau hospitals.

"All New Zealand communities deserve world class public hospital facilities," Pete Hodgson said. "When Labour came into office six and a half years ago, our heath infrastructure was in tatters after nearly a decade of under-investment.

"Climbing back from that has required a massive capital investment of well over a billion dollars and the largest public hospital building programme in New Zealand's history.

"We've built new public hospitals from Kaitaia to Invercargill. I'm pleased that we can now add Wanganui and Wairau to that list.

"Today's announcement is another reminder of what can be achieved when a government invests in our communities instead of pouring money into reckless tax cuts."

The Wairau redevelopment at Blenheim is a $36.7 million project. The government is contributing an additional $12.5 million on top of $24 million of public funding from the Nelson Marlborough District Health Board.

In Wanganui, the government has committed nearly $30 million for the redesign of the hospital. Full approval will be granted following further work by the Whanganui District Health Board. The DHB has already made significant progress in satisfying government requirements for major capital projects.
