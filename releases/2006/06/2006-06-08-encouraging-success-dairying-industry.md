Jim Anderton gave speeches today to the Dairy Farmers' Conference in Wellington and to the Future of Dairying seminar at Lincoln University on encouraging success in the dairy industry. In his speeches, Jim Anderton said the future of New Zealand's success depends – in part – on our success to differentiate products around our valuable advantages. He also paid tribute to the foresight and commitment of the dairy industry.

"I know the dairying industry has recognised the factors that will keep New Zealand ahead of the game. The industry's Strategic Framework 2005 – 2015 has a vision to increase dairy farmer profit and create wealth for New Zealand, through a 50 per cent increase in productivity and 35 per cent growth in milk solids. It is an ambitious document.

"The earnings from dairy are crucial to our standard of living. Dairy is a huge contributor to those earnings. We export 95 percent of our dairy production. For decades New Zealand's production of milk from pastoral-based systems has featured centrally in the backbone of our economy," Jim Anderton said.

"It's been backed by science, smart management and a major role in the international trade of dairy products. This is a profoundly strong platform on which to build the future success of the industry.

"There is strong competition out there. Argentina and Chile are now the world's lowest cost producers of milk and Brazil has recently become self sufficient in milk production. India and China are also building their milk production capacity.

"While we front up to these new competitive pressures, we also have to face other emerging challenges. We should also anticipate an increasing attention to the way that milk is produced in New Zealand, particularly from the affluent markets of Europe. We have a good story to tell here - but we need to put our foot on the accelerator.

"There are targets for better efficiency for water use in the 'Dairy Industry Strategy for Sustainable Environmental Management' and work is already underway. Similarly with fodder and production, animal health and welfare, milk harvesting and 'business and human resources', progress is being made. The investment this industry makes in research and the effort it is putting into quality will help to maintain its competitive edge.

"The government is playing its role as a partner with the industry in all this work. Cash for research comes from the Foundation of Research Science and Technology. The MAF Sustainable Farming Fund has provided over $10 million for dairy industry projects support since its inception. There'll be more funding announced very soon for projects beginning after 1 July.

"The science is important because it underpins innovation. Overall, the Labour-Progressive government invests over $83 million/year in pastoral farming research. And it is innovation that will increase our productivity and provide us with an edge in global markets as they evolve in future. Innovation has always underpinned our primary industry.

"But as they grow, dairying will remain the heart of our economic machinery.  
Our edge - our source of value - will be our excellence. We need more high value products, and better exports. I'm committed to working in partnership with the sector to overcome the barriers to faster growth. We have a lot of work to do but I am confident of great things from New Zealand's dairy industry," Jim Anderton said today.
