Improving productivity is key to economic transformation, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson told the Transport and Industrial Relations select committee select committee today.

“Productivity has been identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the basis for improvements in real incomes and welfare. This means that when productivity improves, everyone benefits,” Ruth Dyson said.

The Minister said productivity will be a primary focus of the Labour portfolio and the Department of Labour this financial year.

Over the past year, the Workplace Productivity Project – a joint initiative between government, business and unions – has developed a range of resources and tools to help workplaces identify and put in place the changes they need to improve their productivity, including the Workplace Productivity Kit.

"When I visited the International Labour Organisation in Geneva recently, the officials there said if they are asked for advice on how to increase workplace productivity they tell people to go to the New Zealand Department of Labour website to look at the kit."

“New Zealand has averaged about 4 per cent economic growth in recent years, through increasing our labour force participation – now we need to increase the value of work produced every hour,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Productivity is not about people working longer hours; it’s about innovating, it’s about interesting and satisfying jobs, and it’s about working together.

“The need for productivity improvements are not just a focus for government. Business and union representatives see this as an issue of national importance and a shared initiative.”

The government will continue to work closely with business and union networks, including umbrella groups Business New Zealand and the Council of Trade Unions, to further develop the Workplace Productivity Project.

**Background on the Workplace Productivity Project**

**The Workplace Productivity Project** - a government, business and union initiative to boost productivity in New Zealand workplaces - already has a range of initiatives and tools in place that are proving popular. Some examples are:

**Productivity seminars:** More than 2000 companies have attended productivity seminars over the past 10 months run by the Department of Labour, Chambers of Commerce, the Council of Trade Unions and Business NZ. Another eight are planned for the Auckland and Canterbury regions in July and August.

**Workplace productivity website:** The website at [www.workplaceproductivity.govt.nz](http://www.workplaceproductivity.govt.nz) was set up by the Department of Labour to provide useful information about productivity here and overseas. Since going live in September last year, the website has received nearly 90,000 hits.

**Case studies:** The website includes case studies of New Zealand businesses that have dramatically raised their productivity, benefitting the businesses, employees and customers.

**Productivity Snapshot questionnaire:** This diagnostic tool enables businesses to assess themselves against the seven drivers of workplace productivity, and provides suggestions to improve performance.

**Productivity ‘starter’ kits:** This year, 5000 productivity ‘starter’ kits have been distributed by the Department of Labour to small and medium-sized businesses. Another 5000 will be distributed soon.
