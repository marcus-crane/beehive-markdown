Foreign Minister Winston Peters opened the new tuberculosis isolation ward at Port Vila Central Hospital today, on the second day of his three-day visit to Vanuatu.

The 16-bed ward was built by Rotary District 9910, with members from New Zealand and Vanuatu contributing significant amounts of time, money and materials to the project.

NZAID, the New Zealand government's international development agency, was a major contributor of funds to the construction of the ward.

“TB is a serious disease in Vanuatu. The operation of this ward will contribute to the control and reduction of TB transmission on the island of Efate, as well as improving the treatment of the illness,” said Mr Peters.

“The construction of this ward is a good example of the two countries working together at both government and community level. Over 60 New Zealand Rotarians came to Port Vila to help their counterparts here build the ward.

"I’m also pleased that ni-Vanuatu students from the local technical trade school have worked on the site, and developed their skills in the process.”

Mr Peters said that Rotary had built a TB ward on the island of Espiritu Santo in 1998. After it opened, the incidence of TB dropped by 50 per cent in one year, and continues to drop.
