Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Dr Warren Tucker is to be appointed as the new Director of Security, heading the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service.

Helen Clark said Dr Tucker, who is currently the Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau, is an experienced public service manager with a wide knowledge of New Zealand’s intelligence and security issues.

“Dr Tucker has a distinguished record as a public servant, with a particular focus in the security and defence areas.

“He has the skills and experience necessary to lead and manage the NZSIS, which is a key agency in New Zealand’s intelligence and security infrastructure,” Helen Clark said.

Dr Tucker will start in his new role on 1 November 2006. The present Director of Security, Richard Woods, will be retiring on 31 October 2006.

Dr Tucker has been the GCSB’s Director since 1999. Prior to that, Dr Tucker worked as Intelligence Co-ordinator in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and held a number of senior management roles at GCSB.

In the 1980s, Dr Tucker was based in Washington as First Secretary in the New Zealand Embassy. He has also served as an army officer in the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals, and is currently the honorary Colonel Commandant of the Corps.

He has a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) and PhD in Electrical Engineering.
