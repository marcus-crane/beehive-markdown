Nick Smith has once again failed to get his facts right, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The Minister was referring to Dr Smith seeming to forget about improvements made to the Resource Management Act (RMA) last year to deal with matters of national significance - and that his party had voted against these improvements.

“When National voted against the [Resource Management Amendment Bill last year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23893), they were voting against improvements to RMA processes requested by industry, including infrastructure companies like Transpower,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The RMA concerns raised by Transpower in [their 2004/05 Annual Report](http://www.transpower.co.nz/?id=5747) were dealt with by the Resource Management Amendment Act, particularly the ability to have cross-boundary consents dealt with as one. This is why, contrary to what Dr Smith claimed in the House yesterday, Transpower’s latest 6-monthly report makes no reference to the RMA – the Government had dealt with those concerns.”

This was not the only thing Dr Smith got wrong in the House.

Contrary to claims by Dr Smith, Transpower has a current consent to increase the capacity of its Otahuhu-Henderson transmission line above that allowed in the district plan. This consent, which allows for maintenance and emergencies, is current until the end of 2007, by which time a permanent consent application will have been heard.

The latest [World Bank Report “Doing Business” ranks New Zealand second in the world in terms of the cost to business of dealing with consents and licences](http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreEconomies/Default.aspx?economyid=140) – such as RMA consent processes.

“Clearly this Government is working to get the balance right in terms of encouraging economic development and environmental sustainability,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“National’s true agenda has been exposed by Maurice Williamson in a car magazine where he is quoted as saying National would "tear the guts out of the RMA".”

“National need to come clean and tell the public of New Zealand that they have no interest in proper environmental safeguards and do not care about the huge economic advantage this country gains from its clean green image.”

The Resource Management Amendment Act, passed by Parliament in August 2005 introduced a series of improvements to the working of the RMA. For more information go to [www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/rma/](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/rma/)
