Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen has asked for further information and a report from the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) in relation to the latest claims by National Party’s Bill English.

“In the meantime, TEC will be responding to media enquiries in terms of the detail as this is an administrative matter.

“It should be noted that these are precisely the kind of issues which are leading us to change the funding system for tertiary education.

“Mr English is as usual economical with the truth in stating that I have suggested that these kind of issues would not be raised again.

“These kinds of issues are precisely why the funding system of bums on seats which was put in place by National will be changed to a greater emphasis on outcomes by this Government” Dr Cullen said.
