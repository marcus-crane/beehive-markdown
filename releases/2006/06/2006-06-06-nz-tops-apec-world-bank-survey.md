A World Bank study which rates New Zealand as the top APEC member for ease of doing business was the focus of attention of the APEC Trade Ministers conference in Viet Nam today, says Trade Minister Phil Goff.

“APEC’s focus today included a session on how to promote private sector development by improving the behind-the-border environment in which businesses operate,” Mr Goff said.

“The World Bank study won praise as providing APEC with the ability to benchmark and monitor progress in this area.

“New Zealand received the top aggregate score for ease of doing business. We came first in areas like licensing procedures and registering property.

“We also scored highly in investor protection, ease of exporting, ease of starting a business and the labour market.

“The World Bank has scored New Zealand as the easiest place to do business for two years in a row. This reflects the high quality, business-friendly environment we have sought to create.

“New Zealand and Canada are now working through APEC to encourage other economies in the region to improve their business regulation.

“World Bank research has shown very clearly the link between high quality business environments and a country’s development prospects.

“As a world leader in creating an environment for doing business, New Zealand is well placed to lead this initiative," Mr Goff said.
