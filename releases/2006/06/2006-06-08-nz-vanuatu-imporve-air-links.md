Airlines will be able to fly between New Zealand and Vanuatu up to four times a week following improvements made to the bilateral air services agreement between the two countries, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Mr Peters and Vanuatu's Acting Foreign Minister George Wells made the announcement at a joint press conference in Port Vila today, at the conclusion of Mr Peters’ three-day visit to Vanuatu.

"The new agreement allows designated airlines from New Zealand and Vanuatu to fly between the two countries up to four times a week. It also provides for greater route flexibility and enables code-sharing arrangements between airlines, including those of third countries," Mr Peters said.

“These new aviation arrangements are a big step forward in creating opportunities for New Zealand and Vanuatu airlines to develop the route and to boost tourist travel to Vanuatu, which is its number one industry.

"This is consistent with the new development partnership announced today which puts more emphasis on creating economic growth,” Mr Peters said.

The agreement is effective now.
