Conservation minded countries won an important victory at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Saint Kitts and Nevis today with the voting down of a proposal to resume whaling in coastal areas of Japan, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said.

"This vote was important because it is a proposal Japan has been putting up for many years and it has become an indicator of who has the numbers in the Commission," Mr Carter said.

"For the proposal to succeed it required a 75 percent majority, which it was never likely to get. However, if it had won a simple majority it would have been a clear indication that Japan had seized control of the Commission on some matters. The vote was very tight, just 31 votes against to 30 votes in support.

"The pro-whaling group has been emboldened by the arrival of Gambia which has now paid its overdue membership fees and is able to vote," Mr Carter said.

"Technically, this should have given the pro-whalers enough for a simple majority in the Commission and would have on the coastal whaling vote if not for four nations opting to abstain. These included Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, China and Korea, all of whom New Zealand and Australia have been talking with closely.

"Unfortunately, Kiribati and the Solomons also put their name to a declaration circulated at the Commission this afternoon calling for the 'normalisation' of the IWC in favour of whaling. So too did four other Pacific nations that vote with the Japanese: Tuvalu, Nauru, the Marshall Islands and Palau," Mr Carter said.

"It is possible this declaration may be put to a vote at the meeting over the next two days, and because the numbers are so tight Japan could achieve a simple majority for it. This would be a largely symbolic victory but it would send an alarming signal for other upcoming votes in the IWC.

"New Zealand has had another good day, but we are not out of the woods yet," Mr Carter said.
