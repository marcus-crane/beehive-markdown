The Labour-led government's pledge to deliver New Zealanders faster, better broadband has taken a further step forward with the first reading in Parliament today of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill.

The bill has been introduced just eight weeks after the government announced its telecommunications stocktake package on May 3, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"As well as delivering on our promises ahead of schedule, the quick introduction of the bill shows we have listened to commentators who wanted to minimise any uncertainty in the marketplace," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Subject to the legislative process, including the hearing of submissions at the select committee, the aim is to have this bill returned to the House and passed by the end of the year. "

The Telecommunications Amendment Bill implements the government's pre-budget telecommunications stocktake package announced on May 3.

Among its many provisions, the bill provides for unbundling the local telephone loop to allow vigorous competition between internet service providers for the home and business market.
