Reducing the supply and availability of illicit drugs at the front line is an essential component in the fight against drug abuse, says Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, as today marks [International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking](http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/drug/).

"The safety and health of our families and young people is impacted on by the availability of methamphetamine and other drugs, and New Zealand Customs is at the front line in the ongoing battle against the importation of these illicit substances, and the chemicals used in their manufacture," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"Customs and other New Zealand enforcement agencies are working together to reduce the harm caused by drugs to the community, with Customs' specific responsibility to intercept illegal drugs and drug utensils at the border.

"However, supply reduction is really only one part of the strategy to fight drugs.

"To help achieve widespread reduction in demand, the community needs to adopt a zero tolerance approach to drugs.

"The Government is also working across a number of fronts to target drug abuse."

The Ministry of Health is currently drafting a [National Drug Policy](http://www.ndp.govt.nz/policy/nationaldrugpolicy.html) and is analysing submissions received on the draft. The policy is planned for release towards the end of 2006. Its overarching goal is to prevent and reduce the health and economic harms that are linked to tobacco, alcohol, illicit and other drug use.

In May, Customs and Police [made the largest seizure of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as 'ice' or 'P'), and pseudoephedrine ever detected](http://www.customs.govt.nz/about/News/MEDIARELEASE20060525.htm) coming into New Zealand, with a street value of around $135 million.

The operation was the result of collaboration between Customs, New Zealand Police, and the Hong Kong Police, with support from New Zealand's National Drug Intelligence Bureau.

"While Customs is alert to emerging and existing drug smuggling trends, using the latest intelligence and technology to help detect and intercept drugs, the volume and sophistication of trans-national organised crime is rising.

"Major drug seizures indicate New Zealand continues to be a target of such criminal groups.

"This shows that effective law enforcement is essential in combating drug trafficking and trans-national organised crime. In 2004/2005 Customs made 73 significant drug seizures compared with 32 in 2003/2004," Nanaia Mahuta said.
