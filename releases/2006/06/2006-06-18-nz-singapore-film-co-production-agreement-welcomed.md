Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the announcement of the first feature film co-production between New Zealand and Singapore companies.

Singapore-based MediaCorp Raintree Pictures and New Zealand’s Eyeworks Touchdown intend to co-produce two films – the New Zealand-based Tattooist and Singapore-based Altar. Both films are presently under development.

Helen Clark and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong witnessed the signing of the agreement today in Auckland.

“This agreement represents the first feature film co-production to take place under the Audio Visual Agreement signed between New Zealand and Singapore in July 2004,” Helen Clark said.

“The New Zealand Film Commission, Singapore’s Media Development Authority, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise have been instrumental in bringing these companies together.

"In particular Eyeworks Touchdown Television received a Strategic Investment Fund grant, administered by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, which has helped it develop a business model focused on Asia,” said Helen Clark said.

“In recent years, New Zealand film makers have enjoyed outstanding success and acclaim, both for blockbuster big budget movies, and for films telling New Zealand stories.

“The New Zealand Government - through Investment New Zealand, in conjunction with the New Zealand Film Commission and the national locations office Film New Zealand - actively markets New Zealand as a location for filming, and has played a key role in facilitating this first New Zealand/Singapore co-production.

“With the audio-visual co-production treaty in place, I hope we will see more co-operation between New Zealand and Singapore screen producers in future,” Helen Clark said.
