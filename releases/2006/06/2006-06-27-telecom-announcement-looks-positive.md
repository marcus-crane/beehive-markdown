Communications Minister David Cunliffe has cautiously welcomed Telecom's announcement that it will voluntarily create a separate, independent wholesale operation.

"On the face of it, this looks to be a positive development," he said.

"Subject to receiving and analysing further detail on the proposed measures, the government looks forward to developments that improve competitive, non-discriminatory wholesale markets for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

"I look forward to receiving more details and advice from officials."
