Transport Minister Annette King has released the terms of reference for the Advisory Group on Roading Costs.

“There are two variables in the roading construction equation that require attention, says Ms King

"This Government has addressed the funding issue with the unprecedented investment in transport infrastructure announced in the budget, and the Advisory Group is addressing the other key variable, value for money.”

Through consultation with stakeholders, the Advisory Group has developed a focused scope of work that will identify the drivers of cost escalation in the Transit New Zealand road maintenance and construction programme. It will also consider local authority road construction and maintenance that is co-funded by Land Transport New Zealand.

The Group is examining:

·input costs  
·supply constraints and competitive forces in the construction industry and their effect on price escalation  
·design and technical standards  
·scale and complexity of projects  
·expansion of project scope  
·project planning and management  
·contracting and tendering process

The group is scheduled to report its findings and recommendations to the Minister in late July. The Minister will incorporate agreed recommendations into the report back to the Government Expenditure and Administration Committee in September.

Clive Tilby chairs the group, which also includes Jo Brosnahan, Alan Isaac and Stuart McKenzie.

Mr Tilby, a consultant to the infrastructure industry, is a professional engineer with knowledge of the construction industry. He also has project and financial management skills.

Ms Brosnahan, also a consultant, has extensive public and private sector experience. Mr Isaac is the recently retired CEO of KPMG’s Wellington and Auckland offices and Mr McKenzie, previously a professional engineer working in the construction industry, is currently a partner in Endeavour Capital, Ltd, a venture capital firm.

The group is being supported by advice from the Ministry of Transport, other transport agencies and the Treasury.
