Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed his condolences to the family of former United States Ambassador H. Monroe Browne, who died of a heart attack aged 89.

Mr Browne was Ambassador to New Zealand and Western Samoa from 1981 to 1985.

“Mr Browne was Ambassador during challenging and changing times in the United States-New Zealand relationship.

"Despite that, he made many friends here and was highly regarded by those who worked with him. He continued to maintain a close interest in New Zealand affairs long after he returned to the United States, and remained in contact with many of his friends here right up until his death," Mr Peters said.

Before becoming Ambassador, Mr Browne was a teacher, and an industry leader in agriculture. He served in the Navy during the Second World War.

Mr Browne also served in a number of public roles in his home state of California.
