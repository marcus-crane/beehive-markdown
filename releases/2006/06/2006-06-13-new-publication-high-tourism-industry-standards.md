Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today launched a new publication that is aimed at helping new tourism operators deliver quality products and services.

Mr O'Connor launched the publication ‘Give it 100%’ at New Zealand's largest tourism event, [Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand](http://www.trenz.co.nz/), 2006, which is taking place in Christchurch.

Give It 100% is a guide to marketing, provides information to new or developing operators on how the tourism industry works, and explains what tourism organisations do.

This new publication partly replaces ‘Getting Started in Tourism', which Tourism New Zealand has been producing for many years.

Mr O'Connor said the publication would help maintain the high standard that has become the hallmark of New Zealand tourism.

"People brimming with great new ideas enter the market all the time and a publication such as this is a valuable tool to help them navigate their way through the often tricky process of setting up and developing a business.

"New Zealand tourism depends on its reputation for quality. This book will help ensure our standards remain very high."

Tourism New Zealand reviewed the previous publication last year. The replacement focuses on providing information around marketing for both new businesses, and those established businesses that wish to develop their marketing capacity.

It also references the latest research and industry details and explains the distribution channels available to businesses, how to work with industry associations, and how to use marketing effectively.

Case studies of businesses who have succeeded in tourism include

Northland's Top Experiences,

Ulva's Guided Walks,

Tarawera Legacy,

Southern Wilderness NZ Guided Walks,

Edgewater Resort,

Maori Tours Kaikoura.
