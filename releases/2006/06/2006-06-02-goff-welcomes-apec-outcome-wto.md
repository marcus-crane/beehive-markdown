Trade Minister Phil Goff today welcomed the statement issued by APEC Trade Ministers calling for urgent action on the World Trade Organisation's Doha Development Agenda talks by the end of June.

Mr Goff was speaking at the end of the APEC Trade Ministers meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.

“The statement is substantially in line with New Zealand’s contribution to the meeting, which called for a strong political commitment from all participants to progress the talks,” Mr Goff said.

“APEC members represent around 50 per cent of world trade and 60 per cent of world GDP.

"A strong statement from this body promoting an ambitious outcome in the DDA talks will hopefully give positive impetus to the negotiations in Geneva later this month,” Mr Goff said.
