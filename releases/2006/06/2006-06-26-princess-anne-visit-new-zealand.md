Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal will visit New Zealand next week.

Princess Anne arrives for a four-day visit on 9 July to take part in the closing sessions of the 2006 Emerging Pacific Leaders' Dialogue. The two-week dialogue opens in Brisbane, closes in Auckland, and includes study tours to 10 Pacific locations.

Helen Clark said Princess Anne will also take part in events with organisations she has taken a personal interest in over the years while she is in New Zealand. These include the Mission to Seafarers, Save the Children New Zealand, the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals, and Riding for the Disabled.

Further details of these engagements will be announced closer to the visit.
