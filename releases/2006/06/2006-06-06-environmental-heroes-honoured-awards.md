New Zealand’s environmental heroes are being honoured in this year’s Green Ribbon Awards, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“These individuals and groups have put a great deal of effort into helping sustain, protect and enhance New Zealand’s unique environment,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“They deserve to be recognised and rewarded for their efforts.”

The announcement of the [Green Ribbon](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/awards/green-ribbon.html) winners coincides with [United Nations World Environment Day](http://www.unep.org/wed/2006/english/) and shares a common goal to raise environmental awareness.

The Green Ribbon Awards have become an established tribute to the outstanding contributions that individuals and organisations make towards the environment.

From a strong list of 61 nominations this year, seven winners have been selected.

The honours for 2006 include:

- A Raglan community’s success in diverting nearly 75 percent of its waste away from landfill.
- A Golden Bay brewery café which uses composting toilets and offers bounties on pests like possums, rats and stoats.
- A Hawke’s Bay high school student’s passion for a wide-range of outstanding environmental projects.

This is the Green Ribbon Awards’ 16th year. During that time 81 winners have been honoured.

“The work of people like those honoured tonight is so important. The environment is integral to our daily lives and the quality of those lives and protecting it is vital,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

### Background information on 2006 Green Ribbon Award Winners

**Xtreme Waste – Whaingaroa**  
**(Winner, Community Action for the Envronment)**  
Following the close of the Raglan landfill in 1998, the Whaingaroa community, near Raglan, looked at ways to provide waste management solutions. Xtreme Waste was set up by a small group of people as a community recycling programme. It has since grown to involve the whole community taking responsibility for their waste.

Xtreme Waste is now diverting approximately 74 per cent of waste volume from landfill. It has provided job opportunities for 26 part time employees, established a large recycling shop, instituted weekly kerbside collection of recyclables and waste from rural and urban areas, and developed and implemented an interactive education strategy with schools and other community groups.

**Tonkin and Taylor – Auckland**  
**(Winner, Urban Sustainability)**  
Environmental and Engineering Consultants, Tonkin & Taylor, are winners in this year’s Urban Sustainability category for their work developing the Auckland City Council’s Seaside Park. The park is located on a closed landfill at Brady Road, Otahuhu.

Tonkin & Taylor employed forward-thinking and effective strategies at the Seaside Park project which included innovative overall design for landfill transformation. The company offered consultation to incorporate public wishes and concerns into the process.

The project incorporated habitat preservation and expansion for existing wildlife populations, and highly advanced, multi-purpose wetland construction to deal with leachate treatment, storm water diversion, flood prevention and shore erosion prevention.

The project took four years to complete and is an environmental showpiece for creative and innovative techniques in the rehabilitation and transformation of closed landfills.

**MW Lissette – Hastings**  
**(Winner, Rural Sustainability)**  
MW Lissette is a road construction and maintenance company based in Hastings. The company takes notice of the potential impacts of its road work by making careful selection of planned routes to ensure minimum crossing of streams, and makes protection of unstable slopes and other sensitive areas a top priority.

MW Lissette avoids unnecessary earth-moving and construction by building roads to the narrowest safe width possible. Its projects also incorporate drainage systems with culverts planned for the highest expected peak flow. By minimising sediment and pollutant run-off and reducing erosion, the impacts on waterways and surrounding landscapes are significantly reduced.

The level of planning and construction taken by the company, and the attention to detail for environmentally sustainable outcomes is commendable and make them an excellent recipient for a Green Ribbon Award.

**Mussel Inn – Golden Bay**  
**(Winner, Sustainable Business)**  
The owners of the Mussel Inn brewer and café in Golden Bay have applied their environmental ethos to their business from day one.

Jane and Andrew Dixon and their two sons integrate sustainability into every aspect of The Mussel Inn from the building materials used, to sourcing the cooking ingredients locally, to finding responsible and creative ways of dealing with the waste they produce, including manufacturing composting toilets.

The sustainable attitude is encouraged and supported amongst their staff and customers to help make the Mussel Inn an excellent example of a successful sustainable business in everyday action.

**Clean Water Whangamata – Whangamata**  
**(Winner, Caring for Our Water)**  
Surfer and water campaigner, Paul Shanks, has committed his time to leading Clean Water Whangamata to have water quality acknowledged as a top priority issue in his community.

Driven by his passion for surfing, Paul has worked with Clean Water Whangamata since the late 1990’s to commission water testing to assess the adequacy of local sewerage systems and to present these issues to local government. Paul’s work has led to the Thames Coromandel District Council now looking at proposals to upgrade and redevelop the local sewerage treatment plant.

**Tom Logan – Napier**  
**(Winner, Young People Making A Difference)**  
Year 10 William Colenso College student Tom Logan’s passion for the environment has been the driving force behind many projects carried out at the Napier secondary school and in the wider community.

Tom established his school’s enviro-group, now with more than 40 members. The group holds regular lunchtime meetings where initiatives like a school vegetable garden and composting project have been developed and implemented.

Tom and his environmentally aware group help coordinate tree planting days at the Hawkes Bay Environmental Education Trust, and fundraise for tuatara preservation and kiwi release field trips.

Tom and his William Colenso College enviro-group are also currently developing a school-wide recycling programme.

Tom has provided environmental leadership and inspiration for other students and is a well-deserved winner of this year’s Green Ribbon Award for Young People Making a Difference.

**Opoho Primary School – Dunedin**  
**(Highly Commended – Young People Making A Difference)**  
Opoho Primary School of Dunedin is a silver medal Enviro School, working towards gold status. The children are involved in every environmental activity and project that Opoho School has achieved and the list of activities is huge: recycling paper, card and plastics; composting and tending a vegetable garden; creating an Opoho School Envirocode design; painting fish pollution warnings on all storm water drains in the community; hosting an enviro-school hui; and working with Dunedin City Council to plant, weed and care for Dundas Bush.

If that were not enough, the students show other schools and interested community members what they have achieved and help others to get environmental projects up and running in their communities.

The children, teachers and Principal of Opoho School are true leaders and role models for their community and deserve to be highly commended in the Young People Making a Difference category for their work to influence the actions of others in schools, at home and in the wider community.
