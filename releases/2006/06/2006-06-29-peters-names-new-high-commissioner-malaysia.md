New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Malaysia will be career diplomat David Kersey, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“Next year we will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations with Malaysia, which will be a significant milestone in our relationship,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand's strong ties with Malaysia cover areas such as defence, education, and trade, while we are both members of APEC and the Commonwealth. New Zealand is also a dialogue partner in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Malaysia is a leading member.

"Bilateral trade between New Zealand and Malaysia totals $1.4 billion, and a free trade agreement is currently being negotiated.

“Mr Kersey will be at the forefront of a multi-agency team, including a newly-appointed education counsellor in Kuala Lumpur, as we continue to build our already close relationship and long friendship with Malaysia," Mr Peters said.

Mr Kersey joined the Foreign Ministry in 1976 and has recently been seconded to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He has previously served as High Commissioner to Singapore, and Ambassador to Vietnam Ha Noi, and in posts in Jakarta and Bangkok.

He will take up his assignment in September, replacing Geoff Randal, who is returning to Wellington.
