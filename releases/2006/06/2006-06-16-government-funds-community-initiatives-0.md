Nine community-based projects, many of them focusing on youth, are to share $1.5 million over three years in funding from the Government, Ministers announced today.

Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope and Minister of Youth Affairs Nanaia Mahuta said $549,000 has been allocated to the projects for this year.

The projects in places as far south as Gore and as far north as Kaipara are to be funded from the Government’s Community Initiatives Fund for up to three years.

The [Community Initiatives Fund](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/community-development/cif/index.html) supports projects run by a proven community leader and that contribute to the social development needs of a geographic community or a community of interest.

“I’m very pleased that this Government is able to support community leaders with great ideas about how to make positive changes in their communities,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“Investing in proven community leaders and their ideas is vital for social change. These are people who know and are supported by their communities. This Government welcomes innovative, community-based actions – if we carry on doing the same things we’ll keep on getting the same results.”

Ms Mahuta said: "Many of the projects focus on the needs of young people in our communities, and investing in youth development initiatives like this will continue to support them to become the best they can be."

The Community Initiatives Fund is administered by the [Ministry of Social Development’s Family and Community Services.](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/)

Fifty-three applications for funding were received this round. An external panel was appointed to review each application and recommend those for funding.
