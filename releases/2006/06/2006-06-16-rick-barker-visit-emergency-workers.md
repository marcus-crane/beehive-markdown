Fairlie and Waimate emergency workers in charge of local response and recovery operations will be visited by Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker tomorrow.

"Emergency workers are doing a great job battling Antarctic-like conditions," said Rick Barker.

"I want to get a better understanding of the situation they're dealing with and the problems they're facing on the ground.

"We've already made military personnel and equipment available and I'd like to see first hand how that's going.

"Forecasts show there's more snow and further sub zero temperatures on the way so we need to act right now.

"Over the weekend we'll continue to monitor the situation from the National Crisis Management Centre in the Beehive basement.

"On Monday I'll report back to my Cabinet colleagues," said Rick Barker.

Yesterday Rick Barker met with Civil Defence and Emergency Management officials in Christchurch.
