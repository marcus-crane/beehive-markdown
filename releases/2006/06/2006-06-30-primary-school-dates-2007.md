Primary school term dates for next year have been amended, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The holidays between terms 1 and 2 will now be a full two weeks. Primary schools’ first term will still end on Thursday 5 April 2007.

The second term will begin a week later than originally planned and will now start on Monday 23 April 2007. This will now be the same for secondary schools.

The change applies to next year only, with further consultation about term dates for 2008 and beyond.
