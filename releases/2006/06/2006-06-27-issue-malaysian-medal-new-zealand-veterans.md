Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today that the general distribution by courier of the Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM) Medal to eligible New Zealanders who served in Malaya / Malaysia between 1957 and 1966 is to begin shortly. The issue of this medal is a Malaysian government initiative to recognise service in Malaya, Borneo, and Singapore.

“The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF), with the assistance of the Malaysian Ministry of Defence, will now undertake the issue of PJM Medals. Defence has acted as the agent for the Malaysian Government in the acceptance and vetting of applications for the PJM Medal. The distribution of the PJM Medal is the logical next step in the process of ensuring that the medal is awarded to eligible New Zealand veterans in a timely manner”, Phil Goff said.

“To date, over 2,600 applications for the PJM Medal have been received and vetted by HQNZDF. The cased medals will be couriered by Defence to eligible New Zealand veterans. The medals will be issued in alphabetical order, by surname of the applicant, to veterans resident in New Zealand and overseas. It is anticipated that the issue of the more than 2,600 medals will take several weeks to complete”, Phil Goff said.

The PJM Medal was instituted by His Majesty the King of Malaysia to commemorate service by the British Commonwealth Forces to safeguard Malaysia’s sovereignty during the Communist Insurgency and the Indonesian Confrontation. The PJM Medal honours the valour and sacrifices made by the New Zealand Forces who served in Malaya / Malaysia for at least 90 days, between 31 August 1957 and 31 December 1966. This also includes service in Singapore up to 9 August 1965.

Eligible veterans, and the families of deceased veterans, are encouraged to apply for the PJM Medal, if they have not already done so. Application forms should be sent to: Medals Office, Headquarters New Zealand Defence Force, Private Bag 905, Upper Hutt, New Zealand.

Further details on the eligibility criteria for the award of the PJM Medal, and application forms, are available from the NZ Defence Force Medals website:
