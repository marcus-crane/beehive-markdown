The Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui is encouraging Maori disability consumers to have their say on Ministry of Health -funded services they receive.

A series of consumer meetings have been held around the country in recent weeks and finish up with four hui this month.

Mita Ririnui says, "the hui allow Maori who have a disability and their whanau to discuss any thoughts or concerns they have about current Ministry-funded disability support services. The hui will also give a voice to Maori disability consumers on the funding priorities for the Ministry of Health's Disability Services Directorate."

"It's important that consumers have control over the services they need to have a quality life and the Ministry wants to hear how it could be doing things better to respond to the needs of Maori who have a disability," says Mita Ririnui.

"The government has increased the Ministry of Health's Disability Services Directorate's funding by $61 million this financial year (2005/06), taking the first step in our long-term commitment to continual improvement in the disability services sector.

"The New Zealand Disability Strategy aims to improve the quality of disabled people's lives through good investment in quality services. These hui allow people to engage in conversation about what the Disability Services Directorate does to support Maori who have a disability and their whanau.

"I encourage disability consumers to attend the upcoming hui to ensure that the Ministry of Health is fully informed of what the disability issues are facing Maori, says Mita Ririnui.

The Ministry of Health is collating information gathered at all of the meetings and will consult with disability consumers on an annual basis. This follows on from a series of smaller scale meetings run last year.
