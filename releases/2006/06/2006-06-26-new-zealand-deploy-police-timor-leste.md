Prime Minister Helen Clark and Police Minister Annette King today announced that New Zealand will deploy up to twenty five police to Timor Leste to assist international efforts to restore law and order there.

Helen Clark and Annette King said that the police are expected to leave for Timor Leste within the next two weeks and would remain there for three months. Initially they are likely to work alongside the 167-strong New Zealand Defence Force deployment already in Timor Leste.

"Political developments over the weekend and the ongoing uncertainty have reinforced the need for the international community to restore law and order so that lawful democratic and political processes can take place.

"The deployment will work closely with the Australian Federal Police and police from other countries under the general arrangements agreed with the Timor Leste Government for the deployment of foreign military and police personnel."

Helen Clark said that the United Nations is currently assessing the nature of any operation it might lead in Timor Leste. A Police Mission is one option under consideration.

"It is likely to take some time for the UN to work through the various issues surrounding its future operation in Timor Leste," Helen Clark said.
