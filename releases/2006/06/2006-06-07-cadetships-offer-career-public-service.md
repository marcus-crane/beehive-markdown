Twenty-three-year-old Jasmine Pene is graduating from her cadetship with Work and Income and credits her experiences as a young mum with helping her understand the needs of other sole parents in her work as a case manager.

Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope today congratulated Jasmine, and the 67 other young Work and Income staff members from around New Zealand, who graduated from the Ministry of Social Development's Modern Apprenticeship Cadet Scheme.

Modern Apprenticeships were introduced by Government in 2000 to encourage and assist young people aged between 16 and 21 into careers while improving their training and qualifications. The Ministry of Social Development started the Work and Income Modern Apprenticeship Cadet Scheme in November 2003 and made an ongoing commitment to train approximately 100 cadets at any one time.

The 68 Work and Income cadets, all case managers at Work and Income Service Centres, have gained a National Certificate in Client Service (Public Sector) Level 4 –  
a nationally recognised tertiary qualification.

“The Work and Income Cadet Programme has given me not just a job, but a career. As a case manager at the Porirua Service Centre I get a lot of satisfaction knowing I am making a difference in my client’s lives,” Jasmine said.

Mr Benson-Pope says the Government is proud of the success of the Modern Apprenticeships scheme: “For the past five years it has opened up opportunities to thousands of talented young people.

"At the end of December last year, 8,388 Modern Apprentices were earning and learning in 32 industries. Over 1400 young people have now completed their Modern Apprenticeship. An additional $34 million investment in the scheme from Budget 2006 will provide for up to 14,000 Modern Apprenticeships by the end of 2008.

“This Government has a strong focus on youth employment, and a strong focus on workplace and industry training. Modern Apprenticeships is just one of a suite of programmes, like Youth Transitions Services, Gateway, and Job Partnerships with Industry, that are successfully helping more New Zealanders into strong career pathways that last.”

The 2006 recruitment of 70 new Work and Income cadets is already underway.
