New Zealand officials will meet with United States government agencies for trade-related talks under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in Washington next week, Trade Minister Phil Goff announced today.

The meeting on 27 June, a regular feature in the bilateral trading relationship since 1992, provides an opportunity for the New Zealand delegation to discuss a range of trade and investment issues.

The last meeting held under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement was in 2004.

“These talks provide an on-going opportunity for New Zealand and the United States to discuss the range of specific bilateral trade issues and concerns we share, with a view to expanding and deepening our already substantial economic relationship,” Mr Goff said.

The TIFA delegation comprises representatives from New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Economic Development and the New Zealand Treasury, as well as representatives from the New Zealand Embassy in Washington DC.
