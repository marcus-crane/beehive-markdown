A Kaipara community-based project is getting over $66,000 in government funding, says Labour MP Dover Samuels.

Community leader Thomas Hinz of Dargaville, with the support of Kaipara District Council, plans to teach Kaipara district caregivers and teachers to mentor young people – including those with intellectual disabilities.

Mr Hinz's project will receive $66,667 for one year from the Government’s Community Initiatives Fund.

“I’m very pleased the government is supporting Thomas Hinz and his great ideas to make positive changes for the around Kaiparacommunity, focused on our young people's future,” said Dover Samuels.

Almost $550,000 has been allocated this year to nine projects from Gore in the South to Kaipara in the North.

"The fund was set up to support proven community leaders running projects that contribute to the social development needs of a geographic community or a community of interest.

“Investing in proven leaders like Thomas Hinz is vital for social progress – if we carry on doing the same things with our young people we’ll keep getting the same results, so it's great to see innovative, community-based action that stands a good chance of improving things, said Dover Samuels.

The Ministry of Social Development’s Family and Community Services administers the Community Initiatives Fund. An external panel was appointed to review each of the fifty-three applications and recommend the final nine.
