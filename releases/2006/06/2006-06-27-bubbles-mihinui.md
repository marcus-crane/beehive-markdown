Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her sadness at the passing of Bubbles Mihinui, the respected Te Arawa kuia and tourism industry icon.

Bubbles (Dorothy Huhana Mihinui), died suddenly in Rotorua on Monday. She was 86.

Bubbles became an apprentice guide at Whakarewarewa Village and geothermal area in 1936, gained her licence in 1938, and became senior guide in 1970 after the death of Guide Rangi (Rangitiaria Dennan).

In 2002, she was made a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to Maori, tourism, and the community.

"It was with great sorrow that I learnt of the passing of Bubbles. She was always a friendly face on my visits to Rotorua," Helen Clark said.

"Bubbles dedicated her life to sharing Maori arts and culture with New Zealanders and international tourists.

"She was a towering figure in Te Arawa and a respected kuia. She made a huge contribution to tourism in the Rotorua area, in particular as a guide at Whakarewarewa.

"She will be missed by Rotorua and by New Zealand," Helen Clark said.
