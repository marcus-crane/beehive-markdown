Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor announced today the appointment of a new member to the Walking Access Panel.

Peter Brown, from Manutuke near Gisborne, has replaced Parekawhia McLean, who resigned recently due to other work commitments.

Mr Brown has project management skills built over 25 years of community economic development, particularly in rural areas. His qualifications include Bachelor of Arts, Bachelors of Laws, Masters in Business Administration and a Diploma in Environmental Management.

Damien O'Connor welcomed Mr Brown to the panel, which is presently consulting with communities around New Zealand, and thanked Parekawhia McLean for her hard work.

The independent panel is hearing the community's views on the issues surrounding walking access to and along rivers, lakes and the coast.
