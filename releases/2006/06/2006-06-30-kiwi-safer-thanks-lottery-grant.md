A juvenile kiwi chick named Toko was released into Egmont National Park today. The chick’s new environment will be safer from predators and pests, thanks in part to Lottery Grants Board funding.

Rick Barker, Minister of Internal Affairs, said the Lottery Environment and Heritage Committee granted $50,000 over two years to the Taranaki Kiwi Trust, to help cover costs for a predator trapping project.

“The project will help to maintain and expand an intensive trapping project, to protect the North Island brown kiwi from pests in the area,” said Rick Barker.

“The existing kiwi population is seriously at-risk. Research shows there may be as few as 20 – 40 remaining pairs in the National Park.

“Without predator control, fewer than 5% of brown kiwi chicks are likely to survive to adulthood.

"I'm delighted that a Lottery grant is funding such an important conservation project. Not only will the predator trapping project help remaining kiwi survive in their now-precarious environment, but it will protect newly released adolescent chicks," said Rick Barker.

Toko, the kiwi chick, is being released as part of the BNZ Kiwi Recovery 'Operation Nest Egg' project. He is the 13th chick to be released this season.

The Taranaki Kiwi Trust is a community-based voluntary charitable organisation. The Trust is working in partnership with the Department of Conservation to conserve kiwi in Taranaki/Mt Egmont.

The existing network of trap lines in Egmont National Park focuses on trapping stoats, the main threat to young kiwi, as well as other mammalian pests. The Lottery grant will contribute significantly to the existing trapping network, while allowing the Trust and DOC to expand the network.

Jenny Steven, a Taranaki Kiwi Trust trustee, said she was thrilled to have received two years of Lottery funding. “The funding will allow the Trust to concentrate on developing long-term sustainable funding options for the predator control project.”
