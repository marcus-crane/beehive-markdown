New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Canada will be career diplomat Kate Lackey, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Ms Lackey has been High Commissioner to Australia since 2002, and served as deputy High Commissioner in Canada from 1985-1987.

“New Zealand and Canada have an excellent and longstanding bilateral relationship. We share many common interests and have similar perspectives on global issues such as human rights, the environment, disarmament, and good governance. Canada is one of our closest allies in the United Nations and Commonwealth.

“Both countries are closely engaged in the global fight against terrorism and have committed substantial forces to help rebuild fragile states. We also share ambitious objectives for the current WTO Doha Development Agenda.

"Canada is New Zealand’s ninth largest export market, worth $518 million in 2005, and Ms Lackey's work will include seeking to expand our export and investment opportunities in Canada," Mr Peters said.

Ms Lackey, who will take up her posting in October, became the Ministry’s first woman deputy secretary in 1997. She has been director of Americas Division and has served in posts in Asia, the Pacific and North America.
