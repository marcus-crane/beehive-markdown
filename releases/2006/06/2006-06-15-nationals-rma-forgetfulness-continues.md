The National Party continues to be forgetful when it comes to the Resource Management Act (RMA), Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“Kate Wilkinson is demonstrating the same forgetfulness as her colleague Dr Smith when it comes to recalling the improvements made to the RMA last year. I know she wasn’t an MP when the Amendments were made in 2005 but that is no excuse,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

[The Resource Management Amendment Act,](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23893) passed by Parliament in August last year addressed the issue of frivolous and vexatious objectors, which was the subject of Ms Wilkinson’s Private Member’s Bill defeated in Parliament yesterday.

Changes were made to the RMA to enable authorities to strike out frivolous and vexatious objectors when considering and hearing submissions made on plans, policy statements, resource consents, designations and heritage orders.

Such frivolous and vexatious submissions will also be able to be struck out where the submitter discloses no reasonable or relevant case; or that it would otherwise be an abuse of the hearing process to allow the submission to be taken further. These strike out powers are linked to the accreditation of hearing panels.

“The RMA Amendment Act was about providing greater certainty and efficiency in the way the RMA operates.

“It’s a pity National Party members have such a short memory span. They are moaning about things the Government addressed almost a year ago,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

Important features of the Resource Management Amendment Act include:

- Ability to remove vexatious applications
- Training and accreditation of hearing panels
- Minister has a menu of options for complex or cross-boundary consents
- Council staff training to support good decision-making
- Introduction of inquisitorial style hearings
- Expert evidence provided in advance
- Minister can require councils to complete plans
- Iwi consultation only at the plan stage
- Recognition of existing investment
- New Zealand-wide consistency of environmental standards

“Clearly this Government is working to get the balance right in terms of encouraging economic development and environmental sustainability,” said Mr Benson-Pope.
