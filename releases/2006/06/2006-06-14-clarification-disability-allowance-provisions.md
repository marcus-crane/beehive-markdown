Disabled people in community residential services, and who qualify for a Disability Allowance may be able to have their payments backdated to 18 May 2006 under a proposed amendment to the Social Security (Long-Term Residential Care) Amendment Bill released today.

The proposed amendment will enable people to receive their full entitlement to a Disability Allowance, even if they take some time to apply due to ill health, disability or reliance on an agent to act on their behalf. People may be able to receive payment from 18 May 2006 if they apply within 12 months of that date.

The proposed amendment to the Social Security (Long-term Residential Care) Amendment Bill also confirms the long standing policy that older people in long-term residential care who are receiving a Residential Care Subsidy are not eligible for Disability Allowance, because their service provider is required to provide the health and disability services they need. This proposal would apply from 14 June 2006 once the Bill is enacted.

The Amendment Bill is currently before Select Committee for consideration. The proposed amendment to the Bill will be considered by the Select Committee which is expected to report the Bill back to the House in by 30 September 2006.
