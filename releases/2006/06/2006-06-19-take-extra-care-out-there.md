Auckland police are taking all possible steps to avoid further kidnappings following two attempts to kidnap college students last Friday says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"I've spoken with the Police and commend them on doing everything possible to apprehend the person responsible for this outrageous behaviour against school children'".

"I congratulate Western Springs College for providing assertiveness training and personal safety information to their students – it has been apparent in the intelligent way these brave young women have responded to the kidnap attempts."

"I encourage students to commute to and from school together – and to let parents know of any changes to normal routines."

Judith Tizard encourages Aucklanders to phone the Police if they have information - Ph Avondale Police on 820 5700 or Auckland Central Police 302 6400.

"But call 111 straight away to report any suspicious behaviour."

"I urge all Auckland parents and school students to take extra care until the Police apprehend this person."
