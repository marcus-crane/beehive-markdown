New Zealand will contribute an additional $1 million for humanitarian assistance to the people of Timor Leste, bringing the New Zealand Government’s total humanitarian contribution during the current crisis to $1.5 million, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“While New Zealand Defence Force personnel are helping to restore security, it’s also important to ensure that those who are suffering because of the violence are assisted," Helen Clark said.

“The latest figures from Timor Leste's Ministry of Labour and Community Reinsertion, which is coordinating relief efforts, indicate that there are more than 65,000 displaced people living in camps around Dili, and a further 35,000 people from the capital living in camps in the districts.

“One of the major challenges is providing food for those displaced. Rice is the main staple of the local diet. Timor Leste's government has asked New Zealand to co-fund a shipment of rice which has arrived in Dili.

“New Zealand has agreed to provide NZ$450,000 to pay for half of the 2000 tonne shipment. The Timor Leste Government will fund the other half," Helen Clark said.

"Distribution of the rice will be managed through a working group, including representatives from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), CARE International, and the World Food Programme (WFP)," Winston Peters said.

“Some of the rice will be distributed to the districts of Timor Leste, where access to food has been further weakened by the arrival of many Dili residents in recent weeks. The Ministry will work with district administrators to ensure that assistance gets to those who are most in need," Mr Peters said.

The Red Cross is also expected to launch an appeal tomorrow, to which NZAID, the Government’s international aid agency, has already committed $500,000.

“Our contribution to the Red Cross will be used to supply basic needs such as shelter, water and medical care," Helen Clark said.

“In addition, a further $500,000 has been made available to support the humanitarian work of New Zealand NGOs currently operating in Timor Leste.

“Our Embassy staff in Dili also have provision to spend up to $50,000 in NZAID funds to help local communities recover from the effects of the conflict,” Helen Clark said.

NZAID has a $4.1 million annual aid programme with Timor Leste.
