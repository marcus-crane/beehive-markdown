Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker today launched a New Zealand-wide campaign urging New Zealanders to “Get Ready Get Thru”.

The press, radio and television campaign is designed to boost public awareness and understanding of the need to prepare to face disasters by having a plan, and storing water and other things they’ll need in an emergency.

A new website getthru.govt.nz gives simple messages on what we all need to do.

The government has committed more than six million dollars over four years to the campaign, which includes the new schools programme “What’s the Plan, Stan?”

At today’s Beehive launch Rick Barker revealed details of a survey on New Zealanders’ preparedness:

- Just six percent (6%) of people say they are “very well” prepared
- Almost half - forty-six percent (46%) - say they are “quite well’ prepared
- Thirty-five percent (35%) - more than a third of us – say they are “not that well prepared”
- thirteen percent (13%) are “not prepared at all”

Mr Barker believes, however, that some people may have overestimated their level of preparedness.

“On average, people who thought they were very well, or quite well prepared in fact didn’t have all the things they needed for a plan and an emergency kit. This shows there is a lot of work still to do.

"This campaign is a start, but as always we will depend on everyone involved in Civil Defence – especially at the local level to continue the other efforts already underway in communities to raise awareness and understanding.

"The main point is that people need to take personal responsibility for themselves and their families and be self-reliant in an emergency for at least three days," he said.
