Early childhood education centres will get a big boost to their funding rates from 1 July to enable them to employ more qualified teachers, say Prime Minister Helen Clark and Education Minister Steve Maharey.

On a visit to the Childspace early childhood centre in Karori today, Helen Clark and Steve Maharey said the Labour-led government was investing $30 million over the next four years as part of a drive to lift quality in early childhood teaching.

"High quality early childhood education has a significant impact on how children learn and develop. The increase to funding rates from 1 July will help to boost the number of qualified early childhood teachers, and ensure all children can access quality early childhood education."

The increased rates would allow early childhood centres to employ more qualified teachers without passing additional costs on to parents.

"Funding rates for all-day services will increase by up to 13 per cent, while rates for session-based services will increase by up to 11 per cent," Helen Clark and Steve Maharey said.

"Playcentres will also get a 9 per cent boost to their funding. This will help to reduce the time volunteers currently need to spend on administration, so they can spend more time with children.

"Quality and participation in early childhood education have increased significantly in the last five years as a result of investments by Labour-led governments.

"Around 94 per cent of all New Zealand children now take part in early childhood education. Overall funding for early childhood education has more than doubled since 1999, and the overall number of qualified teachers has increased by 50 per cent.

"The Labour-led government is also working towards lowering the cost of early childhood education for all New Zealand families with the implementation of up to 20 hours free early childhood education for three and four year-olds beginning in July next year,” Helen Clark and Steve Maharey said
