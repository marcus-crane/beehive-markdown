Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban invites New Zealanders to apply for the 2006 funding round for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowships.

Minister Laban said that the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has helped over 600 New Zealanders, as diverse as scientists, teachers, entertainers and community workers, to undertake research overseas since it was set up in 1965.

Britain’s wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill strongly believed in people going overseas to develop a particular area of expertise, and returning to make a greater contribution to their community back home. Churchill Trusts also operate in the UK and Australia.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders to benefit their communities by researching international best practice, and bringing that knowledge and experience home,” said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Churchill Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs. They typically spend from three weeks to three months overseas.

Past recipients have included Errol Hitt, who researched the growing, the history and production of saffron; Jane Drumm from Mt Eden, who is looking at United Kingdom programmes using innovative ways to assist victims of family violence; and Charitee Gay from Christchurch, who is studying Art Realisation Techniques for people with disabilities.

Applications close on July 31 2006. Application forms for travel in 2007 can be obtained from: Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, Department of Internal Affairs, PO Box 805, Wellington, Phone: 0800 824 824. Email: [trusts@dia.govt.nz](mailto:trusts@dia.govt.nz)
