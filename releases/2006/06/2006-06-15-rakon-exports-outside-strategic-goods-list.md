"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its technical advisers have met and discussed with Rakon the application of export controls to the crystal oscillators that Rakon exports", the Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Phil Goff said today.

"They are satisfied that based on information Rakon has provided, the crystal oscillators Rakon exports are not covered by the Strategic Goods List. They therefore do not require an export permit.

“For electronic components of guidance and navigation equipment, such as crystal oscillators, to be covered by the Strategic Goods List, they must be "specially designed” for military use. This means that they have unique properties distinguishing them for a predetermined military use.

“Radiation hardened products – sometimes loosely referred to as nuclear hardened – are used in a wide range of applications including satellite communications and the aerospace industry. They are unlikely to be specially designed for military use. Rakon further informed the Ministry that it has not manufactured or supplied any "radiation hardened" crystal oscillators.

"Rakon informed the Ministry that it has developed a "G-hardened" crystal oscillator but it is not supplying it to any company for military use. G-shock hardened products – referred to as G-hardened – are used in a wide range of applications, including in surveying, marine, aviation and guided munitions applications. They have many applications and are unlikely to be specially designed for military use.

“Rakon have undertaken to keep in touch with the Ministry about the application of export controls to any new products they might develop.

"New Zealand is absolutely committed to meeting its international legal obligations to control the export of strategic goods. It is also voluntarily but enthusiastically committed to its membership of the four export control regimes."

"Following its inquiry the Ministry is satisfied that Rakon's exports are outside the Strategic Goods List and that New Zealand is fully meeting its international commitments," Mr Goff said.

(The Ministry’s technical advisers were the Defence Technology Agency, which is part of the Development Branch of the New Zealand Defence Force. The Agency’s primary role is to provide scientific and technical advice to the NZDF and it is staffed with scientists and engineers.)
