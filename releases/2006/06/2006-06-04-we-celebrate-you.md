Introduction

As Minister of Veterans’ Affairs, I am honoured to be here today and to speak to the many of you that have served New Zealand in times of conflict.

I also wish to convey to you the warm sentiments of Prime Minister Helen Clark who joins with me today in celebrating your gathering here in Palmerston North.

The legacy of your courage, bravery and determination in the face of immense challenges remains an inspiration to all of us.

Year of the Veteran

This government has officially designated 2006 as ‘Year of the Veteran’, a year for New Zealanders to express our appreciation for the contribution made to our national identity, our communities and our free and democratic way of life given to us by the service and sacrifice of veterans, such as those of you gathered here today.

In the past five years, this Government has put in place a suite of support services for veterans and their families.

I remain committed to continuing that support, but “The Year of the Veteran” provides us with an opportunity, to go even further in honouring those who have served through contributions to community groups, that identify the significant impact you have had on the wellbeing of your communities.

We recognise the immense contribution veterans have made and continue to make to the development of our families, our communities and our way of life.

Indeed, it is a year for us to remember that the fundamental contribution made by our veterans is the very free and democratic society that New Zealand enjoys today.

However, the ‘Year of the Veteran’ also acknowledges that the impact of service can be considerable; not only for the veterans themselves, but for their spouses, their families and their communities.

During this ‘Year of the Veteran’, we recognise the role played by the wives, husbands, families and friends of service personnel in supporting our veterans.

In order to do this, the "Year of the Veteran Community Grants Fund" assists local communities in realising plans for projects and events associated with commemoration.

There is also an opportunity to recognise members of our communities who have gone above and beyond in volunteering their time, skills and effort for the benefit and support of our veterans.

During 2006, Year of the Veteran Commendations will offer a way of also saying thank you to these men and women for their hard work and support, not just from the New Zealand government, but from the people of New Zealand.

While the dedication of ‘Year of the Veteran’ allows us to honour the courage and sacrifice of those who have served for their country, it also provides a time for discussion with those who are still affected by their deployment.

Viet Nam Veterans

In particular, veterans of the Vietnam conflict, and their families, have had long standing concerns about the effects of their service on their health and the health of their children.

In late 2004 a Health Select Committee Inquiry undertook a detailed investigation which concluded that New Zealand soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to physical, psychological and environmental risks, during their service.

In recognition of this, the Labour-led government offered a formal apology to the Vietnam veterans for the failure of successive governments to recognise that the Vietnam veterans were exposed to a toxic environment during their service.

In light of this information, a Joint Working Group was established last year to advise the Government on how best to address the concerns of Vietnam veterans and their families.

Chaired by the former State Services Commissioner, Michael Wintringham, the Joint Working Group welcomed submissions from all Viet Nam Veterans and consulted with over 700 veterans and their families in 17 locations around New Zealand.

The group also held video conferences with New Zealand veterans in Australia.

The Joint Working Group completed their report this month and Government has received the report and is currently considering the recommendations.

The government is actively working towards reconciliation with Vietnam veterans and their families on behalf of the entire nation.

I acknowledge that there are many issues which still face those who served in Vietnam and I am committed to addressing these.

The ‘Year of the Veteran’ provides an ideal time for dialogue on such issues, and to recognise and commemorate your service.

Expressing Appreciation

Finally, as a lasting expression of appreciation to those who have served New Zealand in times of war or emergency, this government is pleased to present a special ‘Year of the Veteran’ Certificate of Appreciation and Lapel Badge.

Veterans of the Vietnam War are warmly encouraged to step forward for these awards. Again, I simply say, as one New Zealander to another, thanks.

I'm proud to be here with you today and as a New Zealander it is everything I can do to say thank you for what you have given us.
