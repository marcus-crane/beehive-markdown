Northlands iconic MP Dover Samuels has united the seven members of parliament from the North to get the RNZ Frigate Canterbury sunk at Deep Water Cove-Te Rawhiti

"Northlands M.P's are united in making a representation to the Minister of Defence, Hon Phil Goff to get the RNZ Frigate Canterbury sunk at Manawahuna Bay, Deep Water Cove-Te Rawhiti," said Dover Samuels

The representation that was made to the minister of defence highlighted the Far North District Council's desire for this to happen along with a strongly supported tautoko letter from Nga Kuia, Kaumatua o Ngati Kuta me Patukeha, Te Rawhiti.

Dover Samuels was instrumental in getting The Rainbow Warrior sunk off Matauri Bay, twenty one years ago…"thousands of tourist have come to Northland to dive the Rainbow Warrior, and of late the Waikato and Tui at Tutukaka, we now have a great opportunity to complete a dive trail of international appeal, by securing the RNZ Frigate Canterbury to be sunk at Deep Water Cove," said Dover.

Dover further added," with the Poor Knights Marine Reserve, the Waikato and Tui at Tutakaka, the Canterbury at Deep Water Cove and the Rainbow Warrior off Matauri, we have an opportunity stitch together a spectacular dive trail that will benefit all of the North."

The Bay of Islands Canterbury Charitable Trust will be the organisation that will drive this initiative, Nga Kuia, Kaumatua o Ngati Kuta me Patukeha, Te Rawhiti make up 50% of the trusts participants.
