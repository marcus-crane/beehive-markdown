"The New Zealand Army has increased its inventory of world-class equipment with the delivery of 24 Javelin medium range anti-armoured weapons," Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

The new weapon systems are part of the Army's $26 million dollar modernisation project approved by the Government in 2001.

"[The Javelin](http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_products/antiarmor/JAVELIN/product-JAVELIN.html) is a state of the art and technologically advanced anti-armoured weapon, effective in destroying any armoured vehicle out to a range of 2500m," said Mr Goff.

The introduction of the Javelin enhances the protection of the Army's soldiers, vehicles and equipment.

The Javelin's optics and thermal imaging capabilities enable it to locate and accurately engage targets by day and night.

The Javelin missile is effective against bunkers, buildings, boats and helicopters, as well as armoured vehicles.

"The Javelin system includes both indoor and outdoor simulators that provide realistic training that has proved to be highly successful.

"This approach to training has been effective overseas, with 92% of operators trained using the simulators, achieving a first time hit with live ammunition.

"The Javelin medium range anti-armoured weapons are now in Waiouru where the initial training on the new weapon system will take place between July and December 2006," Mr Goff said.
