Parliament is committed to ending family violence in New Zealand homes, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today after the first multi-party meeting on family violence.

Members from across the political spectrum met this evening and were briefed on government actions including the Te Rito New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy (initiated in 2002). Following this briefing all MPs contributed positively and constructively on the challenges that confront us all in dealing with the problem of family violence.

MPs were also briefed on the interagency Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, which was established in 2005 to build on Te Rito and strengthen the response to family violence.

This Taskforce will be reporting back in mid July. MPs agreed to reconvene at that time to discuss the Taskforce recommendations.

Social Development ministers Parekura Horomia, Ruth Dyson and David Benson-Pope were pleased with the way meeting went and are looking forward to ongoing dialogue with their multi-party Parliamentary colleagues on this critical issue that affects all New Zealanders.
