Nearly $559 million is being invested in Auckland land transport this year including $400 million on roads and $147 million on public transport.

Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says, "This Labour-led government is working to remove the infrastructure constraints which have held Auckland back. Auckland cannot be a world-class international city if people and goods cannot rapidly move through it."

National transport spending over the next ten years is set to top $24 billion – up from $21 billion last year – following the release of the National Land Transport Programme (NLTP).

"When we came to office the value of big State Highway projects in Auckland that were underway or recently completed totalled $130 million. In March, using exactly the same criterion, the big projects underway or recently completed total $1300 million. This doesn't even include the $1.3 billion Budget 2006 injection."

Judith Tizard noted the Budget also provided further certainty for delivery of state highway construction with a five-year funding guarantee. "It's the first time we've had this funding certainty."

The Government's funding injection also guarantees revenue for other land transport activity in the NLTP including local road construction activity, public transport services and maintenance of the roading network to enable ARTA and Land Transport NZ to plan such activities with greater certainty.

Judith Tizard said upgrading and completing Auckland's important transport routes is the focus for central and local Government in 2006/07.

"As Minister for Auckland Issues, I particularly want to congratulate ARTA on its 2006/07 Auckland land transport programme, the launch of which I attended this morning. The team of eight – the seven territorial local councils and ARTA – have collaboratively developed this integrated regional programme of roading and passenger transport infrastructure and services which complements the Transit State Highway Forecast.

"We are all committed to making Auckland’s major routes more efficient, managing the capacity on Auckland’s road networks and making passenger transport more attractive as an alternative to using the car.

"The Northern Busway is one project having a significant impact on Auckland transport. I congratulate North Shore City Council for opening Stage One of the project in November last year, with two Park and Ride bus stations at Constellation Drive and Albany, and ARTA for investing in the bus services. Working in partnership with central and local government, the Northern Busway is getting Aucklanders out of their cars and on to public transport."

The Western Ring Route remains a top priority because of its importance as a strategic alternative to State Highway One. "Today my colleagues the Prime Minister and Transport Minister Annette King turned the first sod in the construction of a key section of Auckland's Western Ring Route. The $210 million Manukau motorway extension will improve traffic flows in Manukau and the region as a whole, including giving better access to and from Auckland airport."

The Manukau Extension Project is a 4.5 km four-lane motorway which connects the existing State Highway 20 (SH20) at Puhinui and State Highway 1 (SH1) motorways south of the Manukau City Centre. Once completed, the Western Ring Route will provide a strategic alternative to SH1 between Manukau City and Albany via SH20, SH18 and SH16.

The funding for Auckland in 2006/07 will include approximately:  
·$400 million for the maintenance and construction of state highways and local roads  
·$147 million for public transport  
·$2 million for programmes and facilities that encourage travel behaviour change and promote walking and cycling.

Funding has been committed for the continuation of major projects, including:  
·The SH 1 ALPURT B2 extension from Orewa to Puhoi to provide an efficient and safe corridor for traffic;  
·The Northern Busway and Esmonde Road Interchange to improve passenger transport services between North Shore and Auckland;  
·The Mt Roskill extension of SH 20 on the Western Ring Route to ease traffic congestion;  
·The Manukau motorway link between SH 20 and SH 1 on the Western Ring Route to ease congestion;  
·The Greenhithe motorway deviation on SH 17 on the Western Ring Route to ease congestion;  
·The Waiouru connection involving arterial roading and a motorway interchange, constructed jointly by Transit and Manukau City;  
·The Greenlane interchange upgrade including widening of Greenlane Road and the Greenlane/Great South intersection by Transit NZ and Auckland City.

"This government is working for Auckland and is delivering on our promise to get Auckland moving", says Judith Tizard.
