The Minister Responsible for the Law Commission, Mark Burton, welcomed the Law Commission report Waka Umanga: a Proposed Law for Maori Governance Entities, which was tabled in Parliament today.

The Law Commission’s report tackles the complex issue of suitable legal models for Maori governance, as well as the issue of how tribal entities obtain a mandate from their own people and how they can receive recognition from Government and other agencies.

The report is a comprehensive and wide-ranging review of governance arrangements for Maori and associated issues.

"The Government has been considering these issues for some time,” Mark Burton said. “I welcome the Law Commission’s contribution to the policy debate, and the practical suggestions contained in the report. The issues involved are complex and will require a considered response from the Government."

The recommendations have implications for a number of Government portfolios and several ministries will be directly involved in preparing a response to the Law Commission’s report. That response will be lead by the Minister of Maori Affairs, and will be presented to Parliament by the end of the year.
