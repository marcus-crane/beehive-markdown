“New Historic Places Trust legislation will enhance the ways in which New Zealand’s historic heritage is preserved and protected”, says Associate Minister for Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard.

The Bill has been passed by Parliament and comes into effect on 1 August this year.

One of the major provisions of the Bill is the strengthening of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust’s governance arrangements. It also provides for legislative consistency in the notifications and submissions processes, which ensures the involvement of parties affected by proposed historic heritage registrations.

Judith Tizard says, "The changes to the makeup of the board ensure a balance of expertise and, along with the Trust’s new Crown entity status, will strengthen its accountability to government and support its key role in promoting and protecting New Zealand’s historic heritage.

“The amendments to the Historic Places Act are appropriate and necessary given the very significant increased funding for the Trust announced in the recent Budget. Government allocated a total of $12.8 million of new operating funding over the next four years, as well as an additional $600,000 in this 05/06 financial year in supplementary funding."

“Baseline operational funding for the Trust rises from the current level of $7.153 million to $9.9 million in 2006/07 and to $10.5 million in 2007/08 and subsequent years. The Trust will also receive new capital funding of $3.2 million during the period 2005/06 to 2007/08 to support its capital plan, such as refurbishing its heritage buildings."

The Bill reduces the size of the Board from 11 to nine members, and increases the number of government appointees from three to six, while retaining three elected members.

"The enhancements to the Trust’s governance arrangements, also recognises the Trust’s significant regulatory responsibilities and their potential impact on private property rights.

“The governance changes will not, however, impinge on the freedom of the Trust to carry out its functions at arm’s length from government,” she said.
