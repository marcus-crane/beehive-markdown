"The New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force will assist with Civil Defence efforts in the Canterbury region, Defence Minister, Phil Goff announced today.

"In anticipation of a request for support, an aviation fuel tanker was sent to the South Island yesterday and Defence Force assets put on standby.

"Late this morning the acting director for Civil Defence formally requested assistance and as a result elements of the Defence Force have now been deployed.

Burnham based Army personnel and vehicles will head out to remote areas to ascertain the state of roads and assess any damage. Other personnel are deploying to Civil Defence emergency centres including Fairlie and Waimate to act as liaison officers and assist in the coordination of Defence Force support.

"Two RNZAF Iroquois Helicopters from Ohakea will join the Army already deployed later this afternoon.

"The New Zealand Defence Force is always ready and willing to assist New Zealanders in difficult situations such as this," Mr Goff said.
