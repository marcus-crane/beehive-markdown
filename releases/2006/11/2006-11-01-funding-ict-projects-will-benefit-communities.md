Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today announced the opening of the [Community Partnership Fund’s](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____18.aspx) 2006/07 funding round, as part of the Labour-led government's [Digital Strategy](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/default____4.aspx).

"The Digital Strategy aims to make New Zealand a world leader in information and communication technology (ICT) by improving the capability and skills of all communities," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"This Community Partnership Fund is about unlocking our potential as communities to achieve New Zealand's economic, social and cultural aspirations."

"It will enable organisations to continue to develop innovative projects that increase the confidence of people in our communities to use and understand ICT."

"Communities with easy access to ICT, together with the ability and confidence to use technology will be well equipped to create a digital future for all New Zealanders."

"The Fund is strongly focussed on communities working together in collaboration to identify needs, ideas and effective ways to implement their ICT projects."

"I have visited several of last year’s successful applicants and was impressed by the standard of their projects and their commitment to their communities. I look forward to seeing what this year’s funding round will produce,” said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

All organisations with community ICT projects are invited to make an [Expression of Interest](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____346.aspx) (EOI) to the Fund. EOI’s must be submitted by 19 December 2006.
