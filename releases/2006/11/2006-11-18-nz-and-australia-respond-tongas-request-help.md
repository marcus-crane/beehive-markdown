Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that New Zealand would send a contingent of defence personnel and police to Tonga in response to a request from Tonga’s government for security assistance in the wake of rioting on Thursday.

Australia will also provide defence personnel and police to a New Zealand-led contingent which is expected to leave for and arrive in Tonga tomorrow \[Saturday], subject to final agreement on arrangements between the three governments.

Helen Clark said a group of about sixty New Zealand Defence Force personnel will assist with security at Fua’amotu International Airport. Eight to ten New Zealand Police will be deployed to provide additional security and assistance at the New Zealand High Commission in Nuku’alofa.

“The NZDF personnel will provide security at the airport. They will work with the Aviation Security section of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Tonga Defence Services, and the Tonga Police Force in securing international flights, aircraft, crews, and passengers.

“The New Zealand Police’s primary role will be to provide security and assistance to the New Zealand High Commissioner and his staff. They will also discuss further with the Tonga Police Force what might be needed in terms of ongoing assistance needs in the short and medium term.

“I expect those discussions will identify further areas where New Zealand and Australia can assist. We will look favourably at responding to those needs quickly.”

Helen Clark said the riots have been deeply unsettling for Tonga.

“This is a troubling time for Tonga. It comes at a time when the country and government has entered a process of political reform and New Zealand is supportive of that.

“I hope that the security support to be provided by New Zealand and Australia will provide a basis for an early return to order and normality within Tonga, will help to restore an environment in which Tonga’s reform process can continue, and will be seen as a positive contribution from friendly neighbours,” Helen Clark said.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also sending two additional consular staff to bolster the High Commission.
