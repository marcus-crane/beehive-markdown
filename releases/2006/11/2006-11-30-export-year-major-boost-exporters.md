Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced a $33.75 million boost to the Market Development Assistance Scheme which supports New Zealand exporters breaking into offshore markets.

This funding boost is a key feature of Export Year 2007, which is also being formally launched at the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Export Awards tonight.

Helen Clark and Winston Peters said that Export Year 2007 is a key part of the confidence and supply agreement negotiated between Labour and New Zealand First.

Helen Clark, Winston Peters, Trade Minister Phil Goff, and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today visited tapware manufacturer and exporter Methven Ltd’s Avondale premises to make announcements about initiatives for Export Year 2007.

"Improving our country’s export performance is critical for the future prosperity of all New Zealanders. For the economy to develop and transform, it is essential we have more globally competitive, high value firms and increase our export returns,” Helen Clark and Winston Peters said.

Helen Clark said a key part of Export Year 2007 is the one-off funding boost announced today to the Market Development Assistance Scheme.

“The funding will be spread over fifteen months from January. That means that support for the scheme will go from $27.1 million to $40.6 million in the 2006/07 financial year, and from $25.4 million to $45.6 million in 2007/8.

“This scheme is a vital component of our efforts to crack key markets overseas. It has already been very successful, and very popular, with about 320 firms currently receiving assistance.”

Helen Clark said the boost to the Market Development Assistance Scheme would enable many more businesses to use it to develop their export markets.

“The scheme has been heavily over-subscribed in both years of its operation. The 2006 funding round closed a month after it opened owing to excess demand, despite Budget 2006 providing extra funding of $19.8 million in 2006/07, and $14.8 million in outyears.”

Helen Clark and Winston Peters also launched the Export Year logo today, and the Export Year website www.exportyear.co.nz which provides information, how-to guides, checklists, and resources for exporters and which goes live today.

As part of the lead up to Export Year 2007, a conference in being held in Auckland tomorrow for the CEOs and founders of more than 50 export companies to brainstorm what the business sector can do to lift export performance. Other initiatives to be rolled out next year include:  
·Targeted trade missions led by ministers.  
·Beefing up the mentoring programme with people who have “real world” export experience to work with up-and-coming exporters and increasing access to exporter education courses.

Helen Clark said that Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard and Trade Minister Phil Goff will be heavily involved in Export Year initiatives.

New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said export growth was critical to New Zealand's long-term economic sustainability.

"As a country, we face two inconvenient truths when it comes to exporting. The first is that this is not a choice -- our exports must grow or our economy will falter. That means making structural and practical changes that will provide incentives for businesses to begin exporting, or to export more. We are confident that as Export Year 2007 unfolds, this will occur.

"The second is that this must be a long-term project. The initiatives and policies unveiled as part of Export Year 2007 must pay a dividend over the next decade and beyond. The success of Export Year 2007 will not be measured in 2008, but in a much stronger economy in 2017 that offers greater business profitability, higher wages, and better social services," Winston Peters said.
