The Ngäti Mutunga Claims Settlement Act was passed by Parliament today.

The Act provides for the full and final settlement of all of Ngäti Mutunga’s Taranaki-based Treaty of Waitangi claims and enables the transfer of settlement assets and other redress agreed in the 2005 Deed of Settlement.

The settlement includes a formal Crown apology for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, cultural and commercial redress, and a total package of $14.9 million.

Associate Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui welcomed the passage of the Act.

"This is an important milestone in the process to address historical grievances and a particularly important landmark in the achievement of Treaty settlements in Taranaki," he said.

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised, and addressed in a peaceful and constructive way. It is part of a growing momentum to address historic Treaty grievances. This is the second claims settlement bill to pass through Parliament this year, while a third bill is set for introduction before year's end.

"Treaty settlements strengthen the relationship between the Crown and iwi and lay the foundations for us to build a strong and confident sense of national identity.

"While the Crown could not possibly compensate Ngäti Mutunga for all the iwi has lost, I believe this settlement will provide Ngäti Mutunga with the chance to develop an important asset, which will contribute significantly toward a sustainable future for the iwi," Mita Ririnui said.
