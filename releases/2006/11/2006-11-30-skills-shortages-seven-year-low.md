Skills shortages are at their lowest since 1999, making it the best time in seven years for employers to be looking for staff, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"The Department of Labour's latest quarterly report ['Skills in the Labour Market'](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/lmr-Skills.asp) shows that while unemployment has remained at historically low levels, it has also become significantly easier for employers to find both skilled and unskilled labour," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Skills shortages are easing thanks to better job matching in Work and Income, industry-driven training, and good immigration policy.

"During the September quarter, 21 per cent of firms had difficulty finding skilled staff. This is 40 percentage points below the 61 per cent of firms in the December 2004 quarter, and well below the 40 percent average of the last six years," Mr Benson-Pope said.

Mr Benson-Pope said these results were due to:

- The Ministry of Social Development's job matching service, which has seen a record number of people move into work in the past year
- Industry-driven training programmes, which identify skills shortages and provide the training that enables industries to recruit the right staff
- Immigration policy that takes into account the needs of New Zealand's labour market.

"While the situation will continue to improve, this remains an important issue for New Zealand businesses," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Employers can lessen their impact by upskilling staff and providing flexible workplaces with good work/life balance."
