Non-compliant and potentially dangerous Christmas tree light sets have been prohibited from sale and use by the Energy Safety Service, Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven announced today.

"I want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable festive season. That is why I've taken prompt action to ensure these unsafe light sets are banned," Harry Duynhoven said.

The prohibition came into effect on Friday 17 November 2006. The notice bans the manufacture, importation, sale, installation and use of this Christmas tree light set. Anyone, including consumers, who breaches the prohibition would be in non-compliance with the Electricity Regulations 1997 and could be liable for a fine of up to $10,000.

"These Christmas tree light sets do not carry the required electrical markings or warnings. What's more, they are unsafe and should not be used," Harry Duynhoven said

The lights electricity supply leads do not offer effective protection against electric shock. These leads, which may have green or white insulation around the wires, are of poor quality and may split and peel away when moved back and forth, exposing live wires. The other problem is that the supply leads can easily come away from the control box, exposing the user to an electric shock hazard.

The plugs on the light sets are also not suitable for use in New Zealand, as they have aluminium pins that can be easily bent and could break in the socket outlet leaving an exposed live pin.

The lights are a low cost item, sold in a number of discount and low-price chain stores in unmarked plastic bags or generic Christmas lighting boxes. The product packaging and wording may vary, but known wording on the packaging says ‘Christmas Decorations’, ‘Rice Lights’ or ‘Multifunction Rice Lights’.

"Energy Safety Service staff are checking shops to ensure that non-compliant light sets have been removed," Harry Duynhoven said.

People who have bought this electrical product should destroy it or return it to the retailer for a refund. Consumers can also contact the [Energy Safety Service](http://www.ess.govt.nz) to report if they have seen or purchased these products by phoning 0508 377 4636.
