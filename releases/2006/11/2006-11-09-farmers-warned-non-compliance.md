Environment Minister David Benson-Pope warned today that dairy farmers’ non-compliance with their local authority’s effluent discharge limits will not be tolerated.

The Minister has congratulated regional authorities committed to monitoring and enforcing compliance with discharge limits. However, he said he was very disappointed that early compliance results indicate there are some dairy farmers not fully complying.

“There are no excuses for not complying,” he said. “Each regional council sets out how and where effluent can be disposed of in its regional plan and resource consents. Under the [Resource Management Act](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/index.php), there are penalties for not complying - up to two years’ jail, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.

“Those who are not complying are not only risking the health of our water bodies and our environment, they are also risking stiff penalties.

“Most farmers are working with industry and government to better manage our water bodies. They are probably, like me, feeling let down by those who are not complying. I call on them and the dairying industry to help get these stragglers on board.

“We are all in this together, and farmers who ignore effluent consent conditions are being short-sighted. As individuals and as a nation, we need to preserve our supply of quality water.

“Water quality is crucial to New Zealanders and is one of our most valued natural assets. How we manage our water bodies is important to our future health and prosperity," he said.

The Ministry for the Environment plans to publish the compliance results of all local authorities by the end of the year.

“I look forward to examining these complete results very closely,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

Dairy farmers wanting more information about effluent limits should contact their regional council. More information about the Resource Management Act is available at [www.rma.govt.nz.](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/index.php)
