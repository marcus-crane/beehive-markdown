Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker rode in with the 'Ride of the Veterans' charity motorcycle convoy as it concluded in Wellington today.

The five veterans have travelled by motorcycle from the North Cape to Bluff thanking communities for their efforts on behalf of veterans and raising money for the children and grandchildren of Vietnam Veterans.

Rick Barker joined riders Alastair MacKenzie, Dave Barr, John Coleman, Bruce Gordon and Graeme Weavers in the final leg of the trip from Rangiora to Wellington.

"It has been a pleasure riding with the convoy. The Ride of the Veterans has visited every RSA in the country and have been warmly welcomed in towns throughout New Zealand," said Rick Barker.

"It has been a most humbling experience," says Alastair MacKenzie. "The hospitality and generosity that we have received throughout New Zealand from members of RSAs and the general public has been quite amazing."

The Ride of the Veterans raised over $40,000 for the Vietnam Veterans’ Youth Development Trust. The Trust makes grants to assist veterans’ children in education, sport and other endeavours.

"The riders are to be congratulated for taking the lead in fundraising for a very good cause, and for raising awareness amongst veterans about health issues," said Rick Barker.
