The Government is investing $15.5 million in a Green Party initiative to increase the use of solar water heating in New Zealand.

Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation Jeanette Fitzsimons says with climate change accelerating and energy prices rising, it makes sense to use the sun to heat our water.

The programme will run for five and a half years from now, with $15.5 million allocated for the first three and a half years. Funding levels for the final two years will be decided after a review in 2009. The programme includes:

·Providing independent information to help consumers decide whether solar is suitable for them, and what kind of system they need;

· Motivating demand through promotion;

· Improving quality and cost effectiveness by working with industry including setting standards and encouraging training opportunities;

· Providing financial assistance to home owners;

· Putting more solar water heating systems into Government buildings; and

· Encouraging new ideas through an Innovation Fund.

“Our initial goal is to double the numbers of solar water heating systems being installed,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

This will see approximately approximately 15,000 to 20,000 systems installed by 2010. Assuming this electricity would have otherwise been supplied by coal and gas power stations, the estimated CO2 savings are equivalent to getting 5000 to 7000 cars off the road.

Solar water heating will help many New Zealand families reduce their power bills while also reducing their impact on the environment, Ms Fitzsimons says.

Energy and Climate Change Minister David Parker says the Government has developed this programme as part of its broad approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy in the home as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

"Further initiatives in this area will be made clear in the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the draft National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, which will be out for public consultation shortly.

“I am pleased to be working closely with Jeanette Fitzsimons as we make progress in these areas,” Mr Parker says.

The finance assistance available from the Government for purchasing solar water heating systems will increase from $300 to $500 from February 2007. This is provided in the form of a contribution to the cost of interest on a loan.

Access to the increased finance assistance will be subject to systems meeting criteria on energy performance and cost effectiveness.

The criteria will mean taxpayer funding will only be available to the systems that deliver most effectively for homeowners.

“We know solar water heating is more cost-effective for larger households (four or more people) and that it is important that it is installed properly, to maximise the capture and transfer of the sun’s energy. We want to help families select the system that is best for them,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

From May 2007 there will also be assistance for new home builders. Details are still being finalised.
