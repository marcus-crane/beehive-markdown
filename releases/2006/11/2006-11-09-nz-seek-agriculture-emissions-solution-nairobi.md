New Zealand will be seeking international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, at an international meeting on climate change in Nairobi next week, Climate Change Minister David Parker said today.

New Zealand is taking part in the twelfth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the second Conference of the Parties serving as Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

The meeting in Nairobi constitutes the second international meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol since its entry into force in February 2005.

“In light of the recent Stern review, it is increasingly important that countries move constructively towards agreement on climate change,” said Mr Parker. “New Zealand will work actively to support progress towards agreement.”

"A major challenge for New Zealand is finding a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, which make up about half of our total emissions, something that puts us in an unusual position."

"We will be emphasizing the world-leading research into this matter we are already undertaking at home, but also looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with likeminded countries and encouraging others to increase their R&D spending in this area."

All nations, including those that have not ratified Kyoto, will be participating in discussions around the establishment of an international framework for climate change beyond 2012.

“The Nairobi discussions will help shape the next steps of negotiations for global action on climate change," Mr Parker said.

“As a biologically based economy and trading nation, New Zealand’s national interests are threatened by climate change and it is therefore imperative that an effective global framework for action on climate change after 2012 is agreed."

“The meeting also provides a valuable opportunity for bilateral discussions with other nations about climate change,” Mr Parker said.
