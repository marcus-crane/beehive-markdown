The government has released a new resource that draws together information about regional job vacancies, employment and unemployment levels and benefit numbers, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

Mr Benson-Pope said the [integrated regional reports](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/lmr-regional.asp) would be invaluable for employers, local and central government agencies, job seekers, and everyone working towards regional economic development.

"All the information in these reports is already available from [Statistics New Zealand](http://www.stats.govt.nz/default.htm), the [Department of Labour](http://www.dol.govt.nz), and the [Ministry of Social Development](http://www.msd.govt.nz)," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"What's been missing is an integrated picture of everything that's happening regionally. What are the regional job vacancies? How do these match with labour force participation and employment figures? What benefit numbers are showing the strongest movement in the region?

"The new quarterly regional reports will give an at-a-glance answer to these questions. They're part of Labour's commitment to regional social and economic development," Mr Benson-Pope said.
