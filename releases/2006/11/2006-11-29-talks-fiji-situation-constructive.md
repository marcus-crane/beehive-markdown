Foreign Minister Winston Peters says today's meeting between Fijian Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Commodore Frank Bainimarama at Government House had been constructive.

"The discussions extended over two hours and were lengthy, serious and meaningful," Mr Peters said.

"New Zealand hosted today's meeting because we recognise that resolving the current situation in Fiji is fundamentally important to its future, and to the future of the wider Pacific.

"Our role as host of the meeting was to bring the parties together and to facilitate dialogue between them.

"We have done so today.

"We welcome the positive character of the discussions and the constructive spirit that both Prime Minister Qarase and Commodore Bainimarama brought to the table.

"Consultations and work will continue on the matters under discussion.

"Our role as host and facilitator means it is not appropriate for us to comment on the nature and substance of the issues discussed.

"Any additional comment on the issues, and today's meeting, will come from the Fiji participants, as the matters concerned are domestic ones for Fiji.

"The New Zealand government, as a friend of Fiji, remains, however, ready to continue in its role as a facilitator of dialogue," Mr Peters said.
