Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Jim Anderton opened the Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITP) New Zealand Annual Conference today and said that tertiary education was a key component that willl contribute to New Zealand’s economic transformation and strengthen the development of our regions.

“The tertiary sector has a vital role to play in transforming New Zealand into a high wage, high skill, and knowledge-based economy. We are taking steps to produce more skilled graduates in areas the economy needs, and getting better value for taxpayers from the investment we are making in the sector,” Jim Anderton said.

“The Government appreciates the commitment of the sector's leaders to work with us to produce the best outcomes for everyone. Your role is critical in making the significant changes successful and I look forward to working closely with you. We want key parts of the new approach working by 2008.

“The Government is committed to investing in New Zealand's priorities and shifting resources to better match the urgent need for skills and knowledge. Industry will have more of a say about the skills our system produces. Students will have a say themselves about what and how they learn. Tertiary institutions should have a vital role in defining their distinctive regional contribution.

“Skilled workers are a critical part of our social and economic development because the industry will rely more and more heavily on new skills. Investment in skills will pay dividends for the whole of New Zealand.

“The need for ITPs to focus on their own regions has largely been accepted across the sector. Each region needs to build on its competitive strengths and to improve networks, so that everyone pushes together on the highest priorities for development. In my six years as Minister of Regional Development, I found the regions that have been most successful have been those that have done this best,” Jim Anderton said.

“The emphasis on industry needs and regional priorities will mean that many of our institutions need to get even closer to our primary industries. The Government is clear about this. All ITPs with a rural catchment will be expected to engage closely with rural communities and they will need to work closely with workers and industry groups in the primary sector.

“As Minister of all the primary industry portfolios, I want to raise the profile of the primary production sector. We need to restore the status of the sector as an attractive and good one in which to study and make a career in.

“There is a lot to do. I look forward to working on the new approach with the tertiary sector for a better future for us all,” Jim Anderton said today in Christchurch.
