The Supergold Card launched today will provide meaningful discounts across a range of services and products to seniors, says Associate Minister for Senior Citizens Winston Peters.

"The Supergold Card, for people 65 and over, recognises the contribution they have made, and continue to make, to New Zealand," Mr Peters said.

"The Card will be available in August next year. Legislation will be introduced soon; its passage will be given priority by the government, and funding has been made available for its implementation and operation.

"The Supergold Card will have tangible benefits that will make a real difference to cardholders by providing easy access to government concessions as well as discounts for commercial goods and services.

"Its launch in Auckland today coincides with start of the process for companies wishing to offer discounted services or products to cardholders. Over time we expect that seniors will have an access to a growing number of discounts, including high-cost items."

Mr Peters said that due to high interest in the card, from both seniors and businesses, the Ministry of Social Development has set up two freephone numbers – 0800 25 45 65 for seniors with initial enquiries, and 0508 65 00 00 for businesses. More information is also available on [www.msd.govt.nz](http://www.msd.govt.nz).

"A dedicated website and a directory of services will promote the range of concessions and discounts available to cardholders across the country.

"The card will be sent automatically to people receiving NZ Super or a Veteran's Pension, with a special version going to war and emergency service veterans. Cardholders can choose to have their photo on the card, which may be useful for those who don’t have photo ID."

Mr Peters said many businesses had recognised the value of the card.

"Already several large companies, who we can't name yet because the process has only just begun, have expressed a strong desire to be involved.

"With over half a million seniors eligible for the Supergold Card, it represents a valuable, loyal and rapidly growing market for businesses to be involved in.

"Business enthusiasm at this early stage bodes well for the Supergold Card rapidly becoming a valuable discount card for seniors," Mr Peters said.

### Key information on the Supergold Card

- The Supergold Card is a concession card for New Zealand residents who are 65 or over, or who qualify for NZ Superannuation or a Veteran's Pension.
- It will provide commercial discounts from participating businesses, and easy access to concessions on government and local authority services.
- The card will be credit card sized. It will carry the holder's name, a number and whether the holder receives NZ Super or a Veteran's Pension, or has a Community Services Card. A photograph for ID purposes is optional.
- Associated legislation will be introduced this year. Funding for the card's implementation and operation has been made available. The card will be available in August 2007.
- About 540,000 people – including around 15,000 under the age of 65 – will be eligible to receive the card.
- It will be sent automatically to people receiving NZ Super or a Veteran's Pension, and to people aged 65 or over who receive a benefit. Other residents aged 65 plus will qualify for the card, but will need to apply.
- Cardholders' spouses who are under 65 will be able to access the commercial discounts.
- Veterans will receive a specially-branded Supergold Veterans Card.
- The Supergold Card replaces the Community Services Card and Super Card. People who currently hold those cards will be able to access their entitlements through the Supergold Card, and more concessions may be added later.
- There will be no change to existing NZ Super entitlements.
- The Ministry of Social Development has set up a freephone for seniors wanting to make inquiries. It is 0800 25 45 65.
- The Ministry will also produce a directory and establish a website listing all discounts being offered to cardholders.
- A wide range of discounts for everyday goods and services are likely to be offered, and the experience in Australia is that commercial discounts build up year by year.
- MSD is now seeking expressions of interest from businesses. Conditions are being finalised but are likely to include a requirement that discounts last at least 12 months.
- A freephone has been set up for interested businesses on 0508 65 00 00.
