A record $138.5 million of lottery profits has allowed the reintroduction of lottery funding for community facilities, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today at a function to launch the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

"In 2002 falling lottery profits resulted in the Lottery Community Facilities Fund being discontinued. However an increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits over the last few years has allowed us to reintroduce the fund," said Rick Barker.

"The reintroduction of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund will be warmly welcomed as it will provide much sought after funding to build or improve community facilities.

"In 2005 the Government set up the Significant Community Based Projects Fund to provide communities with a way of obtaining funds needed to complete major projects. The reintroduction of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund will provide capital funding for a larger number of smaller scale, local projects.

"Over $8 million has been set aside in 2007-08 and applications for the first funding round will open on 30 April 2007.

"In 2005/06 $138.5 million was transferred to the Lottery Grants Board. This is the largest amount transferred since New Zealand Lotteries was established in 1987, and $24.5 million more than was budgeted.

"Lottery Grants help communities reach their potential, and play an important role in our strengthening communities. Thanks to this increase in profits even more groups will be able to benefit", said Rick Barker.

Detailed information and application material about the reintroduced Lottery Community Facilities Fund will be available at the end of April 2007. For more information on lottery grants visit [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz), or call freephone 0800 824 824.
