Environment Minister David Benson-Pope is aiming to meet Fire Service and Police officials as soon as they can give him a formal briefing on this year's Guy Fawkes season.

Mr Benson-Pope said the behaviour of some people at this year's Guy Fawkes had shown the necessity for tighter controls on fireworks sales and use.

"I'd like to see sensible regulations that protect the right of New Zealand families to enjoy a safe and responsible Guy Fawkes with their neighbours and friends, but that also prevent the kind of behaviour that can ruin it for everyone else," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"I'm seeking a formal briefing on the incidents that took place during this year's Guy Fawkes, and then I'll discuss any proposals with my colleagues.

"Any changes need to be approved by Cabinet, but will be in place well before Guy Fawkes 2007," Mr Benson-Pope said.
