New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Samoa will be career diplomat Caroline Bilkey, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand enjoys a close relationship with Samoa. It is the only country with which we have a Treaty of Friendship, and there are many strong cultural and economic links between the New Zealand and Samoan communities,” Mr Peters said.

Ms Bilkey, who will also be accredited to American Samoa, is currently a Deputy Director in the Ministry’s Legal Division. She has previously been posted to Canberra, the United Nations in Geneva, and Bangkok.

Ms Bilkey will take up her appointment in May, replacing John Adank, who returns to Wellington.
