Jim Anderton, revisited the Addington. Net community computing centre in Christchurch today to help celebrate its 5th birthday.

"I was here when this idea started out five years ago using recycled computers. That the project has thrived and reached this landmark shows that the best ideas are resilient," Mr Anderton said.

Set up in the face of a community need, Addington.Net, now has 18 computers available on weekdays. Computer use and training are free. Broadband Internet use is free during training sessions and offered at low-cost for casual users. The centre offers one-on-one help with CV preparation and assistance with general computer use.

It also provides free Internet access to children after school and has people on hand who can help others learn about the Internet, email and formatting. The centre now gets up to 15,000 visits a year.

"Access to affordable computing is as important today as access to public transport and libraries has been for decades, " said Jim Anderton. "We owe a debt of gratitude to people whose vision and work produce community assets."

Addington.Net was a project driven by a core group with members from Addington Bush, Manuka Cottage, Addington Neighbourhood Association and Addington Business Association. Most of the original trust members are still involved and they have now formed a partnership with the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology and Computing For Free.
