A "no surprises" [Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS)](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/info-releases/hlfs-info-releases.htm) for the quarter ending September 2006 shows annual employment growth remaining strong at 1.5 per cent, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The latest HLFS shows unemployment at 3.8 per cent, up 0.1 percentage point from this time last year. Labour force participation is at 68.3 per cent, up 0.2 percentage points over the same period.

The quarterly shift in the unemployment rate is a 0.2 percentage points increase, and in labour force participation a 0.4 percentage points decrease.

"New Zealand remains one of only five out of 27 OECD countries whose unemployment rate is below 4 per cent. Even with the slight easing in the labour market, we've achieved our second-highest level of employment and our third-highest labour force participation rate," Mr Benson-Pope said.

It's particularly good to see that the Maori unemployment rate fell from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent in the year to September 2006, while the Pacific unemployment rate fell from 6.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent over the same timeframe. These annual averages are record low rates of unemployment for both Maori and Pacific people.

"The Labour Department has been saying for some time that high unemployment is a thing of the past, and once again the HLFS confirms that view. Low unemployment and high labour force participation are now standard features of the employment scene," Mr Benson-Pope said.

Mr Benson-Pope said the government's economic management and its initiatives to support people into work was further endorsed by the latest monthly benefit figures showing a continued fall in Unemployment Benefit numbers.

"Thanks to programmes like [Working New Zealand](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27504), we'll see this progress continue and opportunities to work extend to all groups in our society," he said.
