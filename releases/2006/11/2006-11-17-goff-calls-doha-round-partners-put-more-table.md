Following are remarks made by Trade Minister Phil Goff during the debate on the WTO Doha Development Agenda. The WTO Director-General, Mr Pascal Lamy, attended the meeting and participated in the discussion.

“I welcome the statement by the WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, that the time has come to move back to a normal negotiating process in Geneva, said Mr Goff.

“The suspension of the negotiations since July this year has, if nothing else, forced all of us to think through the implications if the Doha Development Round were to fail.

“I think all of us have come to the clear conclusion that we simply cannot afford to see the Round collapse.

“Yet the Round is certainly at risk of failure.

“People ask me whether the major players really want an outcome. I believe they do – I accept what all of our colleagues say in that respect is in good faith.

“But declaring commitment to an outcome is not enough. All of us need to act to give substance to our words. At this point we have had no indication of any real breakthroughs on substance.

“Clearly people want to get the process back on track. I share Pascal Lamy's sense that it is time to get work underway again in negotiating groups – starting with agriculture but extending across the full negotiating agenda.

“The breakdown of the negotiations in July proved that the offers currently on the table aren’t enough to give us a deal. If we try to stay within everyone's comfort zone then we won't get a deal.

“So it is clear that everyone will have to do more. That means offers of real and higher cuts in current subsidy levels and genuine improvements in market access in agriculture and industrial goods. It also means negotiating disciplines to ensure that the headline numbers translate into genuine new market opportunities.

“What is the process that will deliver this?

“The existing negotiating model hasn't worked – we can't just rely on a few big players meeting at ministerial level to come up with the deal.

“I agree with Pascal Lamy that at this stage we need a process run primarily at negotiator level along the lines of past GATT/WTO rounds. Negotiators need to deal with the technical detail as well as separating out a shorter list of critical choices which will need to go to Ministers at the right time.

“We have the challenge of the expiry of the Trade Promotion Authority in the US. If we want to have a real chance of getting it renewed, which is critical for the completion of the Doha negotiations, we will need to deliver some real progress on the main issues of substance over the next couple of months.

“We also need to think about what messages we send from this meeting.

“It is important to signal flexibility and our readiness to move off existing positions.

“If we are not individually and collectively ready to do this, then we must bear responsibility for failure of the Round and all that means.

“I would also like to see that message extended to others involved in the negotiations. We should urge our partners in other regions to commit themselves, like us, to putting more on the table. Without this we will not complete the Round.
