New Zealand can continue to take pride in some of the world's cleanest, most beautiful rivers and lakes – but new reporting from the Ministry for the Environment also showed there was no room for complacency, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

Mr Benson-Pope said the three technical reports drew together regional data from around New Zealand. They showed more needed to be done to protect water quality and supply, particularly in lowland waterways.

"New Zealand has around 4000 lakes over one hectare in size, and many of these are in great condition. The reports focus on the 153 that are monitored, and show that about half of these are under pressure," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"They highlight the areas we need to keep working on to ensure sustainable management of all [our freshwater](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/freshwater/), and show that the actions government is taking are the right ones."

Mr Benson-Pope said the reports showed the quality of some lowland waterways was under pressure from intensive land use, although pollution resulting from major point discharge sources such as sewerage outlets had declined.

"We need to keep improving land management practices, applying fertilisers in a better way, and fencing stream boundaries," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"We also need to keep working towards fair and sustainable water allocation, in light of the fact that allocation has increased 50 per cent since 1999.

"Water is a vital resource for New Zealanders' recreation, economy, environmental values, tourism industry, and health," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Under the [Sustainable Water Programme of Action](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/prog-action/ "Link to details of the Sustainable Water Programme of Action, on the Environment Ministry website. "), the Labour-led government will continue to monitor water quality, to produce national policies and standards, and to encourage better land management. I'm pleased to see that almost twice as many lakes are being monitored for water quality today as in 2000."

The reports are posted on the Ministry for the Environment website, [www.mfe.govt.nz](http://www.mfe.govt.nz):
