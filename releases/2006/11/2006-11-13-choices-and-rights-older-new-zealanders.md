Older New Zealanders have as much right to choose to be in the workforce as younger, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope told an ageing research conference today.

"For some time, unemployed people aged 60 and over have been saying they want work-focused services from Work and Income. Others have been asking why we don't make greater use of the skills of the 60-plus age group as unemployment keeps going down," Mr Benson-Pope told the conference at Te Papa.

"[Working New Zealand](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27504) will remove the current discrimination within the benefit system, extending employment services and programmes to everyone on Unemployment Benefit, regardless of their age.

"Working New Zealand is about asking up front what people can do and what work might be suitable for them. We've had fantastic results from our trial of this approach, and are implementing it in every Work and Income site over the next year," he said.

[Latest benefit figures](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27687) show Unemployment Benefit numbers at 39,001, a drop of 9,938 over the past year. Overall benefit numbers have fallen 11,368 over the same period.

"The skills and contribution of New Zealand's older people are vital to our agenda of economic transformation," Mr Benson-Pope said. "Working New Zealand takes advantage of low unemployment and high job growth to give older people every opportunity to be part of the labour force of the future."

Mr Benson-Pope also confirmed that older people getting a Sickness or Invalids Benefit would not have work expectations or a work test. "For this client group, Working New Zealand is about closer engagement and support, not a work test," he said.
