National will now face choosing its fifth leader in nine years, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"This continued instability in the National Party is a sign of a party still nowhere near ready to govern.

"Dr Brash's resignation was inevitable. But it solves little. By all accounts Mr Key, the likely successor, was deeply involved in all the events that have eventually led to Dr Brash's downfall.

"In particular, we all await with interest Mr Hager's book to see the role Mr Key played with respect to the Exclusive Brethren. It is also likely to reveal Mr Key's central role in National's hidden policy agenda at the behest of the Business Roundtable and its associates.

"And if the bizarre rumour is true that Dr Brash and Mr Key are swapping jobs then it will be even clearer that nothing has really changed.

"The Labour Party relishes the prospect of having nearly two years to highlight Mr Key's inadequacies. We look forward to the next leader and the one after that," Dr Cullen said.
