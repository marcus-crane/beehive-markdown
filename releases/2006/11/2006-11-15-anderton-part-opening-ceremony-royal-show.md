Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton was a part of the official opening party at the New Zealand Royal Agriculture Show today in Christchurch. He gave a brief speech where he emphasised the importance of the agricultural sector to our economy.

"We are a small country; the things that unite us are far more powerful than those that divide us. In our cities there is a rural heart beating in the chests of Kiwis who have never been on a farm. We are not like Australia where some rural communities are so isolated there are adults who have never been to a large city centre. New Zealanders know we are in this together - town and country - because our economy depends on our rural communities," Jim Anderton said.

"Between 70 - 95 percent of our primary goods are exported. Two thirds of our foreign exchange comes from primary sector industries. That’s the foreign exchange we need to earn to pay for the goods and services we import.

"If we want to keep importing high value products like cars, iPods and oil, we need to generate higher and higher incomes. The best way we can earn more for New Zealand is for our primary industries to earn more. They are the major part of our economy.

"Our meat and dairy sectors are the only industries in New Zealand that have truly global scale. The market capitalisation of our five largest meat and dairy cooperatives is greater than the entire New Zealand stock exchange.

"It’s fashionable to think primary industries are declining in importance. But the facts tell a different story. Over the last fifteen years agriculture, forestry, and related industries have increased their productivity more than double the rate of the rest of the economy. The contribution of agribusiness to New Zealand’s economy has been rising.

"The primary industries offer a vibrant and viable lifestyle for everyone who settles in the rural heartland. We want it to be a career choice young people are drawn to, as New Zealand needs our best and brightest talent to be attracted to these high-tech and highly skilled industries.

"Let me say that this is a matter of more than just rhetoric or sentimentality. There will be no first world health, education, infrastructure, or even environment without a first world economy. For our entire foreseeable future we will continue to be dependent on our primary industries for our first world status. And our primary industries are performing successfully.

"As Minister of Agriculture, I am very pleased to be with you today and be part of the official opening of our Royal Agriculture Show in Christchurch. I share your keen pleasure that the Canterbury A & P Association is hosting the Royal NZ Show for the next 4 years - until 2009 inclusive. And I know with goodwill, purpose and a commitment to our rural communities, we can realise an even better future for New Zealand," Jim Anderton said today at the Royal New Zealand Agriculture Show.
