Energy minister David Parker today welcomed the report [*Healthy, Wealthy and Wise*](http://www.pce.govt.nz/reports/allreports/1_877274_28_3.shtml), by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Morgan Williams.

"I agree with Dr Williams that cold, damp and poorly insulated houses make people ill more often, and we could save money on hospital bills by making sure our houses are healthier."

"That's why this government is [reviewing the building code](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27150) and the [National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy](http://www.eeca.govt.nz/about/national-strategy/index.html), to put greater emphasis on measures to make better use of energy in our homes."

"In advance of that, we have [just announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27611) a proposed package of measures to reduce energy use in homes and commercial buildings, which includes increasing the insulation requirement for new homes."

"The government is convinced of the economic benefits that arise from well-insulated houses, and the potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to [climate change](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=25).

"Further initiatives in this area will be made clear in the New Zealand Energy Strategy draft, which will be out for public consultation before the end of the year."
