Climate change minister David Parker says National's new leader is getting his ideas muddled, in his attempt to talk up his environmental credentials.

"John Key is offering nothing new."

"He says he doesn't like the Kyoto Protocol, but he wants a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme with Australia."

"I have already discussed the possibilities of emissions trading with Australia when I met with the Australian environment minister Ian Campbell at the recent UN climate change conference in Nairobi.

"An emissions trading scheme works by setting emissions reductions targets, such as we have under the Kyoto Protocol, which then sets a price for emissions," David Parker said.

"Can we take it then, that John Key is now a Kyoto supporter?

"Last year John Key said he wasn't sure climate change was a problem. Yesterday he said he'd always believed in it."

"National has to come clean on where it stands on climate change."
