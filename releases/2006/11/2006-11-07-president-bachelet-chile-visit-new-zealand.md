Chile’s President Michelle Bachelet is to visit New Zealand after the APEC Leaders’ meeting this month, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

President Bachelet will be in Wellington from 20-21 November, immediately after the APEC Leaders' Summit in Viet Nam.

“I am delighted that Michelle Bachelet is able to visit New Zealand so early in her term as President of Chile," Helen Clark said.

“The conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (P4) between New Zealand, Chile, Singapore and Brunei has contributed greatly to the development of our relationship with Chile.

"Chile will become the fourth member of the P4 on 8 November. P4 Leaders will celebrate its entry into force for all four countries at the APEC summit in Ha Noi.

"In March I attended President Bachelet's Inauguration and discussed with her and leaders of Chile's economy how to take our economic relationship forward.

"The President's visit will expose her and her delegation directly to the opportunities for growing Chile's links with New Zealand, including in science and research, and in education, where we are a provider of the English language medium education which Chile seeks to lift the language skills of its people," Helen Clark said.

In addition to meeting the Prime Minister and Cabinet, President Bachelet will receive a formal welcome from the Governor-General, address a business breakfast, and visit Te Papa and Industrial Research Limited.
