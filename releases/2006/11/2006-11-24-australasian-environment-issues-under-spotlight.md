Environment Minister David Benson-Pope expects "a very lively agenda" as he joins his Australian counterparts today for a trans-Tasman discussion of environment issues.

Vehicle emissions, electronic waste, water use and contaminated sites are a few of the topics that will be under the spotlight at the fourteenth meeting of the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) in Christchurch.

Along with the New Zealand Minister, the EPHC comprises ministers from Australian Federal and State Governments. Mr Benson-Pope said the meeting was an excellent forum for debate about shared environmental challenges.

"New Zealand and Australia have many similar environment issues, from how to best manage e-waste to how to reduce vehicle emissions," Mr Benson-Pope said. "With climate change gaining international attention, this is an excellent time for us to be learning from each other's challenges and solutions."

Mr Benson-Pope said he would share progress on New Zealand's steps to improve air quality, the Govt3 initiative for environmental sustainability, and work around climate change and landcare. He was looking forward to gaining insights into Australia's unique challenges with drought and water demand.
