Speaking today at the Annual Conference of the New Zealand Grain and Seed Trade Association, being held in Christchurch, Minister for Agriculture, Jim Anderton said "When I look at the grain and seed sector, there is cause for considerable excitement about the opportunities the future offers."

He cited as an example that the vegetable seed industry has grown from near zero export earnings in 1995 to $30 million this year. "If we increase export seed value by five percent from this project, we would achieve increased export earnings of $1.1 million a year. "

The value of New Zealand's grain and seed industry production each year is somewhere between $150 and $170 million. It produces grain with a farm gate value of $370m, which in turn helps produce poultry and pork products worth $1.2 billion a year and cereal products worth about the same.

"Our primary industries are the lifeblood of our economy. Agriculture alone makes up over half our export earnings," said Mr Anderton. "If we are going to enjoy the lifestyle of the first rank of nations, then we have to earn a global income. But the truth is that for the foreseeable future the only industries we have with global scale and sophistication are our primary industries."

Productivity in New Zealand's primary industries has been rising faster than the average of the rest of the economy, going from 14 percent to sixteen percent of GDP. The Minister talked about how the on-going investment in science, research and development, and in innovation is producing more value.

"This government wants to transform our economy into a high-value, high-skill knowledge-based economy. Our primary sectors are already showing innovation and increases in value that the rest of the economy can emulate. But there is a lot more potential still to unlock within the primary sector.

The Labour-Progressive government is committed to working in partnership with the industry to unlock that potential."

Mr Anderton also talked of the need to attract more young people to see the primary industries as an attractive career option. "This issue is one of the most pressing for our primary industries, which face a challenge in persuading them that life on the land offers attractive opportunities."

Jim Anderton said that he is committed to continue his meetings with the industry, working to identify opportunities for development and innovation in this sector.
