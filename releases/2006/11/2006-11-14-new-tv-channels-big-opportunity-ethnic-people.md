The coverage of ethnic communities on New Zealand television should significantly improve following a $79 million funding package announced today for TVNZ, Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said.

"The Labour-led government has agreed to back TVNZ's plans to move in to digital television services. As part of these plans, two new channels are to be created offering greater opportunities for ethnic community programming," Mr Carter said.

"Until now, the television coverage of ethnic communities on TV One, TV2 and TV3 has been poor. Where ethnic community programming has occurred at all on mass audience TV channels, it has often been in difficult and inaccessible time slots.

"Ethnic communities make up a rapidly growing proportion of New Zealand's population, and it is crucially important that broadcasting becomes more inclusive and reflective of them," Mr Carter said.

Two digital channels are to be launched by TVNZ supported by $79 million from the government.

The first channel, with a working title of TVNZ News 24, will be a factual channel with extended news and current affairs coverage, reports and interviews, documentaries and special interest programming

The second channel, with a working title of TVNZ Home, will carry a high percentage of New Zealand content, and will include children's programming, family factual and entertainment programmes, and an evening showcase of local and international drama, comedy, arts and culture.

"Together these channels should provide more slots for the screening of ethnic programming at more accessible times, and help introduce new audiences to the issues ethnic communities face, and the contribution they make to New Zealand," Mr Carter said.
