A new $3 million fund for the Buy Kiwi Made regional and sector initiatives was announced today by the Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made Sue Bradford.

“The fund, part the Government’s $11.5 million Buy Kiwi Made programme, aims to support initiatives that promote New Zealand made goods and other Buy Kiwi Made objectives. We are particularly looking for ideas from regional and sector groups that are built on collaboration and have wide appeal.”

Ms Bradford made the announcement at a Buy Kiwi Made event showcasing New Zealand products in Parliament. The event, involving 34 companies, was the first in a planned series of seven regional showcases around the country designed to increase awareness of New Zealand made goods and the Buy New Zealand Made campaign. The other six will be held next year.

“With today’s event, and the announcement of the new fund, Buy Kiwi Made is well and truly underway. It is particularly fitting that this is happening this week, the first anniversary of the death of Green Co-Leader Rod Donald. Rod’s energy and passion was the driver of the Buy Kiwi-Made initiative. He was determined that we should recognise and celebrate the quality, diversity and innovation of New Zealand made goods as we are doing today.”

There will be three application rounds for the new fund over the next two years; an initial round in January/February 2007 of up to $1.5 million, a second, in October next year, of up to $1 million and a final round in March 2008 of $500,000 and any underspend from previous rounds, said Ms Bradford.

Projects to be funded must be New Zealand-based and focused and be consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations such as WTO and CER arrangements. In addition, projects must fall outside the criteria of existing government assistance.

The Ministry of Economic Development will administer the fund, with final decisions made by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Industry and Regional Development along with the Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made.
