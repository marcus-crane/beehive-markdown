Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.

I want to acknowledge the tangata whenua here in Whangarei and thank you for your mihi.

It is a pleasure to be here at the launch of a new Restorative Justice Service here in Whangarei. I am pleased to have the chance to meet with you and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to communicate kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face).

I would like to acknowledge Judge McDonald, Judge de Ridder, Judge Harvey, Shane Jones MP, Julia Hennessy from the Crime Prevention Unit at the Ministry of Justice, and Inspector Bruce Bird from NZ Police for attending this launch and showing your support for Ngati Hine’s work in restorative justice.

The relationships between agencies and groups ensure that these processes have the best chance of having a positive effect on the communities that you work with.

Most importantly I would like to acknowledge the Ngati Hine Health Trust for all of the hard work and effort they have put into organising this launch.

It's great that you are willing to be one of the providers around the country who work alongside the Ministry of Justice to help provide restorative justice processes to the people of New Zealand.

I note that in Te Tai Tokerau, Hohourongo, the approach of justice through reconciliation, is a long-standing and favoured concept, and I am pleased that the Ministry has been able to support this.

I commend your efforts and acknowledge your tradition of bringing this healing form of justice to both the victim and the offender.

I am confident this programme will link into your existing practices and experiences and bring benefits for your families, whanau and community.

I want to talk about an example of restorative justice that took place in your community – a real life situation where this process has a positive impact on all those participating, including the victim and the offender.

There was a serious assault on a young woman by a male family member. The family had asked for a facilitated process that was eye-to-eye, direct and swift. That process was arranged within 36 hours of the assault.

Any family members who could make it to the hui in that short time were asked to come.

The male family member had initially denied the incident. However, when facing the young woman, he admitted to the assault.

The young woman was overcome with relief and tears, as his acceptance and admission in front of whanau was what she had wanted from the process above all else. The whanau also shared in the young woman’s relief and tears.

As you have all been part of a community who has, for a very long time, supported this type of process and healing, you will no doubt be aware of this sort of positive outcome and I know that the resulting benefits for the community are a great inspiration for being involved in restorative justice.

I want to talk briefly about the broader context for the Government’s plans for the development in restorative justice.

**The growing prison population**

As I'm sure you are all well aware, the issue of the growing prison population is a significant challenge for the Government, and for our society as a whole.

We have an increasing prison population that is at odds with a long term downward trend in recorded crime levels.

From a peak of 7,610 inmates in March 2006, forecasts indicate that the prison muster could be nearing 9,000 within five years. We now have the fourth highest imprisonment rate in the OECD.

Twenty years ago there were fewer than 3,000 prisoners, and in 1996 the number was about four and a half thousand. In addition to the obvious high social costs, this increase has put significant pressure on the Corrections system.

I believe that many New Zealanders share my concerns about the burgeoning social and economic consequences of imprisonment.

And this increase has occurred within the context of decreasing crime over the last decade, when recorded criminal offences have declined by 13 percent.

This decrease is even more striking if we factor in population growth: by that measure reported crime has fallen by 19 percent over the last decade.

A particular tragedy of New Zealand’s high imprisonment rate is the high number of Maori in our prisons. Over half of all inmates are Maori, while Maori only make up about 15 percent of the total population. Any solutions that we put in place must be effective for Maori.

These are major problems that will not be resolved by simple measures. This Government is determined, however, to work towards long-term, sustainable solutions.

**Effective Interventions**

The reasons for the growing numbers of prisoners are complex. Accordingly, there has seen a significant amount of work carried out by a number of agencies led by the Justice Ministry to help determine and understand the reasons for the increase; and importantly some of the options for addressing both its causes and impacts.

The result is that the Government has now agreed on a range of strategies designed to reduce both criminal offending and the prison population on a number of fronts.

These strategies, which were publicly announced in August, are collectively called the Effective Interventions package and can be grouped into three broad themes:

- Earlier interventions to prevent crime;
- Using alternatives to prison where this is appropriate; and
- Adopting smarter uses of prison resources.

In developing the Effective Interventions strategies officials looked at a wide range of possible sanctions that could have an impact in further reducing crime, addressing the growing prison muster and building genuinely safer communities.

An important factor in achieving these outcomes is improving the process and outcomes for all those involved within the justice system on a day-to-day basis.

On Wednesday the new Parenting Hearings Programme, which is being piloted in six family courts around the country got underway.

This programme is a new process for determining complex Care of Children cases and will run for two years. The programme allows for a greater focus on the needs and views of children as well as reducing delays in the court process.

It provides for a more active role for the presiding judge to identify the issues to be resolved in defended cases and deciding the best process for achieving resolution.

By avoiding delays and enabling quicker resolution of cases the process is intended to reduce the damage that lengthy court battles do to the family relationships at stake and produce better outcomes for children.

Like the Parenting Hearings Programme, producing better outcomes for those involved within its process is a fundamental element of restorative justice. This is why restorative justice is an important component of the new government initiatives.

**Restorative Justice**  
New Zealand is internationally recognised as a leader in restorative justice – and the New Zealand Government has strongly supported the use of restorative justice processes in the criminal justice system. Most of you here today are from the 32 community-based programmes funded by the Justice Ministry to provide restorative justice processes upon referral from the criminal court.

The Ministry’s court-referred restorative justice pilot was one of the first fully evaluated tests of the use of restorative justice in cases of serious offending by adults.

The pilot, which was established in 2001 in the Auckland, Waitakere, Hamilton and Dunedin District Courts, built upon the Youth Justice System’s Family Group Conferences, and on existing community-based restorative justice programmes.

The pilot was evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in:

- increasing the resolution of the effects of crime for victims;
- increasing victim satisfaction with the criminal justice process; and
- reducing re-offending.

Its evaluation was completed last year, and the results were encouraging.

Most victims who participated in a restorative justice process found it a positive experience.

Three quarters of participants reported feeling better as a result of taking part in a conference.

Twelve months after the court hearing more than half of the victims said that the offence was completely behind them, and many victims said that the restorative justice process had helped them achieve this.

Around three quarters of victims reported that the offender understood how they felt. Two-thirds of them said that the offender had been made accountable for their actions and had shown that they were sorry for the offending.

Victims had the opportunity to say what they wanted to; they felt involved in the process and were treated with respect.

In follow-up interviews (a year after their conference), more than one third of victims said that they felt more positive about the criminal justice system after participating in a restorative justice conference.

The majority of victims reported that the conference enabled them to make the effects of the offence on them clear to the offender.

Most victims said that they would attend another such conference and many said that they would recommend participating in restorative justice conferences to others.

The evaluation also showed that restorative justice processes could increase offenders’ involvement in dealing with their offending.

Offenders reported that the restorative justice process gave them an opportunity to say what they wanted to and they understood and agreed with the decisions made about how to deal with their offending.

A two-year follow up of re-offending was completed in February 2006. It showed a small overall decrease in the re-conviction rate of offenders who had taken part in restorative justice, when compared to carefully matched comparison offenders.

While the sample was not large, the evaluators concluded that the decrease in re-offending was real, as the reconviction rate of the conferenced group was lower than all of 10 matched comparison groups throughout the two-year period.

The evaluation also found that fewer conferenced offenders were sentenced to imprisonment than the matched comparison groups, and that where they were sentenced to imprisonment, the sentences were shorter, and more were given the opportunity to apply to serve their sentences as home detention.

The lower imprisonment rate for offenders is a positive and encouraging outcome of restorative justice processes.

**Effective Interventions – Restorative Justice**

All of you here who have been part of the court-referred restorative justice pilot or of other community-managed restorative justice processes have the right to share in the success shown by the evaluation of these programmes and to feel that your work has contributed to the future of restorative justice in New Zealand.

Access to proven and new restorative justice processes is an important feature of the interventions put forward as part of the Government’s initiatives to address the high rate of imprisonment, and to provide more effectively for the needs of victims.

Information from the courts pilot and a number of other community-managed programmes was drawn on in the development of four proposals that will expand the availability of restorative justice processes at different stages of the criminal justice system.

The first of these proposals will extend provision of restorative justice processes in cases of less serious offending, as part of the Police Diversion process.

The second proposal is for the staged extension of the successful restorative justice pilot in cases of serious offending - where an offender has pleaded guilty and admits responsibility, and the offence is serious, so diversion is not an option and imprisonment is a possible outcome.

The third proposal is a positive new development that will use restorative justice when offenders are in prison and as part of the process of reintegrating them into the community.

The fourth proposal is a cornerstone for the expansion of restorative justice, and will provide a performance framework to ensure safe and high quality practice that meets the needs of the criminal justice system, victims, and offenders.

The work that you do over this weekend towards developing standards and measures for good practice in restorative justice will contribute to this development work, and will ensure that providers’ views are incorporated into the developments.

Restorative justice processes provide a safe and controlled environment for offenders to face their victims, take steps to redress the harm they have caused to them and to the community, and to address the causes of their offending.

These four proposals will increase significantly the opportunity for victims to have a real say in the criminal justice system and real input into the outcomes for those who have harmed them through criminal offending.

Clearly, the Government cannot progress this work alone. The Justice Ministry will be working with others from within communities as well as other agencies, the judiciary and legal and other professions to advance this new approach.

The Government recognises the need to maintain the community-based aspect of restorative justice.

In line with this view, the Ministry of Justice will be working closely with Restorative Justice Aotearoa in developing policies and implementing standards for restorative justice provision.

The Ngati Hine Health Trust will be, I am sure, one of many restorative justice providers around the country making a difference in the lives of people who are affected by offending.

Those who work in the restorative justice field demonstrate a strong dedication and commitment to their community, something that I very much admire.

I also wish to acknowledge all those who are here today, and those who are unable to be here, who dedicate their time and efforts into making restorative justice processes work in a real way to repair the harm caused by offending, and to help prevent its re-occurrence in the future.

New Zealand is recognised as a world leader in restorative justice, and you can all be proud of your contribution to this.

The government values the important role you play in ensuring the rights of victims are realised in the criminal justice system.

Thank you.
