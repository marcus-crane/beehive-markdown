Communications Minister David Cunliffe welcomes the report back to Parliament of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill.

"I wish to thank members of the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee for their hard work hearing public submissions and considering the detail of the bill," Mr Cunliffe said.

"The committee's proposed amendments have been made public in its report. The government will consider the recommendations before deciding on the next step in the progress of this bill."

The bill was introduced to Parliament on June 29. It implements the Labour-led government's pledge to deliver faster, better broadband Internet access, as unveiled in the pre-budget telecommunications stocktake package announced on May 3.

A PDF file of the report and the bill as reported back from the select committee are available on the [New Zealand Parliament](http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/9880C157-E3E2-413C-9DC1-EB2A98B8BE5E/47606/DBSCH_SCR_3592_3977.pdf) website.
