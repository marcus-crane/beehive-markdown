Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Denisov today signed an arrangement for the two countries' foreign ministries to hold expert consultations.

Mr Peters and Mr Denisov are both in Hanoi for the APEC Ministerial Meeting.

The arrangement follows a proposal made to Mr Peters by his counterpart Sergei Lavrov during Mr Peters' visit to Moscow in April.

"At a time when Russia is actively increasing its bilateral engagement internationally, this arrangement will help keep New Zealand on its radar screen," Mr Peters said.

"It secures access to Russian officials for our diplomats and provides a framework for regular consultation between officials.

"It also encourages our respective multilateral missions in New York, Vienna and Geneva to hold regular consultations, and our diplomatic missions in third countries to consult on foreign policy issues.

"New Zealand's relationship with Russia is continuing to develop. Russia is becoming an important player on the international stage and its views on a number of issues, such as disarmament, regional security, and the environment are important to us. This consultation agreement will ensure we are able to discuss such issues in greater depth."

Earlier in the day, Mr Peters also signed a double taxation agreement with Mexico.

Such agreements are designed to share the cost of relieving double taxation, provide greater certainty on tax treatment, lower taxes on certain income, and reduce compliance costs for some short-term activities.
