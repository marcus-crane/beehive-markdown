Police Minister Annette King has launched the Single Non-Emergency Number demonstration project, saying it has the potential to provide a significant new police service for New Zealanders.

The SNEN demonstration project, which went officially live today after bedding in for the past week, is being trialled in Auckland and Bay of Plenty, with a full evaluation scheduled to begin in July next year.

Ms King, who announced the “go live” at the Northern Communications Centre in Auckland, says she hopes the evaluation will show that a SNEN, one of the most important recommendations to emerge from the Independent External Review Panel that reviewed Police Communications Centres last year, is viable in New Zealand, and that the service will be able to be rolled out nationwide.

“The Government has certainly committed to the demonstration project with that eventual aim of a national SNEN firmly in mind. This year’s Budget allocated $3.5 million a year in ongoing funding for the demonstration, as well as $850,000 capital spending per year for the first three years to cover capital costs for the project.

“A nationwide SNEN has the potential to take pressure off the 111 service, to provide a far better resource for the police, and a far better service to the public, whose safety is the paramount consideration in this whole exercise.”

Ms King said two stories emerging from the first “unofficial” week of calls showed how versatile the SNEN could become. “One call came in this week from a Cantonese speaker, who wanted to report that his car had been stolen. He was able to speak to a Cantonese-speaking Community Service Advisors and give her full details about what had happened. On the same day, one of our Mandarin speakers was also able to take a burglary complaint.

“Both callers were very impressed with the service they received, and so am I. I think it's tremendous. I want to congratulate the NZ Police team who have nurtured the demonstration project to this stage, and I will be keenly awaiting the full evaluation of the project.”
