Minister of Corrections Damien O’Connor today emphasised the important role prisoner employment and training has to play in reducing re-offending rates.

Mr O’Connor was speaking at a graduation ceremony for prisoners at Rolleston Prison. He said providing employment gives prisoners work skills, training and the chance to gain formal qualifications to help them find work on release from prison.

Mr O'Connor said the Prisoner Employment Strategy, launched in May, aims to increase the number of prisoners in work from 40 per cent of the population to 60 per cent by June 2008. It will also significantly lift the number of NZQA units achieved.

“Most prisoners have limited education or work experience. In fact, half of all prisoners are not in work before entering prison.

“Providing prisoners with real skills and experience increases the chances of them finding work on release, which has a positive effect on re-offending rates and results in fewer victims and a lower financial cost to society.

“The four prisoners graduating today are a good example of the strategy in action. These prisoners were provided employment and training at the prison’s nursery and they have now earned a Level 2 National Certificate in Agriculture.

“This type of training and employment can only be of benefit, to the prisoner, businesses and the community. However, we cannot do this alone and greater community cooperation and assistance is needed to provide even more employment opportunities for prisoners.”

Key points of the Prisoner Employment Strategy include:  
·Aligning prisoner employment activities with the needs of local employers,  
·Developing a partnership with industry and industry-training organisations,  
·Ensuring prison-run businesses fulfil social as well as commercial purposes,  
·Working with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) on post-release reintegration,  
·Expanding the Release to Work programme.

The types of industries that are expected to have greater involvement include: plant nurseries, forestry, farming, light engineering, construction, textiles and timber processing.
