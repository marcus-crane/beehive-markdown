Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus) will be awarded to those who were involved in the recovery, investigation, and identification operation following the Erebus air disaster.

Today, 28 November, is the 27th anniversary of the disaster.

Helen Clark said that the medal will be awarded to an initial group of 133 police and other personnel who took part in the response to the tragedy of [the crash of Air New Zealand flight TE 901 on Mt Erebus](http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/respondingtotragedy-erebus), Ross Island, Antarctica, on 28 November 1979, with the loss of all 257 on board.

“The crash of flight TE 901 was without question the bleakest moment in the history of New Zealand’s fifty year presence in Antarctica. The work of those involved in what was called Operation Overdue was critical in supporting the victims' families and helping our nation come to terms with the tragic deaths of so many people.

"The recovery team at the crash site consisted of experienced Search and Rescue personnel, including police and Federated Mountain Club members, together with support personnel. Victims recovered from the crash site were flown to Auckland for identification by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police.

Helen Clark said that until the Government had instituted the NZSSM in 2002 there was not a suitable way of recognizing the extraordinary service of those involved in Operation Overdue.

This new medal recognises service or work for New Zealand in very difficult, adverse, extreme, or hazardous circumstances which falls outside the boundaries of what individuals could normally expect as part of their routine duties or work. A Special Service Medal was [last awarded in 2005](http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/f5/f5b.html) to recognise New Zealanders who were involved in rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts in areas devastated by the Boxing Day 2004 earthquake and tsunami.

“The work of personnel involved at Mt Erebus far exceeded the boundaries of what could be expected in the course of normal police, search and rescue, or air accident investigation duties. The circumstances were extreme: a hazardous physical location, extreme climatic conditions, dangers presented by the wreckage, the psychological strain of recovering the victims, and highly demanding physical work,” Helen Clark said.

“This medal also recognises the unique psychological risks faced by those who worked to identify successfully 214 of the 257 victims. The identification team’s complex work was exhaustive and painstaking. It was undertaken in harrowing circumstances well outside the boundaries of what would normally be expected in the course of routine duties.

Police Minister Annette King said a small number of medal recipients are still serving with the NZ Police.

"They include Sergeant David Templeton who worked with the disaster victim identification teams in Auckland, and who was recently awarded the [New Zealand Bravery Decoration](http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/d/d6.html). Southern District Commander Superintendent George Fraser also worked in the Auckland Mortuary.

“Additional former police personnel and civilians will also be eligible for the medal. Available records have not enabled us to identify everyone involved with Operation Overdue. The Government would like other eligible people, or the families of any eligible Operation Overdue personnel who have since died, to make an application for the medal," Annette King said.

Defence Minister Phil Goff said the NZSSM (Erebus) will be administered by the New Zealand Defence Force, on behalf of the NZ Police.
