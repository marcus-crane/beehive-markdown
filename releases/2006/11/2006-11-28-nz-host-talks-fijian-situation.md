Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today that Fijian Prime Minister Qarase and Military Commander Bainimarama will be holding talks in New Zealand tomorrow.

“The Fijian Prime Minister Qarase and Military Commander Bainimarama have agreed to meet in New Zealand on Wednesday,” said Helen Clark and Winston Peters.

“Prime Minister Qarase will travel to New Zealand on an RNZAF Boeing later today. Commodore Bainimarama has agreed to delay his return to Fiji in order to meet with Fiji Prime Minister in Wellington.

"New Zealand has been concerned for sometime at the escalating tensions between the Fijian Government and military. Our efforts over the last few days have been directed towards encouraging direct dialogue between the Fijian Government and military."

"We are delighted that both the Prime Minister and the Commodore have agreed to meet face-to-face. There are difficult and long-standing issues between the Fijian Government and military, but it is positive that the parties have agreed to meet.

"The nature of any outcome from the meeting is, of course, up to the two parties. However the immediate economic and social future of Fiji depends on the result."

The discussions will take place at Government House in Wellington. Winston Peters will attend.
