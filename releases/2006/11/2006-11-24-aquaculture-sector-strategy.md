Minister of Fisheries Jim Anderton congratulates the aquaculture industry on its appointment of a CEO for the recently established New Zealand Aquaculture Ltd.

“The appointment of Mike Burrell to head New Zealand’s aquaculture sector body is an important step in delivering the sector’s Aquaculture Strategy - a vision that will drive New Zealand’s aquaculture growth,” Jim Anderton said today.

“Aquaculture is a valuable industry, and is already worth $325 million a year to the New Zealand economy. I believe there is enormous potential for this to become a sustainable industry worth a billion-dollars a year to New Zealand.”

“The Government supports the aims of the New Zealand Aquaculture Strategy, released in June 2006. The strategy’s goal is to grow the industry to $1 billion a year by the year 2025.

“The Government is currently working with industry and other stakeholders to help achieve this goal.

“The Government will announce what actions it will be taking to directly support the industry’s sector strategy early next year.”
