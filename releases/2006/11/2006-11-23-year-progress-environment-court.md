Courts Minister Rick Barker tabled the Report of the Registrar of the Environment Court in Parliament today.

"During the year 913 matters were filed with the Environment Court, 1158 cases were disposed, and 1374 were awaiting hearing. This represents the lowest number of cases outstanding since 1995", said Rick Barker.

"To reduce delays the Labour-led Government has almost doubled Environment Court funding since 1999/2000, invested in extra judicial and administrative support, introduced a new case management system, and rolled out electronic evidence recording and transcription services. Greater use has also been made of mediation services to resolve matters without the need for formal hearings.

"While there is always scope for improvement, it is pleasing to see that great progress has been made," said Rick Barker.
