ACC Minister Ruth Dyson and New Zealand First Deputy Leader Peter Brown today announced details of a review of the way physiotherapy services are funded and accredited.

"The confidence and supply agreement between the Labour-led government and New Zealand First includes a review of the way in which physiotherapy services are funded and accredited. This announcement progresses that commitment," said Ruth Dyson.

"The review will also consider the rehabilitation outcomes of ACC claimants receiving necessary and appropriate physiotherapy services."

Peter Brown said he and Ruth Dyson were pleased to announce the appointment of Bill Wilson, QC as the Independent Reviewer.

"Mr Wilson has extensive experience as a lawyer and has undertaken the other reviews including ACC Regulations (1994) and Tranz Rail Safety (2000).

"The progress of the Review will be monitored through regular reporting to the Minister for ACC, in consultation with myself. A final report is expected by September 2007," said Mr Brown.

In summary the review will look at:  
a. ACC payments to physiotherapists. The level of payment under regulations specifically, and the effect of payment relativities between regulation and contract generally, on the sustainability of physiotherapy services;  
b. The endorsed provider network (EPN). Concern about certification and associated compliance costs with EPN;  
c. Culture of ACC/audits. Perceived inappropriate culture and attitude by ACC towards physiotherapists; and  
d. The Physiotherapy profession generally. The general sustainability of the physiotherapy profession within New Zealand and ACC's role in maintaining a sustainable physiotherapy sector.

[Draft terms of reference for the review](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/PhysiodraftTOR.doc) will be given to physiotherapy groups for their input and feedback before being finalised.
