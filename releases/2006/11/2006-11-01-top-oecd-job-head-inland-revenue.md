Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the appointment of Inland Revenue chief executive David Butler to a key position in the OECD.

The OECD has appointed Mr Butler as Head of Taxation Administration and Consumption Tax, based in Paris.

"It's a great tribute to David's skills and shows the high international regard that is held both for himself and Inland Revenue," said Dr Cullen.

He was appointed head of IRD in 2001 after a 25-year tax career in Australia and was recently re-appointed for another five-year term.

"David has done a sterling job and I have valued the high quality advice he has provided me on a range of complex tax issues.

"I am particularly grateful for his work on a number of the government's key reforms. He has contributed to the timely introduction of the Working for Families scheme and paid parental leave. His leadership is assisting the smooth introduction of interest free student loans and KiwiSaver. I have also greatly valued his work on the current Business Tax Review and proposed changes to investment tax rules.

"David has been at the forefront of measures to improve Inland Revenue's relationship with its customers. The department plays a vital role in our economy and the fair and efficient administration of tax rules is critical. Tax must be easy to comply with, but hard to avoid and David has done much to enhance Inland Revenue's credibility in this regard.

"He has also strengthened Inland Revenue's relationship with the Australian Taxation Office and established regular meetings between New Zealand and Australian Commissioners. This is important as more our businesses become trans-Tasman firms.

"I wish David well in the future and I am sure his experience in New Zealand will greatly assist the OECD in its tax policy work."
