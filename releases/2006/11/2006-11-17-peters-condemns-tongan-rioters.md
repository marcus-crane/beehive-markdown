Foreign Minister Winston Peters has condemned today's rioting and arson in the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa.

"Resorting to violence and arson in the name of democratic reform cannot be tolerated. It is straight out criminality," Mr Peters said.

"If you march in the cause of democratic reform yet resort to such lawless actions, you are demeaning your own cause, debasing the reputation of Tonga abroad and risking severe effects on Tonga's economy, particularly if it results in a slump in the tourism trade.

"Although no violence has been directed at foreigners, New Zealanders in Tonga are advised to avoid the downtown area of Nuku’alofa, to stay away from large gatherings, and to take advice from local authorities," Mr Peters said.
