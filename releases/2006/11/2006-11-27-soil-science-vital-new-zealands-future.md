“Soil science has a lot to contribute to the vision the government has for transforming the New Zealand economy,” said Murray Sherwin, the Director- General of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), speaking today on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton, at the opening of the Soils and Society 2006 conference held in Rotorua.

The contribution of agribusiness to New Zealand’s economy has risen from 14.2 per cent of GDP in 1986, to 17 per cent today. “Our primary industries are so important to our economy, and those land-based primary industries are dependent on our soil," Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealanders have always been good at growing raw products because of a moderate climate and ample pastoral land." But he cautioned that there was no room for complacency: “Other countries have sunshine and rainfall as well.

“Just as innovation in the nineteenth century set alight our primary industries, it has continued to fuel our future prosperity. But the most important innovation in New Zealand industry has come from our continued investment in science and research.”

The government is committed to investing in primary sector science because it sees it as critical to maintaining the competitive advantage of the country’s land-based industries. Mr Anderton said: “We can only continue to compete by moving up the value chain. Higher value production will result from our investment in science and innovation.”

He also talked of the importance of science in helping to meet one of today’s biggest challenges. “We will rely on science to deal with another issue of considerable importance to our land-based industries - climate change. All sectors have a role to play in climate change. But our land-based industries are in the front line because they are so very exposed to the risks and opportunities.”

The government believes agriculture, horticulture, cropping, and forestry, need more emphasis on sustainability. “We are custodians of our own future. There will be increasing opportunities for science in the area to develop solutions,” said Jim Anderton.
