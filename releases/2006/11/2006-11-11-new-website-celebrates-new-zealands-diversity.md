New Zealand’s richness of ethnic diversity is both showcased and supported in a new website launched today by Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter.

The website, www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz, has been developed by the Office of Ethnic Affairs to reflect the diversity of New Zealand’s multi-ethnic society and to provide a resource to individuals and communities.

“Today, around one-in-ten New Zealanders identify with ethnic groups other than Maori, Pacific Island, or Anglo-Celtic,” said Chris Carter. “Within fifteen years the figure will be almost one-in-five.

“New Zealand as a nation is enriched by the contribution of our many ethnic communities, but as we move forward we must keep talking with each other. This website provides a valuable tool to assist with that communication.

Mr Carter said the website contained a comprehensive directory of ethnic communities and their representatives.

“The number of contacts listed in this database illustrates the breadth of the cultural landscape of modern New Zealand. Making this information available online will enable communities to get in touch and share ideas.

“The website also collates for the first time the wide range of services and support available to ethnic communities offered by the Office of Ethnic Affairs and by other Government agencies," Mr Carter said.

“The Labour-led Government established the Office of Ethnic Affairs with the purpose of encouraging and promoting the strength that ethnic diversity offers New Zealand. The new website is a further step towards achieving that goal.”
