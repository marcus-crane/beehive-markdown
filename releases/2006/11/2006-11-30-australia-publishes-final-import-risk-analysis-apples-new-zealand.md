Trade Minister Phil Goff and Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton have noted the publication of Biosecurity Australia’s Final Import Risk Analysis (IRA) for New Zealand apples today.

“We have been waiting a long time for this document and Ministers have taken every opportunity to impress on Australia the importance attached to this issue. At last they are nearing the end of a protracted process.

However, we are extremely disappointed that the conditions for access do not appear to have materially changed despite New Zealand’s substantive submission on the earlier draft. We provided extensive scientific analysis in support of our argument that no risk mitigation measures should be necessary for our apples”, the Ministers said.

"This will not be acceptable to the New Zealand apple industry as, on first reading, it does not give us the access we hoped for," Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton said.

The Final IRA recommends that imports be allowed under extensive conditions, to all states except Western Australia. Previously, a total ban had been imposed on the grounds that apples might transmit the plant disease fire blight.

“After 84 years, while the total ban on New Zealand apples appears to be on the brink of being overturned, extensive conditions will be imposed on access. We will be assessing this 600-page document very carefully. The devil will be in the detail and we will examine the conditions and the science behind them very carefully.

“Working closely with industry, we will also need to determine exactly what is required to meet the conditions for access. This will enable the Government to make sound and robust decisions on our next steps. No options have been ruled out including taking the case to the WTO,” the Ministers said.

The release of the Final IRA is a further step towards finally getting New Zealand apples accepted for import into Australia. The next step in the process, following any appeal, is for the Australian Government to issue a policy determination on access for New Zealand apples.
