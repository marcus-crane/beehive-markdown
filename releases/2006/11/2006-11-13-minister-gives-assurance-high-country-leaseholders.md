Land Information minister David Parker today welcomed moves from high country pastoral leaseholders to go to court to clarify the principles to be applied to valuations when setting high country rents.

Following the release of the Armstrong Report and the preliminary government response to it, some leaseholders have questioned the Crown's approach to valuation for rent setting, and suggested that it be resolved through a judicial determination.

David Parker said leaseholders have also sought an undertaking that the government would not legislate to overrule the outcome of a judicial determination.

"I have today given high country leaseholders such an undertaking and confirmed that the Government will abide by the decision the courts make."

"LINZ officials are meeting with leaseholder representatives again in December, by which date I expect that LINZ and the leaseholders will be in a position to agree on the process for applying to the court," David Parker said.
