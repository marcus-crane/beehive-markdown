Attorney-General Dr Michael Cullen, together with the Chief Justice, announced today that an appointment round for Queen’s Counsel would take place in 2007.

Changes to the process for the appointment of Queen’s Counsel are included in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. Those changes are to take effect in July 2008, including the change of name from Queen’s Counsel to Senior Counsel.

Applications for appointment as Queen’s Counsel should be sent to the Solicitor-General no later than 28 February 2007 in accordance with the Practice Note, dated 12 August 1991 (published in LawTalk (2 September 1991).
