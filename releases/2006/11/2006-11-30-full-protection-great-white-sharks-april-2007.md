White pointer sharks will be fully protected within the 200 nautical miles of water around New Zealand, and from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats further a field, the Ministers of Conservation and Fisheries announced today.

The species, also known as the great white shark, will be protected under The Wildlife Act meaning it will be illegal to hunt, kill or harm a white pointer shark within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ – 200 nautical mile limit around NZ). It will also be illegal in New Zealand to possess or trade in any part of a white pointer shark.

New Zealand is a signatory to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and has an obligation to prohibit the taking of white pointer sharks.

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said despite the white pointer’s reputation as an apex predator, it was vulnerable to fishing and becoming rarer throughout the world.

“These majestic animals occur naturally in low numbers and, without protection, could be pushed to the brink of extinction. The Wildlife Act provides a strong deterrent against targeting great whites with a $250,000 fine and up to six months imprisonment as a maximum penalty."

The species will be further protected on the high seas (outside the EEZ) under the Fisheries Act where New Zealand-flagged boats will be prohibited from taking white pointer sharks while fishing outside the EEZ.

However, provisions will be created to permit the continued use of shark nets to protect swimmers around beaches in Dunedin, and fishers accidentally catching and killing white pointers will not be prosecuted provided they register the death with authorities.

Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said the white pointer shark was not known to be targeted by commercial fishing but was occasionally taken, unintentionally, as by-catch.

Mr Anderton also said they were sometimes targeted by recreational fishers and there was some demand for jaws and teeth as fishing trophies. Others were unintentionally caught in set nets.

“No one wants to see an animal hunted to extinction for the sake of a jaw or a few teeth or to be placed under pressure by accidental catch. Under these new regulations no fisher will be able to profit from taking a white pointer, and any fisher inadvertently catching one will have to return it to the sea, intact, and alive, if possible,” Mr Anderton said.

The protection comes into effect in April 2007.
