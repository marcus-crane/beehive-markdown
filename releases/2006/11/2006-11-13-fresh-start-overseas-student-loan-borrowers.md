There will be a fresh start for those overseas with [student loans](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz./) under new rules unveiled by Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today.

"The changes introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill today are part and parcel of our aim to enhance the quality and lower the cost of tertiary education," said the Ministers.

"We want to improve the skills base of New Zealand by ensuring greater numbers of students have access to high quality tertiary education. This is essential if we are to transform New Zealand into a higher wage, knowledge-based economy.

"Interest-free student loans are a key part of improving access to tertiary education. However, it is clear the rules around overseas borrowers need to be improved as they discourage many from meeting their obligations and may deter some from coming home.

"We recognise that graduates want to travel overseas and gain valuable skills and experience and that repaying student loans during their OE can be difficult.

"However, we don't want them to accumulate an unmanageable debt in the process which ends up discouraging them from returning home and contributing to the economy. Therefore, we need a fresh start.

"The new rules will make it easier for students heading overseas to stay on top of their repayment obligations and give more breathing space for those who are overseas and are struggling with rising debt.

"The fact that interest-free loans are generally limited to borrowers living in New Zealand has increased financial incentives for borrowers to leave New Zealand without informing Inland Revenue because their loans would then attract interest.

"In future Inland Revenue will know when borrowers go overseas. A law change will allow data matching between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. This will ensure that only those entitled to interest-free loans have access to them.

"The data match is expected to reveal about 40,000 borrowers who are or have been non-resident and whose loan accounts will therefore have to be adjusted," said the Ministers.

**New rules for borrowers overseas from 1 April 2007**

Fresh start:

- The amnesty for non-resident borrowers in arrears will be extended to 31 March 2008. This means penalties will be wiped. If they apply for the amnesty and meet certain conditions, including making regular payments based on the new repayment rules for two years, their loan balance will not increase except for interest.

Making it easier to repay:

- There will be a repayment holiday for borrowers going overseas of up to three years, during which time they will not have to make repayments, although their loans will still attract interest. This also applies to those who have met the amnesty conditions.
- For all overseas borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday, their yearly repayment obligations will be based on the size of their loan balances. A borrower with a loan balance of $15,000 or less will be expected to repay a minimum of $1000 a year, a borrower with a loan of between $15,000 and $30,000 is expected to pay $2000 a year, over $30,000, the minimum repayment is $3000 a year. Repayments are currently based on 1/15th of the size of the loan.

Encouraging overseas study:

- Inland Revenue will be able to grant interest-free loans to undergraduates studying full-time overseas to bachelor’s degree level.

Other changes:

- Simplifying the rules that determine whether someone is a New Zealand borrower, and thus required to repay the loan on an income-contingent basis, or an overseas borrower, whose payment will be based on the size of the loan (see above).
- Fine tuning specific interest write-off rules to reflect the introduction of interest-free loans.
- Borrowers who had repaid their loans by 13 November 2006 and had an interest write-off to which they were not entitled will not have the write-off reversed.

Changes applying to all borrowers:

- The late payment penalty for all borrowers will reduce from 2.0 per cent per month to 1.5 per cent per month. The change will apply to amounts subject to a late payment penalty on or after 1 April 2007.
- Inland Revenue’s powers to grant hardship relief will be made more flexible by allowing it to suspend payments during the year for borrowers who apply for it.
