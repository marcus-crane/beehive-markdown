Minister of the primary industries sector, Jim Anderton has today sent out the latest issue of the newsletter *Primary News* to the farming community. In it he covers the importance of irrigation; labour supply in the primary sector; the enormous potential of aquaculture in New Zealand; the challenges posed by climate change; the importance of addressing issues of sustainable land management; the need to promote regional and bilateral free trade agreements; issues of animal welfare; and biosecurity.

Initiated earlier this year, Mr Anderton sees the newsletter as an important means of keeping in touch directly with the farming community, alongside his meetings with primary sector and industry representatives. He values the feed-back he has had and says that this two-way communication is vital in maintaining a positive relationship.

"Over the last few months I have been very impressed by some of the initiatives I've seen taken by the primary sector. And it's a reminder of the vital contribution it continues to make to the economy of New Zealand.

"Of course there are issues that we need to continue to address. A skilled labour force, sustainable land management and biosecurity are immediately obvious in this respect. Working positively together is the way to find solutions, which is why I value the direct contact I have with those who work in and for our primary sector industries.

"This newsletter is also timely in giving an overview of the issues of climate change, as they affect the farming community, and some of the initiatives the government is putting in place.

"We have innovative, world-class primary industries in New Zealand and, as Minister, I believe we can forge a successful partnership between this sector and the Labour-Progressive government to meet the challenges we all face," Jim Anderton said today.
