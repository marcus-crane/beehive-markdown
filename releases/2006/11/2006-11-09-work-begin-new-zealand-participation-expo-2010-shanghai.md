Trade Minister Phil Goff today announced that cabinet approval has been given for development work to start on New Zealand's participation in Expo 2010 to be held in Shanghai, China.

"Expo 2010 will be the largest world expo ever with the organisers aiming to secure 200 countries. The New Zealand contribution will be the largest New Zealand presence ever at a world expo", said Mr Goff.

"Organisers are projecting 70 million visitors to Expo 2010. This compares to 22 million at the last expo New Zealand participated in at Aichi, Japan in 2005 where the New Zealand pavilion attracted 18.3 percent of total visitors.

"The New Zealand pavilion at Expo 2010 will need to be double the size of that at Aichi to cope with as many as 14 million visitors through our pavilion. This will mean an area of at least 2000 square metres. The likely cost, to be met by contributions from government and the private sector, is between $25–30 million.

"Work will begin soon to secure a prime spot for the New Zealand pavilion within the Expo 2010 site, a substantial tract of prime river side land which represents one percent of all the urban land in Shanghai.

"The New Zealand Consul General in Shanghai, Wen Chin Powles has been appointed interim Commissioner General for the Expo and will be responsible for the management of all initial activities in Shanghai surrounding New Zealand's participation. She will be working with a team from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in New Zealand that worked successfully on the New Zealand pavilion at Aichi.

"A design will soon be selected for the New Zealand pavilion and we are determined to make this the most successful New Zealand participation yet in a world expo.

"The decision to come to Expo 2010 was based on the importance of our relationship with China and the success of New Zealand participation in the 2005 expo held in Aichi. Our goal will be to leverage the achievements and profile of New Zealand in what is one of the most dynamic and fastest growing and evolving markets in the world.

"New Zealand's commitment to Expo 2010 was announced in April during the visit to New Zealand of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to accept China's invitation to participate in Expo 2010.

"A tender process managed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will lead to the selection of a suitable design for a pavilion. Work on that design will begin in early 2007 with the aim being to complete construction in 2009", said Mr Goff.
