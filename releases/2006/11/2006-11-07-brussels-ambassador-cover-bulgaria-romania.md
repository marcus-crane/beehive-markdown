New Zealand’s Ambassador to the European Union, Wade Armstrong, will be accredited to Bulgaria and Romania, who will join the EU in January, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Mr Armstrong, who is resident in Brussels where the EU is based, is also currently Ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg.

“New Zealand will extend accreditation to Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria to ensure that our voice is heard in all member states of the European Union,” said Mr Peters, who noted that trade with Bulgaria and Romania was modest but expanding.

There is a small New Zealand population of Bulgarian and Romanian origin that migrated in the early 1950s.
