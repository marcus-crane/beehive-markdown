New Zealand is not short of water, but demands for freshwater are increasing. At a meeting with Canterbury farmers today, Jim Anderton, Minister for Agriculture, said that the rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands and groundwater systems are among this country's most valued natural assets, and he cautioned: "In many cases demand is exceeding the water available beyond what is sustainable. We need to make sure our scarce resources are used as efficiently as possible."

He went on to discuss the effects of climate change, noting that they were already in evidence, especially on the drier east coast. "Experts predict we will experience more variable rainfall in future. In other words, there will be more demand on storage and more times when we don't have enough water to meet all the demand."

The Labour-Progressive government has seen the need to work in partnership with water users - local government, industry, Maori, science agencies, and communities, both rural and urban.

"I'm pleased about the willingness sectors have shown to work through this process in a constructive and co-operative way," said the Minister. "The Sustainable Water Programme of Action is looking at how central government can help improve the management of New Zealand’s freshwater resources. "

A key challenge facing farmers is better irrigation efficiency. Regional councils are increasingly looking at whether water is allocated to the highest value use and whether farmers are irrigating efficiently. If there are competing applications for water, the one with the greatest benefit to the community and the environment will be given the allocation.

Mr Anderton said, "The gains from irrigation can be enormously beneficial - not only to farmers, but to communities and to the environment. I believe careful management will mean farmers have nothing to fear."

Emphasising careful management, the Minister cited an example of an Irrigation New Zealand project that was completed with the [Sustainable Farming Fund](http://www.maf.govt.nz/sff/). It found the profitability of irrigated agriculture is commonly lower than it should be. "So there is plenty of scope to improve the efficient use of water and energy in irrigation. We're left with two main options to increase the amount of usable water available: water storage and improved efficiency in our water use."

Financial support from the government is available through the Sustainable Farming Fund for feasibility studies. It has paid for twenty-one studies for community schemes over the last five years.

"The challenges are substantial. The gains are potentially substantial as well. Farmers have a lot to gain from participating in managing this resource better," said Mr Anderton.
