Trade Minister Phil Goff has launched a television documentary series in Beijing which will introduce New Zealand to a television audience estimated by China Central Television ultimately to be up to 300 million Chinese viewers.

"The documentary series, 'New Zealand Journeys' consists of five, one-hour episodes which explore aspects of New Zealand culture and society and provide a comprehensive overview of modern New Zealand seen from a Chinese perspective", said Mr Goff.

"The series has been developed and produced by internationally renowned Dunedin based film makers, Natural History New Zealand in collaboration with China Central Television (CCTV10) and with funding from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage through the Cultural Diplomacy International Programme.

"Natural History New Zealand worked closely with their Chinese colleagues on the production of this series, with the goal of ensuring the documentaries allow New Zealand to be seen through Chinese eyes.

"The five documentary themes are; New Zealand natural history, people, innovation, cinema and the links between New Zealand and China. The series portrays New Zealand as being an innovative and creative, cosmopolitan society with beautiful scenery, a clean and sustainable environment, a stable economy and a unique and colourful history.

"The documentary series began screening in China on Friday night on CCTV10 with subsequent screenings also on other channels. With tourism from China to New Zealand for the first time breaking the 100,000 mark, the TV documentaries will assist greatly in giving New Zealand a significantly higher profile.

"The launch this week of the direct air link between New Zealand and China, the new documentary series and New Zealand's largest ever business mission abroad have all helped to promote New Zealand in the increasingly important Chinese market", Mr Goff said.
