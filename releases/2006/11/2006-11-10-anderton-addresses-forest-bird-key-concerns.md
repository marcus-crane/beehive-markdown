Minster of all the primary industries, Jim Anderton addressed the Forest & Bird conference tonight and said that he had good news about progress on the issues their members were passionate about. He said that issues of sustainability and the environment were becoming core business everywhere.

"For many years environmentalists have been challenging industry about the sustainability of our way of life and protection of our natural environment.  
Our primary industries are also facing challenges from other directions. We need them to keep growing if we are going to enjoy a rising standard of living and even maintain the standards of education and healthcare our communities expect," Jim Anderton said.

"Consumers globally are demanding higher standards of environmental and social responsibility, and our producers are beginning to respond to this. The Labour-Progressive Government’s vision is for New Zealand to become to world’s leading sustainable food producer.

"We're seeing initiatives like the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord and more recently the Dairy and Environment Strategy. Meat and Wool New Zealand are also developing an environmental strategy.

"Earlier this year I had the pleasure of launching the FertMark Code of Practice for Fertiliser Use, and I note the firm Summitt Quinnphos are forecasting a thirty to forty percent reduction in fertiliser use from the adoption of nutrient budgeting. Within the horticulture sector, there are programmes for Sustainable Winegrowing in New Zealand and Integrated Pest Management in fruit production.

"Forestry is putting effort into independent certification for sustainable forestry practices. Half of our plantation forests and a third of the annual harvest are already third-party certified.

"These examples matter because agriculture and forestry use fifty-two percent of our land area and more than three quarters of our fresh water. Every-day decisions made by farmers, horticulturalists and foresters have a real effect on our environment.

"In recognising where we are going, I want to also pay tribute to the partnership approach making the new direction possible. Farmers are working with environment groups. Fishing companies are working with communities and with Forest and Bird. Foresters are working with local government and each other. I want to praise Forest & Bird's constructive role in the partnership as well, and encourage more of it.

"I encourage you to take a moment to reflect what an achievement it is for environmentalists who belong to Forest & Bird how far we have come. I've been round social activist groups most of my life and I know there is always a temptation to demand more and better. But it's also worth pausing to reflect and celebrate our achievements. And the direction of all New Zealand's primary industry should make you feel very confident about our future," Jim Anderton said.
