Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard today released the latest annual reports of the Adjudicators of the two Auckland-based Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal Tribunals (MVDT).

“These reports provide the MVDT Adjudicators with an opportunity to give me feedback on how well they see the disputes resolution system is working for both consumers and traders,” says Judith Tizard.

"Overall, the reports show that the system is working well for consumers, with almost 60% of the cases heard by these two tribunals being found in favour of the consumer."

Adjudicators can also make recommendations for amendments to the Motor Vehicle Sales Act that they consider to be desirable, based on their experience.

“Most of the issues raised in the reports will be considered in the discussion paper on the Motor Vehicle Sales Act which is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. This follows on from the comprehensive Review of the Act which was released earlier this year.”

“I look forward to receiving feedback from adjudicators, traders and consumers early in the New Year once they have had the opportunity to consider the next discussion paper.”
