A strategic framework report released today at the Manufacturing Summit in Auckland is being welcomed by Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made Sue Bradford.

The strategic report was developed by businesses, unions and government representatives from the Manufacturing+ Vision Group, through a series of workshops and consultations over the past year.

Ms Bradford congratulated the report’s authors for highlighting the role of New Zealand manufacturing at the centre of economic development.

“I have taken note of the key findings of the report, particularly those findings that relate to the Buy Kiwi Made programme,” Ms Bradford says.

“While the report’s authors are concerned that the intrinsic value of manufacturing in New Zealand is yet to be fully realised, they point out that Buy Kiwi Made is a key programme in profiling New Zealand manufacturing, and that manufacturing is one industry with the potential to greaty increase its contribution to the country’s balance of payments.

“The report correctly highlights the need to retain and build on manufacturing in New Zealand to ensure that innovation capacity and product expertise are not lost.

“I look forward to developing close links between the Buy Kiwi Made programme and the Manufacturing+ initiative to retain the innovative potential of local manufacturing in New Zealand and build on the positive role the sector plays in our economy,” Ms Bradford says.
