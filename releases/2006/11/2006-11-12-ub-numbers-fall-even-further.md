October benefit figures show Unemployment Benefit numbers have fallen even further below the 40,000 threshold they broke earlier this year.

"A few months ago, Unemployment Benefit numbers fell below 40,000 for the first time since 1982," said Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope. "Now they've dropped a further thousand, to 39,001.

"Over the past year, Unemployment Benefit numbers have fallen 9,938, Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers have fallen 5,489, and overall benefit numbers have fallen 11,368.

"This is excellent news for all the New Zealanders who've moved into work, for their families, and for the businesses who are seeking workers to help their growth. It's also good news for other benefit clients, such as sole parents and people with ill health or a disability, who now have access to employment support that traditionally hasn't been provided to them," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"The Labour-led Government is continuing to drive down benefit numbers through policies that support people into work, and services that meet their needs. We have a vision for New Zealand that is about more than just tax cuts," he said.

"Through [Working New Zealand](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27504), we're continuing to reform the benefit system so everyone who can work is supported to work," he said. "These latest figures confirm that we're right to focus on what people can do, rather than any perceived limitations."
