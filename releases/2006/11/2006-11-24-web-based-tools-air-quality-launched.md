To the uninitiated, Straight or Curved Line Paths, PM10 concentrations, and gazetted airsheds may sound like the stuff of a science fiction novel.

In fact, they're tools for managing air quality, and have been joined by a new application: interactive, web-based air maps, for regions to track their progress towards meeting national air quality standards.

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said the interactive, web-based air maps would provide a visual comparison of air quality across regions.

"The air quality standard for PM10 is 50 microgrammes per cubic metre over 24 hours," Mr Benson-Pope said. "Councils have set annual targets to reduce smoke and soot levels in selected sites called airsheds, and to meet the PM10 standard by 2013.

"The air maps will help them to see how well they're doing, especially in gazetted airsheds where the PM10 standard has been exceeded twice or more in a year."

Mr Benson-Pope also welcomed the news that some airsheds had upgraded their monitoring equipment, making future data much more complete. "Straight or Curved Line Paths in regional plans set out the targets for reducing air pollution," he said. "Consistent, quality monitoring is the way to ensure those targets are met."

Mr Benson-Pope said that reducing PM10 levels in New Zealand's air was first and foremost about health. "Poor air quality is responsible for respiratory diseases, asthma attacks, reduced immunity, and premature death.

"There's no reason for anyone in New Zealand to have to put up with unhealthy air. Initiatives like the government's Warm Homes project, new standards for wood burners, and our work to support regional government, are contributing to better air for us all," he said.
