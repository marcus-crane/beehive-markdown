National's arrangement to get out of its election spending pickle is just the kind of slippery behaviour we have come to expect, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"It should front up, pay up and suffer the consequences of its mistake.

"Instead National has employed expensive lawyers to find a way to weasel its way out of the GST blunder. And it expects the broadcasters to come to the party by providing advertising space.

"Most ordinary, hard working New Zealanders own up to their mistakes and pay their fines when they break the law.

"This deal means National gets off scot-free. It doesn't change the fact that it broke the law and received advertising it wasn't entitled to.

"At a time when National is mired in allegations about unethical behaviour, I am amazed it chose today to make the GST announcement," said Dr Cullen.
