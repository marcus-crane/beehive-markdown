New Zealand's biggest industry of the future will be a sustainable one, a high-level group of tourism sector figures have agreed.

The consensus emerged from a wide group of tourism leaders from business, local and central government and the conservation sector, which met yesterday in Wellington for the third meeting of the Ministerial Advisory Group overseeing the update of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 ([NZTS 2010](http://nztourismstrategy.com/)).

The group considered the outcome of a broad consultation over the past two months across the tourism sector. Members of the group focused on outcomes for the wider industry and New Zealand as a whole.

Minister of Tourism Damien O'Connor said tourism is likely to be New Zealand's largest and most important industry in the future, but must be developed in a way that continues to protect the environment, communities, visitors' quality of experience, and the industry's profit expectations.

"We know what we have to do to grow the industry so that it reaches its full potential, and we will be fine-tuning our approach over coming months. A key element of the strategy is for New Zealand to lead the world in our commitment to sustainability."

Tourism is already one of New Zealand's most valuable industries, with total tourism expenditure by domestic and international visitors reaching $17.5 billion in the year ended March 2005.

Strategy Director Geoff Burns said the meeting was incredibly positive.

"Despite coming from widely differing sectors and backgrounds the group reached consensus on key issues and directions.

“We believe we are at a breakthrough point in the development of New Zealand tourism.

“There is broad agreement tourism will be the industry of New Zealand’s future - delivering benefits to communities, the environment and to the wider New Zealand economy. The Strategy will be the blueprint for delivering that vision.

"Tourism will have a greater voice in this country’s future."

Mr Burns said significant agreement on key directions has been reached and will be expanded on in the development of the Strategy.

“New Zealand is a small country and most of our international visitors have to travel a great distance to get here. We believe that with careful management these features can be turned into a positive - building on the strong conservation and community values intrinsic to New Zealanders. We will be an example to the rest of the world in sustainability and environmental management,” he said.

Issues that will feature in the Strategy include:

- **Growing tourism** while protecting and enhancing the environment, communities, quality of our visitors’ experiences.
- **Global market share** – building New Zealand’s profile in the fiercely competitive international market through identifying and maximising marketing opportunities and channels.
- The **role of local government** in destination management – how local government shapes a visitor’s experience to a region through its business policies and through the provision of services and planning decisions.
- **Research** – including how and what priorities should be set for industry research.
- **Quality** – building the industry to world-class standards and supporting the role of Qualmark, the industry’s state of the art quality endorsement agency.
- **Product development** including opportunities for new business, and the key role Maori play in New Zealand tourism.
- **Domestic tourism** – currently accounts for more than half of all visitors in the industry and is crucial to continued success.

Strategy Director Geoff Burns said tourism provides an opportunity to build **quality of life for all New Zealanders**.

"Based on the spirit of today’s meeting the Strategy will gain co-operation across the sector and in partnership with central, local and regional governments."

Next steps include developing a draft for comment from industry, central and local governments by late February. The final Tourism Strategy 2010 update will be released in May 2007.

The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 update is a private and public sector initiative to plan for the future of New Zealand tourism. A secretariat of the Tourism Industry Assn, Ministry of Tourism and Tourism NZ is managing the development of the strategy/project to update the NZ Tourism Strategy 2010.
