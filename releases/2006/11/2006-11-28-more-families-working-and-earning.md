More than a quarter of a million families are getting more money every week, thanks to low unemployment and [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz/).

Visiting the Under the Canopies – Strong Pacific Families expo in Porirua today, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said the government had exceeded this year's target for the number of families getting tax credits through Working for Families.

"We aimed to reach 260,000 families; the total stands at 270,000," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Since Working for Families was introduced in October 2004, the number of working families getting tax credits from Inland Revenue has increased by 101,000.

"As just one example, a family earning $36,000 a year and with four young children could now be better off by around $200 a week.

"A good labour market and low unemployment is supporting parents to move off benefit and into paid work," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"Between September 2004, just before Working for Families was introduced, and September 2006, Unemployment Benefit numbers fell by 24,700, and Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers fell by 8,400.

"These figures add up to more people working, and more people getting tax credits through Working for Families. I encourage all families to freephone 0800 227 773, or visit the website www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz, to find out if they're entitled to tax credits.

"When Working for Families is fully implemented in April next year, around 360,000 families will benefit. Meanwhile, these latest figures mean good news for Christmas for over a quarter of a million hard-working Kiwi Mums and Dads and their children," Mr Benson-Pope said.
