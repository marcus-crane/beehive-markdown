The APRA Silver Scroll Awards are a time to celebrate New Zealand's incredibly creative and talented songwriters says Associate Arts Culture & Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

"My warmest congratulations to Don McGlashan who won this year's Silver Scroll Award for the song ‘Bathe in the River’ at the awards last night," says Judith Tizard. "It's a beautiful gospel-style song written for the New Zealand movie, No.2."

"My warm congratulations to all the finalists – it's a huge achievement to make it to the finals given the abundance of home-grown talent.

"I also wish to applaud the category winners:

§SOUNZ Contemporary Award recognising creative excellence by a New Zealand classical composer was awarded to Ross Harris for ‘Symphony No.2’;

§APRA Maioha Award for the best Maori waiata was awarded to Richard Bennett for ‘E Hine’;

§Most performed work in New Zealand was awarded to James Reid for ‘Stand Up’;

§Most performed work overseas was awarded to Neil Finn for ‘Don’t Dream it’s Over’.

"These songs are truly 'Made in New Zealand' - the fresh, innovative and uniquely New Zealand sounds reflect who we are and where we have come from. They brand us as being something special around the world.

"I am incredibly proud of our home-grown talent. New Zealand music is in very good hands."
