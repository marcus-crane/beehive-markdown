The members of a special tribunal to consider an application from NZ Fish and Game for a water conservation order on the Oreti River have been announced today by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

“I have appointed three experienced people who bring a range of skills and expertise in RMA hearing procedures to consider the application,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“Dr Brent Cowie from Christchurch will serve as the chair of the special tribunal. Dr Cowie is an environmental consultant with extensive experience in water management and an experienced hearings commissioner.

“The other members are Dr Gail Tipa, a resource management consultant from Dunedin who has knowledge of the cultural issues around the use of water, and Dr Paul Blaschke, a consultant ecologist from Wellington,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

NZ Fish and Game seek protection of the main stem of the Oreti River upstream of Mossburn, specified tributaries and connected groundwater. They want recognition of the natural values of the river, its angling value and trout and wildlife habitats.

Fish and Game are also seeking protection of the main stem of the Oreti River from Mossburn to Wallacetown for the contribution it makes to the angling and fishery values upstream.

The public will be invited to make submissions to the tribunal. The tribunal will then hold a hearing and provide a report to the Minister for the Environment that makes recommendations about whether the application for a water conservation order on the Oreti River should be granted.
