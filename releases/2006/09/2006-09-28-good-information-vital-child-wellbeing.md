Acting Minister for Social Development and Employment, Ruth Dyson, has welcomed Save the Children’s acknowledgement that effective outcomes in child welfare start with quality, comprehensive data.

"Good information is a vital tool in achieving positive outcomes in child welfare."

"In 2004, the Ministry of Social Development produced a comprehensive report covering all dimensions of child welfare. The Ministry has advised me that consideration is currently being given to publishing the report on a regular basis."

The report, [Children and Young People: Indicators of Wellbeing in New Zealand](http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/work-areas/csre/children-young-people-indicators-wellbeing-nz.pdf) covered areas such as health, care and support, economic security, safety, education, civil rights, justice, culture and identity, social connectedness and environment.

"In addition to the 2004 report, the Ministry of Social Development's annual [Social Report](http://www.socialreport.msd.govt.nz/) is constantly being developed and refined to provide the most relevant and accurate information about New Zealanders and how we live."

Ms Dyson says the Ministry is also considering utilising the Social Report to increase the regularity of published child welfare data.

"But care must be taken that data isn’t being gathered so regularly that it risks misrepresenting the truth of the situation; many trends only become apparent over a long period of time."

"The Labour-led government’s focus is firmly on fighting poverty and Working for Families aims to improve adequate incomes for families with children and to make work pay. By the time it is fully in place it is expected to result in a 30% reduction in child poverty."
