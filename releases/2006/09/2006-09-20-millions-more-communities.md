The record $138.5 million transferred to the Lottery Grants Board by New Zealand Lotteries in 2005/2006 will help strengthen communities from Kaitaia to Bluff, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today.

“Not only is this the largest amount that New Zealand Lotteries has transferred to the Lottery Grants Board in their 19-year history, but it is a whopping $24.5 million more than was budgeted," said Rick Barker.

"New Zealand Lotteries profits are a major source of funding for Creative New Zealand, Sport and Recreation New Zealand and the New Zealand Film Commission. In addition more than 3,400 community organisations and projects receive lottery grants each year.

“The work these organisations do strengthens the fabric of society and this additional funding means these organisations can do even more,” said Rick Barker.

"Lottery Grants benefit a diverse range of projects and organisations, from bowling clubs to botanical gardens; museums to maternity services. The extra funding means even more kiwis will now have links with the many different organisations that receive lottery grants.

"Since New Zealand Lotteries began in 1987 over $2 billion has been transferred to the Grants Board for distribution to our communities, and our communities are more vibrant for it,” said Rick Barker.
