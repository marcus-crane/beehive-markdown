As this year’s Air New Zealand Fashion Week draws to a close Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the government is providing $600,000 to the event over three years.

"The Labour-led government has worked with Fashion Week organisers since the event’s inception to ensure its success. This latest funding of $200,000 a year for three years comes on top of over $1 million of government financial support in the last five years, as well as significant marketing collateral and in-market assistance," Trevor Mallard said.

"Fashion Week is a tremendous event that allows New Zealand designers to showcase their work in front of hundreds of international and local buyers and media representatives.

"It also gives a massive boost to the Auckland economy, with recent research suggesting the event is worth almost $30 million to the Auckland economy."

The funding will be used to bring strategically targeted buyers and media to the event for the three years to 2008/09, and to develop a public day.

"Fashion is an important industry for New Zealand. It offers the opportunity to show the world we can deliver cutting edge creativity. Our fashion designers are indicative of a new breed of confident, outward-looking New Zealand business people that are successfully taking on the challenge of doing business in a rapidly changing world environment.

"Fashion Week epitomises the creativity, passion and drive that are so vital to New Zealand’s economic transformation into an export-led, high wage and innovative economy."

"In addition to supporting the New Zealand Fashion Week, the government also works with fashion export companies and helps them get face to face meetings with key international buyers and media at offshore fashion week events.

"Having an in-market presence at these fashion weeks increases these companies’ access to buyers, media, stylists and influencers from around the world and also allows potential cross leveraging of other export sectors such as entertainment, music, and food and beverages," Trevor Mallard said.

Background: The funding comes from the Regional and Industry Development Fund, a grant scheme administered by the Ministry of Economic Development.
