National Party law and order spokesman Simon Power does not understand the processes around transporting young prisoners, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

"Simon Power is attempting to make a big issue out of the information that is contained on the assessment forms which accompany prisoners to and from court appearances.

"What he doesn't appear to know, but would know if he had done his research, is that the age of a prisoner being transported is always provided in accompanying documents.

"I have already acted to ensure that those under 18 years of age do not travel in the same compartment of a van as prisoners over 18, until the investigations into the death of Liam Ashley are complete. I issued this directive to the department on Monday 28th of August.

"And I will not hesitate to instruct further changes to be made should gaps in the transfer process be brought to light during the subsequent investigations. The department is fully behind this approach."
