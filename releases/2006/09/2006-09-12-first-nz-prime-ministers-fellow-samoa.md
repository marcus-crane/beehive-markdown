Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the first New Zealand Prime Minister’s Fellow from Samoa.

The first fellow is Ms Laeimau Oketevi Tanuvasa, currently the Chief Executive Officer of Computer Services Limited, a Samoan information technology and communications company. She is also involved in a number of business forums in Samoa, and is president of the Samoan Association of Women Graduates.

The fellowship was established under a programme agreed last year by Helen Clark and Samoa’s Prime Minister, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.

The programme will operate in a similar manner to New Zealand’s fellowship programmes with other countries, such as Japan and Korea. Each year, a Fellow will be nominated by the Government of Samoa for consideration and final approval by the Prime Minister of New Zealand.

Once selected, the Fellow will visit New Zealand for up to one week to meet with key figures in New Zealand. The New Zealand Government will pay for the visit.

“The fellowship programme reflects the close ties between New Zealand and Samoa and was agreed as one of a number of initiatives to strengthen the Treaty of Friendship between our two countries,” Helen Clark said.

“The aims of the fellowship scheme are to enhance understanding of the bilateral relationship among potential leaders in both countries, to develop personal relationships, to create opportunities for dialogue and enhance bilateral cooperation, and to promote the bilateral relationship.”

Ms Oketevi will today meet with Prime Minister Helen Clark. She is in New Zealand for the week, and is undertaking a programme of business and government-related calls in Christchurch and Wellington, meeting with both private and public sector representatives in the information, communication, and technology sectors.
