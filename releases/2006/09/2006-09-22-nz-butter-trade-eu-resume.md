“New Zealand will accept a proposal that the European Commission has been developing, dealing with the balance of New Zealand butter exports to the European Union under the 2006 quota”, Trade Negotiations Minister, Phil Goff, said today.

“The European Commission has been consulting with New Zealand officials on the details of the proposal to ensure that this year’s quota can be filled.”

The Commission’s proposal has also been discussed with representatives of European Union countries this week.

“We expect the proposal to be put to European Commissioners in the middle of next week for their approval, and that the Commission will then move quickly to implement it”, the Minister said.

“If it proceeds in its current form, we will accept this proposal, but I am concerned that, despite intensive consultations, we have still not made progress towards finding a solution for next year’s butter imports.”

“This longer-term solution needs to meet the terms of the recent European Court of Justice ruling, but also needs to be consistent with the EU’s long established commitments to New Zealand.”

“I have spoken to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Mariann Fischer Boel, again this week and impressed upon her that, while we acknowledge the European legal ruling, we must also find a solution that ensures that New Zealand is no worse off as a result of the changes they must make to their regulations,” Mr Goff said.
