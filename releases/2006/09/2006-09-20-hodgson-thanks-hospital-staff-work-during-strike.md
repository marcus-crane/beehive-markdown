Health Minister Pete Hodgson has today thanked staff working in seven district health boards for their efforts to work through a strike by radiographers.

A three day strike in seven DHBs last week is being followed by two one day strikes in six DHBs this week. While all public hospitals have coped well, DHBs faced their busiest day yesterday and will be under significant pressure for at least the next 36 hours.

“It’s been a difficult week and a half for many of our DHBs, including a number of those not directly affected by the strike,” Pete Hodgson said.

“Our public hospitals are coping well because of the hard work and dedication of staff. They have my thanks for their efforts.

“I would also like to thank the public for their efforts in continuing to see their family doctor instead of presenting at the hospital whenever possible. While people should always make sure they cannot be seen in a primary care setting before going to the hospital, this has been especially important during the strike and will be until all radiographers are back at work.”

Pete Hodgson has welcomed news that talks between the radiographers’ union and DHBs will resume next week and hopes an agreement can be reached as soon as possible.
