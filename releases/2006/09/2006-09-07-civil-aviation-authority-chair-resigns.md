Transport Minister Annette King says that she has accepted the resignation of Civil Aviation Authority chair Ron Tannock.

Mr Tannock has been a member of the Authority since 2003 and was appointed Chairperson in 2004. Mr Tannock is a Chartered Engineer and a Fellow of The Royal Aeronautical Society. Before joining the Authority he had held a number of senior posts at Air New Zealand and its predecessor, National Airways Corporation.

Ms King says Mr Tannock has served the aviation industry in New Zealand well over many years.

"His whole life has been dedicated to the industry and has made a significant contribution to sector in the various roles in which he has served.

“The last few years have been difficult with the Civil Aviation Authority having to deal with a number of contentious and high profile issues. He has worked well with industry to ensure safety improvements within the sector.”

In his letter of resignation, Mr Tannock said he felt it was essential that a new Chairperson be in place to launch and manage the recruitment of a new Director of Civil Aviation. He acknowledged the extraordinary contribution of the other members of the Authority in providing the CAA with a sound strategic platform on which to build for the future.

Ms King says Mr Tannock also played a leading role in ensuring that the Aviation Security Service (AVSEC) responded quickly and effectively to the recent terrorism scare in the United Kingdom.

“On behalf of the Government I would like to acknowledge and thank Mr Tannock for his efforts and wish him well for the future.”

Ms King says Mr Tannock is resigning from October 1, though his term does not officially end until November. She will now proceed with the appointment process for a new chair who will oversee the recruitment of a new Civil Aviation director.
