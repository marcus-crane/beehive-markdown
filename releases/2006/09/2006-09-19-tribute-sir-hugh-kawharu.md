Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton today paid tribute to Sir Hugh Kawharu, who died this morning.

"Sir Hugh was an outstanding leader for Ngati Whatua and one of our foremost academics.

"He leaves a long legacy of leadership and service to Auckland, Maori and New Zealand as a whole.

"His strength, dignity and mana helped guide Ngati Whatua to its recent Agreement in Principle with the Crown to settle their outstanding Treaty claims. This agreement capped a long career of achievement in the advancement of Ngati Whatua and its interests.

"He will be missed. I offer my condolences and sympathies to his family and to the people of Ngati Whatua."
