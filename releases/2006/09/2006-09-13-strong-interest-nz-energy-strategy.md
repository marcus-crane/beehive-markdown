There has been strong and wide-ranging interest in the development of the New Zealand Energy Strategy, Energy Minister David Parker said today.

The terms of reference for the strategy were [released for public comment in July](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26354), and a workshop held on 23 August.

More than 140 people attended the workshop, representing the energy sector, industry, non-governmental organisations, central and local government, and interested members of the public. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Development [received 50 direct submissions](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____22306.aspx) on the terms of reference.

A summary of the feedback received has now been released on the Ministry of Economic Development’s website. [www.med.govt.nz/nzes/](http://www.med.govt.nz/nzes/)

“The feedback identified reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the role of carbon-intensive energy sources, transport options, renewable energy, energy efficiency, investment, and research and innovation as the key areas for action,” said Mr Parker.

While there was a high degree of consistency in the feedback, there were also differences between different stakeholder groups in their approach to the various trade-offs inherent in an overall energy strategy.

“It is important to recognise that we’re not aiming for complete consensus in developing a New Zealand Energy Strategy: in such a complex area, that would be unrealistic.

“What’s most important is that the final strategy will set a clear and sustainable long-term direction for New Zealand's energy security and greenhouse gas emissions. It will give increased certainty to energy users, and investors as they plan for New Zealand’s energy future,” said Mr Parker.

The next step in the process is to pull together a draft strategy, informed by the feedback to date. Following publication of that, there will be a consultation with as broad a range of people as possible.
