Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today announced reductions in commercial catch limits for orange roughy, from the start of the new fishing year on 1 October 2006.

The commercial catch limits for orange roughy in the northern North Island (ORH1) will be reduced by 43% to 800 tonnes per year, and the commercial limits for the Chatham Rise and southern New Zealand fishery (ORH3B) will be reduced by almost 10% to 11,500 tonnes.

The Minister said he is aware of the ongoing difficulties of managing the [orange roughy](http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/SOF/Species.htm?code=ORH&list=name) fisheries and he’ll be monitoring the fishery to ensure catch limits are set at a sustainable level.

The orange roughy decisions are part of the Minister’s annual decisions on catch limits for species in the quota management system. The system provides a straight-forward way to adjust annual catch limits so that fisheries are sustainable in the long term.

There have been a number of other catch limit changes for low knowledge fish stocks and for rig in the top of the South Island which will also come into effect on 1 October 2006.

Full details of the new catch limits are available on the Ministry of Fisheries’ website at [www.fish.govt.nz](http://www.fish.govt.nz).
