More than 70 per cent of New Zealand’s councils are now ‘live’ on the National Dog Database and the remainder are in the process of uploading their dog registration data, Associate Minister of Local Government Nanaia Mahuta said today.

When all councils were live this would provide, for the first time, a national view of New Zealand’s dog population available 24 hours a day to councils, she said.

“As part of a package of measures designed to improve public safety around dogs, the National Dog Database (NDD) is a great resource that will make it possible to keep track of dangerous and menacing dogs, and find lost and stolen dogs to reunite them with their owners.”

Nanaia Mahuta said the project to establish the NDD had been very successful, coming in on time and within budget. While there had been some upload issues because some council systems required additional work to become compatible with the NDD, existing manual systems were still available as a back up.

The Department of Internal Affairs administered the database and had worked closely with councils to ensure quality data capture and to assist councils to get their data loaded, Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Councils that are live can already see the potential of the NDD and are getting value from it. This will be maximised when all councils are on board,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
