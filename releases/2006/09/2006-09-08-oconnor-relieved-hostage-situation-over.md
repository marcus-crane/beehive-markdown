Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said tonight he was relieved and thankful the hostage situation in Auckland Prison has been speedily resolved with no-one injured.

"It is a great outcome. The well-being of Corrections staff is something that I take very seriously. They work in a tough environment. I know the department will offer the best available support to the officer and help her recover from her ordeal.

"I have the utmost admiration for the professionalism shown by those involved in bringing this situation to a quick and successful conclusion.

"It is heartening to see that the procedures which are in place for situations such as these proved to be effective.

"We must, however, consider the circumstances that led to this event. Therefore I have asked the Corrections Department chief executive for an urgent report."
