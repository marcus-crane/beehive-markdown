During a visit to the Pulse Heartlands centre today, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said it provided an excellent model for future 'one-stop-shop' service centres for families and young people.

[The Pulse, Te Hotu Manawa,](http://www.heartlands.govt.nz/service-centres/the-pulse-whangarei.html) is one of only two urban [Heartlands Centres in New Zealand](http://www.heartlands.govt.nz/service-centres/service-centres.html). Operated by the Whangarei Youth One Stop Shop Charitable Trust, it provides an alternative education programme, a teen parent school, and access to youth development, employment, training, social, and health services, including alcohol and drug treatment services.

Mr Benson-Pope said that the government was increasingly keen on the one-stop model of integrated and collaborative services, and that the Pulse provided an excellent model for the [Early Years](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27134) service hubs that would soon be opening in high-needs communities.

"Early Years, which I announced on Monday, involves setting up service hubs to connect families to all the early intervention services available, and ensuring those services are well co-ordinated," Mr Benson-Pope said. "We're also establishing teen parent co-ordinators in areas with high rates of teenage pregnancy – and again, there will be much to learn from the Pulse's work in this area."

Mr Benson-Pope said that early intervention was about acting early in the life of a child, or early in the life of a problem. "We want to give all children the best possible start in life, and we want to support young people into healthy, positive lives as adults," he said.

"This involves a whole mix of things, including education, training, and employment, and access to the right services at the right time. The Pulse provides this support exceptionally well, and I congratulate everyone involved in this unique and highly effective service."

The Minister's trip to Northland today also involved a launch of [Family Start](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/strong-families/family-start/index.html) in Kaikohe, and visits to the Trade Enterprise Programme at Northland College, and to the New World Industry Partnership.
