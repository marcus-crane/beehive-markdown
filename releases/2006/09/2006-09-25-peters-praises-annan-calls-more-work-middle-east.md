Foreign Minister Winston Peters has praised the work of United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan but called for greater political will over the Middle East in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Mr Peters said events of the past year had only reinforced the fact that the world would be substantially worse without the UN, which had undergone vital reforms thanks to the vision, determination and courage of Kofi Annan.

"This is all the more remarkable in that for much of his stewardship the UN has been confronted with some of the most difficult international crises of its existence," Mr Peters said.

The UN was passing through a period of challenge to its relevance and effectiveness, and had confronted serious political and security shocks in the Middle East, in Darfur, and in Timor-Leste.

"Last year, world leaders agreed to an ambitious reform agenda based on peace and security, development, and human rights. Progress has been made but we must press on for much remains to be done."

Mr Peters said the challenge of development had never been higher on the international agenda, nor had the need to eradicate poverty been so critical.

"Increasing aid levels will not be enough. We must become more effective.  
We need to make sure that every dollar spent makes a positive difference.

"That means addressing the key threats to our success: poor governance, corruption, and gender inequality. We need to secure fairer international trading relationships. And we must work on these together."

Mr Peters reinforced New Zealand's commitment to realising the Pacific Islands Forum goal of a “region that is respected for the quality of its governance, the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values and for its defence and promotion of human rights”.

"These are ambitious goals. Translating them into reality means hard work by all Pacific countries. This is a challenge we accept.

"New Zealand is determined to seek out the benefits of the Pacific's significance and guard against the threats, among which I include chequebook diplomacy."

Mr Peters said it was a sad reality that the situation in the Middle East had been on the UN agenda since its formation 60 years ago.

"The lack of sustained political will to see through more than a handful of decisions on the Middle East has undermined confidence. It has contributed to an unstable environment where extremism, injustice and despair flourish.

"These issues must be tackled with new resolve, using the international, multilateral system as a tool for peace and progress. The response to the Security Council’s call for an expanded UN force in Lebanon shows that the international community can react to conflict and provide basic stabilisation.

"But such responses are doomed to failure unless the underlying political and security issues are addressed. It is imperative to relaunch the Middle East Peace process covering all issues."

Mr Peters also criticised the cynical and unconscionable action of the Sudanese government for blocking the introduction of a UN force into Darfur.

He noted the UN had played a key role in Timor-Leste's independence, but its presence would be required there for many more years.

"The deployment of a substantial UN police force is vital if peace and stability is to be maintained even in the medium term. But the nature of the expanded UN mission in Timor-Leste reflects the deep and broad engagement required to build a lasting peace."

Turning to UN reforms, Mr Peters said Member States could be satisfied with the recent establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peace-building Commission, but the challenge now was to make them truly effective bodies.

"New Zealand wants to see continuing reform high on the list of priorities for this 61st session to ensure that the United Nations can be as responsive as possible to the needs of Member States, and efficient in getting the best from the resources available to it.

"New Zealand is a country that engages with the United Nations with no hidden agenda. Those who do so pervert and weaken this organisation.

"We will continue to put our efforts behind the principles and policies that will make the United Nations strong."
