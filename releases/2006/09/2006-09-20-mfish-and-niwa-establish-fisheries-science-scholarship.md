Minister of Fisheries Jim Anderton today announced the Ministry of Fisheries and Niwa have established a joint graduate scholarship programme in quantitative fisheries science.

"MFish will provide funding while NIWA will provide supervision and mentoring to the successful scholarship candidates," Jim Anderton said.

"The scholarships would mean that 2 to 3 graduate students each year could develop expertise in quantitative fisheries research, with particular emphasis on the assessment of fish stocks modelling.

“This is an area where there is a shortage of trained graduates in New Zealand. We are looking to attract the best students into quantitative marine science and promote excellence in quantitative fisheries research,” he said.

"Scholarship projects will be selected according to how well they fit with the Ministry of Fisheries goals.

“This scholarship programme will give our top marine science students the opportunity to work with practicing NIWA scientists," Jim Anderton said.
