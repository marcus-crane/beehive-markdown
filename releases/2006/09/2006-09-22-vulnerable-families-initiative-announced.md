Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope has announced the government's new initiative to support vulnerable families to be safe and secure and give their children the best start in life.

"Our most vulnerable families have complex problems that can become overwhelming," Mr Benson-Pope said. "We need to target those families that aren't necessarily getting all the support they need from social service agencies."

Mr Benson-Pope said that families would be identified through a combination of Work and Income data and local agency knowledge. "There's a range of possible indicators of a family needing more support than they're currently getting," he said.

"Things like intergenerational benefit use, a high truancy rate, or transience can all indicate more complex and deep-seated issues.

"If this is the case, we want to make sure the family is connected to all the services and support they need. Vulnerable Families let us use the knowledge we already have, and extend the work we already do, to provide more intensive, co-ordinated support," he said.

A Work and Income Service Co-ordinator will be assigned to the family and provide intensive case management, drawing together the services and expertise of all the relevant government and non-government agencies.

Prominent community leaders will also be involved, encouraging and supporting families who may be reluctant to take up the help offered.

"The support these families need is already available," Mr Benson-Pope said, "but we face two core challenges: lack of awareness among some families of what's available, and in some cases reluctance to work with outside agencies.

"Having a Service Co-ordinator in Work and Income and working with community leaders to link families to support networks helps us overcome each of these challenges.

"Ultimately, we can't force anyone to take up a voluntary service. We can, however, reinforce expectations, and if we have concerns about the welfare or behaviour of any family member, we can bring in the Police or Child Youth and Family."

Mr Benson-Pope said he expected Vulnerable Families would initially work with around 50 families across New Zealand. The initiative would remain private and confidential, and he wouldn't be sharing information about any family's circumstances, including the area in which they lived.

"The government acknowledges the high level of interest in this issue, particularly following the tragic deaths of the Kahui twins and media activity at that time," he said. "However, we must respect families' and communities' right to privacy. Making any information public would only undermine the purpose of the initiative, which is to reach families in need."

Mr Benson-Pope said that today's announcement concludes a week of substantial announcements with a particular focus on families and young people with high needs.

"On Monday I announced the $7.3 million Early Years initiative, whose main components are service hubs and teen parent co-ordinators in high-needs areas," he said. "Early Years is about extending the reach and impact of services for families, with the aim of giving all children the best possible start in life.

"On Tuesday, Education Minister Steve Maharey and I launched the Action Plan for young people in Counties Manukau and Otahuhu, which aims to improve outcomes for young people and steer them away from crime and gang affiliation.

"The 26-point Action Plan is funded by $10 million from this year's Budget, along with additional funding from other streams. It includes intensive case management for around a hundred at-risk families, whanau, and fono; safe houses for youngsters found wandering the streets late at night, who don't have a safe home to go to; and co-ordinated work among agencies to guide every at-risk young person into work, training, or further education."

Mr Benson-Pope said that work, training, and education were essential to young people and families moving out of disadvantage. "The best social development strategy for any individual is a good education and a job," he said. "Initiatives like Early Years, Vulnerable Families, and the Action Plan help us clear out the problems that can stop people having these opportunities."
