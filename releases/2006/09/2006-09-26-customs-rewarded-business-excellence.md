Minister of Customs Nanaia Mahuta has congratulated the New Zealand Customs Service after picking up an Australasian award for business excellence.

The Service was a joint winner of the Environmental, Social, Government and Community Award at the 2006 Trans-Tasman business awards yesterday. It shares the award with the Australian Customs Service and the Financial Reporting Standards Board/Australian Accounting Standards Board.

"This award is recognition of the fact that New Zealand Customs is continuing to build strong relationships with its Australian counterpart, which contributes to harmony and stability in the region and enhances our trading relationship across the Tasman.

"Congratulations to both the New Zealand and Australian Customs Services, who have been acknowledged through this award for their superb efforts in cementing closer relationships between our two countries," Nanaia Mahuta said.

The awards celebrate excellence by businesses that operate in New Zealand  
and Australia, and were presented at functions held simultaneously in  
Auckland and Sydney.

The awards were open to all businesses that have been collaborating on  
trans-Tasman services and solutions, providing they have been operating  
continuously in either Australia or New Zealand, or both, for at least  
three years as at 30 June 2006.
