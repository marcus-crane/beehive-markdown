In a clear bid for leadership of the National Party, MP John Key says in a radio interview he believes the minimum wage should keep rising and implied that Dr Brash is one of the 'hard right wingers' who believes in getting rid of the minimum wage altogether.

In a move to distance himself from the views of Dr Brash and shift National's policy away from the hard right, Mr Key said: "I'm not one of the hardcore, hard right wingers who says 'get rid of the minimum wage; you don’t need it.' Some people take that view, I personally think it has a place and I don’t have problems with it rising."

"Is Mr Key ignorant of his party's hard right wing stance on the minimum wage, or is he attempting to rewrite it as part of his power play for leadership?" says Ruth Dyson.

"I welcome Mr Key's agreement with this Labour-led government's commitment to continue annual adjustments to the minimum wage. Since 1999 this policy has seen the minimum adult wage rise by 46 percent.

"This stands in stark contrast to the last National-led Government, which over nine years raised the minimum wage by less than one dollar."

The Labour-led government raised the minimum adult wage, which applies to people over 18 years, from $9.50 to $10.25 an hour on 27 March this year - the largest increase since the Labour-led government came into office in 1999. Consultation on the 2007 rate is currently underway.
