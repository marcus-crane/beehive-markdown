Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor is encouraging New Zealanders to give their views on regulations surrounding alcohol advertising.

A Steering Group, made up of Government agency representatives and individuals with relevant expertise, was [set up earlier this year](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/863bf848f48fc6cdcc25717d00782a7e?OpenDocument) to see whether the existing regulatory framework for alcohol advertising fits with the Government's alcohol policy.

At the moment there is voluntary industry self-regulation of alcohol advertising in New Zealand. The Government-led review follows a petition delivered to Parliament highlighting concerns over alcohol promotion.

Mr O'Connor said the steering group, chaired by Ministry of Health Chief Public Health Advisor Ashley Bloomfield, has adopted a wide definition of advertising and will take a broad look at advertising in New Zealand.

Issues to be considered include:

- the methods, effects, limitations and conditions of alcohol sponsorship;
- point-of-sale promotions; and
- newer marketing techniques.

"A key part of the consultation will be looking at young people's exposure to alcohol advertising and the impact this could have on them.''

Mr O'Connor said one of the [New Zealand Health Strategy](http://www.moh.govt.nz/publications/nzhs)'s 13 priority [population health objectives](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/c43c7844c94e08cd4c2566d300838b43/4464f7efc32412f9cc256b67007a85cf?OpenDocument#Population%20health%20goals%20and%20objec) is based around harm minimisation for alcohol and other drug use.

"The aim of the review is to assess whether the current regulatory framework is achieving its aim of ensuring that alcohol advertising does not conflict with the need for responsibility and moderation in alcohol consumption.''

Among those whose views are being sought are:

- community representatives,
- public health NGOs and researchers,
- industry stakeholders and
- relevant Government and non-Government agencies.

The closing date for submissions is 31 October 2006. For more information about the review, including the Steering Group's membership and Terms of Reference go to:
