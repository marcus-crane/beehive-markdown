Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced three re-appointments to the [Takeovers Panel](http://www.takeovers.govt.nz/): Alastair Lawrence, for a two year term; and Colin Giffney and David Quigg, for five year terms.

“The Takeovers Panel plays a vital role in New Zealand’s capital markets”, Lianne Dalziel said.

“The re-appointments retain a great deal of knowledge, practical skill and experience that will be particularly useful to the Panel as it faces a number of vacancies in the coming year.”

Alastair Lawrence has been a member of the panel since 1995, and worked on formulating the code (and its subsequent revision). Mr Lawrence has a background in investment banking, and subsequently set up the venture capital company Antipodes Capital Limited, and the private investment bank Antipodes Consult Limited. Mr Lawrence has extensive financial and strategic knowledge of a number of industry sectors within the commercial marketplace. He also has substantial experience in debt and equity markets.

Colin Giffney was a managing director of Jordan Sandman Were, and in 1995 established Giffney & Jones, a specialist corporate advisor firm. Mr Giffney has been a member of the New Zealand Stock Exchange since 1979. He has in-depth knowledge of the securities market, and practical experience in mergers and acquisitions, and contested takeovers.

David Quigg is a lawyer with a Master’s degree based on takeovers law. He is a mergers and acquisitions corporate partner with the firm of Quigg Partners. He has worked extensively on mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, takeovers and corporate governance issues. Mr Quigg is a member of a number of professional institutions including the Wellington Branch of the Institute of Directors. He has spoken at conferences and seminars on mergers and acquisitions, and takeovers matters, and has written articles on the subject.

These re-appointments take effect from 25 September 2006. For further information on the Panel see [Takeovers Panel](http://www.takeovers.govt.nz/)
