Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Prince of Orange and his wife Princess Maxima of the Netherlands will visit New Zealand at the end of next month.

Prince Willem-Alexander, as the eldest child of Queen Beatrix, is first in the line of succession to the Dutch throne.

During the five-day official visit (31 October to 4 November) the couple will spend time in Wellington, the Nelson region, Christchurch and Auckland.

Further programme details will be announced nearer the time of the visit.

"I met Her Majesty Queen Beatrix during an official visit to the Netherlands in 2004. Queen Beatrix visited New Zealand in 1992 on the 350th anniversary of Abel Tasman's voyage," Helen Clark said.

"New Zealand and the Netherlands have a close relationship with links which date back to the sighting of our country by Abel Tasman in 1642.

"This country takes its name from the southern Dutch province of Zeeland. Dutch migrants have also made a valuable contribution to New Zealand society, economy, and culture,” Helen Clark said.

The Prince of Orange and Princess Maxima are visiting New Zealand following an official visit to Australia to mark the 400th anniversary of the first Dutch contact with that continent.
