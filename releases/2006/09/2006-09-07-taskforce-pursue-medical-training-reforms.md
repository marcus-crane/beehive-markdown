The new Workforce Taskforce will have six months to report to the government on significant reforms of New Zealand's medical education and clinical training system, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

In a speech in Auckland today, Pete Hodgson announced the membership of the taskforce and said that their first task would be to advise the government on how to streamline the training of doctors.

"New Zealand's health workforce has grown rapidly under the Labour-led government," Pete Hodgson said. "There are now over 5,000 more doctors and nurses working in our public hospitals than there were in 1999 – that's significant progress, but it's not good enough.

"With an ageing population and a growing chronic disease burden, our health workforce is going to be under increasing pressure to deliver more and better services for New Zealanders. The health sector is emerging from a period of advice and discussion and we now have the momentum we need to act and pursue significant reforms for our workforce.

"The Workforce Taskforce will design final plans to streamline workforce planning and address issues around training, recruitment and retention of the full range of health professionals. Their first task will be to provide me with a specific plan to streamline medical education and clinical training within six months.

"There is still not total agreement in the sector about how to get this done, so the six month report back is a significant challenge. I don't, however, feel we can afford to wait any longer."

The options the taskforce will consider include:  
·Shortening the number of undergraduate years,  
·Starting specialist training during undergraduate years,  
·Moving to a "method of payment for output" for medical education,  
·Collapsing the first two years of postgrad training into one,  
·Giving more recognition to prior learning in specialist training years,  
·Appraising the apprentice training model

"We've been able to recruit a team of talented, highly regarded people to guide the taskforce. I'm very pleased that Dr Robert Logan, the immediate past chair of the National Health Committee has agreed to chair the Taskforce."
