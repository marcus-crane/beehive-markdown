Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope has announced a cross-government Action Plan to improve outcomes for young people and reduce youth offending in Counties Manukau and Otahuhu.

The Auckland Youth Support Network Group has developed the [26-point Action Plan](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/cross-sectoral-work/youth-gangs-action.html). With representatives from the Ministries of Education, Justice, Social Development, and Police, and the Counties Manukau District Health Board, the Network will work with local groups to implement the plan.

“Counties Manukau has the highest proportion of youth, is one of the fastest- growing regions in population terms, and one of the lowest-income regions in New Zealand. The Plan also, however, includes other 'hotspots' in the Auckland region,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“It's important to remember that most young people in Counties Manukau are doing really well, and it’s unfair to define this community by the actions of a few.

“[Ministry of Social Development research](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/social-research/children-young-people/youth-gangs.html) shows a range of factors is driving youth gang membership in South Auckland, including economic, parenting, peer pressure, and disengagement issues. Our responses must involve families and communities, supported by strong social services.

“Young people need to be connected to schools, training and jobs – inactivity and boredom can be triggers for risk taking and criminal behaviour. We need to intervene early to prevent young people getting into trouble, and stop problems that do occur from escalating.

“The introduction of youth workers, while important, is only part of the answer. We need services to work with young people and their families across the full range of issues including schooling, self esteem, parenting, offending, and personal safety,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

Government is investing [$10 million over four years (Budget 06)](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/budget-fact-sheets/2006/improving-outcomes-for-young-people-in-south-auckland.html) in South Auckland to fund youth workers and wrap around family services. It will be used in conjunction with other government funding to resource the Action Plan’s initiatives for prevention, intervention, and crisis management.

“The Youth Support Network and the community have a significant task ahead of them. This is a comprehensive and ambitious plan that aims to make a real difference to the lives of young people and their families in Counties Manukau and surrounding areas. I'm confident great progress can be achieved if everyone works together, “Mr Benson-Pope said.
