Canterbury business leaders tomorrow get the chance to tell the government what they think of the regulations that affect them.

Key industry players from the Canterbury Employer's Chamber of Commerce and the Canterbury Manufacturers' Association will each meet Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel to exchange views on the best way forward.

Lianne Dalziel says the debate has moved beyond a simplistic argument about the place of regulation and is now focussed on maximising opportunities for economic growth.

"Everyone knows we need rules; we just want to ensure they're the right rules – high quality, appropriately targetted and proportionate to the risks involved," said Lianne Dalziel.

"New Zealand needs a properly regulated business environment that still encourages innovation and economic growth."

"We will also focus on the cumulative weight of regulation – it's often not just the one regulation that creates problems for businesses; it's usually a combination of regulations that can cause a real sense of overload."

Lianne Dalziel launched the Quality Regulation Review in May as part of the Labour-led government's economic transformation agenda. Since then, Lianne Dalziel has been getting alongside businesspeople around the country and listening to their concerns and ideas, encouraging these businesses to devise solutions to the issues they raise.

In Christchurch Ms Dalziel will make a presentation to the board and senior management of the Canterbury Employer's Chamber of Commerce and later take part in a focus group organised by the Canterbury Manufacturers' Association to hear feedback from key industry players.

"People who run small and medium enterprises are incredibly busy, so I really appreciate them taking time out to provide the government with the benefit of their experience."
