Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has welcomed the launch of the Action Plan for young people in Counties-Manukau and Otahuhu, and said that the Ministry of Youth Development will lead two of the actions in the 26-point plan.

"The actions the Ministry will lead are about providing opportunities for young people’s voices to be heard, and offer professional support for youth workers," Nanaia Mahuta said. "This is an important part of the government's plan to help young people see that there are other, more positive alternatives to gangs."

"If we are serious about improving outcomes for young people in our communities, we need to ensure that young people feel they are valued and can make a positive contribution. Key to tackling the problem of youth disengagement is listening to the voices of local young people and engaging in a genuine dialogue with them to identify their priorities for action.

"With that goal in mind, the Ministry will be establishing a series of focus groups to ensure that young people’s views on how services can be made better for them are heard and built into future action plans, which is essential if we are going to be successful in addressing this issue."

The second key action will involve the Ministry enhancing its support to the local youth work sector, with the aim of strengthening networks in Counties-Manukau and ensuring that youth workers are supported professionally with best practice youth work principles.

"Youth workers make a powerful and positive impact on young people's lives, and have strong connections and networks within local communities. They provide activities outside of school hours, engage with those who are currently disengaged from education, link young people to services, work with families, and connect young people with each other. They can also complement the many school-based and community initiatives already available to young people.

"While there are significant challenges facing us, I believe that with the combined ongoing efforts of central and local government, community agencies and young people themselves, that we can make a difference in South Auckland, and I welcome this plan of action as a key step towards this," Nanaia Mahuta said.
