Understanding the evolution of the Universe and investigating the psychology of violent offenders are among the research projects in the latest $39 million Marsden funding round announced today.

Research Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey says the funding will go towards 78 projects covering a broad spectrum of fundamental research in areas from economics to cosmology.

“Projects funded by the [Marsden Fund](http://www.rsnz.org/funding/marsden_fund/) are at the forefront of scientific investigation and have significantly contributed to raising the profile of New Zealand science internationally. This year is no exception," Steve Maharey said.

“Emerging areas of science are represented with funding for pioneering nanotechnology research. In the health area, projects include the links between blood pressure and strokes and why strokes tend to happen in the early morning.

"Of the Marsden fund recipients, 26 have also been awarded 'Fast Start' funding which is given to outstanding, talented new researchers. This is significant to ensuring we are nurturing the creative high performers that will produce the breakthrough science we will need in the future.

"While the Marsden Fund supports pure research, it has resulted in a number of commercial applications.

“An example is work at Auckland University into ‘prodrugs’ for cancer – tapping into chemicals that can selectively kill cancer cells but not affect neighbouring healthy cells. As well as having potential health benefits, this work also promises to have a commercial spin-off for New Zealand."
