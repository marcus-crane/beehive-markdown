Family violence and women in leadership are just two of the issues Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel will discuss with her Australian counterparts at a ministerial meeting on the status of women in Adelaide on Friday.

Lianne Dalziel is meeting Australian state and federal ministers to look at issues affecting women on both sides of the Tasman.

"The Australians are interested in our whole-of-government approach to policies affecting women. We've got a lot to contribute to this discussion, particularly with regards to initiatives such as the family violence taskforce and the women's action plan," Lianne Dalziel said.

The [Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/families-whanau/te-rito/family-violence-taskforce.html) is working to prevent and eliminate violence within families through a sustained, co-ordinated and mult-level approach by a range of government and non-government agencies. [The Action Plan for New Zealand Women](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/news-and-pubs/publications/action-plan.html) also takes a cross-agency approach to promoting economic independence, work-life balance and well-being for women.

The New Zealand and Australian ministers responsible for women's issues meet annually to co-ordinate and develop policies that affect the status of women, and to facilitate action on matters affecting women. This also ensures a voice for women in other ministerial forums.

This year's meeting will be chaired by South Australian Minister for the Status of Women Jennifer Rankine. Senior government ministers from East Timor and Tonga and a representative of the Solomon Islands are also expected to attend – the first time Pacific countries will be involved.

Lianne Dalziel says her particular focus will be on finding ways New Zealand and Australia can work with Pacific nations to help them advance the interests of Pacific women, particularly in preventing violence and promoting leadership.
