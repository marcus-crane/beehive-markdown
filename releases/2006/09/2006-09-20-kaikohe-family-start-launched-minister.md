Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope launched the Kaikohe [Family Start programme](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/strong-families/family-start/index.html) today, and restated the government's commitment to providing comprehensive early intervention services to families.

Run by [local PHO Tihewa Mauriora](http://www.tihewapho.org.nz/), Family Start in Kaikohe will provide intensive home visits to 112 families with very young children.

The Family Start family/whanau worker helps the family to set and achieve their own goals, acts as a service advocate if necessary, and ensures that services are targeted and well co-ordinated.

Mr Benson-Pope said that Family Start was one of the government's most successful early intervention services, along with well-known initiatives like [SKIP](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/strong-families/skip/index.html), [Strengthening Families](http://www.strengtheningfamilies.govt.nz/), and [Well Child](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/our-work/strong-families/well-child.html). Local PHO Tihewa Mauriora was the ideal organisation to deliver Family Start in Kaikohe, with a very strong record of delivering health and wellbeing services to the local community, he said.

Mr Benson-Pope said that an extension to Family Start was part of the government's latest early intervention initiative, [Early Years](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27134), announced on Monday. Early Years would also establish new service hubs in high-need areas, teen parent co-ordinators in areas with high rates of teenage pregnancy, and a trial [Roots of Empathy programme](http://www.rootsofempathy.org/) in schools.

"Our goal is to make sure that every family gets the services they need, when they need them," Mr Benson-Pope said. "Early Years is about extending both the reach and the integration of early intervention services like Family Start."
