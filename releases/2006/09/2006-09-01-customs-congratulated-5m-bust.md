Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has congratulated New Zealand Customs officers on the seizure of $5 million worth of crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as 'P'.

On Monday (August 28), Customs officers at Auckland International Airport discovered the bulk of the Class A drug packed into 43 picture frames. The frames were contained in the luggage of two passengers, who were travelling via Hong Kong on Canadian passports.

Customs found the 43 identically sized picture frames during an x-ray examination. Around 100 grams of the Class A controlled drug crystal methamphetamine was discovered within each frame. The total street value of this find is approximately $5 million. The latest bust follows the seizure of a record $135 million worth of crystal methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine by Customs and Police officers in May.

"Thanks to the excellent work of Customs officers, yet another sizeable haul of these hard drugs has been intercepted. However, this is a reminder that we cannot let up in our fight against the criminals attempting to bring them into our country.

"While agencies such as Customs are committed to stopping these drugs at the border, it is essential that we all do what we can by refusing to accept the spread of these destructive and harmful drugs in our communities," Nanaia Mahuta said.
