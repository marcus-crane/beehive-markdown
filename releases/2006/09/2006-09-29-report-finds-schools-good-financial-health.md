The latest report on the compulsory school sector shows New Zealand schools are in good financial health, and the quality of financial management continues to improve, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"This is further evidence that the major investment in schools under the Labour-led government is helping to lift the financial position for the vast majority of schools," Steve Maharey says.

"This is going hand in hand with better financial management by schools.

"The Schools Report 2005 shows almost all schools were in a healthy financial position, with 94 percent of schools having a healthy working capital ratio, up from 92 percent in 2004. Around 64 percent of schools had an operating surplus, compared with 56 percent in 2004.

"Locally raised funds have reduced as a proportion of schools' revenue as government funding has increased."

Steve Maharey said government funding for New Zealand schools was now around $4.5 billion a year, up from around $3 billion in 1999. New Zealand is currently ranked 3rd in the OECD for spending on state education as a percentage of GDP.

"Labour recognises that if we want all schools to deliver a high quality learning environment, we need to be prepared to make the investment. Clearly the investment we are making is resulting in an improved financial position for most schools."

The NZ Schools Report 2005 reviews school finances, provides an assessment of student achievement and engagement, and comments on the quality of schooling and effectiveness of teachers. Other highlights from the report include:

- The literacy professional development project has been successful in raising the achievement levels of students.
- The percentage of students leaving school with at least University Entrance has continued to increase, from 27 percent in 2002 to 33 percent in 2005.
- Nearly 80 percent of students are entering tertiary study within five years of leaving school
- The government spent $4.53 billion on state and integrated schools in 2005
