A total of 94 conservation projects run by private landowners and community groups are to receive government grants for biodiversity restoration, Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Environment Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

The grants from the Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds will aid in the protection of kiwi, blue duck, penguins, skinks, forest systems of kahikatea and kauri, as well as wetlands. They are part of government’s continuing support for nature protection on private land under the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy.

A total of $1.2m will be provided to 74 projects from the Biodiversity Condition Fund, which seeks to improve and maintain native species and habitats on private land. More than half a million dollars will be provided to 20 projects from the Biodiversity Advice Fund, which supports the provision of advice and information to assist with the management of native areas.

The grants will be supplemented by a further $2.6 million being contributed to the projects by landowners, local and regional government and other funding agencies. This will bring the total amount being spent on the biodiversity projects to over $4.4 million.

"We were impressed with the range of projects being funded this year and the scale of those projects associated with protection of at risk species. A high level of technical expertise is now being channelled into the implementation of biodiversity protection on private land," said Chris Carter.

"It is particularly pleasing to see the emphasis on wetland protection in this funding round. Some 16 projects involve landowners working on wetland protection or enhancement projects."

David Benson-Pope said the grants demonstrated the effort many landowners and community groups were putting in to protecting native flora and fauna on private land.

"A lot of this work goes unrecognised and these grants are one way the government can assist landowners in their projects that have conservation benefits on behalf of the public of NZ."

Today’s announcement was made from Taupo Swamp, near Porirua, which is owned by the QEII Trust, and is one of the recipients of the biofunds grants. Taupo Swamp is an extensive wetland area that has the Wellington region’s largest population of harakeke (flax). Over the last 150 years, New Zealand has lost 90% of its wetlands.
