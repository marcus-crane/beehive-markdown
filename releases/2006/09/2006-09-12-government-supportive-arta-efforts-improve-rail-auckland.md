The Government supports the efforts of Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) and the Auckland Regional Council to

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister Annette King say a technical working group is being formed to better understand and inform future decisions around rail infrastructure and funding.

ARTA’s long term Rail Development Plan for Auckland includes:

- a proposal for the electrification of Auckland’s rail network in the medium term, with
- proposed development in the period 2012-2015, and
- for a decision to be made soon with respect to investment in new rolling stock for the region.

ARTA, the ARC, Treasury, and the Ministry of Transport, with support from ONTRACK, will participate in the working group.

The working group will fit with the broad directions and timing for Auckland transport which are now being established through the Auckland Strategic Transport Alignment Project (ATSAP). The key deliverables of ATSAP and the outcome of the Rail Development Plan are expected to be available to the Government and the region by the end of 2006.
