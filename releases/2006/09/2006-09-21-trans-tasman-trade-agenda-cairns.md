New Zealand’s trade and economic relationship with Australia was the subject of a dedicated Ministerial Forum in Cairns attended by Trade Minister Phil Goff, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel, and their Australian counterparts Mark Vaile, Peter McGauran and Ian MacFarlane on Wednesday.

“The range of portfolios involved in the meeting reflects the sheer breadth and significance of the economic relationship” the Ministers said.

“It ranges from a multi-billion dollar trade relationship to an extensive ‘behind the border’ programme of economic cooperation under the Single Economic Market, where we are addressing barriers to doing business in both countries and trans-Tasman.”

“At Cairns we reviewed achievements under the CER heading including agreement on new Rules of Origin (which will be of great benefit to exporters in both countries), and the extension of Australia’s Wine Equalisation Tax rebate to New Zealand wine-makers”

Ministers also discussed specific trade access issues under the biosecurity heading, including access for New Zealand’s stonefruit to Australia – which will shortly be able to access Western Australia – but also apples.

“Jim Anderton made clear the importance we place on resolving the apples issue promptly and in a way which allows for commercially meaningful access to the Australian market”

“We also looked at progress under the Single Economic Market agenda, launching a Users’ Guide on the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement – which plays a vital role in supporting the free flow of goods and labour for both countries – and we compared notes on our respective efforts to improve the regulatory environment for business”

“The meeting was taking place back-to-back with this year’s meeting of the Cairns Group and we were strongly agreed on the vital importance of the WTO Doha Round resuming” the Ministers said.

Finally, Ministers met with senior representatives of the New Zealand and Australian food and beverage sectors, who had held a parallel business dialogue.

“These sectors make a significant contribution to the prosperity of both countries, and we as Ministers strong support efforts towards a more collaborative approach between the sectors, which face many issues in common.”

“Our meeting in Cairns reflected both the great achievements of the CER relationship over the years. It also showed that both countries are committed to building on this success as we face the challenges of the new century” the Ministers concluded.
