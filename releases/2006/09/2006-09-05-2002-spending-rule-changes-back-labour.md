Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said National is telling another lie in claiming he participated in the post-2002 election review of parliamentary funding.

"I have obtained a list of its members and meetings. The Labour representatives, apart from the Speaker, were David Benson-Pope and Mark Burton," said Dr Cullen.

"More importantly, the changes made at that time contradict National's spin.

The main change was to add "parliamentary political parties" to "members" in terms of those who were eligible to spend money to "advertise their services or activities".

"Specifically, this included "material of an informational nature to inform the recipient of the member's or parliamentary political party's views on public issues of the day," and "information about a member's or parliamentary political party's activities."

"In other words, it made it clearer that material such as the pledge card was included.

"It is correct that these rules excluded spending "supporting the election of any person or party." But this was always taken to mean specifically calling on people to vote for a person or party.

"That is why National's pledge pamphlet of 2002, and other material, was seen as legitimate, in the same way that Labour determined its pledge card was legitimate.

"One other subsequent change was to make it clear that both the parliamentary crest and an address had to be included.

"It may well be that the Auditor-General's report will propound a different interpretation of the rules. That does not affect what the Labour party and all other parties, including National, have done in good faith under a different interpretation in the past.

"Certainly no change in the rules after 2002 changed the situation in this respect at all, " Dr Cullen concluded.
