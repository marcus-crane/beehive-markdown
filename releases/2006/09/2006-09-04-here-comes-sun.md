If you are thinking about installing a solar water heater and reducing your impact on the environment, then the Government wants to hear from you.

Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation and Green Party MP Jeanette Fitzsimons today released a discussion document setting out ideas for a new programme to increase the use of solar water heating and is interested in receiving feedback from those in the industry and members of the public.

"Kiwi families can save money on their energy bills while also reducing their contribution to climate change by installing solar water heating," she says.

Ms Fitzsimons today visited Beacon Pathway's NOW Home* in Waitakere, a research home built to test the performance of a range of easily installed and cost-effective sustainability features, including solar water heating.

The NOW Home tenants report that over the summer the solar water system provided all their hot water needs, with some electrical boosting required only in the cooler months.

Provisional results from monitoring show that, in the past 11 months, solar has provided approximately 55% of the tenants' water heating needs, equivalent to a saving of 2500kWh or about $425 on water heating alone.

"We know that an efficient solar water heating system can generally halve water heating costs for an average family. However, we also know the up-front costs of installing solar water heating can be high, and independent information and qualified installers can be hard to find," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"The Government is looking for a big step up in solar and wants more kiwi families and businesses to switch on to solar, so we are developing a new programme to overcome some of these barriers."

Energy and Climate Change Minister David Parker says the Government has agreed to a Green Party plan to invest in a new solar water heating programme as part of a broad approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

"I am pleased to be working closely with Jeanette Fitzsimons as we make progress on this initiative," Mr Parker said.

"Switching to solar water heating is one of the many common sense actions kiwi families can take to respond to climate change."

The discussion document looks at information provision, quality, installation capacity, and possible options for reducing costs leading to greater uptake of solar.

Ms Fitzsimons says she's interested in hearing the industry's views before decisions are made on where Government investment will achieve the best results.

"This is an opportunity to not only give solar a boost but also identify successful ideas that may in future be applied to other renewable energy or energy efficient technologies. Solar is not the only option the Government is interested in, but it's a good starting point."

David Parker says any decisions on a solar water heating programme will be aligned with other work underway to promote energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy including the Government's climate change work programmes, the development of the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the new National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy.

Final decisions on the new solar water heating programme are due to be made before the end of the year.

The discussion document is available from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) at [www.eeca.govt.nz](http://www.eeca.govt.nz/renewable-energy/solar/discussion-document.html). The closing date for responses is 29 September 2006.

\* **What is the NOW Home**  
The NOW home is a research home built to test the performance of a range of easily installed and cost-effective sustainability features. The NOW Home is the first of Beacon Pathway's collaborative, action-based research projects aiming to find affordable ways of improving the sustainability of all New Zealand homes.

Beacon Pathway is a research consortium funded by key industry organisations to help build healthy, sustainable communities by improving New Zealand's housing stock and affordability.

Beacon's consortium partners are: Building Research, Fletcher Building, New Zealand Steel, Scion (formerly Forest Research) and Waitakere City Council. Contributions from these partners are matched, dollar for dollar, by funding from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST).
