What impact does alcohol advertising have on young people's attitudes towards drinking?

That's just one of the questions being asked of the nation's youth as part of the Review of the Regulation of Alcohol Advertising announced today by Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor.

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said the government was keen to hear the opinions of young people on the review, who were being encouraged to provide their feedback through a youth-friendly version of the public discussion document.

Nanaia Mahuta said the review followed concerns about the number of people being harmed by alcohol – including young people – and was about making sure that the current rules around alcohol advertising were effective and responsible.

"While there are a number of different factors that affect drinking behaviour, we are keen to assess the level of impact that alcohol advertising may have on young peoples' attitudes towards drinking. This is why I want to encourage as many young people as possible to tell us what they think of current alcohol advertising and how it may affect them."

The review covers all forms of alcohol advertising, including, TV, radio, newspapers, billboards, posters, branding, discount specials, packaging, competitions and other forms of marketing.

The closing date for submissions is 31 October 2006. For more information about the review:
