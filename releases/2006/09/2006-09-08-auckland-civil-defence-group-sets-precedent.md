Auckland Region Civil Defence Emergency Management Group has set a precedent for the rest of New Zealand in its report on the region’s preparedness for a major disaster, Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today.

“Many lessons can be learnt from this report which takes an in-depth look at the capacity and capability of the Group and its partners to respond collectively on a region-wide basis to a major disaster,” Mr Barker said.

“The Group now has a clear understanding of its strengths and weakness and a benchmark to measure its improvements against.

"The Auckland Civil Defence and Emergency Management Group has made huge strides in the very short time it's been in existence.

"Prior to the passing of the Civil Defence and Emergency Management Act in 2002, civil defence was the responsibility of each territorial authority so the Auckland region had seven plans, one for each of its seven councils.

"A single plan for the whole Auckland region was virtually impossible.

"Now for the first time we have a regional civil defence and mangement plan that addresses the unique characteristics of the Auckland region. The report outlines the strengths and weaknesses of Auckland's preparedness, and explores ways to improve the area's capacity to manage a disaster.

“I congratulate the Auckland Group on its proactive leadership in the field of civil defence,” Mr Barker said.

The report is entitled 'Assessment of the Capacity and Capability of the Auckland Region CDEM Group to Respond to a Disaster Impacting the Auckland Region'.
