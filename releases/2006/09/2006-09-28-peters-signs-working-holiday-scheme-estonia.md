Foreign Minister Winston Peters today signed an agreement establishing a Working Holiday Scheme between New Zealand and Estonia.

Mr Peters signed the agreement during a meeting with his Estonian counterpart Urmas Paet in the capital, Tallinn.

“This scheme enables young people from both New Zealand and Estonia to experience each other’s countries and cultures, and to build important people-to-people links between the two nations,” Mr Peters said.

“Our relations with the new European Union states are continuing to develop, and schemes such as this will help increase contact and understanding.

“The scheme is the first of what we hope will be several working holiday schemes covering the northern EU nations of Poland and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," Mr Peters said.

New Zealand now has working holiday schemes with 14 European countries. All the schemes allow people aged between 18 and 30 to travel and work for a year in the host country.
