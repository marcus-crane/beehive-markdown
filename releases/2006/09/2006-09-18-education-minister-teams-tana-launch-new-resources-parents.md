Helping parents get more involved in their children's learning is the aim of a new booklet and website enhancement launched today by Education Minister Steve Maharey and Team-Up Education Ambassador, Tana Umaga.

The new resources - launched on a visit to Wainuiomata Primary School today – are the latest addition to the government's Team-Up campaign, which encourages parents to support their children’s learning.

"The Labour-led government is committed to supporting parents to take an active role in their child's education," Steve Maharey said.

"Research shows that when parents, families and whanau are involved children have a much better chance of succeeding in their education.

"These resources provide practical ideas and advice for parents to help them support their kids in and out of school.

"The new booklet provides information tips on how parents can support kids in their learning. Parents will find information on how to support kids with their homework, ideas for reading at home, advice on choosing a school, and much more.

"Parents can also get easy access to information on their local schools through the new School Directory section of the Team-Up website. This area includes information on school population, student achievement, learning areas offered, the school’s location and contact details which are now all in one place."

Tana Umaga says a little bit of time spent every day supporting children in their learning can make a big difference.

"The most valuable thing parents have to give their children is time. Learning doesn't start at nine and finish at three. It has to start before and go on after that," Tana Umaga said.

"As parents we all want to see our children do well. They have a better chance of succeeding if we know what they are doing at school and if we are getting involved in activities."

Steve Maharey says recent research on Team-Up shows many parents are already getting more involved in their child's education as a result of the campaign (details attached). To view School Directory and the new Team Up booklet visit [www.teamup.govt.nz](http://www.teamup.govt.nz)
