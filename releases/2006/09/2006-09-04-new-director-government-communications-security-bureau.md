Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the appointment of Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson as Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau ([GCSB](http://www.GCSB.govt.nz/)).

Air Marshal Ferguson will take up his new role when the current Director, Dr Warren Tucker, takes up [his new role as Director of Security](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26113) on 1 November 2006. Mr Ferguson’s term of appointment is for four years.

Helen Clark said Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who is currently the Acting Director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, retired earlier this year from a distinguished military career which culminated in four years as Chief of Defence Force.

“Air Marshal Ferguson is a skilled leader with strong relationship management abilities. He has proved himself in a demanding chief executive role as the Chief of Defence Force, and has a strong track record of achievement.

“He is experienced at senior levels in the security and intelligence community, with a sound understanding of security and intelligence matters, and a good understanding of the role of Director, GCSB,” Helen Clark said.

The Director is the Chief Executive of the GCSB and is responsible directly to the Minister in Charge of the Bureau (by convention the Prime Minister). The GCSB contributes to the security of New Zealand through the provision of timely foreign signals intelligence to the Government and assisting government agencies to protect their electronic information resources and communications systems.
