Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated the Black Ferns for their third consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup win today.

"The Black Ferns have dominated international women's rugby for many years, and have set the standards for other nations to follow.

"It was fantastic that they continued that dominance today with a hard-fought 25-17 win over England at Edmonton, Canada.

"Three world cup wins in succession is a tremendous achievement. I congratulate the team, coaches, and management," Helen Clark said.
