A new super high-speed internet link between New Zealand universities and research organisations has been launched in Auckland by Prime Minister, Helen Clark, Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey and Communications Minister, David Cunliffe.

Helen Clark said the $43 million Advanced Network, which went live this evening, would significantly enhance the range and quality of research scientists are able to do in New Zealand.

"An investment in this kind of digital infrastructure is crucial to ensuring we can to attract and retain the best scientists and researchers and continue to produce world-leading science," Helen Clark said.

"The Advanced Network gives Kiwi scientists access to new tools and techniques, and allows them to participate in real time collaborations with their colleagues around the world."

The $43 million investment from government will cover the costs of the Network during the establishment period of around four years, this investment will be matched by the members, which include tertiary institutes, CRIs and the National Library.

The network will comprise an optical fibre 'backbone' linking universities and research institutions in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin as well as connections to the Hawkes Bay, Nelson and Rotorua.

Steve Maharey said the focus of the Advanced Network would be on increasing the capability of research institutions to access data in real-time and be more connected both nationally and globally

"Initially, it will be used by the members. As capabilities develop, others will have the opportunity to come on board, for example schools, libraries, museums and others researchers.

"Government departments, hospitals, private firms, and international networks will also have the opportunity to collaborate with members for education and research purposes."

David Cunliffe said the network was an important part of the Government’s Digital Strategy, aimed at ensuring New Zealand is a world leading in using information and technology to increase productivity and realise New Zealand’s economic, environmental, social and cultural goals.

“The Advanced Network, with its super-high-speed links, promises to help transform the economy by lifting the standard of our researchers and enabling new technology to be developed here in New Zealand.”
