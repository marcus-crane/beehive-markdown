Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson today gave credit to the work of social workers around the country, including more than 1150 front-line social workers at Child, Youth and Family (CYF).

“National Social Workers Day is a great opportunity to recognise the work that social workers do, at a time when the workforce is moving towards greater professionalisation through social worker registration,” Ms Dyson said.

“Many people don’t realise that social workers can choose to work in a wide range of areas. In Child, Youth and Family alone, the social work options are diverse, including youth justice, care and protection, adoptions, social workers in schools and new initiatives such as family safety teams. This work makes a real difference to our communities.”

According to 2001 Census data, there were 10,400 social workers working in the statutory, health and community sectors, with CYF as one of the largest employers.

“Child, Youth and Family social workers are faced with many difficult situations, often involving family violence, substance abuse, anger and mental health issues. They make critical decisions under rigid time pressures working under the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act.

“In spite of growing numbers of notifications and unprecedented demand for their services, their productivity has improved and the number of unallocated cases has fallen dramatically. National Social Workers Day is an opportunity to congratulate them, and all social workers, for their hard work in helping so many families and turning around so many young lives.”
