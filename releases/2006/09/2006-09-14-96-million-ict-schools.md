Another 174 schools will join a nationwide programme to transform learning through innovative use of ICT, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"The government will invest $9.6 million over the next three years to support 30 clusters of schools with plans to put ICT at the heart of their teaching programmes," Steve Maharey said.

"Around two-thirds of schools have been involved in this programme since it began in 1999. As a result schools are using technology to make teaching more exciting and innovative, and to lift standards for all students.

"Each cluster has access to a national online network, ICT resources, professional development, and support from a professional facilitator. "

Steve Maharey made the announcement on a visit to Sancta Maria College today. The school is part of a cluster with Elim College and Lady Star of the Sea. They will use web technologies to share information with the wider community about the schools’ vision and goals. They will also have access to interactive whiteboards in the classroom

Other initiatives being funded in the latest round include:

- A group of five South Auckland schools working with students to develop 'e-portfolios' of their work to help with the often challenging transition from primary to intermediate school
- Two North Shore schools in Auckland working to create computer games that integrate learning across subjects
- A group of nine rural South Island primary schools exploring with their students and their families Digital stories using digital video and audio, email, blogging and digital imaging
- Two Secondary schools in the South Island using ICT to increase the range of courses available for students
- A group of eight primary schools in Christchurch using voice over internet and online chatrooms to share teaching ideas and information

Steve Maharey said the Labour-led government had invested more than $300 million since 2000.

"Almost all children now have access to ICT and the learning opportunities it offers, including broadband access to every school gate."

The government will provide more than $30 million over the next three years to support ICT clusters in schools. Each cluster receives funding of $320,000 over three years.
