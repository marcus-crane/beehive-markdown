The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society is being mischievous in suggesting the tenure review of Marlborough high country station Blairich is a done deal, says Land Information Minister David Parker.

"In fact, the process still has some way to go before any final offer is made to the lessee."

Public submissions on the preliminary proposal for Blairich closed on 4 September.

"The submissions on the preliminary proposal will now be evaluated before any substantive proposal is put to the lessees," Mr Parker said. "That may take several months."

"In addition, I have asked to see all future tenure review proposals before they become final."

" No doubt Forest & Bird will have made their concerns known through the submissions process, and they will be carefully considered."
