The [Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MWA)](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/) is to lead a trans-Tasman research project on the economic effects of the different work that men and women do, Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

Speaking to the [National Council of Women's](http://www.ncwnz.co.nz/) national conference in Invercargill, Lianne Dalziel told delegates the New Zealand initiative had been approved at the annual Australasian Minister’s conference on the status of women (MINCO) earlier this week.

“MINCO administers a fund to be used for work that can benefit the improvement of the status of women in both countries. New Zealand put forward a research proposal to explore whether or not occupational segregation has an impact on key economic outcomes, such as productivity, and the Ministers from Australia agreed it was valuable work,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Sex-role stereotyping of jobs may have disadvantages for the whole economy, as well as limiting choices for both men and women at a personal level, Lianne Dalziel said.

"This research will help us understand the linkages between occupational segregation and economic performance, and will be useful when developing policy," she said.

The Ministry of Women’s Affairs will approach the [Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/home/0,2987,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html) to commission this work. The OECD has access to extensive relevant data from many countries and has the expertise to undertake the analysis.

The fund will provide $50,000 Australian dollars towards the cost of the research.

“This is an excellent example Australia and New Zealand working together to achieve shared goals. The research will contribute to the economic and social goals of the people of both countries. Ensuring that women who want to be involved in the paid workforce have good choices benefits them, and benefits men, families and children too,” Lianne Dalziel said.
