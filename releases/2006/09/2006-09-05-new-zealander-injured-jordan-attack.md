Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed deep concern at the attack on tourists in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in which a British man was killed and a New Zealand woman was seriously injured.

"This attack, on a group of tourists visiting a Roman amphitheatre in central Amman, is very worrying and my thoughts are with the injured New Zealander and all others caught up in this dreadful attack," Helen Clark said.

"The injured New Zealander has undergone surgery in a hospital in Amman and has been able to talk to her family. Three other New Zealanders who were part of the group, which came under attack by the lone gunman, are uninjured. Four other tourists were injured in the attack.

"All the families of the New Zealanders, who were on an organised tour of the region, have been notified.

"New Zealand has an Honorary Consul in Amman. His staff are working with officials from the British Embassy to provide assistance and support to the injured New Zealander and the other New Zealanders involved.

"The Jordanian Government has expressed deep sorrow at the incident, which is now under investigation," Helen Clark said.
