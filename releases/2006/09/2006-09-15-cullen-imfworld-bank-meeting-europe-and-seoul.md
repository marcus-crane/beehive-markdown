Finance Minister Michael Cullen leaves on Monday for Singapore for the annual IMF/World Bank meeting before heading to several European capitals and Seoul.

"The IMF meeting will be an important opportunity to further press the case for a resumption in the stalled Doha talks. As I said at the recent APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in Hanoi, a multilateral trade deal is critical if we are to maximise the opportunities for world economic growth.

"It is especially important for a primary exporter such as New Zealand and I will be urging the larger economies to show leadership in helping to break the deadlock.

"The IMF meeting will also address reform issues for the fund so that developing nations can secure a larger voice. New Zealand believes this is important."

On Wednesday 20 September Dr Cullen will address key investors at a business breakfast hosted by LGT Bank of Liechtenstein and later meet with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

Dr Cullen arrives in London on Thursday 21 September for a series of meetings with investors and economists, including a call on the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King.

He will also deliver a speech at the NZ High Commission on Friday 22 September to an audience of expats and those with business ties to New Zealand.

Dr Cullen then travels to Brussels for a series of meetings with European Commission officials on financial and tertiary education issues.

In Paris the Minister will meet the OECD's chief economist Jean-Phillippe Costis and French education experts.

Dr Cullen travels to Seoul on Sunday 1 October. He will meet Kwon Okyu, the Republic of Korea's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister and Le Jong-Seo, the Vice-Minister for Education.

Korea is a significant education market for New Zealand being the second biggest source of international students for universities and polytechnics and accounting for nearly half of international school students.

Dr Cullen returns to New Zealand on 4 October.
