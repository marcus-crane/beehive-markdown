Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban is encouraging Pacific people to take part in the Ministry of Health's national population survey if they are approached.

The 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey is the Ministry of Health's biggest national population survey, which is aimed at measuring the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders. The National Research Bureau will choose addresses at random from selected areas throughout New Zealand.

The survey will cover questions that range from what health services people use, to how often people exercise and visit their GPs.

"About 1000 Pacific adults and 400 Pacific children will be asked to take part in the survey over the next 12 months," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"I encourage those Pacific people approached to take part in the survey because the information is used to make important decisions about our health system, programmes and services.

"It is really important that Pacific voices are recorded, and for Pacific people to tell their stories. Our people have higher rates of some diseases than other groups, and we want accurate information to be able to better serve their health needs.

"National Research Bureau interviewers will wear a badge with photo identification, and have a reference telephone number to establish they are a genuine interviewer. The interviewers will have copies of the New Zealand Health Survey information brochure, which are available in Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island Maori, Fijian and Niuean. Interpreters for interviews can also be arranged,'" Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.
