Judith Collins has once again misled the New Zealand public with her recent comments on the serious issue of stress related illness, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“The National Party knows they can’t attack the [government’s success in moving people off benefits and into work](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26383). Ms Collins is resorting to making misleading comments about a very small group of people with high needs,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The Labour-led Government has succeeded in reducing stress related sickness benefit numbers. Ms Collins would know this if she had read the answers provided to the Social Services Select Committee's question on this matter in June.

“Work and Income's [well publicised](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25557) [New Service Approach](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-04-27.html) is successfully helping both existing and new Sickness Benefit clients access work opportunities. This fundamental change has been launched publicly as well as [discussed at the Social Services Select Committee](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/SB%20IB%20Stress.pdf) of which she is a member. Surely Ms Collins’ implied ignorance on this subject can't just be an oversight.

“Contrary to Ms Collins claims that nothing is being done, she has withheld a wealth of information contained in answers to recent written parliamentary questions on specific steps taken to assist Work and Income clients with mental health issues, including programmes like Procare and Workwise.

“Ms Collins has already been caught out on her previous [misleading statements about PATHS](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26582) and benefit numbers, as have her colleagues [Jo Goodhew and Craig Foss](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27059). When will the National Party ever get it right?

“If Ms Collins spent more time keeping the public, and herself properly informed on these issues, her party would have more credibility,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The Labour-led government is committed to getting New Zealanders off benefits and into employment. This has been proven by the [fall in total benefit numbers](http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/media-information/benefit-factsheets/headline-benefit-numbers-jun-06.doc) by 30% since 1999.

“It’s obvious the National Party doesn’t like success. But it’s a shame they must resort to misinformation on such serious issues.”
