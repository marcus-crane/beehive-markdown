Climate change minister David Parker today congratulated the Queenstown Lakes District Council and the Otago Regional Council, for proactively responding to climate change.

Mr Parker said he hoped the community would carefully consider the councils' draft strategy to manage flood risk around Lakes Wakatipu and Wanaka.

The government is committed to reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions, but some climate change is inevitable, and must be prepared for, Mr Parker said.

"We know from bitter experience that floods can cause millions of dollars in damage, as well as heartache for business and home owners."

"Flood events are likely to increase in frequency with climate change. Therefore, the sensible approach is to keep that in mind in the planning, design and location of our expensive infrastructure."
