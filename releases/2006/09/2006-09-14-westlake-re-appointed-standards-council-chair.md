Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the re-appointment of Richard Westlake as a member and Chair of the Standards Council for a term of three years.

Richard Westlake has been a director on many state sector boards and is a governance and strategy consultant.

“Mr Westlake has capably chaired the Council since his first appointment in 2003 and I am confident that he will continue to do well and take the Council forward as the government undertakes a review of New Zealand’s standards and conformance infrastructure,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Richard Westlake also chairs Better Border Biosecurity, a research programme under the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, and is chair of Textiles New Zealand Inc. He is a director of Kiwibank Ltd and Wellington Water Management. He has previously chaired two state-owned enterprises, Quotable Value Ltd, and Meteorological Service of New Zealand Ltd, and was deputy chair of the Crown research institute, GNS Science.

The Standards Council’s primary functions are to develop standards, and to promote, encourage and facilitate the use of standards, which benefit all New Zealanders by improving safety, quality, prosperity and convenience.

Standards are developed across a wide range of sectors – including building, engineering, health and disability, electricity and gas – by committees of expert representatives, who voluntarily contribute knowledge and expertise. Professional and consumer bodies are able to nominate members to the Council ensuring a broad representation of membership.
