The government will provide $2 million towards the establishment of a Geospatial Research Centre in Christchurch that will carry out commercially relevant research for the rapidly evolving geospatial industry, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The centre is a partnership between the University of Canterbury, the University of Nottingham, and Canterbury Development Corporation. It will be established within Canterbury University’s recently announced New Zealand ICT Innovation Institute (UCi3).

"Geospatial technology involves the gathering, storage, processing and use of data that is referenced to geographical location, and has many applications in New Zealand. Some of our companies are already developing world-class capability in this area. Research at the new centre will help increase revenues, reduce costs, and enhance productivity in a variety of industries, delivering an estimated net economic benefit of $63 million over 10 years," Trevor Mallard said.

A key focus of the Labour-led government is economic transformation - working with business and sector groups to deliver a high income, high-wage, export-led economy through growing more globally competitive firms, and the geospatial centre is a step towards this.

The Geospatial Research Centre will include a focus on technologies associated with gathering geospatial data, complementing New Zealand’s existing strengths in the analysis and use of such information. Geospatial technology has potential applications in activities as diverse as surveying, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture and global positioning systems.

The centre will establish strong linkages with industry to ensure it delivers clear commercial benefits. A number of the centre’s key potential customers are located in Canterbury. Many have expressed an interest in supporting the centre and 25 potential projects have already been outlined.

"The centre provides a unique opportunity for Canterbury and New Zealand to gain a competitive advantage by accessing world-class knowledge in a developing industry and using it to benefit industry, tertiary education institutions and research bodies.

"It will encourage local reinvestment, assist with product development, and provide opportunities to those businesses providing products and research services to the geospatial industry," Trevor Mallard said.
