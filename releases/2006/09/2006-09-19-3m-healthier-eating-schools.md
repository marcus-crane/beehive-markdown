Education Minister Steve Maharey, and Green Party Health Spokesperson, Sue Kedgley, today announced a new $3 million a year Nutrition Fund to help schools and early childhood education services become healthier eating environments for children.

The funding was secured by the Green Party as part of its post-election agreement with the government. It will be available from term one next year and will support initiatives that achieve healthy eating such as promoting healthier choices in the school canteen or lunch order system, shared fruit breaks for students, and water only schools.

Steve Maharey says the nutrition fund will encourage early childhood education services and schools to think about their whole school environment, work alongside other schools, and involve students in planning and decision-making. This might include the provision of training and professional development for teachers and food preparers, information for parents, and other initiatives."

Sue Kedgley says the funding will assist in lifting the quality of food available for sale at schools, and at the same time support the health and well-being of our children, and their ability to learn.

"The Nutrition Fund is aimed at helping schools and early childhood services to improve their food environment so that only healthy, nutritious foods are sold and promoted, and children are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to make healthy food choices inside and outside school, and hopefully throughout their lives,” Ms Kedgley says.

The funding will be administered through District Health Boards (DHBs) and the Healthy Eating Healthy Action groups based in the 21 districts in collaboration with others who work with schools. Clusters of schools and/or early childhood education centres will be invited to apply for funding by developing and submitting project proposals. Each proposal will be considered against priorities identified at a community level.  
Examples of project proposals could include:

- Training and support for teachers to strengthen food and nutrition teaching
- Training and support for canteen managers and early childhood education service food preparers to promote healthy food choices in school canteens
- Initiation of a morning fruit break
- Installation of water filters in classrooms

The $3 million a year Nutrition Fund has been allocated under the 2006/07 Budget.
