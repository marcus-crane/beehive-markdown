The retirement age for all judges is to be set at 70, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today.

Since 1980 the compulsory retirement age for all judges has been 68.

"The move will assist the retention of our most experienced and capable judges and encourage recruitment of senior practitioners," said Dr Cullen. "People expect to live and work longer these days and judges are no different.

"The change will also bring New Zealand into line with comparative jurisdictions overseas such as Australia and the United Kingdom."

Legislation giving effect to the change will be introduced to Parliament later this year.
