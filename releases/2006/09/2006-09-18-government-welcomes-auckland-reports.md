Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed two reports released today which confirm the importance of Auckland to the rest of New Zealand.

“We welcome the Committee for Auckland reports which line up well with our own thinking.”

“This government recognises that Auckland is a national asset – that’s why Auckland is a key part of our economic transformation strategy,” says Judith Tizard.

“As well as being home to 34% of all New Zealanders, Auckland is our hub and international gateway, it’s our largest commercial centre and wealth creator. Auckland is home to many of New Zealand’s new industries – especially the creative, ICT and biotechnology sectors.

The Minister says government will continue to build on Auckland’s strengths and to create partnerships with local government, business and the community.

One report estimates Auckland’s net contribution to the New Zealand economy to have been $3.8 billion in 2005. Judith Tizard says it’s no surprise that Auckland is a net contributor given its size and importance to our economy.

“Metro regions like Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Hamilton are generally net contributors. It’s also consistent with major metropolitan centres in other OECD countries including London.

"Many of our large corporates are also based in Auckland which may well skew the results".

“This Labour-led government is proud of its focus and record investment in the Auckland region. In this year alone we are investing nearly $559 million on Auckland’s roads and public transport. We are working to remove the infrastructure constraints which have held Auckland back.

“We welcome this and other initiatives which help to get Auckland working effectively. We all want Auckland to become an internationally competitive, world class city – as well as a great place to live and work.”
