World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September highlights the burden of suicide and the importance of prevention efforts. The theme this year is “with understanding, new hope”, which focuses on translating knowledge and research into practical programmes and activities.

Around the globe an estimated one million people die by suicide each year, according to The World Health Organisation. That equates to a global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000 or one death every 40 seconds. But it is estimated that there are 10-20 times as many suicide attempts as suicide deaths.

In 2003 (the most recent data available), 515 people died by suicide in New Zealand or a rate of 11.5 per 100,000.

Mr Anderton said the suicide of a single person could have a profound impact on whanau, friends and the wider community. Sadly, those bereaved by suicide could themselves be at risk of attempting to take their own life.

The Government has invested $1 million a year over three years to provide support for families and friends after a suicide or suicide attempt, and to reduce the risk of further suicides.

"Most people turn to family/whanau and friends for support. However, they should also be able to obtain more formal support if they need it. The overall goal of this initiative is to provide information, training and services to meet the needs of family/whanau, friends, and others following a suicide or suicide attempt,” Jim Anderton, Associate Health Minister said.

"The initiative is backed up by a series of research reports to ensure that our approach is evidence-based, will make a difference, follows on from other support for families initiatives and is part of a range of work underway to try and prevent suicide in New Zealand,

"Our priority is always to prevent suicide. One suicide is one suicide too many. But it is also important to acknowledge that when this is not possible we need to look after those who are left behind,'' said Jim Anderton.

The Ministry of Health is currently evaluating proposals for the "Support for Families" programme, and it will be fully established early next year. This programme will boost prevention work happening around the country. Some of the initiatives already underway include training on suicide prevention guidelines for emergency departments and mental health services, expanding community development sites to address Maori suicide and adapting, through Lifeline, the ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) programme for a New Zealand setting (this is a two day skills-based workshop that equips caregivers for an effective suicide intervention role).

These initiatives are part of a co-ordinated approach aimed at providing a continuum of support for New Zealanders.

If you are concerned about someone who may be suicidal or is very distressed, there are a number of services you can approach. They include your primary health care provider or general practitioner (GP), community mental health service, Mâori community health service and counselling services such as school counsellors or family counsellors.

There is evidence which has shown that some types of reporting on suicide can result in an increase in suicides. Please refer to the Ministry of Health booklet Suicide and The Media: The Reporting and Portrayal of Suicide in the Media - A Resource.

Some useful phone numbers are:  
Lifeline - 0800 111 777  
Samaritans - 0800 726 666  
Youthline - 0800 376 633

In an emergency, anyone seriously concerned about an individual's immediate safety should remain with them until appropriate support arrives, remove any obvious means of suicide (guns, medication, cars, knives, rope etc), contact your nearest hospital or psychiatric emergency services/ mental health crisis assessment team.
