The passing of the Employment Relations Amendment Bill means a fairer deal for vulnerable workers affected by restructuring, said Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson.

"The passing of the legislation underlines the Labour-led government's commitment to protecting specified ‘vulnerable’ employees such as cleaners and food catering service workers."

The legislation amends Part 6A of the Employment Relations Act to clarify protections for employees who are affected by the sale or transfer of a business, or contracting out of work.

"The terms and conditions of employment of these specified employees have successively been undermined when the work they do is contracted out, transferred or sold to another business, or brought back in-house.

Under this legislation if a vulnerable employee is to be affected when their employer loses a contract for services, they will have the right to choose to transfer to the business that takes over that work, on their existing terms and conditions.

"The Labour-led government’s policies with regard to vulnerable employees have not changed since additional protection was first introduced in 2004. This legislation ensures that the original policy intent of those amendments to the Employment Relations Act is delivered on."

Further amendments proposed in a Supplementary Order Paper will require the disclosure of labour costs to potential new employers wishing to take over a new business or new contract. Potential risks will be minimised for businesses deciding whether to restructure as they will not have to ‘tender blind’ for contracts affected by this legislation.

"This legislation balances protections for those employees who are most vulnerable, with rights for businesses who will be subject to additional obligations. It will not implement a large-scale shift in employment rights; instead, it will deliver on what Parliament intended in 2004."
