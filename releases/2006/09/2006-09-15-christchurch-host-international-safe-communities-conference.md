Minister for ACC Ruth Dyson has welcomed the news that Christchurch City Council has won the bid to host the 17th International Safe Communities Conference in 2008.

"The hosting of the conference is timely as Christchurch will also be seeking accreditation as a World Health Organisation Safe Community in 2008," said Ruth Dyson.

The Safer Christchurch Strategy was launched last year with the aim of aligning injury prevention, road safety and crime prevention with the goal of Christchurch becoming the safest city in New Zealand.

If accreditation is granted as planned in 2008, the ceremony to confer the WHO Safe Community designation will take place during the conference.

"I congratulate Christchurch Mayor Garry Moore on his initiative in seeking accreditation and on securing such a prestigious conference for the city, in partnership with the Safe Communities Foundation New Zealand," said Ruth Dyson.

"The drive to become a WHO Safe Community fits in well with the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy. This Labour-led government is committed to providing a strategic direction for improved collaboration between community groups, non-government organisations and government agencies to achieve injury prevention goals.

"We must continue to work together to raise awareness about injury prevention issues in the workplace, the community and the home."

Five New Zealand communities have already been designated as a Safe Community as part of the WHO Safe Community Network - Waimakariri, Wellington, New Plymouth, Waitakere and Whangarei.
