Finance Minister Michael Cullen has called on the Finance Ministers of APEC to urgently push for a resumption in the stalled Doha round of trade talks.

Dr Cullen was speaking at the 13th Annual APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.

At the meeting the IMF expressed optimism about the global economic outlook, forecasting 5 per cent annual growth over the next two years.

However, Dr Cullen told ministers there were a number of risks that threaten that optimism.

“As a primary exporter we are concerned that the Doha round has yet to reach a successful conclusion. If the talks are not resumed there is a serious risk the goal of greater trade liberalisation will suffer and we will have to rely on less adequate bilateral deals,” Dr Cullen told the meeting.

“If that happens we will not realise the huge potential for world economic growth that would flow if Doha succeeds.

“Large economies which are holding up Doha need to thrash out a solution,” said Dr Cullen.

Dr Cullen also urged APEC Finance Ministers to show leadership on the issue of global warming which could also affect the economic outlook. He told the ministers that New Zealand was already seeing severe climatic events.

“We need a more effective international agreement binding all nations,” Dr Cullen said at the meeting. “This is important not only for New Zealand, but also for our Pacific neighbours which arguably are more vulnerable.

“I am heartened that the importance of global warming was also stressed at the meeting by delegates from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. We need leadership at the highest levels if we are to achieve progress on this critical issue,” said Dr Cullen.

The Finance Minister was attending his sixth APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting. APEC leaders gather for their annual summit in Hanoi in November.
