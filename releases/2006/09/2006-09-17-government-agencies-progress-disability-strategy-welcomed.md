Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the release of 41 work plans by government agencies detailing the practical ways in which they are implementing the New Zealand Disability Strategy.

"These annual Disability Strategy implementation plans are focused on activity that will make a real difference in the lives of disabled people," said Ruth Dyson.

"This year the Office for Disability Issues asked each government agency to develop implementation plans using an approach that will better reflect their actual level of responsibility for implementing the Disability Strategy.

"Government agencies that have key social policy responsibilities, in areas that have a large impact on the lives of disabled people, are planning significant improvements to their services this year," Ruth Dyson said.

These include:

- Child, Youth and Family are developing a service for supporting disabled parents, in particular those with intellectual disability, who are in contact with CYF.
- The Department of Labour is working with the Ministries of Education and Social Development, and the Tertiary Education Commission, on ensuring that young people leaving school, including disabled youth, are engaged in education, training, work or other options leading to economic independence.
- The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is working with NZ On Air and TVNZ on their plans for improving deaf people’s access to public broadcasting services.

"The vision of the Strategy and of the Labour-led government is that we will live in a non-disabling society, where disabled people can say they feel valued and are able to fully participate in all areas of their lives including employment, economic development, education, and quality living in the community," said Ms Dyson.

The plans are available from the Office for Disability Issues, which is responsible for co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the New Zealand Disability Strategy and can be viewed on the Office’s website at [www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/work-plans/2006-07/index.html](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/work-plans/2006-07/index.html).

**Background**

The New Zealand Disability Strategy was launched in 2001. The Strategy provides a framework for promoting inclusion and participation of disabled people.

In developing the New Zealand Disability Strategy, there was extensive consultation with disabled people from all over New Zealand. The Strategy, for the first time, gives government a framework to address disability issues across agencies, policies, services and legislation.

Each government agency is required to provide an annual implementation plan relating to the Disability Strategy: that is, a work plan, with goals and actions, which sets out how the agency is to implement the Disability Strategy over the coming year. They are then required to report annually on their progress in carrying out their work plans over the past year.

Other highlights from this year’s reports include:

The Ministry of Education the progressing the Better Information to Address Barriers to Learning project, which provides teachers with better resources to help identify and address educational barriers to learning in children.

The Ministry of Health is providing more support to enable disabled people to live as others do in their homes and community.

The Ministry of Social Development is leading inter-agency work aimed at implementing New Zealand Sign Language interpreter standards, for use in criminal justice settings. They are also working to facilitate changes to the Enduring Power of Attorney legislation, aimed at protecting the property and personal rights of older people, especially disabled older people.

The State Services Commission is working to ensure the accessibility of government websites and continuing to promote Equal Employment Opportunities for disabled people, through providing related guidance and assistance to government agencies.

The 2006/2007 NZDS implementation plans are now available on the Office’s website, at [www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/work-plans/2006-07/index.html](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/work-plans/2006-07/index.html)
