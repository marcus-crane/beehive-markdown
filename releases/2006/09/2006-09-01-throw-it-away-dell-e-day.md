People who have old, unwanted computer equipment can dispose of it for free on 2 September at the Westpac Stadium.

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Minister for Information Technology David Cunliffe are urging people around the Wellington region to take advantage of New Zealand’s first free computer recycling collection.

“The [Dell computer company](http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ap/topics/main/en/recycle?c=nz&l=en&s=bsd) invites the public to bring to the Stadium any brand of computer, monitor, printer and even mice and drop them off to be recycled and disposed of in an environmentally safe way,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“I congratulate Dell on their commitment to recycling and for setting an example of how industry can manage the environmental impact of the goods they produce, from product development through to end use,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

Dell’s initiative is an example of product stewardship, one of the [Ministry for the Environment’s](http://www.mfe.govt.nz) major work programmes to deal with waste. It is based on producers, brand owners, importers, retailers, consumers and other parties accepting responsibility for the environmental effects of their products – from the time they are produced until they are disposed of.

The government is developing policy to further encourage product stewardship. For example, the Ministry for the Environment is working with different industries to develop voluntary, industry-led product stewardship schemes.

At a meeting earlier this month Ministry representatives, local government and key industries, discussed options on how to divert computer equipment and televisions from landfills and into the recycling stream.

Mr Benson-Pope said a promising result of this meeting is a further commitment from industry for producer responsibility of electronic and electrical equipment.

Mr Cunliffe said it is encouraging to see industry working to find practical ways to improve environmental management of waste in New Zealand.

A [UMR survey](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/waste/eee-survey-report-jan06/eee-survey-report-jan06-1-main-report.pdf#search=%22UMR%20survey%20january%22) in January showed 77% of New Zealand households have at least one computer, with 38% of households replacing their computer every two to five years.
