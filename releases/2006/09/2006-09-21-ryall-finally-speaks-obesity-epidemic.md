Health Minister Pete Hodgson has congratulated Tony Ryall for making his first public comments on obesity after a year of intense public discussion on the issue.

Pete Hodgson said he hopes the National Party health spokesman will finally take time to engage on what is the biggest public health challenge facing New Zealand families.

“2006 has seen a thoughtful yet urgent public discussion about the threat of obesity,” Pete Hodgson said. “New Zealanders are on track to be the first people in the world to confront this epidemic with the energy and commitment that it requires.

“Today’s announcement of the Labour-led government’s Mission On package has been welcomed by the New Zealand Medical Association, the Heart Foundation, teachers groups, the Food Industry Group and others.”

Despite the wide public support for Mission On, the package has been attacked by the National Party.

“I’m disappointed that Tony Ryall and the National Party have found themselves so out of touch once again, but heartened that they finally realise that this is an issue to pay attention to. Most New Zealanders have known that for some time.”
