Health Minister Pete Hodgson has announced new Chair and board member appointments at Wairarapa and Nelson Marlborough district health boards.

Bob Francis will be the new Chair of the board of Wairarapa DHB and Ian MacLennan has been appointed to the board of Nelson Marlborough DHB.

Mr Francis is the current Mayor of Masterton. His term as Mayor began in 1986. Mr Francis’ appointment as member and Chair of the Wairarapa DHB takes effect on 28 November 2006.

Mr Francis has extensive experience in the business and governance areas, through his former roles and appointed offices with the Ministry of Health, the Universal College of Learning (UCOL), Skill New Zealand, Works and Development Services Corporation Ltd and more recently, the International Rugby Board’s Referee Selection Panel.

Mr MacLennan is a self-employed business service contractor from Nelson, with an established background as a chartered, cost and management accountant and has extensive governance experience. His appointment takes effect on 1 October 2006.

Mr MacLennan’s significant background in governance also includes a number of honorary and elected positions. He was a Ministerial appointee to the Council of Nelson Polytechnic (now the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology) and member of the Ministry of Education’s District Property Advisory Committee.

"Bob Francis and Ian MacLennan will bring substantial governance experience to their respective positions," Pete Hodgson said.

"I look forward to working with both Mr Francis and Mr MacLennan to improve health outcomes for the residents of the Wairarapa and Nelson Marlborough DHBs."

Pete Hodgson also thanked Mr Doug Matheson, the Wairarapa board’s former Chair, for his outstanding work during the last six years.
