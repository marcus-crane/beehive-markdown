Land Information Minister David Parker today announced the reappointment of members to the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board ([CSLB](http://www.cslb.org.nz/)) of New Zealand.

“These members have served on the Board since it was established in 2002, and I am pleased with the service they have given,” he said.
