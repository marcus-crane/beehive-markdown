Promoting healthy eating and encouraging Kiwi kids to become more active is the focus of a new action plan for schools and early childhood education services, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The plan is part of [Mission-On](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27181), a new $67 million government-wide campaign that aims to tackle obesity by improving nutrition and reversing declining levels of physical activity among young Kiwis.

"The government will invest $28 million in major new initiatives that support schools and early childhood services to promote healthy eating, and teach skills and attitudes that encourage kids to be active throughout their lives," Steve Maharey said.

"As Kiwis, we often portray ourselves as sports-loving and active. It's of huge concern that New Zealand children are following a global trend in declining levels of physical activity and increasing obesity from a very young age. Poor nutrition is associated with lower academic achievement and poor school attendance.

"Schools and early childhood services, along with parents and communities, have an important role in ensuring children gain the skills and habits they need for a healthy life.

"While many schools and early childhood services have already made major changes, more needs to be done and the wider community also need to be engaged and take responsibility."

Initiatives specific to schools and early childhood services will include:

- Changes to the National Administration Guidelines, requiring school boards to develop policies that promote and achieve healthy nutrition, and reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and drinks
- New guidelines to help schools provide healthy food options, including a food and drink classification system
- A regional [Nutrition Fund](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27152) available to schools, which will support the implementation of guidelines (this initiative is part of an agreement with the Green Party)
- A social marketing campaign, including a toolkit for schools to use, national and local advertising and research on the effectiveness of the campaign
- Professional development support for teachers to strengthen and improve the teaching of food and nutrition education
- Work to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods within early childhood services
- A programme of high-profile events to encourage students to get involved in learning about nutrition.

In addition to initiatives announced today, the government has several existing programmes in place to enhance physical activity in schools.
