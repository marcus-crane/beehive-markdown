Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson today welcomed the release of two reports about workplace partnership and is encouraging employers, employees and unions to use them as a springboard for closer workplace relations.

"Both reports contain valuable information for New Zealand businesses, employees and their representative groups, and confirm that traditional ways of organising work aren't necessarily the best ways of managing our workplaces into the future," said Ruth Dyson.

The reports from the Partnership Resource Centre of the Department of Labour show the benefits of working together in a constructive way, Ms Dyson said.

"With record high numbers of people in work and low levels of unemployment, workplaces need to adapt to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges of this new-look labour market."

"The dramatic changes in the labour market over the past six years require a new, more collaborative approach from employers, unions and staff, if we are to achieve the goal of a high-performing productive economy," Ms Dyson said.

The first report, Stocktake on Workplace Partnership in New Zealand, shows employers and unions are more willing to work together than common perception would suggest. Benefits of working in partnership include innovation, productivity growth, improved service delivery and more satisfied staff.

The second report, International Experiences of Partnership, looks at four countries - Denmark, Norway, Ireland and the United Kingdom - and the benefits they have experienced from partnership approaches. The report provides useful lessons of how successful workplace partnerships can be developed in New Zealand.

"I encourage employers, employees and unions to talk to each other and look for new ways to incorporate partnership approaches into our workplaces, and thereby increase productivity and economic transformation."

The reports are available on the Partnership Resource Centre website at: [www.dol.govt.nz/services/partnershipresourcecentre/](http://www.dol.govt.nz/services/partnershipresourcecentre/)
