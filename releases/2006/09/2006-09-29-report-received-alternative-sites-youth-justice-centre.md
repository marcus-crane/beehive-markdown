An important next step in improving resources in the Youth Justice system has been taken, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services, Ruth Dyson said today.

Ruth Dyson has received a report from Child, Youth and Family (CYF) regarding potential alternative sites for the planned Youth Justice Residence in the central North Island.

"This report from CYF is an important next step in creating a solid platform of information to assist in assessing the options for Youth Justice Central moving forward."

The Minister is expected to announce the preferred site for the residence in the next fortnight, once the report's recommendations have been fully considered.
