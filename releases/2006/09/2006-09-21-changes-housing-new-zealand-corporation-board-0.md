Housing Minister Chris Carter today announced several appointments to the Board of Housing New Zealand Corporation.

Garry Wilson, Sandra Lee, and Colin Dale have been appointed as new board members, while existing member Lope Ginnen has been reappointed.

"Mr Wilson, Ms Lee, and Mr Dale have a great deal to offer Housing New Zealand," said Mr Carter. "Together they bring excellent and extensive governance experience, and will be well placed to assist the Corporation in meeting expectations.

"Ms Lee and Mr Dale have an in-depth knowledge of the Auckland environment, with its diverse challenges and opportunities. Mr Wilson’s experience at the helm of a large public sector agency will further strengthen the Board’s ability to assist in building capacity and capability within the Corporation.

"I also welcome Ms Ginnen to a further term on the Board. She has demonstrated her knowledge and skill in representing the Corporation on a number of issues.
