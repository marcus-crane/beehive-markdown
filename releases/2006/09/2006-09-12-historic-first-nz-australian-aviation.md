Transport Minister Annette King has welcomed Australian legislation allowing eligible New Zealand and Australian airlines to operate in both countries without the need for an Air Operator Certificate from both civil aviation authorities.

“This is believed to be the first time two countries have entered into such an agreement anywhere in the world,” Ms King says.

The Australian Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 was passed by the Australian House of Representatives yesterday. Corresponding legislation was passed in New Zealand in 2004 and only requires approval by the Governor-General to be brought into force.

Ms King says mutual recognition is an important step in forging closer economic links with Australia. “We welcome the opportunity for our airlines to take full advantage of the open skies agreement between Australia and New Zealand.

“Allowing airlines to operate in the other country under their home certification removes the significant cost of being certified in both countries. This will make it easier for operators to take advantage of commercial opportunities across the Tasman.”

Ms King added that mutual recognition was possible because the regulation of airline safety in both countries is of a very high standard and comparable with international best practice.

“We recognise that there are differences between our two systems, including in particular standards. But these can be accepted as it is the overall safety outcome achieved by each system that is being recognised.”

Air Operator Certificates for the operation of aircraft of more than 30 seats or 15,000kgs maximum take-off weight will be the first to be recognised. There is provision for mutual recognition of other safety certification relating to airline operations under the Australia-New Zealand open skies agreement to be considered in the future.

### Questions And Answers: Australian Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment

***Why do we need mutual recognition?***  
The Government is implementing mutual recognition of aviation-related certification with Australia to fulfil a commitment first undertaken in the 1996 Single Aviation Market Arrangements, and reconfirmed in the 2000 Memorandum of Understanding on Open Skies. Currently, airlines operating services in both countries are required to be certificated by both aviation safety authorities. The intent of mutual recognition is to remove costly regulatory barriers to airlines taking up the commercial opportunities, created by those air services arrangements, to operate air transport services between, within and beyond the two countries.

***Are safety standards the same in both countries?***  
The overall standards of safety regulation achieved by Australia and New Zealand are equivalent, and comparable with international best practice. There are differences in detail between the two safety systems but these are not at issue, as it is the overall safety system that is being accepted, not its individual component parts.

***Why not just harmonise standards?***  
There are a number of differences between the safety systems in place in the two countries. Most of these differences are of a minor nature, but harmonisation would require a very large investment in time and resources to achieve equivalence and does not address the issue of single or dual certification. It is likely, however, following implementation of mutual recognition, greater harmonisation will occur over time as respective rules and safety regulations of both countries are continually reviewed.

***What about establishing a joint safety authority?***  
As above

***What happens in the event of a serious safety concern relating to an Australian airline operating in New Zealand – what can CAA do?***  
The principle of mutual recognition is that the standard of safety regulation achieved by each country is comparable. Thus, if CAA were to become aware of a safety concern relating to an Australian airline, the matter would be referred to the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority to deal with. In the extremely unlikely event that CASA failed to provide adequate oversight, or that instant action was required, New Zealand retains the ultimate right to effect an immediate halt to airline operations. Any further regulatory action arising would, however, remain the responsibility of the Australian authority.

***What is the expected benefit to New Zealand aviation operators?***  
Airlines wishing to operate domestic services in both countries are currently required to obtain a domestic Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in both countries. The issue of a domestic AOC requires, inter alia, that the airline have a head office and operational base, as well as the CEO and other relevant responsible personnel based in the country issuing the AOC. For an airline operating domestic services in both countries, this essentially means that such infrastructure and personnel are duplicated in both countries. The costs arising from this include those associated with:

- placing and maintaining aircraft on the register of the host country, coupled with removal from the register of the home country;
- compliance with differing regulations, including those for maintenance, aircraft equipment, and operational procedures;
- opportunity costs associated with having crews licensed in the host country;
- establishment of operational base in the host country, including head office establishment and ongoing costs, salaries and expenses for executive management, and insurance and accident compensation costs over an operation without the ability to leverage off existing home operation.
- Under mutual recognition, this duplication and the attendant costs will be avoided.

***Will implementing mutual recognition cost airlines anything?***  
No.

***Does this apply to all Australian and New Zealand airlines?***  
No. Mutual recognition is being implemented in order to remove barriers to airlines taking up opportunities under the 2002 ‘open skies’ air services arrangements between New Zealand and Australia. As such, its application is limited to those airlines that qualify to operate services under the agreement, either as a Designated airline, or as a Single Aviation Market airline. The mutual recognition arrangement is also limited initially to those airlines operating to Civil Aviation Rule Part 121 standards (essentially, those operating aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats, or cargo aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off weight of 15,000kg or more) --- due primarily to the complexity of the task and the long lead time required for legislation. It is expected that the greatest benefits from mutual recognition will be achieved in recognition of certification of air transport operations involving large aircraft, as operators of such aircraft would be the most likely to seek to operate services in both countries and would otherwise incur the greatest start-up and compliance costs.

***What about Virgin Blue - does mutual recognition mean it would be easier for Virgin Blue to start services within New Zealand?***  
Mutual recognition will make it easier for any Australian airline to commence services within New Zealand. The airline would still need to meet Australian safety regulatory requirements to be authorised to operate internationally, but would not require duplicate safety certification from the New Zealand CAA. However, Virgin Blue would still need to meet relevant criteria if it wished to operate as a Single Aviation Market (SAM) airline or as an Australian Designated airline under the Air Services Agreement between Australia and New Zealand.  
Currently, Christchurch-based Virgin Blue subsidiary company Pacific Blue Airlines (NZ) Ltd holds full safety certification from the New Zealand CAA. As well as operating trans-Tasman services,Pacific Blue Airline (NZ) Ltd also operates international air services on behalf of Pacific Blue (Aust) Pty Ltd and Polynesian Blue.

***How are the Qantas domestic operations within New Zealand currently safety certified?***  
Qantas services within New Zealand and some of its trans-Tasman services are currently operated by its Christchurch-based subsidiary company Jetconnect.This company holds full safety certification from the New Zealand CAA.

***Will mutual recognition be extended to provide for other air operators?***  
It is possible that mutual recognition may be extended in the future to encompass Part 125 operations (aircraft with 10 to 30 passenger seats) however, experience of the current process and development of confidence in the ability of the operators of smaller aircraft to operate offshore will be important factors in the speed with which wider mutual recognition could be implemented.

***Will mutual recognition be extended to cover other countries?***  
No. The commitment of the New Zealand and Australian governments to mutual recognition relates specifically to air transport services operated under the provisions of the ‘open skies’ agreement in place between the two countries.

***How is CAA surveillance of operations by New Zealand airlines in Australia to be funded?***  
The CAA will charge airlines directly, on a cost recovery basis, for oversight of operations conducted in Australia. The annual cost of such supervision (not including any extraordinary occurrences) is estimated at around $5000 a year, significantly lower than the current ‘up-front’ and ongoing costs associated with obtaining and maintaining separate safety certification in both countries.

***How will mutual recognition affect the proposed commercial alliance between Air New Zealand and Qantas?***  
Mutual recognition is unlikely to have any effect on any future partnership between Air New Zealand and Qantas, as the two airlines will remain separate entities with existing separate certification. It would, however, make it easier for other New Zealand airlines to commence services in Australia if commercial opportunities arise (and vice versa).

***Why has Australia taken so long to pass the legislation?***  
Because of differences in parliamentary processes
