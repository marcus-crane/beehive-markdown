A range of innovative youth projects by local councils that support young people to get into work, further education or training, are set to receive government grants totalling more than $680,000.

Youth Affairs and Associate Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the successful recipients of the Ministry of Youth Development's annual Youth Development Partnership Fund at the Youth in Local Government Conference in New Plymouth.

“Congratulations to the 11 territorial authorities whose innovative projects have been selected to receive funding, and am excited that the Ministry is able to support these initiatives which involve, challenge and encourage young people,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Fund recipients include councils stretching from the far north to the heart of the south, covering rural and urban communities. Pending the signing of final funding contracts, the successful councils will receive grants ranging from $25,000 to $150,000.

"The Youth in Local Government conference is the perfect venue for announcing the successful grant recipients, and highlights the value of local government joining forces with central government and communities to support projects which address the local needs of young people.

“The theme of this year’s fund is education, training and employment, which aligns with the priorities set by the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs. The selected projects offer a huge range of opportunities, through activities which support enterprise, learning, leadership, participation, and development of resources for young people.”

The territorial authorities set to receive project funding include: Far North District Council, Manukau City Council, Franklin District Council, Otorohanga District Council, Opotiki District Council, Taupo District Council, South Taranaki District Council, Nelson City Council, Grey District Council, Westland District Council, and Clutha District Council. The funding totals $681,700.

"The fund reflects the fact that councils not only need to develop projects which address the needs of young people in their communities, but that they also need to be innovative and inclusive in their approach if they are to truly engage with young people and keep them involved and enthusiastic," Nanaia Mahuta said.
