Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that His Royal Highness the Duke of York will visit New Zealand in March 2007.

Prince Andrew will visit New Zealand for about a week. He will take part in a special ceremony to recognise the gallantry of the Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi in Rotorua on 17 March.

Lance Sergeant Manahi was not awarded a Victoria Cross during World War Two despite recommendations that his gallantry warranted the highest award for valour. This year, the government, working with Te Arawa, the Manahi VC Committee, and Buckingham Palace, announced that it would hold a special ceremony to recognise Lance Sergeant Manahi’s deeds.

The Queen has expressed her admiration for the bravery of Lance Sergeant Manahi, and the presence of the Duke at the ceremony reflects her wish to be personally associated with the initiatives to recognise his gallantry.

The Duke will also undertake a range of other activities, which will be announced when finalised.
