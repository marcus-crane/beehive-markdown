Cabinet has approved tighter regulations around the sale of fireworks for Guy Fawkes 2007, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“Cabinet has agreed that the fireworks sale period for 2007 will be limited to three days before Guy Fawkes, and the legal age of purchase will be raised to 18 years," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"This aims to restrict young teenagers from purchasing these potentially harmful explosives, and to make the Guy Fawkes season less taxing for the Fire Service and Police,” he said.

Mr Benson-Pope said Cabinet had also agreed that in 2007 sparklers would not be sold separately, but only as part of larger fireworks packs, to discourage the dangerous trend of ‘sparkler bombs’.

Mr Benson-Pope said that at this stage he had stopped short of a total ban on fireworks. "I have listened to the various groups that do want a ban, and I am still open to that possibility in the future, but I believe the best approach at this stage is to tighten up the laws around sale," he said.

"Guy Fawkes is a fun event for thousands of families, and fireworks-related damage is caused by a small group of mostly young people. I don't feel it's fair on New Zealanders to ban fireworks sales at this stage because of the actions of a minority.

“We want to see fireworks users behaving responsibly, being aware of and avoiding fire risk, guarding the personal safety of themselves and others, and being aware of the effect the noise has on animals.

“I understand the frustration the Police and Fire Service teams feel when faced with problems over Guy Fawkes, and I hope these new restrictions will send a message that deliberate harm or damage is criminal and is being clamped down on,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“In addition to the new regulations, the Environment Risk Management Authority will start investigating the design and construction of fireworks, and next year government will consult with industry about new regulations in this area," he said.
