Immigration Minister David Cunliffe says the reported case of hundreds of potential migrants allegedly owed money by a failed recruitment company highlights the need for his bill to licence immigration agents.

The Press newspaper reported today it had been inundated with complaints about a failed Christchurch recruitment company the paper said owed 229 potential migrants about $600,000 in unrefunded fees.

“Cases such as this are good examples of why there is a need to regulate immigration agents and provide greater protection to those who use their services," Mr Cunliffe said.

“The Immigration Advisers Licensing Bill now before Parliament has been introduced to improve the standard of immigration advice.

“While there are many professional and helpful agents out there working in the interests of migrants, there are also those who abuse the trust of people wanting to start a new life in New Zealand.:

The legislation will make it an offence to provide immigration advice without a licence. Offenders could face a fine of up to $100,000, seven years imprisonment or both.

“In my role as an electorate MP I understand the impact unscrupulous immigration consultants can have on people’s lives. That is why we have been working hard to ensure this new legislation is as robust as possible.

“The bill is progressing well. It is currently on the order paper awaiting its second reading. I look forward to this being passed into legislation as soon as possible in the new year.”
