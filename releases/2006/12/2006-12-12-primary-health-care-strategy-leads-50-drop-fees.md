Tony Ryall and the National Party need to come clean on their opposition to lower doctors fees for New Zealanders, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

"Tony Ryall continues to pretend that no one has any idea what the Labour-led government's seven year $2.2 billion investment in primary health is achieving," Hodgson said.

"I'm happy to tell Mr Ryall what is has achieved - this government has cut the cost of seeing the family doctor in half.

"The majority of the funding is being spent directly on lowering the cost of doctors visits and prescription drugs. From July 1 next year, affordable access will be universal.

"The National Party will be getting the same feedback the government is getting - this is a policy that families are welcoming. Mr Ryall also knows that it is a policy his Party cannot afford to support while they continue to advocate for reckless tax cuts.

"Every New Zealander who visits their GP and pays half what they used to will know that Mr Ryall's attacks on the government's investment in primary health care are based in desperation, not reality."
