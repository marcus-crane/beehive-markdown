Keep it seriously simple at Christmas and spend time not money on family and friends advises Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

"I am dismayed to see some credit companies preying on more vulnerable New Zealanders and encouraging them to borrow money to buy Christmas presents, " says Judith Tizard.

"Think outside the square this year. Put your plastic cards away and avoid borrowing money or getting into debt to buy presents, or things you don’t need or wont use everyday.

"Our families and friends value our time and thoughtfulness – not the amount of dollars spend on expensive presents," the Minister says. "That's what we remember and value the most.

"Create vouchers you can give as presents – give your time and skills, or offer babysitting or time out.

"Please avoid getting into debt this Christmas as it make things much harder in the New Year".
