Ruth Dyson today questioned John Key's abandonment of National's long held  
opposition to fair industrial relations law and the sincerity of his latest  
branding exercise.

While it's welcome that National have finally admitted that Labour's  
employment law has had a major role in achieving the world's lowest  
unemployment rate, workers are right to be skeptical about Key's motives.

"Key has fundamentally misunderstood the differences between the Labour  
government's Employment Relations Act and the Employment Contracts Act of  
the 90s," Ruth Dyson said.

"He needs to come clean on what he means by tinkering round the edges; the  
public deserves to know:

-Does he now oppose National Party MP Wayne Mapp's 90 day probationary Bill  
which only two weeks ago he supported in parliament?

-Does he support the "Work Choices" Australian model?

-Does he now support the vulnerable workers legislation which he opposed  
only a few months ago?

-Does he support keeping the bargaining fee in the Employment Relations  
Act?

"The basis of the Employment Relations framework is the preference for  
collective bargaining and the obligation for good faith negotiations. Will both of these remain? Will employees be entitled to multi employer  
collective agreements (MECAs)?

"Workers and employers deserve better than ill informed, sweeping  
generalisations," says Ruth Dyson.

"Where is the detail, John?"
