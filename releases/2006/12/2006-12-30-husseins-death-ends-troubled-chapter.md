Duty Minister Trevor Mallard today said that Saddam Hussein’s death ends a chapter in Iraq’s troubled history.

“New Zealand does not support the death penalty as a matter of principle,” Trevor Mallard said.

“We acknowledge, however, that Saddam Hussein’s execution occurred within the framework of Iraqi law, and as a response to his crimes against humanity.

“New Zealand regarded the guilty verdict as appropriate. The task now is for the people of Iraq to look forward and work for a stable unified Iraqi nation.”
