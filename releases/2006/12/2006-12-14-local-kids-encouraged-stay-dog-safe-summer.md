Local children were today encouraged to "stay dog safe" during summer as part of a visit to Masterton's Lake View School by Youth Affairs and Associate Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Keeping families, especially children, safe around dogs is the focus of a public education and advertising campaign called Stay Dog Safe This Summer, recently launched by the Minister.

"One of the key things we want parents and children to be aware of is that incidents between people and dogs are much more likely to happen during the summer months, when they are both are out and about and more likely to run into each other," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"People may also be surprised to know that a majority of incidents involving people and dogs happen around the home, and often involve the pets of family or friends, which shows that any dog – no matter how familiar or well-trained – has the potential to bite.

“However, many dog attacks are preventable if people know how to behave around dogs, and children especially need to be very careful, which is why we've launched the Stay Dog Safe campaign. The Government wants to ensure the greatest possible enjoyment and safety for families, dogs and owners during summer."

The campaign involves print and website advertising, and features nine dog safety tips for children. The tips were taken from The Dog Box, a dog safety teaching resource distributed to all New Zealand schools in October 2005.

Nanaia Mahuta said the public education campaign was just one of the Government’s initiatives to improve public safety around dogs.
