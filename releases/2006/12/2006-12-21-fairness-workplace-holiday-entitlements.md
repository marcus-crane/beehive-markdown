"Clear holiday entitlements are just one way in which the Labour-led government is encouraging better working conditions and fairness in New Zealand workplaces," said Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson today.

Businesses with employees working on public holidays over Christmas and the New Year will by now be aware that employees must be paid time and a half for the time they work on a public holiday and be provided with a day off in lieu.

"Christmas and Boxing Day fall on a Monday and Tuesday this year, as does New Year's Day and the 2 January holiday, so employees who would normally work these days and do work on them should receive these entitlements.

"Other government initiatives include promoting flexible workplaces and work-life balance.

"Not only do these initiatives assist in promoting modern, productive business practices, they also help New Zealand compete successfully against other countries to attract and retain people with the skills we need.

"I'd like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday period, whether you are working or taking time off," said Ruth Dyson.

More information on annual holidays and other holiday entitlements is available on the Department of Labour's website: [www.dol.govt.nz](http://www.dol.govt.nz)
