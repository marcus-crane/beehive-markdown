A significant first step towards developing a medicines strategy is underway with the release of a public consultation document today, by Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne.

The publication, "Towards a New Zealand Medicines Strategy", looks at the existing systems for regulating, obtaining and managing the use of medicines and potential improvements for the future. It covers a range of areas from ensuring people make the best use of their prescription medicines to increasing the transparency of the decision-making process used to determine which medicines are funded and which are not.

"Medicines are widely used and offer significant health benefits but they can be expensive. This makes them a key focus for many people in the health sector,'' Peter Dunne said.

"The idea behind this work is to develop a cohesive, overarching medicines strategy for the future. We are keen to receive feedback about the proposed strategic framework and key initiatives - have we got it right and are there other gaps we need to think about.''

The development of a long-term medicines strategy was part of the Government's confidence and supply agreement with United Future. The Terms of Reference specify that the aim of the Strategy is to 'identify where improvements can be made within the existing system and broad policy settings to ensure the best health and disability support outcomes from medicines over the coming years'.

"The Government recognises the importance of this work and it pleased to be part of this collaborative initiative,'' Pete Hodgson said.

"Ultimately it's about ensuring the best health for New Zealanders.''

The proposed strategy has three main objectives. The first objective is around the quality of medicines, in particular the regulation of medicines.

The second objective is about access to medicines, irrespective of an individual's ability to pay. Proposed areas of focus include improving transparency of how decisions about funding medicines are made, and improving how the community pharmaceutical budget is set.

The third objective is about ensuring the optimal use of medicines. This includes identifying initiatives to ensure that choices about medicines, the ways medicines are delivered and the ways individuals use them are safe and result in the best health gain possible.

"This includes ensuring that best-practice prescribing is occurring and that people take medicines according to the prescribers' instructions. Unfortunately we know this isn't always happening,'' Peter Dunne said. "This can impact on both health and financial outcomes".

For example, the Central Pharmacy and MidCentral District Health Boards's Safe and Efficient Disposal of Unused Medicine Project disposed of $300,000 of unused medicine from the community in one year.

Throughout the consultation document there are a number of questions for direct feedback. For example, suggestions are sought about how to support evidence-based prescribing, and how to improve co-ordination and communication between health sector agencies that are involved in optimal use initiatives.

Written submissions on the "Towards a New Zealand Medicines Strategy Consultation Document" close on Friday, 30 March next year. All submissions will be analysed and feed into the development of the final Medicines Strategy to be released in 2007.

Alongside the initial Strategy a list of initiatives will be identified for action. If any changes to systems are required they will be identified in the priority actions.

**Questions and Answers**

What has happened since the confidence and supply agreement to get to this point?

Following the release of the terms of reference for the Medicines Strategy in April 2006, the Associate Minister of Health, Peter Dunne wrote to groups across the health sector encouraging their participation in the Medicines Strategy work. Many of these groups subsequently met with the Associate Minister and/or the Ministry of Health to discuss their views on the strategy.

**What happens next?**

Submissions on Towards a New Zealand Medicines Strategy Discussion Document close on 30 March 2007. The submissions will be analysed and fed into the final Medicines Strategy and the list of initiatives to be released in 2007.

**Will the development of a Strategy result in people getting access to high-cost medicines that are not funded at the moment?**

Access to medicines is a key part of the Discussion Document. Pharmac is also considering how it assesses and funds high-cost medicines, and will release a discussion document within the next two months. The Ministry will draw on this when considering how best to balance the Government’s responsibility to protect New Zealanders from substantial costs due to ill health and at the same time achieve the best health outcomes for the population from within available funds.

**Will we have more money for medicines?**

This document is about the systems that are used in relation to medicines – including how we set the pharmaceutical budget. Improving these systems will make it clearer whether we are spending the right amount on medicines. The document recommends improvements to the process by which community pharmaceutical budget is agreed. Improvements include the use of explicit principles to guide decisions about the budget level, and the District Health Boards giving greater consideration to how they prioritise their spending across all the services they fund.

**Does the Discussion Document include a review of Pharmac?**

The work to develop the Medicines Strategy is not a review of Pharmac. The document takes a considered look at the whole system. However, Pharmac’s role is central in the sector and the document proposes options for increasing the transparency of Pharmac's decision-making.

**What are the most significant improvements that can be anticipated?**

The greatest gains are likely to be in the area of optimal use of medicines. Optimal use means ensuring that choices about medicines, how the system delivers medicines and how individuals use medicines are safe and result in the best possible health gain.

A broad range of activities contribute to ensuring the optimal use of medicines, including:

- considering the most suitable and cost-effective treatment for people, including non-medicinal alternatives
- considering the safety and appropriateness (including risks and benefits) of the medicine choice, and the dose and length of treatment, in relation to the person’s clinical need
- minimising the overuse, under-use and misuse of medicines
- ensuring that people use medicines in the way that was intended by the prescriber
- monitoring the outcomes of medicine use.

**Do New Zealanders have good access to medicines compared with people in other countries?**

Yes. Firstly, our prescription charges are low – soon the whole population will pay a $3 charge for prescriptions. New Zealanders also have access to products to treat a comprehensive range of conditions. While Pharmac aims to ensure a fully subsidised treatment is available from within each group of medicines this does not mean that all medicines that may treat a condition are fully subsidised.
