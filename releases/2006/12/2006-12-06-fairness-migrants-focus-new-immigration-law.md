Migrants are set to benefit from a world-class immigration system based on principles of fairness and human rights, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Mr Cunliffe has unveiled a package of proposals for a new Immigration Act following public submissions and consultation on the Immigration Act Review discussion document issued in April.

“Migrants from all over the world play an important role in the economic success and wonderful diversity of this country. That role is set to increase in the future as our need for skilled, talented people continues.

“The new laws will provide migrants with a fairer and simpler immigration system, with expanded provisions for human rights at every stage of the process.

“A new visa system under the new legislation will be more flexible and transparent, making the process of applying to come or stay in New Zealand much simpler for migrants.

“There will also be more ability for discretion around residence decisions, meaning many migrants will notice faster and fairer decisions around their applications.

"Under a new appeal system, all migrants will have access to a world-class appeal tribunal that will replace the four existing appeals bodies. This tribunal will fully consider their case in light of a broader set of international obligations and humanitarian considerations – making the appeal process more transparent.

“People held in detention for immigration reasons will also have access to legal aid and there will be new alternatives to minimise the use of detention. Under the current law only refugee claimants and residents have the right to legal aid.”

An Immigration Bill to replace the existing 1987 Act will now be drafted ready for introduction to Parliament in April 2007. The select committee stage will provide further opportunities for public input into the bill.
