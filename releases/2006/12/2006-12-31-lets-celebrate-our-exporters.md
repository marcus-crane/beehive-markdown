On the eve of Export Year 2007, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today urged New Zealanders to celebrate and get in behind kiwi exporters as the key link in delivering higher living standards and wealth in the years ahead.

"We’ve got a great lifestyle here in New Zealand and as we enjoy the summer holidays, it's time to make a New Year resolution to cheer on our kiwi exporters - the unsung heroes who will play a huge role in raising our living standards and delivering our future prosperity," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Labour-led government is proud to support our exporters through Export Year 2007 - an initiative that is part of our support agreement with NZ First and which has the backing of all the main business groups in New Zealand.

"Unlike National, we want people to get behind our exporting firms and cheer them on just like we do our sports stars. The government is committed to working with business to grow the number of successful kiwi exporters as part of our agenda to transform the New Zealand into an economy that is export-led, innovative and high wage. the Government is working on areas such as business tax, education, infrastructure investment, a greater emphasis on research and development, and further enhancing our global linkages.

"New Zealand must carve out a true kiwi approach to economic success, with policies and programmes that are tailored to what is uniquely New Zealand and uniquely kiwi - our environment, our isolation from key markets, our small size, our natural strengths and resources, our talents in innovation, our kiwi-can-do attitude.

"We know that it is our successful exporters who will drive up our living standards and our wealth as a country. That's why the negativity and lack of vision and policy from National is disappointing. This party can only whinge like a scrooge from the sidelines, attacking Export Year 2007 and all government support for kiwi firms. Their most recent attack on the popular market development assistance scheme is bizarre. This scheme helps firms break into offshore markets and the exporters who have participated in it say it is making a difference.

"The programme for Export Year includes export-related events and conferences, a boost to the market development assistance scheme, the expansion of mentoring and beachhead programmes, and targeted trade missions. Export Year will continue to be developed with input from the key groups including Business NZ, Export NZ, Economic Development Association NZ, Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc, NZ Council of Trade Unions, NZ Pacific Business Council, Auckland Canterbury and Wellington Chambers of Commerce."
