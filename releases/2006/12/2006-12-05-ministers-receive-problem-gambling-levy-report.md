Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker and Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor have received the Gambling Commission's report setting out recommendations for funding of problem gambling services between 2007 and 2010.

Mr O'Connor and Mr Barker thanked the Commission for its report, which raises a number of issues for consideration, and which will assist the levy setting process.

The Gambling Act 2003 sets out a clear process for reviewing funding of services for problem gambling every three years.

Mr O'Connor and Mr Barker will consider the Commission's recommendations over coming months, with the Cabinet due to make its final decision for setting the gambling sector levy rates for the next three years. New regulations and appropriations are due to be set in time for a 1 July 2007 start.

Background:

The Ministry of Health is required to propose the gambling sector levy based upon the requirements to provide services to prevent and minimise gambling harm. This includes applying the levy calculation formula contained in the Act to identify the different levy rates per gambling sector. The levy was last set in 2004.

During the course of 2006, the Ministry first developed the Draft Problem Gambling Service Plan, Needs Assessment and Levy Calculation 2007-2010 document and then undertook public consultation.

This consultation involved five public meetings across the country, an industry specific meeting as well as an eight-week period for receiving written submissions.

The Ministry then produced a revised Problem Gambling Service Plan and Levy Calculation 2007-2010 document, which was forwarded to ministers and then to the Gambling Commission who, as required under the Act, consulted with stakeholders.
