Health Minister Pete Hodgson has today reminded National Party Associate Health Spokesperson Jackie Blue that health stories tend to move quickly.

Dr Blue issued a press statement at 1 pm today calling for the Minister to step-in to resolve issues surrounding epidural access for women in the Nelson Marlborough region.

The statement was issued more than 24 hours after the issue had already been resolved as had been reported in yesterday's Nelson Mail.

"Health is a busy space," Pete Hodgson said. "I appreciate Dr Blue's concern and am happy to inform her that the issue has been resolved."
