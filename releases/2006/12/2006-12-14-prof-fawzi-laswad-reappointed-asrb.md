### Background to Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB)

The ASRB, established under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, is an independent Crown entity. Its main function is to review and, if it thinks fit, approve any financial reporting standard or amendment submitted to it. The Act is currently being reviewed. For information on the review click [here](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____11011.aspx)

The ASRB consists of not less than four and not more than seven members appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce. When considering appointments, the Act requires the responsible Minister to recommend candidates who have knowledge of, or experience in, business, accounting, finance, economics or law.
