Undergraduate medicine and dentistry education and training will get $24.6 million of additional annual funding from next year, Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen announced today.

The need for additional money was identified in the recent review of funding arrangements for undergraduate medicine and dentistry education. The Tertiary Education Commission and the Ministry of Education undertook the review.

"The government's objective is to ensure that New Zealand's tertiary education institutions are in the position to be able to recruit and retain skilled staff and that students have access to the highest quality learning," said Dr Cullen.

"The increase in funding will support excellence in medicine and dentistry education and training, including the development and expansion of curricula to ensure they are up-to-date and world-class.

"There will also be support to expand training for future GPs in rural areas, which has been identified as needing development.

"This assistance will deliver graduates who are equipped with the right skills and knowledge to meet the current and future needs of the medicine and dentistry professions.

"It will also help ensure that our families, young and old, have access to medical and dental services of the highest quality."

In 2007 the new funding rates will be between $32,458 and $38,283 per Equivalent Full Time Students (EFTS) for medicine, and $46,427 per EFTS for dentistry. This represents an increase over current funding rates of $13,566 for medicine and $14,353 for dentistry (all amounts are GST exclusive).

The University of Auckland and the University of Otago provide undergraduate medicine education and training. The University of Otago provides dentistry education and training.

"Today's announcement delivers on yet another Labour manifesto promise. It also builds on the recent $26 million funding increase for university staffing and further underlines this government's commitment to ensure our tertiary institutions are better resourced to provide world-class education," said Dr Cullen.
