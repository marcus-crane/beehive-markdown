Conservation Minister Chris Carter will represent New Zealand at the State Funeral of former United States President Gerald R Ford in Washington, Cabinet Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Former President Ford died on 26 December at the age of 93. He served as President of the United States from 1974 to 1976.

“President Ford won respect for the decent, down to earth qualities that he brought back to government after assuming the Presidency in 1974 in the difficult circumstances of the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the resignation of former President Richard Nixon,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The United States is a fundamentally important partner for New Zealand. It is appropriate that we mark our respect for the strength of US democracy and the many other enduring values that we share in common with the United States in this way.”

Chris Carter and other senior foreign representatives will join leading US political figures and the family of the late former President at the National Funeral Service to be held at Washington National Cathedral in Washington DC on the morning of Tuesday 2 January.

Following the funeral service, Mr Carter and other foreign representatives will meet US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Tuesday 2 January has been declared a US national day of mourning for former President Ford.
