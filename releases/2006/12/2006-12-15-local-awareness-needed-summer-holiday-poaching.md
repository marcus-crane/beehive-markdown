Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton used the opportunity of being in the Marlborough region for the Queen Charlotte School's prize giving ceremony to reinforce the message of the Poaching is Theft campaign over the coming summer holiday period.

"I asking the local residents and holidaymakers to keep an eye out for poachers over summer and report any suspicious activity to the Ministry of Fisheries," Jim Anderton said.

"Poaching tends to increase as people flock to the coast for summer. The sheltered waters of the Marlborough Sounds and the productive, rocky coast around Kaikoura are no exception.

“For this reason Marlborough was chosen as one of the areas to pilot the Coast Watch project."

The Coast Watch project was set up by the paua and rock lobster industries – it urges residents in the outer Marlborough Sounds to be on the watch for suspicious activity and report it to MFish on the new 0800 4 Poacher number (0800 476 224).

MFish have two six-metre boats based in Picton and Blenheim that can respond. Poachers can be also pursued by helicopter if required.

“A few years ago a notorious Wellington poacher was caught in the outer Sounds by helicopter and successfully prosecuted, after a tip-off,” Mr Anderton said. “The means are there to respond, but our fisheries officers need information from the public to catch poachers and fish thieves."

The Coast Watch project is part of the ‘Poaching is Theft’ joint initiative between the seafood industry, government and recreational fishers, launched by Mr Anderton in October. It aims to raise public awareness about the impact of the poaching and fish theft of paua and rock lobster (crayfish).

“Everyone is entitled to their fair share of these resources and everyone can play their part to ensure the sustainability of New Zealand’s valuable fisheries. Thieves who line their own pockets with a public resource are decreasing the quality of legitimate users catch,” Mr Anderton said.

“By complying with the bag and size limits for paua and rock lobster, and reporting suspicious activity, all New Zealanders can help to protect the fisheries for future generations. We want all New Zealanders to have access to a quality catch," Jim Anderton said.
