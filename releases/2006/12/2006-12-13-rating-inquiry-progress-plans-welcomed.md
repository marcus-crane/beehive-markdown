Minister of Local Government Mark Burton welcomed news of progress made by the Independent Inquiry into Local Government rates and plans for the public submission process.

"The issues relating to the funding of local authorities are of critical interest to ratepayers and both local and central government.

"The inquiry panel is clearly mapping out an effective work programme, which I believe will mean the key issues are well canvassed," he said.

The inquiry panel announced today that it will invite written submissions at the end of January and hold public forums during February and March.

"Clearly, the inquiry panel has quickly got down to work and is already focusing on having a robust process in place to receive public submissions in a range of ways."

"I would encourage those who have an interest in local government rating issues to provide input to the inquiry in the New Year."

On 1 November the terms of reference and panel membership were announced. The inquiry panel will report to the Government by 31 July 2007.
