Korean President Roh Moo-hyun will visit New Zealand from 7 to 10 December, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

President Roh will meet with a range of government, business and community leaders in Wellington and Auckland, attend a state dinner hosted by the Governor General, and lay a wreath at the National War Memorial.

"New Zealand and Korea have a wide-ranging relationship across many areas, including trade, education, research, science and technology, and the creative sectors, including film,” Helen Clark said.

“Korea is New Zealand’s seventh largest trading partner, with total trade worth over two billion dollars last year.

“More than 30,000 Koreans live in New Zealand, and many New Zealanders choose to live in Korea as part of their overseas experience.

“I look forward to discussing with President Roh the prospects for the relationship between our two countries as we move through the 21st Century.

“This visit also provides an invaluable opportunity to explore how New Zealand and Korea might further work together as regional and global partners.

“Korea’s pivotal role on the world stage has been highlighted by both North Korea’s provocative nuclear programme and by Korea’s Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon being appointed as United Nation’s Secretary General,” Helen Clark said.
