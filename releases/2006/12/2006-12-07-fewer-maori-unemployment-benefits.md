The Minister of Maori Affairs and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Parekura Horomia has welcomed the dramatic drop in the numbers of Maori on unemployment benefits.

"The number of Maori receiving the unemployment benefit dropped from 41,000 in September 1999 to 15,000 in September 2006, a reduction nearly two thirds (64%) said Parekura Horomia".

"It is pleasing that Maori right through the age range from 18 – 64 years have contributed to the downward trend, with substantial falls in numbers of all ages receiving unemployment benefits.

I am particularly heartened by the fact that the numbers have fallen most dramatically in younger age ranges. There are now more than 74 percent fewer young Maori men aged under 25 years on unemployment benefit than there were in 1999, down from 9,800 to 2,500. Numbers of younger Maori women in this age group has also fallen considerably from 5,300 in 1999 to 1,700, a drop of 68 percent.

"Employment offers Maori the best opportunity to improve their living standards and to participate in New Zealand's strong economy," said Parekura Horomia.
