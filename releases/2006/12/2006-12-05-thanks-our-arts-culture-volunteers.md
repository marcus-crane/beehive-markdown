Today, International Volunteers Day, is a great day to acknowledge the thousands of New Zealanders who help support our arts and culture says the Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

"Every day and night, right across the country, our local drama and operatic clubs, historical societies and historic places committees are driven by these people who volunteer their time.

"A Creative New Zealand Survey released earlier this year found that an overwhelming 33% of New Zealanders described themselves as crew/ helpers or volunteers for the performing arts alone."

These volunteers help to make things happen – from staging events, doing the programmes or lighting, applying makeup, to renovating historic cottages, or indexing historic records – they are helping to build both our sense of community and our national identity."

My sincere thanks to you all! You make a real difference."
