The Mâori Purposes Bill has been passed by Parliament and Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said that it makes changes to several pieces of legislation significant to Mâori.

“Amendments have been made to Te Ture Whenua Mâori Act 1993, the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, the Mâori Fisheries Act 2004 and the Mâori Commercial Claims Settlement Act 2004”.

Mr Horomia said that a sound legal framework and infrastructure is needed to assist Mâori manage their assets and efficiently resolve any disputes that may arise.

“The Mâori Land Court’s jurisdiction has been expanded in recent years. To reflect this, Te Ture Whenua Mâori Act has been amended to increase the maximum number of permanent judges that can be appointed from 8 to 14.

“Changes have been made to ensure that the Chief Judge can better share his/her workload with the Deputy Chief Judge. This will help the Mâori Land Court continue to function effectively.”

Mr Horomia said that other changes include clarifying the role of the Mâori Land Court when determining disputes referred under the Mâori Fisheries Act and the Mâori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act, and the validation of some judicial actions to provide certainty to the parties concerned.

Mr Horomia said that Treaty settlements are providing Mâori with a base on which they can invest in the future – through their children, through enterprises and through iwi and other community structures.

“This Government is committed to the timely settlement of all historical Treaty claims. We have set a target date of 2020 to complete this process.

“One of Labour’s election pledges was to introduce a closing date of 1 September 2008 for the submission of historical Treaty claims. This has now been achieved.

“Claims submitted before 1 September 2008 can be amended after this date and extra information can be added. What is important is that all historical claims are submitted by 1 September 2008.

Contemporary claims about events after 1992 are not affected by the closing date and can be submitted at any time.

“A number of technical amendments have also been made to the Mâori Fisheries Act 2004 and the Mâori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act.

Mr Horomia said that these amendments addressed some oversights in the legislation and its interaction with the Fisheries Act 1996 and implemented original policy intentions.

Amendments have been made to the Mâori Fisheries Act 2004 to allow for changes to the quota shares held by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited for allocation to iwi. These changes can result from the exercise of preferential allocation rights under the Fisheries Act 1996, and from alterations to quota management areas under the same Act.

Mr Horomia said that other technical changes to the Mâori Fisheries Act 2004 included correcting an oversight in the process for allocating harbour quota; correcting an error in the classification of red crab stocks. An error in the definition of ‘pre-commencement space’ in the Mâori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004 has also been corrected.

“These changes will help ensure that the allocation of fisheries settlement assets to iwi is able to proceed smoothly and as originally intended”, Mr Horomia said.
