Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard today officially opens the $200 million Central Motorway Junction, which she says will help get Auckland moving and get through-traffic off city roads.

"As well as reducing congestion these links will make travel times more predictable, provide all the missing cross-city connections and improve access to public transport," says Judith Tizard.

The Central Motorway Junction has four new motorway links, creating connections between the region’s four cities - Auckland, Waitakere, Manukau and the North Shore.

Drivers now have direct access between the Northern Motorway, Grafton Gully and the Ports of Auckland and improved access to the Central Business District, Auckland Hospital, Mission Bay and Parnell.

“From today, Auckland gets moving. This project has been many years in the making and is a huge step forward for Auckland as we work to resolve the city’s traffic issues. While the reduction in travel times and new city connections will be a relief for motorists, this project also signals major advances in the Government’s commitment to economic transformation and environmental sustainability

"Auckland cannot be a world-class international city if people and goods cannot move rapidly through it."

The Government is committed to investing in transport infrastructure and this financial year a record $2.3 billion has been allocated for transport spending.

“We are committed to improving Auckland’s infrastructure. By 2011, as the global community descends on New Zealand from the Rugby World Cup, we will be ready to show off a world class city.”
