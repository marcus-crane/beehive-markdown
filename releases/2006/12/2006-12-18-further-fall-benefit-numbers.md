Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope has welcomed the continuing fall in Unemployment and Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers, following the release of the November figures.

"Unemployment Benefit numbers fell by almost 3,000 in November, to 36,063, and Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers are under 100,000 for the first time since 1993", Mr Benson-Pope said.

"In the past year, the fall in Unemployment and Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers has outstripped the increase in Invalids and Sickness Benefit numbers by a ratio of four to one," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"The result is that overall benefit numbers have fallen by over 14,000."
