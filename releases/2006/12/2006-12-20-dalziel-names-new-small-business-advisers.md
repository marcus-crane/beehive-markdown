The Small Business Advisory Group is taking on a new look with twelve new appointments, Minister for Small Business Lianne Dalziel announced today.

The [Small Business Advisory Group](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____161.aspx) has provided business sector perspectives to the government on policy development relating to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) since 2003.

Lianne Dalziel said the twelve new members brought a wealth of talent and expertise in diverse areas, in addition to being hands-on small business owners.

“The advice of the group has been instrumental in shaping small business policy. The people I have chosen represent a cross-section of small businesses from around New Zealand and, collectively, they will have a strong voice on small and medium enterprise issues.”

More than 250 applications for positions on the Small Business Advisory Group were received, with the following twelve people being appointed:

- Jenny Agnew, Auckland, skin care products;
- Paul Bayly, Auckland, financial sector;
- Lynn Currie, Arrowtown, fashion sector;
- Robyn de Bruin-Judge, North Shore, furniture design and manufacture;
- Bernadette (Bernie) Graham, Dunedin, clothing sector;
- Deborah Hart, Wellington, photography;
- John Holm, Christchurch, engineer, manufacturer;
- Daphne Luke, Otaki, Maori economic development;
- Ronnie Matafeo, Auckland, quantity surveying;
- Rod Meharry, Rotorua, event signage;
- Frank van der Velden, Auckland, IT and marketing; and
- Claire Vogtherr, Hawkes Bay, food sector.

Carol Beaumont, of the Council of Trade Unions, has been appointed as special advisor to the group.

“The nine members who comprised the original Small Business Advisory Group have set the bar high, in terms of their thorough advice and the time they have spent working with government to improve the business environment for small and medium enterprises.

“Such a large number of applicants for positions in the group shows there are many local business owners motivated to work with government. After three years of high-calibre work from the first Small Business Advisory Group members, I thought it was appropriate to appoint new members with the same passion and dedication to come on board and build on the team’s achievements.”

Lianne Dalziel said the inaugural members of the Small Business Advisory Group had worked with government on a number of significant initiatives, including changes to fringe benefit tax rules, legislation to amend tax depreciation rules, increased consultation time on regulations affecting business, and simplifying reporting procedures to various government agencies.

“I thank all the outgoing Small Business Advisory Group members for their ideas, hard work and ability to help set in motion policy changes to benefit small businesses.

“I am looking forward to working with the new team, whom I trust will continue to act as forthright advocates for small business as the group’s original members have over the past three years.”
