New Zealand will give $500,000 to the International Red Cross to help relief efforts in the Philippines following Typhoon Durian, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Typhoon Durian swept through central Philippines last week, triggering flooding and mudslides that left 1000 people dead or missing, and hundreds more injured.

“New Zealand and the Philippines have close ties, and the damage and suffering caused by this disaster is immense," Mr Peters said.

"Our aid will provide essential supplies to the survivors, including medicines, food, blankets and clean water.

“The Prime Minister has also written to President Arroyo to convey New Zealand’s condolences and to advise her of our assistance.

"Typhoon Durian is the fourth destructive typhoon to have hit the Philippines in the past two months, and New Zealand previously donated $100,000 to relief efforts in October.

“Mitigating the threat of natural disasters such as Typhoon Durian is a subject we will discuss with President Arroyo and other Asian leaders when the East Asian Summit in Cebu, Philippines, next week,” Mr Peters said.
