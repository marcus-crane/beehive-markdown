Regulations giving effect to United Nations-imposed sanctions against North Korea came into force in New Zealand today.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the United Nations (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) Regulations 2006 ensured New Zealand met its obligations, as a member of the UN, to implement Security Council sanctions.

“New Zealand has joined the international community in strongly condemning North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Hopefully collective action, such as these targeted sanctions, will drive the message home to North Korea's leadership," Mr Peters said.

"News that the Six Party Talks will resume next week is welcome, but the critical question remains whether North Korea is willing to make a genuine commitment to abandon its nuclear ambitions," Mr Peters said.

The sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1718 prohibit the export of luxury goods; military equipment, and items that could be used in ballistic weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and the procurement or provision of services related to such equipment.

They also freeze the assets of certain North Korean groups and individuals, and impose a travel ban against designated North Korean individuals and their families.
