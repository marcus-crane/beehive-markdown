The unofficial Minister for New Zealand Music Judith Tizard today congratulated Outward Sound which helps export our music on a successful first year of operation.

"This government set up Outward Sound last year to help export New Zealand music by assisting with market development initiatives and promoting New Zealand music offshore," says Judith Tizard.

"Outward Sound has granted $538,847.92 to a total of 35 New Zealand artists over four grant assistance rounds over the year. The programme includes music from all genres, styles and niches for the benefit of bands, composers, songwriters, producers, companies and solo artists."

The 35 successful recipients are: Arch Hill Recordings, Batucada Sound Machine, Bic Runga, The Bleeders, Blindspott, Breaks Co-op, Brooke Fraser, The Brunettes, The Checks, Concord Dawn, Die! Die! Die!, Elemeno P, Evermore, Goldenhorse, Goodnight Nurse, Greg Johnson, Handmade Records, John Psathas, Katchafire, King Exports, LOOP Management NA, LOOP Recordings Aot(ear)oa, Midium Records, Minuit, Moana & The Tribe, Ode Record Company, The Phoenix Foundation, Rattle Records, Savage, Sugarlicks Records, Tim Finn, Tyree.

"Outward Sound have invested wisely and the benefits are significant. For example Elton John's declared Break Co-op to be his ‘favourite band in the world’.

Other achievements this year through Outward Sound grants are:

-Greg Johnson’s single ‘Horses’ has been played on US radio 1,200 times and been heard by an audience of nearly nine million. His album will be released in the States on 6 December.

-Batacuda Sound Machine performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and WOMAD in the UK and Goodnight Nurse completed a tour of over 30 Australian secondary schools.

-Moana and the Tribe released their CD and DVD ‘Toru’ through SonyBMG in UK, and undertook a 25 date European tour in support of the release.

-Evermore have had their Dirty South remix of ‘It’s Too Late’ played across USA and UK radiowaves – the track reached number 4 on the USA Billboard Dance Airplay Chart.

\- The Checks, first ‘discovered’ by the NME at NZMIC’s Resonate 2005, have recorded their debut album in London for Full Time Hobby/SonyBMG UK with the first single scheduled for release in Britain during January.

-Elemeno P’s video for ’11:57’ was the number 1 viewer voted video on Channel V for over a month and was the ninth most added song at Australian radio in October.

-Goldenhorse, after two sell out shows in London, went on to play a 13 date headline tour of Germany supporting the release of their album.

-Loop North America is steaming ahead, with ‘Loop Select 08’ being compiled with influential Los Angeles radio DJ Jason Bentley. Loop NA have just won the advertising account for JackAss – the Playstation game.

-Katchafire shipped over 10,000 copies of their debut album ‘Revival’ in Hawaii alone. 160 American radio stations have playlisted tracks, with college radio in Ohio having them at number 1! ‘Revival’ debuted at number 4 in the Billboard World Music charts.

-Breaks Co-Op’s track ‘The Otherside’ got to number 9 on the UK airplay charts and was in the UK iTunes Top Thirty for over a month. After a 57 date tour of UK and Ireland, Elton John declared them his ‘favourite band in the world’.

-Concord Dawn have a UK release scheduled with Metalheadz and were on the cover of November’s ‘Knowledge’ magazine. To a drum and bass artists this is akin to being crowned king of the world.

-Die! Die! Die! secured worldwide management by the prestigious New York firm Esther Creative, who’s clients include Lou Reed and Ricki Lee Jones. They have both English American releases for their debut album and have toured both countries twice already this year. They made their American television debut on the successful show ‘Project Runway’ a month after Billy Corgan from the Smashing Pumpkins and David Bowie were in the audience for a New York showcase.

The Minister says, "These are significant achievements – I look forward to exporting more New Zealand music during Export Year next year."
