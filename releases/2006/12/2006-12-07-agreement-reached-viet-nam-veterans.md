Defence Minister Phil Goff and Veterans Affairs Minister Rick Barker today announced details of the government's response to the recommendations of the Joint Working Group report on the concerns of Viet Nam veterans.

"A formal memorandum of understanding has been signed between the government and representatives of Viet Nam veterans, the Ex-Vietnam Services Association (EVSA) and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RNZRSA).

"The agreed package is wide ranging and acknowledges in concrete terms that service personnel in Viet Nam and their families have been exposed to and continue to be affected by a toxic environment.

"The package is targeted at the key concerns of veterans and their families. These include personal health, the health of children and grand-children, the hurt that has remained with them for decades over the way their exposure to toxic environments has been denied and handled and the manner in which they were treated on their return to New Zealand.

"The focus of this package is on those who have served their country and have faced health or other difficulties. It is based on the three key themes of acknowledging the past, putting things right and improving services to Viet Nam veterans. This government is committed to ensuring this structured and thorough process creates the right circumstances in which we can put this sad chapter in New Zealand's recent history behind us.

"A large amount of detailed planning and development work is required to implement this package. We will establish a Joint Implementation Group comprising representatives from a number of government agencies, the RNZRSA and EVSA to oversee the implementation of the memorandum of understanding.

The first meeting of the JIG will be held in early 2007.

"Details of the events, services and programmes to be implemented will be promulgated to veterans and their families as soon as the JIG has begun working on the practical implementation issues.

"The package will deliver benefits close to $30 million.

"Today's announcement completes a process which began in 2004 when [Parliament's Health Select Committee reported on Viet Nam veteran's exposure to defoliants](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F21127). In response to representations made by Veterans' groups, the Joint Working Group, chaired by Michael Wintringham, was established to make recommendations to government on concerns of Viet Nam veterans.

"The Joint Working Group reported to Ministers on 28 April 2006 and the report can be found online at [www.vietnamvetswg.govt.nz](http://www.vietnamvetswg.govt.nz). Following completion of the report, negotiations began with veteran's organisations. We would like to thank representatives of the EVSA and the RNZRSA for the hard work and commitment they put into successful conclusion to the negotiations. The package announced today substantially reflects the recommendations of the report.

"It is estimated that approximately 3400 New Zealanders served in the Viet Nam war. Many of those veterans and their families receive services from [Veterans Affairs New Zealand](http://www.veteransaffairs.mil.nz/) and the [War Pension Services Unit](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/get-assistance/war-veterans-pensions/index.html) within the Ministry of Social Development.

"We are pleased that after 34 years the grievances which existed and became entrenched have been addressed. It will take time for the healing process to work but at least this process can now begin," said Mr Goff and Mr Barker.

A summary of the government's response package is attached to this release.
