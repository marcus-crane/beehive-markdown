The United Kingdom's Work and Pensions Select Committee is visiting New Zealand this week, on a fact-finding mission about our historically low unemployment and high workforce participation rates.

Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope has described the visit as an endorsement of the Labour-led government's work-focused services.

"The Work and Pensions Select Committee has stated that they're visiting New Zealand to learn more about the active labour market policies that have seen [Unemployment Benefit numbers drop](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27687) by more than 100,000 since 1999, and the [unemployment rate](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27660) fall to historically low levels – currently 3.8 per cent.

"The Select Committee has indicated that it is particularly interested in our work for Maori, sole parents, and people aged 50 and over.

"We've made dramatic reductions in Maori and Pacific Unemployment Benefit numbers and Domestic Purposes Benefit numbers, and through [Working New Zealand](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-10-26.html) we're extending our services to older New Zealanders as well," he said.

"The UK's Labour government and New Zealand's Labour-led government have similar beliefs about the value of work for social inclusion, economic independence, and strong families," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"It's fantastic to have this opportunity to show them what we're doing to put these beliefs into action."

The eight Select Committee members have meetings scheduled with Minister Benson-Pope, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson, Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter, and the Social Services Select Committee; and will visit the Ministry of Social Development, Department of Labour, Treasury, Inland Revenue, and Auckland University Institute of Public Policy.
