Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the reappointments of Dr James Ng and Alick Shaw to the Council of Creative New Zealand.

Dr James Ng of Dunedin, is a retired doctor with a long association with the New Zealand Chinese community. He is the author of a number of publications about the Chinese in New Zealand and has been involved in many national and regional arts and cultural events.

Alick Shaw of Wellington, is a Wellington city councillor and Deputy Mayor. He is active in the cultural activities of the Wellington area, and is a member of the Embassy Theatre Trust and Chair of the Wellington Sinfonia.

Both men have been reappointed for three-year terms ending on 31 October 2009.

Judith Tizard says, “I am delighted that Dr Ng and Mr Shaw have agreed to continue to serve on the Council.”

“Both appointees have considerable governance experience in creative and cultural agencies, and bring valuable skills and knowledge to the Council’s deliberations. I welcome their willingness to contribute to the government's major arts development organisation.”

Background

The Council, chaired by Christopher Doig, is responsible for overall policy development and is the “public face” of the organisation. It guides the development of Creative New Zealand’s three-year Strategic Plan, and determines the division of funding between the two arts boards.
