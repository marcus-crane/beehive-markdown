Jim Anderton, the Minister of Forestry, today announced that $2.475 million would be made available for the Hirini St Gisborne port bypass road, regarded as vital to the Gisborne forestry industry.

Mr Anderton said, at an evening meeting with Gisborne's Mayor and members of the Eastland Wood Council, that the wood industry offered the greatest potential of any industry for substantial returns. But in the past, "It was also the industry in greatest need of transformation, from exports of low value commodities to high-value, high skill, job rich products."

The Forestry Industry Development Agenda (FIDA) and the government have been working closely since 2000. Mr Anderton said that, since becoming Minister of Forestry, his focus has been to remove impediments to development of the industry. The Hirini St extension is regarded by the Gisborne industry as being the key to all forestry access routes into the port.

"Land Transport New Zealand, from the Regional Roading Fund created by the Labour-Progressive government, has agreed to allocate the money. The government has committed significant resources to the development of the wood industry in New Zealand, and in particular in the East Coast region.

Because of the importance of the wood industry to New Zealand’s future development and the positive role it will continue to play in an era of climate change that commitment will continue. So I, along with my colleague, Hon Annette King, the Minister of Transport, am delighted to be able to make this announcement," Mr Anderton said.
