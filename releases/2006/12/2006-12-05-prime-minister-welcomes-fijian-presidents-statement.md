Prime Minister Helen Clark has welcomed today's statement from the Fijian President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, in which he now says he does not support or condone the actions of Commodore Bainimarama and the Fijian military.

"The situation is still very grave in Fiji but the President's comments today are a very important and positive development.

"I welcome the President's statement that he 'neither condones or supports the action of the military' and that these actions are 'contrary to the rule of law and our democratic ideals'.

"Commodore Bainimarama has sought to manufacture legal grounds for his actions but the President has now made it clear that he will not be co-operating in this.

"I continue to urge the Commodore to follow the President's lead and pull back from the brink of this coup, which would be disastrous for the Fijian nation, people, and economy."

Helen Clark said she also welcomed the public's show of support for Prime Minister Qarase and his government, with people gathering outside Mr Qarase's house in Suva.

"It is important that the leaders, church groups, and the public of Fiji show support for the democratically-elected government and the Prime Minister. People power is needed to show that the citizens of Fiji will not tolerate the overthrow of the legal government of Fiji and the abandonment of the rule of law. Helen Clark said.
