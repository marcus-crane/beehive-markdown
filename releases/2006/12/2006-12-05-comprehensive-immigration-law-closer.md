New immigration laws will make coming here easier for the migrants New  
Zealand wants and enhance border security against those we don't want, says  
Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Mr Cunliffe has unveiled a package of proposals for a new Immigration Act  
following public submissions and consultation on the Immigration Act Review  
discussion document issued in April.

"I am delighted with the package agreed to by the Cabinet, including  
changes from the discussion document proposals to reflect of the views of  
the public.

"There was significant public feedback, and proposals that have been  
modified to reflect the views of submitters include additional privacy and human  
rights safeguards and greater emphasis placed on the training of officers  
exercising new powers.

"It is an important part of New Zealand's economic transformation that we  
have a relevant, flexible and responsive immigration system built on strong  
legislation. I believe these changes to the act will deliver this.

"The changes provide the means to simplify and streamline the law to  
facilitate the entry of those migrants we want in New Zealand, and to  
enhance border security and tighten the law against those we don't want.

"This includes a simplified visa system, more flexible powers to enforce  
immigration law and the ability to collect and use biometric information.

"We will have a robust new international protection regime, a world-class  
independent appeals system and a model detention system that will uphold  
human rights and high standards of fairness.

"The world has changed since the current act was introduced in 1987, with  
competition for skills intensifying and new security issues arising. This  
legislation, as part of a wider change programme looking at immigration  
policy and our delivery of services, will ensure New Zealand stays ahead."

An Immigration Bill to replace the existing 1987 Act will now be drafted  
ready for introduction to Parliament in April 2007. The select committee  
stage will provide further opportunities for public input.

### Backgrounder

A programme of immigration change is underway to ensure New Zealand  
continues to attract skilled people who can successfully settle and  
contribute, while maintaining the security of our borders.

There are three pillars to this:

- Legislative reform, through a fundamental review of the 1987  
  Immigration Act
- A strategic review of key aspects of New Zealand's immigration policy
- Supporting service delivery within the Department of Labour.

The 1987 act has been reviewed and the government has decided on proposals to draft a new Immigration Bill.

**Why do we need change?**

The global immigration environment is changing, bringing both  
opportunities and challenges for New Zealand, based on:

- Increased mobility
- Increased competition
- Increased population diversity
- Increased risk

Economic transformation, one of the Labour-led government's three  
priorities for the next decade, seeks to develop a high-income,  
knowledge-based economy that requires accelerating the pace of change and  
becoming more internationally integrated.

In the next decade, immigration, permanent and temporary, is crucial for  
New Zealand's economic transformation:

- as a key source of talent, skills and investment for New Zealand  
  firms
- for raising corporate capacity, improving productivity and boosting  
  international networks
- to increase the proportion of the working age population
- for New Zealand exports, through allowing the entry of tourists and  
  students, two of New Zealand's top foreign exchange-earning industries
- as a balance against emigration by New Zealanders as part of the  
  global trend of increased mobility, and
- to increase our international reach and linkages through leveraging  
  off bilateral and regional relationships, including free trade agreements.

Immigration will continue to be an important source of talent, skills and  
investment in New Zealand businesses.

**The Immigration Act Review**  
The government reviewed the Immigration Act to ensure that New Zealand's  
immigration law encourages the entry of the people we need, while  
effectively protecting New Zealand's border.

Having a strong legislative foundation for New Zealand's immigration system  
will allow the government to better facilitate the entry and stay of people  
New Zealand wants and needs, and better manage risks to New Zealand in a  
fair and balanced way.

Since the Immigration Act came into force in 1987, various amendments have  
been made to the legislation.

These included changes to the removal regime for people unlawfully in New  
Zealand and strengthened provisions to prevent migrant smuggling and  
trafficking. A major change took place in 2003 with the introduction of the  
"expression of interest" approach to selection of skilled migrants.

While these changes have all led to improvements in the way the immigration  
system works, they have been piecemeal and resulted in increasingly complex legislation.

**What was the aim of the review?**

The purpose of this review was to make fundamental changes to immigration  
legislation.

This review aims to provide New Zealand with a strong legislative  
foundation, to allow us to develop future-focused policies and encourage  
economic growth.

This was a review of immigration legislation, rather than a direct review  
of policy or operational procedures.

**What was the process for the review?**

In March 2005, the Cabinet directed the Department of Labour to develop a  
discussion paper for public consultation on the review of the act, and to  
seek feedback on options.

The discussion paper looked at the current legislation and outlined options  
for change including discussion of costs and benefits, and comparisons  
with other countries' immigration legislation.

During the consultation period the department held a series of meetings  
with stakeholders.

This consultation provided an opportunity for immigration stakeholders and  
members of the public to consider the different options and submit their  
views.

The consultation period was from Wednesday April 5 to June 14 2006, however due to significant interest, the close off date for written submissions was extended to 31 June 2006 to allow more time.

Officials held public meetings in May and June 2006, which were attended by  
more than 650 people, to outline the proposals. The department received  
3,985 written submissions in response to this paper, of which 360 were  
unique. Submissions were received from a wide range of individuals and  
organisations including employer organisations, law societies, refugee and  
migrant groups and communities, immigration consultants, carriers,  
government agencies, and education providers.

All submissions were considered and a summary of submissions is available  
at www.dol.govt.nz/actreview

**What was the feedback?**

Some of the proposed changes received strong public support, for example:

- Strong support for an integrated visa system and 90 per cent of 91  
  submitters and public meetings supported an interim visa
- Two-thirds of submitters supported the change for the minister to  
  delegate powers to make positive exceptions to residence decisions, but  
  commented the minister should have the power to intervene
- 75 per cent of 60 organisations agreed to enabling electronic  
  decision-making
- 65 per cent of 62 organisations and 80 per cent of 42 individuals  
  supported providing a stronger legislative basis for employer  
  responsibilities
- Over three-quarters supported a flexible offences and penalties  
  regime for education providers
- General agreement with the Ministry of Justice as the preferred  
  agency to support the tribunal.

Other proposals saw a mix of differing opinions, for example:

- Strong reservations about health exclusion criteria
- Mixed support for a move from four separate appeal bodies to one  
  tribunal
- Mixed responses to the proposal of using classified information in  
  visa and protection decisions
- Mixed views about an instant fine system for strict liability  
  offences where carriers failed to meet their obligations
- Approximately 40 per cent of 83 submitters supported and 40 per cent  
  opposed the issuing of warrants of commitment for secure immigration  
  detention for up to 28 days
- Just under half of the 56 organisations indicated support for the  
  power to collect and store biometric information from non-NZ citizens,  
  compared to 80 per cent of 46 individual submitters.

**What were the decisions?**

The Cabinet agreed to a package of proposals for changes to the Immigration Act. These changes incorporated the views of the public, the results of consultation with other agencies and comparisons to international immigration legislation. The main changes are:

**Facilitation**

- a clear, guiding purpose statement for the Immigration Act  
  a simplified visa system that provides for greater clarity and flexibility in managing non-citizens’ travel to and stay in New Zealand
- providing for more responsiveness and efficiency by enabling the Minister of Immigration to delegate positive discretion in residence decision-making to officials
- enabling electronic decision-making  
  the ability to collect and use specified biometric information to enhance visa and border processing

**Human rights protection**

- a single protection determination procedure that incorporates New Zealand’s core immigration-related international obligations, including the Refugee Convention, the Convention Against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
- a robust independent appeals system, including a single appeals tribunal that replaces the existing four appeals bodies

**Enhanced border security, that maintains high standards of fairness**

- a streamlined deportation process that is more efficient and transparent while maintaining fairness
- an ability to use classified information in a limited range of decision-making situations without disclosure, balanced by a set of special safeguards
- more flexible powers for compliance and enforcement to provide for integrity in the immigration system, such as an ability to require address information about people liable for deportation from a wider range of sources
- more flexible and responsive monitoring and detention provisions that maintain a commitment to human rights, including access to legal aid, new alternatives to secure detention, and more discretion for the courts
- the ability to collect and use specified biometric information for identity verification purposes

**Provisions for third parties**

- employers and education providers required to take reasonable steps to check entitlement to work or study to meet their existing obligations
- new provisions for information sharing to check entitlement to publicly funded services
