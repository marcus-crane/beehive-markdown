The timeframe for a report reviewing alcohol advertising regulations has been extended after the Ministry of Health received more than 250 submissions.

"It's really pleasing to receive such a great response and it is especially encouraging to hear the views of so many young people,'' Associate Health  
Minister Damien O'Connor said.

"The submissions are now being analysed and it is important the Steering Group set up to do the work has enough time to assess all contributions before it reports back to me. Accordingly, I have extended the reporting date to the end of March next year.''

The review covers issues such as the amount of alcohol advertising young people are exposed to. It is assessing regulations controlling the advertising of alcohol.

The Steering Group, which will produce the final report, is made up of representatives from various government ministries, including health and youth development, public health experts and representatives from the Broadcasting and Advertising Standards Authorities.
