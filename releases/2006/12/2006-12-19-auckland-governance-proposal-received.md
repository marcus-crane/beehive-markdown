Minister of Local Government Mark Burton has received a proposal for strengthening Auckland's regional governance arrangements.

"It's positive to see the region's councils working together to develop this proposal," Mark Burton said.

"The government acknowledges the significant amount of work and effort that's gone into this important initiative."

Ministers will now consider the proposal and the details of the resolutions and any caveats that individual councils have added to it.

"It is critical that the Auckland region is served by strong and appropriately structured governance arrangements.

"These structures must be able to take Auckland forward as a twenty-first century metropolitan region, which is able to compete on the international stage.

"Should the model proposed by Auckland councils show real potential to address the challenges and opportunities facing Auckland, then the government will work collaboratively with the region to advance the required reforms."
