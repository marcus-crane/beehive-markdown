New Zealand is contributing $2 million to relief efforts in Africa following two humanitarian crises caused by extreme weather conditions, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand will give $1 million to the United Nations Refugee Agency for its work in the Horn of Africa where severe flooding has affected up to two million people, many of whom have already been made homeless by conflict," Mr Peters said.

“The area affected by the flooding is vast, with food aid required in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya to deliver food supplies.

"The other $1 million will go to the World Food Programme's activities in drought-stricken areas of southern Africa.

“This year has brought relatively good harvests after seven years of severe drought. However many people have lost their livelihoods and are not able to buy food or seeds to plant crops for next year.

"The World Food Programme's relief work is helping people bridge that gap in order to prevent the situation worsening," Mr Peters said.

Both contributions will be managed by the government’s international aid agency, NZAID.
