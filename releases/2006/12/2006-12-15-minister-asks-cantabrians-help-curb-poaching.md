Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton asked Cantabrians to be vigilant over summer and help protect New Zealand’s precious marine resources from poaching.

Mr Anderton said, “Although most people fish responsibly, there is still a hard core who deliberately flout the regulations to line their pockets.”

“The Canterbury coast doesn’t have as big a poaching problem as some other areas, but a lot of seafood poached from other areas is sold in Canterbury.”

“We’ve got to stamp this black market out. This type of fish theft is depleting our valuable fisheries and robbing legitimate users of their fair share.”

Mr Anderton asked Cantabrians to report to the Ministry of Fisheries anyone selling black market paua, rock lobster or any other fish on the 0800 4 POACHER hotline (0800 476 224).

“The same applies for people who are obviously breaking the regulations and taking too much seafood. Call 0800 4 POACHER and report them.”

In October, Mr Anderton, launched the ‘Poaching is Theft’ joint initiative between the seafood industry, government and recreational fishers. This aims to raise public awareness about the impact of poaching and fish theft of paua and rock lobster.

The 'Poaching is Theft' initiative aims to reduce this theft of the millions of dollars of illegal fish that is taken from New Zealand’s coastlines every year.

Mr Anderton said fisheries officers will be very active in Canterbury over the holiday period and that the Canterbury coast lends itself well to patrolling.

“There are limited launching places in Canterbury, so fisheries officers can target their effort and be very effective.”

Mr Anderton said New Zealand had recreational fishing opportunities few other countries enjoyed, and everyone had a part to play in protecting them.

“The recreational regulations are sensible and by complying with the bag and size limits, and reporting suspicious activity, all New Zealanders can help to protect our fisheries for future generations. We want all New Zealanders to have access to a quality catch.”
