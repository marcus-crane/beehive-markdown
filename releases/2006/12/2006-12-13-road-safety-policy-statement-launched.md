New measures to crack down on drugged drivers will create a new offence that makes it illegal to drive "while impaired by illegal drugs", says Transport Minister Annette King.

Ms King made the announcement today when she and Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven launched a Road Safety Policy Statement based on feedback from the public and road safety stakeholders to the See You There … Safe As! programme launched in June this year.

The two Ministers today also launched the Road Safety Education Strategic Framework, endorsed by the National Road Safety Committee, to guide all government agencies involved in road safety education, information and promotion.

Ms King says the issue of drugged drivers was one of the most important raised during the Safe As workshops, and a Land Transport Amendment Bill in 2007 would provide the Government’s response.

“The penalties for drugged-driving offences will mirror those for drink-driving. Drivers who are stopped because they are suspected of driving while impaired by illegal drugs will be required to undergo a roadside test, and if they fail this, they will be required to give an evidential blood test.”

Ms King says the issue of drugged-driving is complicated “and the solution that we have come up with best suits our needs. While we are not introducing random drug testing at this stage, the new law will address the road safety concerns about drugged drivers. If a person fails a roadside test the police officer will have the power to remove the keys of their vehicle and prevent them from driving.”

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven announced several other road safety measures or proposals today, including asking NZ Police to adopt a further reduction in the tolerated speed around schools to 54km. “This builds on the successful initiative in February this year to reduce the tolerance to 5km around schools. That campaign has worked, but we want to provide our children with even more protection. Their safety is paramount,” says Ms King.

Mr Duynhoven says another key issue arising from the Safe As consultation concerned driver education as a key to reducing the road toll.

“There are clearly different education and training needs for different stages of people's lives, starting from their first steps as pedestrians on their way to school,” Mr Duynhoven says.

"Educating people to take responsibility for their actions is critical. Enforcement measures are a reactive remedy and certainly have their place, but we must take a more proactive approach by putting in place an education programme that prevents crashes and breaches of the law.

“The Road Safety Education Strategic Framework contains an education model that takes into account a wider range of road safety issues for a wider audience. This model recognises that everyone in the community can increase their awareness, knowledge and understanding of risks on the road. People will benefit from initiatives they see as highly relevant to themselves, their families and their transport needs for work and leisure.

“New initiatives will include education, information and promotion about unenforceable risks such as driver fatigue and driver distraction.”

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven say another major road safety focus will be on improving the Graduated Driver Licensing System and the associated training and testing regimes to reduce the risks to young and novice drivers.

“This is a complex area and the details are still to be worked out,” says Mr Duynhoven. “This is not something that the Government can achieve on its own. We need to work in partnership with those who are involved in this training and who understand the needs of young drivers.”

Ms King says the Government has clearly noted that one of the strong messages from the consultation programme has been that demerit points are a far more effective deterrent than fines.

"People who persist in breaking road rules will lose their driving privileges because they pose an unacceptable risk to other road users. The Government has asked officials to look at the demerit point regime and develop proposals for the better use of penalties to reduce road safety risks. This approach might be particularly effective with young drivers who repeatedly break the rules while on their graduated licences.

“We will also look at changing the balance between fine levels and demerit point levels for speed offences and look at introducing demerit points on intersection infringements, red-light cameras and seat belt offences, but we will not be introducing demerit points on speed camera detected offences."

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven say the Government will continue to look at other road safety suggestions arising from the consultation during 2007. “The Government remains firmly committed to our stated goal of no more than 300 deaths and 4500 hospitalisations a year by the end of 2010. It would be great if we could do even better than that. No one should ever be killed or injured when going lawfully about their business on our road network.”
