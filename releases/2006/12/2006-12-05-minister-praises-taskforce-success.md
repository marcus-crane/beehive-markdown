Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope has praised the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs for its success in developing work, training, and education options for young people.

"Tourism management, artisan training, trades apprenticeships, and council cadetships are just a few of the work-focused programmes available for young people today," Mr Benson-Pope said at today's signing of the Taskforce's updated Memorandum of Understanding with government.  
.  
"This is in large part thanks to the leadership and support of the Mayors Taskforce over the past four years.

"The Taskforce is also involved in things like School Expos, Young Achievers Awards, and Outdoors Adventure Programmes, all of which motivate and inspire young people to believe in themselves and their abilities," he said.

Mr Benson-Pope also launched the new Mayors Taskforce for Jobs campaign Our Youth Our Future, which will target groups of young people with particular barriers to work.

"The government and the Mayors Taskforce have the goal of every 15 to 19 year old being in work, training, education, or another activity that will lead to long-term economic independence," Mr Benson-Pope said. "We know there's still some way to go, but we're making good progress."

"With 96 per cent of Mayors signed up, the Taskforce provides an excellent structure for councils to support local employers to take on young workers, and keep information and resources flowing among the key players.

"Today's updated Memorandum of Understanding and the launch of Our Youth Our Future will enable us to reach even more young people," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"The partnership with government means the Taskforce can focus on the local initiatives, while government funds and leads national programmes like Gateway, Modern Apprentices, and Youth Transitions Services," he said.

Mr Benson-Pope also welcomed today's announcement by Education Minister Steve Maharey of an additional $2 million for truancy services. "Ensuring young people who should be at school are at school is crucial to their future prospects," he said.
