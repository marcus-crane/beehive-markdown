Artwork from some of New Zealand's talented young artists can now be seen in the Beehive, thanks to a partnership between Arts Access Aotearoa and Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta’s Parliamentary office.

"This is an appropriate and exciting initiative for both organisations," Nanaia Mahuta said. "Arts Access Aotearoa is a national organisation that works to promote access to the arts for all, including youth. As the Minister for Youth Affairs, I am proud to support this initiative, which provides an opportunity for talented young artists to exhibit their work."

The first artist to take part in the project is 22-year-old Symon Te Wheoro, from Raglan, within the Tainui electorate. He is currently in his fourth year studying visual art at Gisborne’s prestigious Toihoukura School.  
The work currently hanging in Ms Mahuta's Beehive Office, Tuakau Redoubt, is part of a series concerning trench warfare and battlefields around the Waikato.

Twenty-three year-old Auckland artist Emily Raftery will be the next to show her work in the office from Monday (December 11). A graduate of the Whitecliffe College of Arts and Design, Emily has completed a degree in fine arts, majoring in photography. Her two untitled photographs are part of a year-long investigation into beauty and light, looking at the way emotional content can be added to a work by using aesthetic techniques.

Executive Director of Arts Access Aotearoa, Julie Donvin-Irons, says: “We are thrilled that the Minister’s office has agreed to host art from talented artists around the country. Both Symon and Emily's work are great examples of the inspiring and intelligent art being produced by young artists, and we look forward to providing the opportunity for more young artists to exhibit their work here.”
