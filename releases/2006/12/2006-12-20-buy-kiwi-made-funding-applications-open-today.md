The initial funding round for the $3 million Buy Kiwi Made Regional and Sector Initiatives Fund is now open, Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made, announced today.

“The fund, established in November, is part of the Government’s $11.5 million Buy Kiwi Made programme. Its aim is to support regional and sector initiatives that have demonstrable economic merit and are consistent with the objectives of Buy Kiwi Made,” said Ms Bradford.

Projects to be funded must be New Zealand-based and focused and be consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations such as WTO and CER arrangements. In addition, projects must fall outside the criteria of existing government assistance programmes.

“The fund is contestable to ensure successful projects have the greatest chance of achieving substantive economic benefits for the relevant sector and the local region. It requires a 50 percent financial contribution from applicants,” said Ms Bradford.

The initial round of up to $1.5 million opens today and will be open until 2 March 2007. A second round of up to $1 million will follow in October 2007, and in March 2008 there will be a final round of $0.5 million with any underspend from previous rounds.

Applications for grants must be from a representative group from sectors or regions, or a cross-sector or cross-regional group, and have strong industry or regional support from industry members, local government, economic development agencies, or iwi and community groups. Applications from individual firms will not be considered.

The Ministry of Economic Development will administer the fund, with final decisions made by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Industry and Regional Development along with the Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made. Application forms for the fund, and further information on Buy Kiwi Made, is available at www.med.govt.nz/buykiwimade/.
