ACC Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the appointment of Wayne Butson and Philippa (Pip) Dunphy to the board of ACC.

"Wayne Butson is an industrial relations specialist, and as National Secretary of the Rail and Maritime Transport Union, Wayne has had significant experience in developing and implementing injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes in workplaces."

"Pip has worked in the financial sector for over 20 years specialising in banking, finance and investment management. She is a member of the Nominating Committee for the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation, and was a member of the Earthquake Commission Board and the Taskforce on Financial Intermediaries. She has worked with a wide number of New Zealand and offshore companies in the area of capital raising, interest rate and currency risk management."

"The differing areas of expertise of Pip and Wayne will be an asset to the ACC board and complement the skills of other board members,” said Ruth Dyson.

Ms Dyson thanked outgoing board member Ray Potroz for his contribution to the board since his appointment in 2000.

ACC board members are appointed for three years, with the opportunity to be re-appointed for a further three years.
