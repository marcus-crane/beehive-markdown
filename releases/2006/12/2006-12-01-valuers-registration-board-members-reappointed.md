Land Information Minister David Parker today announced the reappointment of members to the Valuers Registration Board.

The following members have been reappointed to the Board for three years as of 1 December 2006:

- Michael Evan Leigh GAMBY of Auckland
- Bethia Margaret GIBSON of Wellington
- Hekiara James PUKETAPU of Auckland.

“These members have served the Valuers Board very well,” David Parker said.

“The experience they bring will be valuable as the Board continues its important work.”

The Board operates under the Valuers Act 1948. Its role is to register valuers to conduct valuations of land and buildings. It also monitors the content of valuation degree courses and approves qualifications.

The Board maintains a register of qualified valuers and has certain disciplinary powers over their conduct.

Evan Gamby is reappointed on the nomination of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers. Last year another current member of the Board, Timothy Allan Crighton of Christchurch, was also appointed on the nomination of the Institute.

The fifth member of the Board is the Valuer General, Mr Neill Sullivan of Wellington. Neill is the ex-officio chair of the Board.
