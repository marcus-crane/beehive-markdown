Today’s results of the November Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) launched by the Northern Employers & Manufacturers Association have been welcomed by Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made, Sue Bradford.

“It is pleasing to note that in some cases, orders for manufacturers are booked solid for three months – and that the value of manufactured exports has risen to more than $14 billion, or 45% of all exports of traded goods," Ms Bradford says.

"These figures show that the Manufacturing Industry is not a sunset industry, as some of its detractors maintain. It makes a vital contribution to New Zealand's economy.

"The Government's Buy Kiwi Made programme has the economic aims of helping increase NZ's manufacturing capacity, create employment and reduce the trade deficit. It also has sustainability goals, such as helping to reduce fuel consumption.

“New Zealand's balance of payments deficit is still running far too high. Hopefully, a combination of the Government's Buy Kiwi Made and the Export Year programmes will see this deficit begin to reduce. However, a New Zealand high dollar could undermine such initiatives

“The Buy Kiwi made media marketing campaign will be underway from the middle of 2007," Ms Bradford says.
