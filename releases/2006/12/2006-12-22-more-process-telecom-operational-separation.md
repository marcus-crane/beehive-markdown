Communications Minister David Cunliffe has announced more details of the process to be followed for the operational separation of Telecom.

The Telecommunications Amendment Act provides a process for the minister to finalise legally enforceable undertakings with Telecom for its operational separation in order to promote fair and equal access to key wholesale services.

“It’s important that these undertakings are settled in a timely manner and that they deliver a robust operational separation,” said Mr Cunliffe.

The first phase of the legislative process provides for the minister to issue a detailed determination on his requirements for Telecom’s operational separation.

The minister will be publicly consulting on his draft determination before it goes to the Cabinet for approval.

"I expect to issue a final determination around April."

Once the minister issues his determination, Telecom has 20 working days to prepare its draft separation undertakings in consultation with the minister. There will then be a second public consultation where the minister invites comments on Telecom’s draft operational separation undertakings.

“If all goes well, and with the constructive co-operation of Telecom, I hope to finalise Telecom’s split around the middle of next year,” said Mr Cunliffe.
