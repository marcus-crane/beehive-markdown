A detailed action plan to maximise energy efficiency and renewable energy in New Zealand was launched by government today for public discussion.

The draft New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy proposes detailed actions to achieve energy savings in sectors such as homes, products, industry and vehicles.

It also seeks input to help set targets for the growth of renewable energy.

“In a sustainable energy future, energy efficiency and renewable energy will work together to slow demand growth and reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels,” said Jeanette Fitzsimons, Government Spokesperson for Energy Efficiency and Conservation.

“This is a strategy for all New Zealanders including government, business and every individual. To be successful the strategy needs support from the whole community. If everyone takes responsibility for their part of the plan, everyone will share the benefits of energy savings, warmer homes, better health and a cleaner environment.

“The draft strategy contains a range of possible actions and we are inviting the public to tell us which actions they support, where the priorities should be, and whether the proposals aim too high or not high enough,” Ms Fitzsimons said.

Feedback will be used to determine the content of the final strategy, due out in June 2007.

This draft Strategy has been developed alongside the New Zealand Energy Strategy and is a key part of the Government’s response to global climate change and the need for a secure supply of energy.

Written submissions are invited and must be received by 30 March 2007

Background - the draft New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy

Why do we need this strategy?

If we do nothing, demand for electricity is predicted to increase 40 per cent and for transport fuel by 35 per cent by 2030 – that’s less than 25 years away.  
Our use of fossil fuels – oil, coal and gas - will continue to grow, our greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 30 per cent by 2030.

This means our contribution to worldwide climate change will be so much greater.

This will cost New Zealand more – not just economically, but environmentally and socially as well.

This draft New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy is the Government’s proposal for an action plan to cut the waste, help every New Zealander save money, improve our health and comfort and reduce climate changing emissions from fossil fuels. At the same time, the more we achieve, the more credible becomes our claim to be a truly clean and green country and the envy of the world.

What areas does it cover?

Targets and actions are proposed in the following areas:

Better products – using less energy and saving more money  
Healthy homes - more comfortable with less energy  
Smarter commercial buildings – more productive work environments  
Increased energy productivity in industry  
Sustainable agriculture – efficient with low carbon farms, orchards and vineyards  
Further on a tank full  
Efficient freight movement  
Introducing renewable transport fuels  
Living and working – better mobility, lifestyles and communities  
Smart electricity networks – getting the most from our electricity sector  
Clean electricity and heat – more energy from renewable sources  
Government leading the way – partnership and innovation

What energy efficiency gains will it deliver?

The strategy focuses on the areas where we can make the biggest difference. Targets will be set at sector level, and gains measured at sector level. So, for example the programme that sets energy performance standards for products and appliances is expected to save at least 7 petajoules by 2012. As initiatives are finalized, savings will be confirmed.

How does this fit with the NZES?

This draft strategy sits is an important part of the NZES. It has been developed in partnership with the NZES and is also a standalone strategy under the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000.

It directly supports the New Zealand Energy Strategy (NZES) goals of:

1.Maximising how efficiently we use our energy to safeguard affordability, economic productivity and our environment.  
2.Maximising the proportion of energy which comes from our abundant renewable energy resources.  
The draft strategy sets the direction, proposes \[the] some targets and the ways we can make it happen. It will also set out who is responsible for each measure.

Who is responsible for the strategy?

The draft strategy names those organisations responsible for making sure the targets are achieved.

In each area there is a ‘lead agency’ that carries overall responsibility for delivery, monitoring and reporting. In some areas there are supporting agencies that are responsible for operational delivery of particular aspects of the programme.

Accountabilities are currently being finalised. There will be an element of negotiation, ensuring there is a fair match between accountability, capacity to effect change and the resources required to realise the goals of the draft strategy. Once this process is complete the accountabilities will be reflected in agency Statements of Intent (SOI) and performance agreements with Ministers.

Those agencies involved will also work with local government and non-government organisations to embed the actions throughout New Zealand.

When can we see the final strategy?

We are currently seeking feedback from the public which will be used to develop the targets and actions that will make up the final strategy. Public submissions are invited until 30 March 2007. The final strategy is due out by the end of June 2007.
