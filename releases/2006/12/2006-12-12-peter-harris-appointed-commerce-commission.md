Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel has appointed Peter Harris, the deputy chair of the Electricity Commission, to be an associate member of the Commerce Commission.

The Electricity Commission oversees the performance of the electricity industry while the Commerce Commission administers a targeted control regime to encourage electricity lines companies to improve their performance for the long-term benefit of consumers.

“The cross appointment ensures there is a consistent approach to regulatory oversight of Transpower and the electricity lines businesses. This means the combined impacts of regulation on electricity lines businesses are taken into account in the decision-making,” Lianne Dalziel said.
