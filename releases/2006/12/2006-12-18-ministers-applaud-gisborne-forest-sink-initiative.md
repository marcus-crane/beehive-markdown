Jim Anderton, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and David Parker, Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues have said that the just-announced forestry initiative in Gisborne is just the kind of enterprise that they hope to see more of as New Zealand addresses issues of climate change.

Rakaikura Ltd, representing Maori landowners, and SFM Australasia Pty Ltd, part of the Sustainable Forestry Management Group (a world leader in ecosystems investment) last Friday launched a joint venture, Iwi Rakau Ltd.

The venture will see up to 30,000 hectares of Ngati Porou lands in Gisborne turned into new permanent forests under the Government’s Permanent Forests Sinks Initiative. As well as sequestering up to 75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, the Iwi Rakau Project will provide erosion and flood control benefits.

Ministers Anderton and Parker today launched the Government's discussion document on Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change. They applauded the Ngati Porou venture in the face of the challenges presented by climate change.

"This is a long-term, intergenerational problem that has to transcend short-term self interest. The Iwi Rakau Project is a good example of the kind of business opportunities that present themselves when major change takes place, " Jim Anderton said.

David Parker said that the Government was keen to encourage the planting of Kyoto-compliant forests and it was particularly pleasing to see the Iwi Rakau Project being established: "Not only will this afforestation enhance our carbon sinks, it will provide major co-benefits in relation to erosion control, flood protection, improved water quality and biodiversity."
