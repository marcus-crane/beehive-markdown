Jim Anderton, the guest speaker at Queen Charlotte College's prize-giving ceremony in Picton tonight, complemented the school on its contribution to the aquaculture industry.

Talking about how the Marlborough region is a leader in New Zealand's aquaculture, Mr Anderton recalled his visit to the College in 2003. "The Aquaculture Academy here was new then and I came here for the launch of the Academy's research vessel. Obviously Queen Charlotte College has an important part to play in the development of the industry."

The Government has just announced that it is earmarking $2.9 million to help councils plan for aquaculture as part of its focus on economic transformation in the regions.

“Aquaculture is a growth industry, and will bring sustainable development to our regions if it is properly planned,” Jim Anderton said.

Addressing the students in particular, Jim Anderton said that this country has a history of innovative and visionary young New Zealanders who have come up with brilliant world-beating ideas. "There are more opportunities than ever before. And the message I have for you is that you can be part of those opportunities from right here, in Picton."

"There is never a time when education and learning stop. So the most important ingredient in success is your own determination and vision. And there is an insatiable demand for innovation and creativity - for people to make the most of the skills and opportunities around us," Mr Anderton said.
