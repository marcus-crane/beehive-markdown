A new library for prisoners at the Auckland Regional Women’s Corrections Facility was opened today by the Minister of Corrections Damien O’Connor.

The library will complement the education and work training programmes prisoners will complete to help them find work on release, Mr O’Connor said. More than half of all prisoners have no formal qualifications when they arrive in prison, and about the same number have not worked.

“Literacy and education go hand-in-hand. Access to books from the new library will enable prisoners to consolidate the reading skills they learn through prison-based educational programmes.

"This will help them become valued members of the community, such as increasing the chances of them finding work, which is a key part of the Government's Effective Interventions strategy.

“As well as helping them find employment, it is true that many of the women here are, or will be, mothers. I hope they will use this library to practice reading skills they can use to support their children succeed at school and have better lives.”

Corrections is also presently evaluating additional education and foundation learning in prisons, and developing a long-term strategy linking to the Prisoner Employment Strategy. The strategy aims to further develop work skills among prisoners through prison-based industry and courses, and release-to-work programmes.

It is also rolling out an additional 500 recycled computers for prisoners over the next six months, which will enable group classes and the use of new non-Internet teaching materials.
