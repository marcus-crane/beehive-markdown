A review of international tax rules aims to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand companies operating in export markets overseas, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Active income from the offshore operations of New Zealand companies may be exempted from domestic income tax to help them compete internationally," the Ministers said.

The possible change is outlined in a [discussion document](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/)  
released today that seeks feedback on options for a major revamp of New Zealand’s international tax rules.

"We are looking at a radical shift in our approach to taxing offshore income from our companies operating overseas, one that distinguishes between active income, such as manufacturing and industrial activity, and passive income, such as royalties and interest," said the Ministers.

"Under such a distinction, offshore active income would be exempt from New Zealand tax, rather than taxed as it is earned, as happens now.

"The current rules may encourage New Zealand companies to relocate their headquarters to some countries where their offshore income is treated more favourably. Reducing the tax burden will improve their competitiveness and help to ensure New Zealand retains more activity.

"For example, a New Zealand-based company with operations in China would be able to take the same advantage of China’s tax holidays as companies from other countries. Under New Zealand’s current international tax rules, however, the company would pay tax at a 33 per cent rate on such income.

"We want to ensure New Zealand companies operating offshore with subsidiaries can obtain the same advantages in another country as their competitors.

"The tax rules of nearly all other countries distinguish between active and passive income, and either delay taxing offshore active income until dividends are paid or exempt it altogether, as Australia does.

"The rules can also create high compliance costs because they require New Zealand-based firms overseas to calculate their income tax in accordance with New Zealand tax rules, even though there may be little or no additional tax to pay here once they have paid foreign tax.

"Our tax system plays an important role in fostering a competitive business environment. That is why it is a key focus of the government’s Economic Transformation agenda.

"The possible change would bring us in line with most other OECD countries and reinforce our efforts to improve competitiveness under the Business Tax Review.

"Reform of the international tax rules was urged by many in submissions to the Business Tax Review especially large, export focused companies. It has also been raised with government by a number of business groups. Some firms consider a move to an active/passive regime as important, if not more important, than lowering the corporate tax rate.

"Also under consideration is a possible reduction in non-resident withholding tax rates in the tax treaties that we negotiate with other countries. This is levied when a non-resident derives interest, royalties or dividends from New Zealand. Lower rates would help encourage inward investment and would also benefit New Zealand firms investing offshore because reciprocal arrangements could apply as tax treaties were renegotiated.

"If the government proceeds with the changes outlined in the discussion document, it will be necessary to introduce complementary domestic tax base protection measures to ensure that only offshore active income is exempted. For example, if active foreign income becomes exempt from New Zealand tax, we would need to ensure that excessive interest is not deducted from New Zealand earned income

"We anticipate lively interest in the possible reform, and look forward to receiving submissions on the ideas canvassed in the discussion document. Submissions are due by 16 February 2007 and the government expects to be in a position to make decisions by the middle of next year," the Ministers said.
