Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui has launched Whakatâtaka Tuarua: Mâori Health Action Plan 2006-2011.

*Whakatâtaka Tuarua 2006-2011* sets objectives for Mâori health over the next five years and builds on from [*Whakatâtaka - The Mâori Health Action Plan*](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/by+unid/E09B7F5EB0A2665CCC256C70007D22EC?Open) which was implemented in 2002, which has provided the health sector with a valuable tool for contributing to reducing health inequalities between Mâori and non-Mâori.

"I am pleased to announce that many of the actions from Whakatâtaka 2002-2005 have been successfully implemented and so today I also launch a document celebrating some of these achievements entitled Ngâ Kâwai."

Some of these milestones include the establishment of the Whânau Ora awards which celebrate innovative Mâori provider initiatives every two years. [Raranga Tupuake: Mâori Health and Disability Workforce Development Plan](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/B8F7F25B7906CD4CCC25714F001611B6) was launched earlier in the year and [Ethnicity Data Protocols](http://www.nzhis.govt.nz/documentation/ethnicity/index.html) have also been implemented across the health and disability sector.

Mita Ririnui says, "the second Mâori health action plan proposes a number of new actions and identifies four key priority areas for Mâori health.

"These include building quality data and monitoring Mâori health, developing whânau ora-based models, improving Mâori participation at all levels of the sector, particularly workforce development and governance and improving primary health care.

"This government is committed to improving the health status of Mâori, who have on average the poorest health status of any ethnic group in this country."

Mita Ririnui says if we want to improve the health of our Mâori population we must ensure we have health professionals that can respond to the needs of Mâori. It is encouraging to see the degree to which reducing inequalities is now core business for our primary health care sector.

"I am pleased with the [extensive public consultation]() the Ministry of Health undertook in developing Whakatâtaka Tuarua: 2006-2011."

Hui were held throughout the country to gather views on what priorities and actions the health and disability sector should do to improve Mâori health. Overall there was broad support for the action plan.

Since the consultation period, the action plan has been transformed to represent Whakatâtaka Tuarua: 2006-2011, reflecting common messages from the hui, including the need for greater collaboration across sectors and within health; the need to enhance mainstream services to address Mâori health needs; and explicit actions to address the health needs of Mâori living in rural areas.

"I look forward to regular updates on progress from the Ministry of Health on the sector's implementation of Whakatâtaka Tuarua and the latest action plan will be reviewed in 2009/2010."

### Frequently Asked Questions

***1. Has the Ministry of Health achieved all of what it set out to do in Whakatâtaka: Mâori Health Action Plan 2002-2005?***  
The Ministry has met many of the milestones under the first Mâori Health Action Plan and these are documented in the publication Ngâ Kâwai. Some highlights include:

- Strategic Research Agenda for He Korowai Oranga completed in 2005. The Strategic Research Agenda aims to build an evidence base for He Korowai Oranga that is supported by a coordinated and resourced Mâori health research community.
- Ethnicity Data Protocols for the health and disability sector completed and training on the use of these conducted with DHBs from 2004-2006. The Ethnicity Data Protocols describe procedures for the standardised collection, recording and output of ethnicity data for the New Zealand health and disability sector.
- Mâori Provider Development Scheme continues to support the delivery of effective health services to Mâori.

Because of their long term focus, some activities like primary health care, public health initiatives and workforce development will continue to be advanced under Whakatâtaka Tuarua.

***2. Did the Ministry of Health reflect changes in Whakatâtaka Tuarua 2006-2011 following its consultation period on the document?***  
Yes. As a result of [consultation](), some gaps were identified and this has led to additional actions being incorporated in the plan. Some of these include:

- an action on the review of the [Well Child](http://www.wellchild.org.nz/) Framework and Schedule including ensuring services are effective for Mâori
- an action that the Ministry of Health with DHBs and other relevant stakeholders engage with whânau, hapû, iwi and Mâori communities to ensure that strategies and planning processes to any emerging health issues of national significance take account of Mâori health needs
- an action relating to improving the prevention and management of long term conditions
- an action relating to the implementation of [Good Oral Health for all, for life: A Strategic Vision for Oral Health in New Zealand](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/by+unid/229C4904287A71EDCC2571D3007BE4BE?Open) including ensuring that community oral health services will be delivered effectively to reduce the inequalities in Mâori oral health
- a stronger evaluative focus for the whânau ora case studies
- several intersectoral initiatives under [Pathway Four](http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesma/355)

The Ministry has also reviewed all actions and associated milestones in response to feedback. Refinements have been made.

***3. Which areas of Mâori health still require particular attention?***  
Whakatâtaka Tuarua identifies the following areas for priority attention over the next five years:

- building quality data and monitoring Mâori health
- developing whânau-ora-based model
- improving Mâori participation at all levels of the sector particularly workforce development and governance
- improving primary health care.

These priority areas were affirmed through limited sector engagement in 2005 and during public consultation by the Ministry in 2006.

***4. When will Whakatâtaka Tuarua 2006-2011 be reviewed again?***  
Whakatâtaka Tuarua will be reviewed in 2009/2010. Findings from the review will be reported to the Minister of Health and will be considered when planning for the next Mâori health action plan commences.

As the action plan is implemented, regular progress reports will also be provided to the Minister of Health.

The Whakatâtaka forum – a group comprising DHB and Ministry representatives will continue to maintain oversight of the action plan as it is implemented.

***5. Why has references to the Treaty been taken out of Whakatâtaka Tuarua 2006-2011 when they were included in the first action plan?***  
An overarching aim for the health and disability sector is the improvement of Mâori health and disability outcomes and to reducing inequalities. The overarching commitment to this can be seen in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act.

This high level commitment is also woven through key strategies – notably the New Zealand Health Strategy, the New Zealand Disability Strategy and He Korowai Oranga.

In the development of Whakatâtaka Tuarua, the Ministry of Health has been guided by these high level statements, including references to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act. The challenge, however, has been to come up with tangible and meaningful actions that operationalise the Government’s commitment, as it is actions not words that will make the difference in producing better health outcomes for Mâori.

***6. How does Whakatâtaka Tuarua aim to improve health inequalities for Mâori?***

Whakatâtaka Tuarua will be an important tool for contributing to reducing health inequalities between Mâori and non-Mâori. Whakatâtaka Tuarua weaves together activities from across the health and disability sector, and other sectors into a single plan that can be monitored over time. This approach will enable the Ministry and DHBs to assess progress made to reduce health inequalities for Mâori.
