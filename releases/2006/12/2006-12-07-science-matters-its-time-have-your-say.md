Biosecurity New Zealand has released their draft  
[*Biosecurity Science, Research and Technology Strategy for New Zealand – Mahere Rautaki Putaiao Whakemaru*](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/science-strategy). The Minister for Biosecurity, Jim Anderton said the consultation period, which closes 28 February 2007, will provide an opportunity for the public to have their say in the future of New Zealand’s science system.

"The strategy doesn’t just focus on research needs but also outlines ways to better deliver biosecurity science and make sure that it is being used to underpin and improve the biosecurity system," Jim Anderton said.

“The strategy is wide ranging. It covers biosecurity science needs for both land and water systems while recognising the importance of protecting our environmental, economic, social and cultural values. It also identifies and prioritises our science needs which will help focus effort where it will make the biggest difference.

"The document reflects the fact that prevention is definitely better than cure for biosecurity and priority action areas for future science direction demonstrate the need to focus research on pushing risk offshore before it reaches New Zealand, while continuing to secure our borders," Jim Anderton said.
