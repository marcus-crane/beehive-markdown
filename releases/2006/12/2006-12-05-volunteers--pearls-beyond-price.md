“Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!”

That is the message Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector is sending to all volunteers, today, on International Volunteer Day.

“Look around New Zealand – volunteers are everywhere! They are the backbone of grass-roots sports, the frontline of our emergency services and disaster relief, and are an integral and valued part of many community and voluntary organisations. From the conservation and environment sectors, to law, the arts and social services – volunteers are pearls beyond price in our communities," Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

The United Nations designated 5 December as International Volunteer Day and invites governments globally to celebrate and acknowledge volunteering. Today celebrates the important role volunteers play in societies.

“More than one million New Zealanders carry out valuable voluntary work both in New Zealand and overseas. These are the very people who help to shape our identity as a nation as their dedication and work brings economical, cultural and social benefits for our country. That is why our Labour-led Government continues to put time, energy and resources into supporting volunteering,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

Initiatives include the Government Policy on Volunteering, the Support for Volunteering Fund, support for the network of Volunteer Centres, grants from the Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS), and the Cheers Volunteers campaign as part of the $6.5 million boost to grassroots sport with a focus on volunteer participation.

“It is great to have this special day to step back, appreciate and celebrate the work of our volunteers”, said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

125 countries now celebrate International Volunteer Day. A list of activities for its celebration in New Zealand can be found on www.volunteeringnz.org.nz or free phone 0800 VOL CNTR (0800 865-2687)
