The government will invest $8 million to build a new primary school at Snells Beach, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The new school located on Dawson Road, will cater for year 1-6 students and is planned to open in 2009, with an initial roll of around 260, growing to 500 over the next 12 years.

"The population of Snells Beach and Algies Bay is projected to grow from 3,500 to 9,200 by 2018. The establishment of Snells Beach primary School will enable us to meet the needs of the local community and provide a world-class learning environment for the students," Steve Maharey said.

"The community has been closely involved in the development of plans for the new school, to ensure they reflect what the community wants, and provide the best possible setting for local students.

"An enrolment scheme for the new school will be developed to ensure that Snells Beach and Algies Bay students have access to a local school, and also to minimise the impact on existing schools in the area.

"Like all new schools, this school will be state-of-the-art with design elements that reflect the local community, and help to provide the best possible education for students.

"An establishment board, which will have responsibility for appointing a foundation principal, determining school policy and governance matters and ensuring the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community will be appointed early in the New Year.

"The Labour-led government currently invests $527.8 million in school property funding, which allows existing schools to continue modernising their buildings, as well as for the construction of new schools like Snells Beach."
