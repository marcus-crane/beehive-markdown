The winning of a dozen environmental awards by Northland schools shows that young people are making a real difference in driving environmental change, says Youth Affairs and Acting Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Northland schools have been recognised for a range of environmental  
initiatives – including turning a swampy paddock into a thriving wetland – at the region's first Enviroschools Awards.

"This is a fantastic example of how local environmental projects which get young people involved can make a real difference for their schools and in their communities," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"The Enviro-schools initiative provides a fantastic opportunity for young people to not only better understand the world around them, but to also lead and even inspire others in their communities to work towards positive environmental change."

Enviroschools is a whole-school approach to environmental education,  
encouraging student-driven action, based on sustainable management of  
resources in several key areas of school life.

The nationwide programme originated through Hamilton City Council in 1993.  
There are now 400-plus Enviroschools in New Zealand, with more  
than 20 in Northland.

"Congratulations to all the schools involved, and to the Northland Regional Council and Ministry of Education's advisory arm, Team Solutions, which joined forces to run these inaugural awards. I look forward to hearing more about the positive impact that the Enviro-schools programme is having in Northland," Nanaia Mahuta said.
