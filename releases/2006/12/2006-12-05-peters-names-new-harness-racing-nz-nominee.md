Racing Minister Winston Peters has announced the appointment of Ray O'Connor to the governing body of the New Zealand Racing Board, effective 1 December 2006.

"Mr O'Connor is appointed on the nomination of Harness Racing New Zealand and will replace Jim Wakefield, who has resigned for personal reasons," said Mr Peters.

"Mr O'Connor, a Chartered Accountant based in Cambridge, will bring a sound combination of industry experience as an accountant that will add value to the skills present on the New Zealand Racing Board governing body.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Jim Wakefield for his fine service on the New Zealand Racing Board and to the New Zealand racing industry.

"Mr Wakefield was appointed to the inaugural New Zealand Racing Board in 2003, which undertook a number of initiatives to lay the foundation for racing's future development," concluded Mr Peters.
