Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton used the opportunity of being in the Gisborne region for a meeting with the Gisborne District Council to reinforce the message of the Poaching is Theft campaign over the coming summer holiday period.

“Large numbers of holiday makers arrive on the East Coast for the Christmas break and levels of poaching fish, rock lobster and shellfish tend to rise at this time," Jim Anderton said today.

"Fisheries officers have already noticed an influx in poaching with the onset of summer. One group fishing at Mahia had 150 paua and 25 rock lobster confiscated at the weekend. These were in excess and most were undersize.

“This type of fish theft is depleting our valuable fisheries and robbing legitimate users of their fair share.”

Mr Anderton said there will be ongoing surveillance in and around the East Coast/Mahia area over the summer months and fishery officers will be making regular patrols.

“But to catch poachers and fish thieves, fisheries officers need help from the public. The East Coast has dozens of secluded bays and fisheries officers can’t be everywhere. Good information, phoned quickly to the Ministry of Fisheries, often makes the difference in successfully catching poachers.”

In October, Mr Anderton, launched the “Poaching is Theft’ joint initiative between the seafood industry, government and recreational fishers, which aims to raise public awareness about the impact of poaching and fish theft of paua and rock lobster.

“Everyone is entitled to their fair share of these resources and everyone can play their part to ensure the sustainability of New Zealand’s valuable fisheries. Thieves who line their own pockets with a public resource are decreasing the quality of legitimate users catch,” Mr Anderton said.

“By using the new 0800 4 Poacher number (0800 476 224) to contact MFish, everyone can help with this problem.”  
The 'Poaching is Theft' initiative aims to reduce the theft of millions of dollars of illegal fish that is taken from New Zealand’s coastlines every year.

“By complying with the bag and size limits for paua and rock lobster, and reporting suspicious activity, all New Zealanders can help to protect the fisheries for future generations. We want all New Zealanders to have access to a quality catch, Jim Anderton said.

### Background

Those fishing during the summer holidays are reminded to stay within size limits and daily bag limits as well as making sure any fishing gear used meets the legal requirements. Information on [recreational fishing restrictions](http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Recreational/default.htm) can be found on the Ministry of Fisheries web site [www.fish.govt.nz](http://www.fish.govt.nz/). You need to find out your legal obligations before you go fishing.

***How do you help stop fish theft?***  
If you see someone:

- taking over their daily limit
- taking undersized fish
- undertaking suspicious activity
- offering you cheap paua or rock lobster (crayfish), especially if its for cash
- Report them: Call 0800 4 POACHER - remember: Poaching is Theft

The Ministry of Fisheries will use all information reported. They may have a compliance officer on hand who can respond immediately or the information will be added to their file for the area. This information will be used to plan operations that will net the poachers.

Every call will be attended to and acted upon and any information provided will remain confidential and can be supplied anonymously.

In the event of a prosecution, members of the community are being encouraged to fill in a Victim Impact Statement – because it is everyday New Zealanders who are the victims of this crime.

***What happens if a ‘couple extra’ or undersize paua or crays are taken?***  
With over 800,000 recreational fishers in New Zealand, if everyone takes a ‘few more’ than allowed, the numbers soon add up. The limits have been set carefully to ensure that the maximum number can be taken without harming the resource – even one or two more could have an effect on the resource.

If undersized paua or rock lobster are taken, they cannot complete the breeding cycle. By taking or buying undersized fish the resource is being robbed of babies and young mothers. By sticking to the rules and taking a stand against those that are abusing the system everyone can help to protect these resources for the future.
