Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor has announced the appointment of three new members of the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand.

The new members are: chairman Peter Glensor (chair of the Hutt Valley District Health Board), Alick Shaw (Deputy-Mayor of Wellington) and Robyn Northey (former dental nurse and social worker now working in the health and not-for-profit sector).

They replace outgoing chairman Prof Andrew Hornblow and members Monica Stockdale and Dr Gillian Tasker, whose commitment and vision have helped show New Zealanders the harms associated with binge drinking, Mr O'Connor said.

"I think we owe the outgoing members a huge debt of gratitude. Under Prof Hornblow's leadership ALAC has made great progress in changing New Zealand's attitude to drinking."

Mr O'Connor said he was looking forward to working with the new members, who would help position ALAC to meet future challenges.

"I am delighted to announce the appointment of three people with extensive experience across a broad range of sectors.

"Their contribution over the next three years will be a vital part of meeting ALAC's key objectives of encouraging and promoting moderation in the use of alcohol and reducing alcohol-related harm. I expect we will see great progress in this area in the coming years to build on the gains ALAC has already achieved."

ALAC has eight members including representatives from the Maori and Pacific communities, a person with experience in public health and at least one person with experience in the treatment of alcohol dependence.
