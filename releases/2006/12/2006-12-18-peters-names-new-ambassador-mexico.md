New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Mexico will be career diplomat Cecile Hillyer, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“Mexico is an important partner in Latin America and a significant export market for New Zealand. Ties between our countries are also diverse, and offer many opportunities for further development,” Mr Peters said.

“Under the government’s Latin America Strategy, the bilateral relationship has developed strongly on all fronts.

"Prime Minister Helen Clark visited Mexico in 2001 and there have been several ministerial and high-level exchanges between the two countries since.

"Mexico is also very active on the international stage, and we cooperate closely in areas such as trade liberalisation, nuclear disarmament, human rights, climate change and whaling," Mr Peters said.

Ms Hillyer, who takes up her appointment in April 2007, was director of the Ministry's Audit Review Division. Her previous postings were as Consul-General in Noumea, and in London and Moscow. She replaces George Troup, who is returning to Wellington.
