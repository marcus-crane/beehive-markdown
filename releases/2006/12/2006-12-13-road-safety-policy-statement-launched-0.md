New measures to crack down on drugged drivers will create a new offence that makes it illegal to drive "while impaired by illegal drugs", says Transport Minister Annette King.

Ms King made the announcement today when she and Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven launched a Road Safety Policy Statement based on feedback from the public and road safety stakeholders to the See You There … Safe As! programme launched in June this year.

The two Ministers today also launched the Road Safety Education Strategic Framework, endorsed by the National Road Safety Committee, to guide all government agencies involved in road safety education, information and promotion.

Ms King says the issue of drugged drivers was one of the most important raised during the Safe As workshops, and a Land Transport Amendment Bill in 2007 would provide the Government’s response.

“The penalties for drugged-driving offences will mirror those for drink-driving. Drivers who are stopped because they are suspected of driving while impaired by illegal drugs will be required to undergo a roadside test, and if they fail this, they will be required to give an evidential blood test.”

Ms King says the issue of drugged-driving is complicated “and the solution that we have come up with best suits our needs. While we are not introducing random drug testing at this stage, the new law will address the road safety concerns about drugged drivers. If a person fails a roadside test the police officer will have the power to remove the keys of their vehicle and prevent them from driving.”

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven announced several other road safety measures or proposals today, including asking NZ Police to adopt a further reduction in the tolerated speed around schools to 54km. “This builds on the successful initiative in February this year to reduce the tolerance to 5km around schools. That campaign has worked, but we want to provide our children with even more protection. Their safety is paramount,” says Ms King.

Mr Duynhoven says another key issue arising from the Safe As consultation concerned driver education as a key to reducing the road toll.

“There are clearly different education and training needs for different stages of people's lives, starting from their first steps as pedestrians on their way to school,” Mr Duynhoven says.

"Educating people to take responsibility for their actions is critical. Enforcement measures are a reactive remedy and certainly have their place, but we must take a more proactive approach by putting in place an education programme that prevents crashes and breaches of the law.

“The Road Safety Education Strategic Framework contains an education model that takes into account a wider range of road safety issues for a wider audience. This model recognises that everyone in the community can increase their awareness, knowledge and understanding of risks on the road. People will benefit from initiatives they see as highly relevant to themselves, their families and their transport needs for work and leisure.

“New initiatives will include education, information and promotion about unenforceable risks such as driver fatigue and driver distraction.”

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven say another major road safety focus will be on improving the Graduated Driver Licensing System and the associated training and testing regimes to reduce the risks to young and novice drivers.

“This is a complex area and the details are still to be worked out,” says Mr Duynhoven. “This is not something that the Government can achieve on its own. We need to work in partnership with those who are involved in this training and who understand the needs of young drivers.”

Ms King says the Government has clearly noted that one of the strong messages from the consultation programme has been that demerit points are a far more effective deterrent than fines.

"People who persist in breaking road rules will lose their driving privileges because they pose an unacceptable risk to other road users. The Government has asked officials to look at the demerit point regime and develop proposals for the better use of penalties to reduce road safety risks. This approach might be particularly effective with young drivers who repeatedly break the rules while on their graduated licences.

“We will also look at changing the balance between fine levels and demerit point levels for speed offences and look at introducing demerit points on intersection infringements, red-light cameras and seat belt offences, but we will not be introducing demerit points on speed camera detected offences."

Ms King and Mr Duynhoven say the Government will continue to look at other road safety suggestions arising from the consultation during 2007. “The Government remains firmly committed to our stated goal of no more than 300 deaths and 4500 hospitalisations a year by the end of 2010. It would be great if we could do even better than that. No one should ever be killed or injured when going lawfully about their business on our road network.”

Questions and answers on drugged-driving.

Why does the new offence apply only to illegal drugs?  
Illegal drugs may be a bigger safety risk than legal drugs. Prescribed medicines and over the counter medicines generally come with substantial warnings where necessary, and are used responsibly by the majority of the population. While the proposed new offence will only apply to illegal drugs the offence of driving while being incapable of proper control will apply to both legal and illegal substances.

What about benzodiazepines (tranquillisers)?  
These medicines usually come with warnings about using heavy machinery and driving, and are prescribed by doctors who will ensure their patients are aware of the likely effects. We expect New Zealanders to continue to use prescription medicines responsibly and carefully consider their fitness to drive. Nevertheless where Police detect impairment at the roadside, they will be able to take action to address the immediate risk to road safety by taking the keys from the driver.

Why aren't we doing what the Australians are doing? Why don't we have random testing for illegal drugs? South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria have introduced random testing for illegal drugs. In these states it is an offence to be driving with detectable levels of certain illegal drugs in your body fluids. In New Zealand, we think it is important to make a link with our road safety goals. What matters is that we identify if the driver is impaired. If we find the driver is impaired by alcohol at a certain level, that is an offence. If we find the driver is impaired by illegal drugs, that will be an offence. Our goal, in line with the harm minimisation principles of the NZ Drug Policy, is to improve the road safety risk.

What will happen at the side of the road?  
First, if a police officer suspects a driver is impaired, the usual alcohol detection process will take place. If the driver is not impaired by alcohol, but the police officer is still suspicious of impairment, a roadside impairment test will now be compulsory. The specific impairment test to be undertaken will be published in the NZ Gazette. At the moment, the test, which is not compulsory, includes an eye examination, a balance test, a walk and turn test and other similar tasks. If the driver does not perform these tasks to a satisfactory standard, the police officer will be able to forbid the driver to drive for a period of time (say 24 hours). A blood test will be required, and the driver will then be taken to a police station or medical centre for this. If the driver performs the tests satisfactorily, he or she will be free to go.

Is the test the same for everyone?  
The test is the same for everyone, but in judging whether the test has been performed satisfactorily, the Police Officer will make allowances for age, state of health and so on.

What if I fail the test because I am sick?  
It may be that the Police Officer refers the case to the Director of Land Transport for consideration of the driver's medical fitness to drive.

Can police stop me anytime, anywhere? Yes. The test will be compulsory when the Police Officer has reason to suspect impairment.

What about the methadone users (they've killed people in the past)? What about party pills?  
The definition of an 'illegal' drug in this road safety context will be very carefully considered as the legislation is drafted. Methadone is a prescription medicine and if it is used in accordance with the prescription, it will not be strictly or specifically illegal to drive while impaired by methadone, or by party pills. It will still be an offence to be incapable of proper control of a vehicle. The immediate risk of someone driving while impaired will be addressed by taking the keys off the driver at the roadside, whatever substance has impaired them.

What about existing offence for 'improper control'?  
The existing offence, for being "under the influence of drink or a drug or both, to such an extent as to be incapable of proper control" of a motor vehicle, will remain unchanged.
