Dr Judith Aitken is the new Chair of Capital & Coast DHB, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

Dr Aitken is currently Acting Chair of the Capital & Coast DHB, following current Chair Bob Henare being on leave, due to a slow recovery from an operation. Dr Aitken's term as an elected board member on the Capital & Coast DHB began in 2001. She has served as the board’s Deputy Chair since 2004. Her appointment as Chair commences on 24 December 2006, the date on which Mr Henare’s resignation takes effect.

"Judith Aitken will bring substantial governance experience to her new position through her previous roles, and I look forward to continuing to work with her to improve health outcomes for the people of Capital & Coast DHB." Pete Hodgson said.

Dr Aitken has extensive experience in the business, consultancy and governance areas, through her former roles and appointed offices with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, the Wellington Regional Council, the State Service Commission and the Australian Department of Education.

Pete Hodgson also thanked Mr Henare, the current Chair, for his outstanding work and careful stewardship of the Capital & Coast DHB and its predecessor during the last 17 years and wishes him good luck with his recovery and future enterprises.
