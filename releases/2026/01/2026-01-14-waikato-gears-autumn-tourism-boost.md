Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has announced more than $450,000 in funding for a new international tourism campaign, helping boost the Waikato economy as autumn approaches.

The funding will support new seasonal travel deals and itineraries designed to attract international visitors, particularly from Australia, to experience the heart of the North Island during the cooler months via direct flights to Hamilton Airport.

“I’m excited visitors will be able to experience the best the Waikato region has to offer from the moment their flight touches down,” Louise Upston says.

“This campaign celebrates everything that makes this region unique. From cycling the Waikato River Trails and exploring the Hobbiton Movie Set, to marvelling at the glowworm caves of Waitomo or visiting the Len Lye centre in New Plymouth, there is something for every traveller. Autumn brings a vibrant new perspective to our landscapes, our farmers’ markets are in full swing, and our hospitality is always warm.”

Funded at $459,250, the *One Flight* campaign will be delivered through a regional collaboration led by Hamilton & Waikato Tourism, with Destination Great Lake Taupō, Visit Ruapehu, and Venture Taranaki. Together, these organisations are making it easier for visitors to explore the best of the central North Island, with new travel deals and themed itineraries designed for the autumn season.

“Seasonal deals and new itineraries will help support local businesses, create jobs, and share in the pride that locals feel for their home. This is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the spirit of the heart of the North Island,” Louise Upston says.

The *One Flight* campaign is one of five initiatives supported in the second stage of the Regional Tourism Boost (Round 2 ) which totals $3.69 million and aims to bring more international visitors to regional New Zealand during autumn and early winter 2026.
