Starting today, New Zealanders can receive prescriptions for up to 12-months, saving them money and simplifying access to medicines, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is a commonsense change that will make a real difference to patients who have stable, long-term conditions like asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and high blood pressure,” Mr Brown says. 

“If their GP or other prescriber decides it’s appropriate and safe to provide 12-month prescriptions, these patients won’t have to get a new prescription every three months from their GP. 

“They will visit their usual pharmacy to collect the repeats, and they will only pay a single prescription charge of $5 when they collect their first supply. Patients won’t need to pay a charge for the remaining repeats over the 12-month period.

“This is a win-win for both patients and health professionals. It means lower costs, and better access to medicines for New Zealanders with long term, stable medical conditions. It also reduces the time GPs and other prescribers need to spend renewing routine prescriptions, making it easier for other patients to get an appointment when they need one.

“This is just one of the practical, patient-focused changes the Government has made to give New Zealanders better access to healthcare, closer to home.

“We have also increased prescribing rights for health professionals like nurse practitioners, enabling them to prescribe a wider range of medicines within their areas of practice.

“Together, these changes mean New Zealanders will have quicker, easier, and more affordable access to the care and medicines they rely on.”
