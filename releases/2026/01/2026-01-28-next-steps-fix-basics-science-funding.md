Research Funding New Zealand will bring together leading science, innovation and technology experts to invest in research that delivers real-world benefits for New Zealanders, says Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti.

Dr Reti has announced the inaugural Research Funding NZ Board, established to streamline research funding and provide independent, strategic investment decisions that support economic growth.

“For too long, New Zealand’s research funding system has been fragmented and overly complex, creating unnecessary red tape and diluting impact,” says Dr Reti.

“Research Funding NZ fixes the basics by replacing multiple decision-makers with a single, independent board. This will create a simpler, more coherent funding system while strengthening our focus on excellent research with real-world outcomes.”

The Board brings together some of New Zealand’s most accomplished science and innovation leaders, with experience across the Marsden Fund, MBIE Science Board, Health Research Council, and international funding bodies in Australia, Singapore and Europe.

The Research Funding NZ Board members are:

- Dr Emma Blott (Chair)
- Professor Aidan Byrne
- Professor Amanda Barnard
- Professor Brett Cowan
- Professor Dianne Gleeson
- Dr Meika Foster
- Distinguished Professor Sir Peter Hunter
- Dr Sue Bidrose

Research Funding NZ will replace most existing research funding decision-makers, including the Marsden Fund Council, the Science Board, some MBIE functions and the Health Research Council.

The transition will be phased to ensure continuity and minimise disruption. The Marsden Fund and Endeavour Fund will be among the first to move under the new structure, with Research Funding NZ making decisions for upcoming funding rounds. All current research contracts will continue.

“Government investment across the full spectrum of science, from blue-sky research to applied and commercial innovation, will help grow the economy and improve health and wellbeing,” says Dr Reti.

“By fixing the basics of our funding system, we are building a stronger future for science, innovation and the researchers whose work improves our economy, health and resilience.”
