The Government has delivered on its commitment to roll out peer support services in eight emergency departments five months ahead of schedule, with Tauranga Hospital becoming the latest hospital to implement the service, Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey says.

“We committed to rolling out peer support workers in eight hospitals over two years, and I’m pleased to say we’ve delivered that milestone five months early,” Mr Doocey says.

Mr Doocey marked the milestone by meeting peer support specialists from Ember, who will work in the emergency department.

“Ember already provides peer support specialists in EDs in the Auckland and Waikato regions and have valuable experience in ensuring a smooth establishment of the service in Tauranga.

“For people arriving at ED in mental health crisis, the experience can be overwhelming. Having a peer support specialist alongside them someone with lived experience who understands what they’re going through can make a real difference.

“The feedback from hospitals already using this service is clear. People feel more heard, more supported, and better connected to follow-up care in the community.

“Peer support specialists also play a key role in linking people back into community services once they leave hospital, helping set them up for better long-term outcomes.

“As New Zealand’s first Minister for Mental Health, I’m determined to better recognise and strengthen the peer support workforce. Their lived experience brings incredible value to our mental health system.”

Since launching at Middlemore Hospital in September 2024, the service has expanded to North Shore, Auckland City, Waikato, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, and now Tauranga.

“This is about backing what works, growing our workforce, and making sure that when people take the brave step of asking for help, support is there when and where it’s needed.” Mr Doocey says.
