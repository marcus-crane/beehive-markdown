A new facility at Mason Clinic in Auckland has officially opened, marking the next chapter of forensic mental health services in New Zealand, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey say.

“The opening of this facility is a major step forward for forensic mental health in New Zealand and strengthens the infrastructure needed to deliver safe, effective care,” Mr Brown says.

The Mason Clinic is New Zealand’s largest forensic psychiatric service, supporting close to two million people across Auckland and Northland. E Tū Wairua Hinengaro is a three-storey, 10,000-square-metre building – nearly double the size of the facilities it replaces.

“Modern facilities are essential for good health outcomes. They improve safety, support staff to do their jobs well, and ensure patients receive treatment in environments that are fit for purpose.

“This new facility strengthens the Mason Clinic’s ability to deliver quality forensic mental health services for the long term, while maintaining safety for patients, staff, and the wider community,” Mr Brown says.

The $200 million facility has 60 replacement inpatient beds, enabling the closure of four outdated units. It is one of the largest specialist mental health infrastructure projects in the country and forms part of nearly $1 billion being committed nationally to modernise hospitals and specialist facilities.

Mr Doocey says the new building will deliver safer, more effective care for patients and the community.

“People enter mental health facilities to get well and to be safe, and that is exactly what this new facility is designed to do. Families should be confident that when a loved one is receiving care, they are in a secure environment with the right support to recover.

“By investing in modern, fit-for-purpose facilities, we are ensuring people receive the care they need to get better, while also protecting the wider community.

“Expanding and upgrading mental health facilities is a key part of the Government’s plan to improve access to mental health services and deliver better outcomes for patients,” Mr Doocey says.

The opening builds on wider work underway in forensic mental health, including a $51 million investment in Budget 2025 to deliver 10 new acute inpatient beds and eight new step-down beds through non-government organisations in the Midland region.
