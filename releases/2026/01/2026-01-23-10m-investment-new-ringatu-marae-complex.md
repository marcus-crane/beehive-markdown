The Government is investing just over $10 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to upgrade the National Ringatū Marae Complex in Bay of Plenty, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka say.

The new complex will boost resilience in the infrastructure of the Wainui Marae near Ōhope, which has been the focal point of the Ringatū movement and the local community for more than 130 years.

The initiative follows similar investments in Waitangi National Marae, Parihaka and Rātana Pā.

“The complex will be a place to gather, learn, and strengthen the Ringatū community as a part of the broader Māori community in Bay of Plenty. It also represents valuable infrastructure work which strengthens the community value of marae in rural areas,” Mr Jones says.

The build is expected to create 71 jobs, including building apprenticeships, during its 19-month construction and provide ongoing employment opportunities, particularly for Māori youth, after completion. The grant will go to Ringatū Church Incorporated, a registered society. 

Mr Jones made the announcement today at Rātana, where a delegation of Ringatū members was present.

“Both Rātana and Ringatū are critical institutions in Te Ao Māori. They also are a part of our nation’s story,” Mr Potaka says.

“Both had visionary leaders, blended biblical teachings with traditional Māori beliefs and customs, and included political momentum seeking to address Māori progress.

“Te Kooti founded the Ringatū faith after his exile to the Chatham Islands in the late 1860s during a time of displacement and colonial conflict. His escape and the movement’s survival symbolised resilience against injustice, land loss, and cultural suppression,” Mr Potaka says.

The complex will feature a wharenui (meeting house), wharekai (dining hall), wharetāonga (treasure house), and wharepaku (toilets) and creates a modern, safe space for worship, cultural events, and learning. It will also serve as a civil defence hub for the eastern Bay of Plenty and generate income through venue use, education and cultural tourism.

“This investment will help preserve an important part of New Zealand’s heritage, support local employment, and provide a lasting asset for its community,” Mr Jones says.
