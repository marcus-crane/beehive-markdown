The deployment of a New Zealand Defence Force liaison officer to Israel has been extended by an additional three months, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“The situation in Gaza continues to evolve as implementation of the peace plan progresses,” she says.

“This deployment continues to make a critical contribution to our understanding of what is a dynamic and complex operating environment in and around Gaza.

“This extension is to ensure that the NZDF liaison officer can continue to improve our understanding of what is happening on the ground to inform any future decisions regarding New Zealand’s potential contributions.”

The extension is until 3 May 2026, and the liaison officer will continue to be based in the US-led Civil Military Coordination Centre.
