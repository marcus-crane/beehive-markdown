The Crown and Ngāti Hāua have concluded nine years of negotiations as settlement legislation passes its final reading in Parliament today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith says.  

“This is a significant day for the Crown and Ngāti Hāua. Through this settlement the Crown acknowledges its historical breaches of the Treaty, returns 64 culturally significant sites, and provides $19 million of financial redress.

“The legislation also provides statutory pardons for Te Rangiātea and Mātene Ruta Te Whareaitu, who were tried under martial law in 1846, meaning they were deprived of protections that would have been their right at a civilian trial. These pardons remove their convictions, recognise their mana and honour their legacy within Ngāti Hāua for future generations.

“Recognising this history is vital to restoring our relationship going forward, and the redress provided by the Crown will contribute to the economic, social and cultural wellbeing of Ngāti Hāua for future generations.

“It was a privilege to welcome Ngāti Hāua back into the House today and to share this moment as we look toward a future shaped by a strengthened relationship.”

Ngāti Hāua is an iwi based in the Central North Island, centred in Taumarunui. They have a population of approximately 2,500 members.
