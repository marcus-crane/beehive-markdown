Construction has begun today on Hawke’s Bay Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital’s rapid-build inpatient ward, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This new ward is a practical way to meet growing demand quickly. It will provide 28 inpatient beds for short-stay surgical patients and surgical assessments, helping streamline care for this group and freeing up surgical and medical beds elsewhere in the hospital,” Mr Brown says.

Four months of off-site factory construction will run in parallel with around six months of on-site works, with the ward expected to be operational in August 2026.

“This combined approach shortens the overall build programme, ensures consistent quality, and reduces disruption to day-to-day hospital operations.

“Once complete, the ward will improve the experience for people needing surgery, help meet demand during peak periods, and strengthen the hospital’s ability to deliver timely, quality care.

“Increasing inpatient capacity now will reduce the use of overflow areas, improve emergency department wait times, and help the hospital manage growing demand while long-term redevelopment continues.”

The Hawke’s Bay ward is one of five modular units being delivered nationwide under the Government’s fast-tracked hospital wards programme to rapidly expand inpatient capacity and improve patient flow at New Zealand’s busiest hospitals.

Funded as part of Budget 2025, the programme will deliver 140 new inpatient beds in 2026 across Hawke’s Bay, Nelson, Middlemore, Wellington Regional and Waikato Hospitals.

“These units are quicker to build and more cost-effective than traditional construction, allowing us to strengthen hospital capacity where it’s needed most. Using off-site modular construction means we can deliver at speed, stay within budget, minimise disruption for hospitals, and provide faster benefits for patients and staff.

“This is about investing in infrastructure that supports better patient care, with patients at the centre of the design. The new ward will play an important role in lifting performance at Hawke’s Bay Hospital and supporting better outcomes for patients across the region,” Mr Brown says.
