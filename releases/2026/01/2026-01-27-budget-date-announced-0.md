The Government will set out its financial intentions for the coming year on 28 May when it delivers the 2026 Budget, Finance Minister Nicola Willis says.

“The focus of this year’s Budget will be on supporting the delivery of core public services – in particular, health care, education, defence, and law and order.”

Nicola Willis says the Budget will demonstrate tight control of discretionary government spending while funding a limited number of priority commitments.

“There will be no splashing the cash.

“Careful stewardship of public finances is essential to fixing the basics and building the future.

“Delivering savings and reprioritising existing expenditure will again be features of the Budget.

“These sorts of decisions are always tough, but they are necessary to ensure we can continue to fund the public services people rely upon while getting the books back in order.”
