People affected by recent severe weather are receiving temporary accommodation and marae-led welfare support, with recovery assistance now being delivered on the ground, says Minister for Māori Development and Associate Minister of Housing Tama Potaka.

“Temporary accommodation is already in place for households who cannot return home, with 17 motorhomes currently on the ground supporting displaced whānau. A further 25 motorhomes are now on the move, with more being deployed to affected areas as access allows,” Mr Potaka says.

Delivered through the Government’s Temporary Accommodation Service, households are being placed quickly, with assessments typically completed within 24 hours of registering with the service.

“Marae are often the first-place people turn to and they responded immediately with manaakitanga by opening their doors to welcome displaced people providing kai and shelter for whānau when it mattered most. We are making sure their mahi and leadership is acknowledged and that they’re not left carrying that cost,” Mr Potaka says.

The Government, through Te Puni Kōkiri, is delivering $1 million through the Marae Emergency Response Fund. The first tranche will see $600,000 to support 22 marae.  

People who have been displaced, or who may need temporary accommodation, are encouraged to register for support.
