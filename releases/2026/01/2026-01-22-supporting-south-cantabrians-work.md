The Minister of Social Development and Employment Hon Louise Upston has kicked off the new year meeting with Timaru employers and encouraging them to hire jobseekers in the first instance. 

The Minister is reminding companies how the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) can support their businesses by helping them get staff with the right skills and who are the right fit.

MSD’s Timaru Business After 5 event was an opportunity to talk more about how MSD and local employers can work together to meet workforce needs.

Minister Upston said it was good to see a strong relationship between major employer Fonterra and MSD. The MSD team had worked at both a national and regional level to understand and meet Fonterra’s workforce needs. 

“I’ve been pleased to see MSD build trust and confidence with local employers by understanding their business, and their goals and workplace culture to find a match with local job seekers.”

“Every person and every business is different. MSD will take the time to learn what matters, connecting with local and ready-to-work talent, from the country’s largest pool of job seekers.”

“Recruitment isn’t just about filling a role — it’s about unlocking potential and creating lasting opportunities. Partnering with MSD helps businesses succeed while achieving employment goals.”

“In MSD’s Southern region, 81 percent of people receiving Jobseeker Support for less than a year have previous work experience, and around 47 percent have worked in moderately to highly skilled jobs. This shows MSD has people ready to start work now.

Employers of any size or industry are encouraged to get in touch with MSD. They’re available to connect you with the right people.” Louise Upston says.
