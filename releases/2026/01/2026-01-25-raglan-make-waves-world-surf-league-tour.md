In a landmark moment, the World Surf League (WSL) is bringing its Championship Tour to New Zealand shores this year.

Raglan has been selected as the fourth stop on the 2026 WSL Championship Tour, one of twelve international locations showcasing some of the world’s best professional surfers.

“I’m thrilled to announce that Raglan will be hosting the New Zealand Pro – WSL Championship Tour event, the biggest elite surfing event ever staged in New Zealand,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“It’s swell for shore. This is an incredible opportunity for surfing in New Zealand. Fans will be able to watch the world’s most talented surfers get barrelled and compete, inspiring our budding young athletes and helping grow the sport in New Zealand.

“The New Zealand Pro will also give a major tourism boost to the Waikato, with a lineup of competitors and spectators to the region and a global broadcast of the event, showcasing Raglan as a top surf destination internationally.”

The New Zealand Pro will run from 15 – 25 May 2026, when the top 36 men and 24 women will ride a wave and compete at the world-class, left-hand point break at Raglan. This will be the first combined Men’s and Women’s World Surf League Championship Tour event ever held in New Zealand.

The event is being supported through the Government’s Events Attraction Package, which aims to bring high-value international events to New Zealand, attracting international visitors, stimulating the economy and growing New Zealand’s global profile for major events.

“Major events like these give a huge economic boost to our cities and towns - supporting hospitality and tourism businesses, creating more jobs and growing our economy and building for the future,” Louise Upston says.

“We’re not just hosting events; we’re building a reputation internationally as a world-class destination for culture, sport and entertainment.”

The WSL Championship Tour is the fourth event announced from the Events Attraction Package, with more to be announced in the coming months.
