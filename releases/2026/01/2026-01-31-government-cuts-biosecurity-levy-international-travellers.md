From today, the biosecurity part of the Border Processing Levy will drop by 30 percent for most arriving travellers, Minister for Biosecurity Andrew Hoggard says

“The change will see the biosecurity levy reduce from $16.92 to $12.03 for incoming air passengers,” says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard.

“After COVID-19, Biosecurity New Zealand raised the levy to cover border costs and rebuild operations.

“With air travel recovering faster than expected those costs are now paid off, we can lower the levy while keeping strong biosecurity controls in place.

“It’s great to be in a position to ease costs on international travellers and Kiwis coming home, while still keeping our border safe from environmental and economic threats.

“The Border Processing Levy funds biosecurity services such as x-ray screening, detector dogs, and other protections. 

“Farmers, growers, foresters and fishers are the backbone of this economy. That makes the biosecurity controls funded by the levy critical for New Zealanders’ standard of living.

“The government remains committed to modernising border biosecurity.

“We have set aside funding from the levy to allow Biosecurity New Zealand to invest in new border technology and more detector dogs.

“This includes investing in a digital border programme that will build on the successful introduction of the New Zealand Traveller Declaration and deliver smarter passenger processing and new x-ray technology.”
