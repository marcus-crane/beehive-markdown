More Australians will soon be discovering the wonders of the lower South Island, with a fresh boost of Government funding for the Southern Way campaign, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston announced today.

“We’re backing the South to shine,” Louise Upston says.

“With direct flights from the Gold Coast into both Dunedin and Queenstown, it’s never been easier for Australians to explore everything the lower South Island has to offer.

“This campaign is about sharing what makes the South truly special – Oamaru's iconic cheese, Central Otago wines, Fiordland and Southland hikes  and Dunedin’s vibrant arts scene.

Even when it’s crisp outside, our southern hospitality is always warm. By working together, we’re showing the world there’s nowhere quite like the lower South, and we’re proud to welcome visitors to experience it for themselves,” Louise Upston says.

The Southern Way campaign will receive $459,250 from the second stage of the Regional Tourism Boost Fund (Round 2), to build on the momentum of the first campaign, which is helping to put the region’s unique experiences on the map for Australian visitors looking to travel outside of the peak season.

“This is a fantastic example of what can be achieved when our regions work together,” Louise Upston said.

“The Southern Way campaign brings together Great South, Tourism Waitaki, Enterprise Dunedin, Clutha Development, Tourism Central Otago, Destination Queenstown, and Lake Wanaka Tourism. By joining forces, these organisations are showcasing the very best of the South and delivering real benefits for local communities.”

Running from April to June 2026, the campaign will encourage visitors to take advantage of time-limited travel and accommodation deals, and to enjoy the South’s legendary hospitality. New themed itineraries and bookable packages will make it simple for travellers to experience the region’s best.

“This is about supporting local businesses, creating jobs, and sharing the benefits of tourism across the South,” Louise Upston says. 

“By working together, our regions can offer visitors something truly special, while boosting our economy and strengthening our communities.”

The Southern Way campaign is one of five initiatives supported in this second stage of funding, which totals $3.69 million and aims to bring more international visitors to regional New Zealand during autumn and early winter 2026.
