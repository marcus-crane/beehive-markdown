Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced that the 2026 General Election will be held on Saturday 7 November.

“Continuing the recent tradition of announcing the election date early in the year ensures New Zealanders have certainty,” Mr Luxon says.

“Kiwis can also have certainty that our Government will continue governing throughout the year to deliver on our plan to fix the basics and build the future.

“When we took office, the country was going in the wrong direction, and it’s taken a lot of hard work in the last two years to start turning things around.

“Through careful economic management and by stopping wasteful spending, inflation has fallen from over 7 per cent under Labour to just 3 per cent now – resulting in considerable interest rate drops, taking pressure off homeowners. 

“The economy is picking up, with increasing business and consumer confidence, building and manufacturing taking off, and exports doing incredibly well. 

“Along with the Free Trade Agreement with India, these results show that with a National-led Government, Kiwis can look forward to more prosperity and opportunity, higher wages, lower mortgage costs, and a brighter future for themselves, their children, and grandchildren.

“In law and order, police are more visible on the beat, there are 38,000 fewer victims of crime, youth offending is down by 16 per cent and ram raids are down by 85 per cent. In schools, our focus on teaching the basics brilliantly has seen the number of new entrants achieving in reading jump from 36 per cent to 58 per cent.

“Continuing to deliver on our plan to fix the basics and build the future so that Kiwis around the country get more results like these will remain our focus in the lead up to the election later this year.”

The Prime Minister has advised the Governor-General of the election date.

The Government’s intention is that the House will rise on 24 September, with Parliament dissolved on 1 October. Writ day will be on 4 October and nominations will close at noon on 8 October. Advance voting will begin on 26 October and the last day for the return of the writ will be 3 December.
