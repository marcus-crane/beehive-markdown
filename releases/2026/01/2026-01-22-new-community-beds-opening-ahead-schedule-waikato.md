Four new community based forensic step-down beds will open ahead of schedule in March thanks to the partnership between Ember Services Limited and Health NZ, Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey announced today.

“Opening more mental health beds is a commitment made by the government in its Mental Health Plan to deliver faster access to support,” Mr Doocey says.

“Budget 2025 funded two new community based step-down forensic beds in Waikato every year for the next four years as part of a wider $51M program to improve access to specialist forensic services.

“I’ve listened to the frontline, both patients and mental health professionals, and asked for the funding of eight new beds to be brought forward over two years, not the four years originally intended.

“These new beds will be backed by community wraparound support teams and funding to attract and retain specialist staff.

“I have always said patient and public safety must be paramount. By gradually reintegrating people who are transitioning out of inpatient forensic care, we can help more people return to the community safely.

“Community based step-down beds free up inpatient beds for people who really need them and form part of a step-by-step care system, allowing patients to move gradually from higher support to less supervision. These beds also ensure continuity of care, help reduce the risk of relapse and re-hospitalisation, and enable greater participation in rehabilitation programmes.

“Today’s announcement of new community based step-down forensic beds will increase bed capacity on top of the new 10 bed acute forensic inpatient facility in Waikato.

“This package is part of our broader mental health plan to deliver faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response.”
