Work is underway to support health services in storm-affected regions, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey say.

“I want to acknowledge the profound stress, loss, and disruption these communities are experiencing. Ensuring the health system responds effectively has been a critical part of our efforts, with Health New Zealand establishing a recovery team to support both the immediate response and longer-term recovery, giving communities the care and reassurance they need,” Mr Brown says. 

“We are also working across government to actively monitor and plan for emerging risks, particularly for vulnerable and isolated communities.

“Despite the scale of these severe weather events, health services across the country remain operational and continue to deliver care as usual.”

Mr Doocey says coordination is underway across all affected districts to provide targeted mental health support.

“I know the emotional toll these events are taking on individuals, families, and communities. We’re working to ensure the health system is ready to provide whatever support is needed as communities navigate this tragic situation,” Mr Doocey says.

“Mental wellbeing coordination is underway across affected districts, with District Psychosocial Coordinators embedded in local Civil Defence Emergency Management Welfare Groups. Working alongside local iwi, they are supporting community wellbeing while ensuring core health services remain uninterrupted.”

Mr Brown says Health New Zealand’s National Public Health Service is working closely with local authorities and Civil Defence Emergency Management partners to assess and manage environmental health risks.

“This includes providing guidance on sewage and waste-contaminated silt, monitoring risks such as leptospirosis, and increasing surveillance to detect early signs of enteric disease outbreaks,” Mr Brown says.

“We’re also maintaining close awareness of isolated communities through district and regional networks and ensuring health services are ready to scale up if medical or supply issues worsen.”

Agencies across government are monitoring risks to essential lifeline infrastructure, including telecommunications, roads, and power, that could disrupt access to care. This includes ensuring ongoing support for medically dependent people who rely on consistent power and communications.

“Our thoughts remain with everyone affected. I want to acknowledge the tireless work of frontline staff, including health workers, who continue to look after our communities during this challenging time,” Mr Brown says.

“I also acknowledge the unimaginable grief many families are experiencing. We share your grief, and we remain committed to supporting all those affected through this tragedy,” Mr Doocey says.
