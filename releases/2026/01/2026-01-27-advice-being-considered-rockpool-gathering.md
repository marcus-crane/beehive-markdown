Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones has received advice from officials outlining options for dealing with reports of rockpools around Whangaparāoa Peninsula and other areas being stripped of marine life.

“I know people are concerned about the sustainability of these rock pools which are critical to the health of ecosystems. That’s why I will be making my decisions in the next week,” Mr Jones says.

The options set out a range of possible restrictions to gathering from rockpools as well as public education.

“I understand the frustrations of people who care about their coastlines but it is important I have all the information before making such significant decisions. For example, I’m considering whether there needs to be a change of rules to better recognise the importance of rockpool species that are not usually gathered for food.”

In the meantime, Fishery Officers are working on the frontline of sustainability, regularly patrolling popular beaches around Auckland and other regions to enforce the rules.

Mr Jones assured the public that the vast majority of those gathering marine life from rock pools were doing so within the current rules. However, there would always be those who exploited the resource.

“I am aware that a recent checkpoint carried out by Fishery Officers in Clevedon, South Auckland, found significant non-compliance from gatherers in that area. Of the 130 inspections done, 23 offences were identified including large hauls of cockles and mussels.

“This blatant disregard for the rules is unacceptable, and Fisheries New Zealand will hold those to break the rules to account.”

Making changes to the rules is just one part of resolving the issues.

“It’s important that communities know how they can get behind initiatives to support the important protection of marine ecosystems,” Ms Marcroft says.

“I am continuing to meet community leaders and groups, along with Fisheries officials, to help educate people about the role they can play in ensuring sustainability and the importance of their local rockpools.

“Minister Jones and I are committed to ensuring healthy and thriving coastal areas that can continue to be enjoyed by future generations.”
