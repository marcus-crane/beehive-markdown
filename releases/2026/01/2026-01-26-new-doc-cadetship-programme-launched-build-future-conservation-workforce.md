A new Department of Conservation cadetship programme has been launched in Renwick to help build a skilled, fit-for-purpose conservation workforce for the future, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says. 

The Te Pū Hono programme is a 30-month paid cadetship designed to support people at the start of long-term conservation careers. The first intake of 10 kaihonoa taiao cadets has begun the programme following a pōwhiri at Ōmaka Marae, hosted by Te Rūnanga a Rangitāne o Wairau on behalf of the Te Tauihu iwi. 

“Our conservation system relies on skilled people working on the ground,” Mr Potaka says. 

“That’s why the Government is focused on fixing the basics by investing in workforce pathways that ensure DOC has the capability it needs now and into the future.” 

Cadets come from a range of backgrounds and will be working for nature from day one. The programme includes hands-on experience in trapping, weed control, ecological monitoring, track and hut maintenance, historic site restoration, and backcountry skills. 

Cadets will also gain experience in more specialised areas aligned to their interests, such as chainsaw operations or biodiversity monitoring. 

“Our native species, tracks and huts are central to who we are as New Zealanders and are a key part of our tourism and economic offering,” Mr Potaka says. 

“Investing in DOC’s workforce is essential to protecting these assets and maintaining New Zealand’s world-class conservation experience.” 

The cadets were selected from a highly competitive pool of applicants, reflecting strong interest in conservation careers and working in New Zealand’s backcountry. Once the programme is established, DOC intends to recruit up to 10 new kaihonoa taiao cadets each year. 

“This programme is about building the future by creating a strong pipeline of skilled conservation workers who can care for our natural environment for generations to come,” Mr Potaka says.
