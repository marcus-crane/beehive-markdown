The Government is rolling out support to schools, kura and families in Northland and Gisborne to minimise potential disruptions, Education Minister Erica Stanford said. 

“Our thoughts and ongoing support are with the students, families, and teachers who have been affected by the severe weather we are seeing,” Ms Stanford says.

“Our priority is on ensuring people have access to services they need to minimise disruption. We are ensuring transport and school lunch provision, warm and dry places to learn and meet, and assessment and repairing of damages.

“Closed and damaged roads have disrupted several school transport services in rural areas – we are working on restoring those services as soon as possible.

“Ministry staff are working with schools and providers to ensure the Healthy School Lunches programme remains available, including for support students cut off from their schools. 

“In Northland, an Education Hub is being set up at Whangaruru School. This is set to support primary and secondary students who can’t currently access their schools in Whangārei. 

“This Education Hub will accommodate up to 40 students. Teacher aides will be available to provide additional support for children who need it.” 

“In Gisborne, some schools have moved their start dates to 9 February following the severe weather. School principals in Te Araroa / Hicks Bay are exploring alternatives including online learning, use of local marae for teaching spaces, sharing of teaching space across differing schools, and more teaching support. 

Ms Stanford says there will be an 0800 number from the Ministry for families in Northland with education-related concerns. The Ministry of Education’s Gisborne office is available to receive all calls about education concerns and is contactable on 0508 656 565.

“I strongly encourage people to reach out, along with staying connected to the wider support that is available outside of education.

“The school property team are assessing all schools. Most assessments have been completed and damage fortunately appears to be minimal. 

“I want to thank the schools and kura for their leadership and innovation, and for stepping up and supporting the affected children and their families during this challenging time. Regional Ministry staff will remain in contact with schools and kura to assist where needed.”
