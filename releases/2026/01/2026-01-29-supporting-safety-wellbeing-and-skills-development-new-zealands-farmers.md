The Government is backing New Zealand’s next generation of food and fibre sector leaders by investing in its premier youth competition, Associate Minister for ACC Nicola Grigg has announced.

For the first time, ACC is partnering with NZ Young Farmers (NZYF) and sponsoring this year’s FMG Young Farmer of the Year competition.

“The FMG Young Farmer of the Year competition is one of New Zealand’s most exciting agricultural events, showcasing the skills, innovation, leadership and practical know‑how of young farmers from across the country,” Ms Grigg says.

“This partnership reflects the Government’s focus on fixing the basics and building the future - making sure farmers have the strong foundations they need today, while investing in the skills, leadership and resilience required for tomorrow.

“Farmers are the backbone of our economy. They support regional jobs, drive our exports and underpin New Zealand’s food security. That’s why this Government is backing them in practical ways, and focusing policy on what actually works on‑farm, letting farmers spend more time doing what they do best.

“However, despite the incredible talent and capability of New Zealand farmers, agriculture remains one of our highest‑risk industries, with thousands of farming‑related injury claims made every year.”

In 2024, ACC received over 23,000 claims for injuries sustained on farms. The cost to help people recover was around $120 million.

“Our Government is laser‑focused on early intervention and practical support that improves the lives of New Zealanders. Bringing ACC’s expertise in injury prevention and recovery into the heart of this competition helps young farmers build safe, sustainable careers from the outset.

“This new partnership reinforces NZ Young Farmers’ commitment to developing confident, capable and healthy future leaders across agriculture.

“Farming is one of New Zealand’s most demanding and rewarding industries, requiring skill, resilience and constant decision‑making in often unpredictable conditions. The contest showcases the real pressures and realities of farming life.

“ACC’s involvement brings a stronger safety and recovery message to the competition programme, helping contestants understand how to work safely, manage risks and support recovery as they build successful careers in agriculture, Ms Grigg says.”
