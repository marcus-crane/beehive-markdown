The Government is deploying motorhomes to quickly support people displaced by recent severe weather, with 10 motorhomes making their way to Northland Te Tai Tokerau today, with an additional 50 intended to be deployed in coming days, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

Additional motorhomes are planned for deployment later in the week as temporary accommodation needs become clearer in other impacted areas particularly the East Coast Tairāwhiti.

“These motorhomes provide an immediate option for people who can’t stay in their homes, especially in affected areas where accommodation may be limited,” Mr Potaka says.

“This is about responding quickly to real need on the ground. Mobilising motorhomes into affected communities gives people somewhere to live while they wait to be allowed back into their home or for more suitable housing if they have sadly lost their home.”

The motorhomes are being delivered through the Government’s Temporary Accommodation Service (**TAS**), which has been activated to support people displaced across Northland Te Tai Tokerau, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, East Coast Tairāwhiti and other affected areas.

“Agencies are working closely with councils, Iwi and community organisations to make sure people can access the accommodation and wider support they need.

“If your home has been damaged or you think you may need temporary accommodation, even if you’re staying with whānau or friends, please register with TAS as soon as possible so support can be put in place.

“I want to acknowledge marae, whānau, councils, Iwi and community organisations who have acted quickly to support people during this difficult time, and who continue to offer care, manaaki and practical support on the ground.”

On Tuesday, the Government announced an initial package which included $1.2 million to support affected regions with immediate and pressing needs through Mayoral Relief Funds and $1 million to reimburse marae that provided welfare in response to this event, and allow them to replenish and continue to build their resilience.

This is alongside existing funding across government that is available to support recovery effects in response to natural hazards and weather events.

**Notes to editors:**

- People affected by the recent severe weather who have a current, or expected future need for temporary accommodation are encouraged to register with the Temporary Accommodation Service:
  
  - **Online:** [www.tas.mbie.govt.nz](http://www.tas.mbie.govt.nz)
  - **Phone:** 0508 754 163
- People only need to register once per household. The Temporary Accommodation Service is not a free service, and part-payments are required. However, TAS will work with each household to ensure these part-payments are affordable, and a hardship process is available if needed.
- At this stage, it is too early to confirm numbers of registrations.
