The Government’s Temporary Accommodation Service (TAS) has been activated today to support people displaced by recent severe weather events affecting parts of the North Island, including Northland, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and Tairāwhiti, and other affected areas, Associate Minister of Housing Tama Potaka says.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Temporary Accommodation Service is accepting registrations from people who have been displaced, or who expect they may need temporary accommodation as a result of the recent weather events.

“MBIE is working closely with Civil Defence Emergency Management, the National Emergency Management Agency, local councils, communities, and Iwi to ensure a seamless transition for people in need to access safe, suitable accommodation,” Mr Potaka says.

“Agencies will continue to work together to provide wrap-around support for communities affected by the severe weather events, including social services, mental health support, financial support and more. I want to acknowledge and thank all those marae, whānau, communities and organisations who have supported people with housing need at this very difficult time.”

MBIE has a responsibility to coordinate temporary accommodation following an emergency, as per the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan Order 2015.
