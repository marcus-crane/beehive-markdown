Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced the first stage of Government support for initial recovery efforts in the regions affected by last week’s severe weather event.

“The impact has been devastating for many people, particularly those who have tragically lost loved ones at Mount Maunganui, Welcome Bay and Warkworth,” Mr Luxon says.

“Over the last few days, I have visited a number of communities and seen the devastation first-hand.

“Our priority is finding accommodation for those who have been displaced. I am advised there are around 500 people across the North Island who are displaced and assessments are ongoing. The Government has activated the Temporary Accommodation Service to help those people access temporary housing.

“We are focused on getting supplies into communities that are currently cut off while we clear the slips and assess the damage to the roads. State Highway 35 (East Coast) and State Highway 25 (Coromandel) have both suffered significant damage and will take some time to repair. KiwiRail is also assessing its lines.

“Health NZ is monitoring the impact on the health system and supporting people experiencing mental distress, while the Ministry of Social Development is working with people who need financial support.”

The Government is making available $1.2 million to support affected regions with immediate and pressing needs through Mayoral Relief Funds, on top of the annual government contribution that has already been made to these funds.

“A further $1 million will reimburse marae that provided welfare in response to this event, and allow them to replenish and continue to build their resilience. Marae have been exceptional in the way they have stepped up to help their communities, providing shelter, food and care to people in need,” Mr Luxon says.

There is also existing funding across government that is available to support recovery effects in response to natural hazards and weather events. That includes, for example:

- The Natural Hazards Commission which has up to $700 million available for claims from this event.
- The New Zealand Transport Agency which has over $700 million allocated for emergency work on local roads and state highways for the 2024-2027 NLTF period.
- The Ministry for the Environment has $7.2 million to help local authorities clear emergency waste.
- The Ministry of Primary Industries Rural Support Trusts have funding to support rural communities.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell says more support will be available once assessments of the damage have been completed.

“While this event is not on the scale of Cyclone Gabrielle in terms of the number of people affected, for those who have been affected the impact is significant and we will make sure they’re properly supported to get back on their feet,” Mr Mitchell says.

The Prime Minister also announced today that he has appointed Hon Chris Penk as Associate Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery.

“The severity of last week’s weather means the recovery is going to take some time,” Mr Luxon says.

“Chris Penk will support Mark Mitchell by leading the coordination of the Government’s response. He will have responsibility for bringing together government agencies to ensure a joined-up response.

“I have also asked that the Associate Minister bring advice back to Cabinet on the potential scope of a government inquiry into the events at the Mount Maunganui Beachside Holiday Park last Thursday.

“I believe there is a strong case for an independent government inquiry. Establishing the facts is not only what the families of those who lost their lives deserve, but also important to help ensure lessons are learned to prevent similar tragedies in future.”
