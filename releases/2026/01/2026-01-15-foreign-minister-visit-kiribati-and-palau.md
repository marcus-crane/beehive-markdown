Foreign Minister Winston Peters will visit Kiribati and Palau as New Zealand continues to deepen and build on its relationships across the Pacific.

It will be the first time a New Zealand Foreign Minister has been to Kiribati since 2019, when Mr Peters last visited.

“New Zealand is a steadfast partner with Kiribati.  We are committed to building on our long-standing relationship across a range of areas, as we work together to enhance resilience, prosperity and security in the Pacific,” Mr Peters says.

Kiribati will complete the Foreign Minister visiting all 17 other Pacific Island Forum member countries within a single term – the first New Zealand Foreign Minister to do so.

Palau is hosting the Pacific Islands Forum and then New Zealand will host in 2027.

“New Zealand and Palau are coordinating closely on the critical regional issues for the Pacific as we both prepare to host the Forum.

“We look forward to continuing our engagement with Palau, which is a world leader on marine resource management,” Mr Peters says. 

It will be the Minister’s second time in Palau, having led a Ministerial delegation there in August 2024.

Mr Peters departs Sunday 18 January, returning Thursday 22 January.
