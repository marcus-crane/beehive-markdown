Farmers and growers are encouraged to stay up to date with weather warnings and seek support should they need it, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay says.

Mr McClay says Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) staff are closely monitoring the weather situation, with heavy rain warnings and watches and strong wind watches in place across the country.

MPI has staff on the ground providing support where required and are working closely with local emergency management groups including sector organisations, Rural Support Trust, local councils and rural businesses.

“Farmers and growers have prepared for the weather including by moving stock to higher ground where necessary. I encourage people to stay safe, avoid travel and keep out of floodwaters,” Mr McClay says.

“It’s important to self-evacuate if you see rising water and to be ready for power and communications outages.”

MetService has up to date forecasts and warnings.

Orange heavy rain warnings for Northland, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty including Rotorua, and Gisborne from Tolaga Bay north have been upgraded to red. 

Orange heavy rain warnings are in place for Auckland and Great Barrier Island, Gisborne south of Tolaga Bay and Hawke’s Bay, and Tasman west of Mapua.

It comes on top of torrential rain over the weekend that caused flooding in parts of Northland. A precautionary state of emergency has been declared for the Whangārei district.

Farmers and growers who require support are encouraged to contact the Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254.
