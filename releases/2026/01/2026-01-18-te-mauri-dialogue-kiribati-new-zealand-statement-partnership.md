**TE MAURI DIALOGUE**

Kiribati - New Zealand Statement of Partnership- Tei Wawaaki n Ararakea te Maeuraoi

This Statement of Partnership sets out the shared principles, priorities and understandings that will guide cooperation and engagement between the Government of the Republic of Kiribati and the Government of New Zealand over the five-year period from 2026-2030.

In coming together in this partnership, we affirm that our long-established relationship is founded on mutual respect and friendship. We recognise this relationship is grounded in shared Pacific identity and culture and strengthened by the growing links between our peoples and our common interests in the Blue Pacific Continent. As our relationship continues to grow we will be able to increasingly discuss issues of mutual interest, acknowledging not only our shared values and priorities but also where our values and priorities differ.

We highlight the importance of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a shared horizon to improve the lives of our peoples and our planet. We are guided by our joint commitment to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We acknowledge the Kiribati 20 Year Vision (KV20), the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) and New Zealand’s goal of supporting a peaceful, prosperous and resilient Pacific.

We recognise the intensifying regional and global challenges that our countries are facing. In that context we reaffirm the shared values at the heart of our partnership – including a common commitment to addressing the threat posed by climate change; promoting, respecting, and advancing human rights and democratic governance; and working with Pacific and other partners towards peace, prosperity, and sustainability. In addition, we recognise the importance of cooperation in the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional and international fora to the achievement of our goals under this Partnership.
