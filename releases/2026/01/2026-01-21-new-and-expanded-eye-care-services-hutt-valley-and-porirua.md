Patients from the wider Wellington region now have faster access to life changing eye surgery, with new cataract services launching at Hutt Hospital today, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Ensuring patients are at the centre of our healthcare system means continuously improving access to timely elective treatment,” Mr Brown says.

“Hutt Hospital will now deliver 20 to 25 cataract surgery sessions each month. This will make it easier for Hutt Valley patients to receive treatment locally, while freeing up theatre capacity at Kenepuru and Wellington Hospitals for more complex eye procedures.

“These changes mean more people will get the cataract care they need sooner and closer to home, while helping reduce waiting times across the wider region.”

Expanded vitreoretinal surgery capacity will also begin at Kenepuru Hospital from tomorrow.

Vitreoretinal surgery treats conditions affecting the retina at the back of the eye, such as retinal detachments and complications linked to diabetes. These procedures often need to be performed urgently to prevent permanent vision loss.

“Two to three additional vitreoretinal surgery sessions will be delivered each week following installation of a second set of specialised equipment through the Regional Retinal Network Plan. This will increase capacity for urgent procedures and ensure patients are treated as soon as possible.

“Cataracts and retinal conditions can have a significant impact on people’s independence and quality of life. By increasing capacity, more patients will be treated sooner, helping prevent avoidable vision loss.

“Together, these initiatives are expected to enable approximately 300 to 500 additional patients each year to receive cataract or vitreoretinal surgery.

“This is about fixing the basics by expanding core elective services and building the future by ensuring more patients get the care they need, when they need it,” Mr Brown says.
