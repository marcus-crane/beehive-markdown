For the first time in almost 50 years, the Government is building new day specialist schools that will support children with high and complex needs to thrive through its commitment to learning support, Education Minister Erica Stanford announced today.

“These two new schools represent a hugely significant and long-awaited milestone for specialist education in New Zealand, and for the students and their families who need them,” Ms Stanford says.

“The provision of more day specialist schools is long overdue in New Zealand. It has been a priority for me as Minister, and we know many parents of children with high and complex needs want the option of a specialist education setting.

“We’ve listened to families, communities and specialists around opportunities to help young New Zealanders with higher and complex needs. I am excited for the children who will be pupils and delighted that these options are becoming available for them.”

From Term 2 2027 and Term 1 2028, two day specialist schools are set to open in Palmerston North and South Auckland in response to the increasing demand for specialist education provision in these regions.

The new schools bring the number of specialist schools operating across New Zealand to 29, filling gaps in areas that were short on resources. The last day specialist school established was Hamilton North School in 1977.

Finance Minister Nicola Willis says ensuring all Kiwi kids have the support they need to learn has been a priority in this Government’s budgets.

“That’s why the Government provided an additional $746.9 million in last year’s Budget to ensure earlier identification of and better help for children with additional physical, learning and behavioural needs.

“I am delighted that that these new schools are being established. They will benefit both kids and their parents.”

Ms Stanford says the Government believes that inclusion is choice and specialist schools do an incredible job for students with high and complex needs.

“Since coming to office, we’ve funded 50 new specialist classrooms and the redevelopment of four specialist schools,” Ms Stanford says.

“Choices have been limited, due to distance and local specialist schools lacking capacity. These new schools will give families in these regions more choice and confidence that their children can learn in an environment that suits them.

“We are committed to supporting all students to unlock their potential, and I’m pleased that these new schools will give more young New Zealanders the learning and support that helps them to thrive.”

The new schools will be manufactured offsite using a standard building design and layout. These will provide purpose-built teaching spaces and facilities to meet the broad range of needs their students may have. They will include accessible indoor and outdoor learning spaces, along with family space and therapy areas.
