Following the changes made today, more New Zealanders with ADHD will have faster access to support as a result of changes to who can assess, diagnose, and start ADHD treatment, Associate Health Minister Matt Doocey says.

“For too long, people with ADHD have faced long wait times and difficulties getting a diagnosis and treatment because access was limited to specialist services,” Mr Doocey says.

“Medsafe and Pharmac’s decision to widen prescribing rules for ADHD medicines is a welcome change for many New Zealanders, and I want to acknowledge those who have long advocated for this.”

What this change means for New Zealanders from today:

- Adults aged 18 and over: Specialist GPs and nurse practitioners can now diagnose ADHD and start treatment.
- Children and teens under 18: Specialist services will continue to provide assessment. However, nurse practitioners working in paediatric or child and adolescent mental health teams can now diagnose and start treatment.

Before today, GPs and nurse practitioners could only prescribe ADHD medicines to patients with a written recommendation from a paediatrician or psychiatrist, or after someone had already been diagnosed and received their first prescription.

“We know there are a number of our GPs and nurse practitioners who are already working closely with psychiatrists to treat ADHD, so they already have the skills to manage this work.

“ADHD treatment can be life-changing for many people. Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can have significant impacts on education, employment, relationships, and overall mental health. With more options available, we can help connect people with the right support, earlier.”

This change is only one in a suite of measures to increase access to ADHD medicines. Pharmac has also removed the two-year renewal requirement for special authorities which allow funded access to stimulant medicines, as well as funding new ADHD medicine.

“I look forward to seeing the positive impact this decision will have on many people’s lives. This really will be a game changer for many,” Mr Doocey says.

 **Notes to editors:**

- Only clinicians who choose to work in ADHD will provide assessment or treatment. Many clinicians already have an interest in ADHD and have been preparing for this change.
- Assessment and diagnosis of ADHD remains a specialist activity, these changes allow clinicians who have developed a specific interest in ADHD to provide support and initiate treatment. It is expected that clinicians will take this up over time, with services developing gradually.
- Costs may vary depending on the type of service and local arrangements.
