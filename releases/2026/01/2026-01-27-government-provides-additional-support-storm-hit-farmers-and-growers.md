The Government is increasing assistance for farmers and growers affected by recent severe weather, Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson say.

“Significant rainfall, flooding, slips, and hailstorms have caused damage to farms, crops, and rural infrastructure,” Mr McClay says.

“The Government will provide an additional $200,000 to Rural Support Trusts to further assist recovery efforts. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed; however, this funding will be made available in Northland, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, and Tairāwhiti.”

Mr McClay says Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) staff are on the ground working closely with sector groups and the Trusts to identify where support is most needed.

“The Trusts play an important role in supporting farmers and growers facing personal, financial, and weather-related challenges,” Mr Patterson says.

This funding is in addition to the $2.2 million announced yesterday by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon to support affected regions through Mayoral Relief Funds and to reimburse marae that provided welfare services in response to the event.

Farmers and growers needing assistance are encouraged to contact the Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254.
