The Government has announced a $1 million Marae Emergency Response Fund to reimburse marae for welfare support provided during recent severe weather events across the Upper North Island, allowing them to replenish resources and build resilience.

Between 20 and 23 January, flooding and landslips caused widespread disruption across Northland, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and Tairāwhiti, with marae opening their doors to evacuees, stranded travellers and isolated residents, often among the first to activate, says Mr Potaka.

“At least 20 marae across five regions activated to support their communities, providing kai, shelter, power and essential support to anyone who needed it.

“This fund ensures marae are not left carrying the costs of that mahi allowing them to replenish what was used, recover from the immediate response, and continue to build their resilience for future events.”

The $1 million allocation has been added to the Māori Development Fund, enabling Te Puni Kōkiri to provide one-off reimbursement grants to marae that delivered welfare support during the January 2026 severe weather event.

Marae or related organisations that provided welfare support can apply for reimbursement grants by contacting their regional Te Puni Kōkiri office to begin the process.

Funding can be used to cover eligible costs incurred while supporting communities, including food, accommodation, utilities and other essential welfare expenses.

“I want to acknowledge and thank the marae, volunteers and communities who stood up for others during these events. Their leadership, Manaakitanga, and care had made and continue to make a real difference,” Mr Potaka says.
