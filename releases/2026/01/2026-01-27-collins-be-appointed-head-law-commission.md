Prime Minister Christopher Luxon today announced that Hon Judith Collins KC will be appointed as President of the New Zealand Law Commission and will not stand as an MP at the 2026 election.

“It is with great regret and enormous gratitude that I thank Judith for her service; however, I am delighted she will take up this prestigious appointment to the Law Commission,” Mr Luxon says.

“The role requires astute legal knowledge – something Judith is eminently qualified for. She will follow in the footsteps of other highly regarded New Zealanders such as Sir Geoffrey Palmer.

“Judith has given more than two decades of her life to Parliament and public service as a Member of Parliament, Minister, and Leader of the Opposition.

“Throughout that time, she has served this country with commitment and conviction. She has carried a wide range of portfolios in Government and fronted some of the most difficult challenges without flinching.

“Working alongside Judith over the past six years, I have seen firsthand her deep commitment to New Zealand, her loyalty to our team, and her unshakeable belief in standing up for what she thinks is right.

“On a personal level, I’ve seen Judith’s compassion for the people she represents, her love for her family, her sharp mind and sense of humour, and her quiet acts of kindness that most people will never know about.

“On behalf of the Government and the National Party I want to thank Judith for all she has given this country,” Mr Luxon says.

Hon Collins KC will remain as an MP until her new role commences in mid-2026.
