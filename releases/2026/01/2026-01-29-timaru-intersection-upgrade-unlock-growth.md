The Government has committed a $2.84 million grant through the Regional Infrastructure Fund to clear bottlenecks on State Highway 1, unlocking major commercial development and new jobs.

Associate Regional Development Minister Mark Patterson says the congestion has been putting real pressure on locals, slowing down daily travel, making it harder for businesses to move goods, and affecting the flow of people across the region.

“This investment will remove a major choke point on State Highway 1, making it easier for families, workers, and freight operators to get where they need to go.

The upgrade to the intersection will also enable the second stage of the Timaru Showgrounds development to proceed, which is expected to add 20,000m² of commercial space and create up to 300 long-term jobs in Timaru,” Mr Patterson says.

The project will deliver a redesigned intersection with improved traffic flow, upgraded signalling, and safer pedestrian and cycle access. During construction, it is expected up to 60 people will be employed.

“Improving the intersection and reducing these transport delays will cut costs for businesses, improve reliability for freight, and keep the local economy moving,” Associate Transport and South Island Minister James Meager says.

“This is about future-proofing Timaru’s transport network, creating jobs, and supporting the region to thrive,” Mr Meager says.

The $4.15 million project will be delivered by NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi and is expected to be completed by mid‑2026.
