The Government is providing a $950,000 loan through the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) to support a Māori trust to increase productivity on its farmland near Hāwera. The investment is expected to create jobs and drive regional growth, Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka announced today.

“The loan will support the trust to upgrade essential on‑farm infrastructure and move from passive leasing of its land to more active farm management.

These upgrades will allow the trust to increase its milking capacity, lift stock numbers and boost milk production and profitability by up to 25 per cent,” Mr Patterson said.

The Omuturangi 6E & 7A Ahu Whenua Trust, which administers 84 hectares of land on behalf of 290 owners, will receive the funding and contribute $120,000 to the project.

“In the longer term, the trust’s aspirations are to self-govern and manage their whenua Māori more profitably. They will also use the farm to train their people in commercial farming,” Mr Potaka said.

Without the loan, the land would have reverted from dairying to less-productive livestock grazing, as the old dairy shed had reached the end of its economic life.

“This project will benefit not only the trust’s landowners but also the wider local economy, with the trust engaging local businesses as part of its expansion,” Mr Patterson said.

This loan is a strong example of the RIF’s focus on Māori economic development. It provides investment where funding could not be secured elsewhere and supports regional growth and employment,” Mr Potaka said.

Construction is expected to begin shortly, with a new dairy shed operational later this year.
