Nelson’s planned marina expansion has been provided a $12.89 million loan, which will help deliver infrastructure upgrades to drive economic growth and generate local jobs, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“The Regional Infrastructure Fund loan will help make [Nelson Marina](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nelsonmarina.co.nz/page/83044-masterplan__;!!Asq5-8xVch3Reg!rK-R-uYXiR79VAIq8V4SXitUONYX9xjBk8z0Q5TOmDxvS__hd2UIjtpuZ3gbfjz0DUdnBxTsnIZt597-5GlvLBnx$) a world-class marine services facility and a major contributor to the region’s economy,” Mr Jones says.

The upgrade will provide the ability to lift out heavier boats for servicing by installing a 110-tonne vessel hoist. It will also expand the marina’s hardstand capacity for marine maintenance from 14 to 54 bays. A purpose-built marine service centre with office, retail and workshop spaces will also be built.

The funding recipient, Nelson Marina Management Ltd which is owned by Nelson City Council, will contribute $12.89 million in co-funding for the expansion project.

“It is anticipated this part of the project will create up to 110 jobs during construction and up to 180 ongoing roles once completed, while promoting local innovation within the marine sector,” Mr Jones says.

It is estimated that Nelson’s sea-based blue economy adds more than $350 million a year in GDP to the region and employs more than 3700 people. It serves as a base for a number of industries including fishing and aquaculture, and is a popular tourism destination. Nelson is also an important centre of marine research and marine engineering.

“This investment aligns with the RIF’s priority of supporting growth through enabling infrastructure that ensures regions are well-connected and productive. This is central to the Coalition Government’s economic growth plans,” Mr Jones says.

Construction is expected to start in May with an anticipated completion date of mid-2028.
