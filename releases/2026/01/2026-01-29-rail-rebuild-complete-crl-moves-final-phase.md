Auckland’s rail network is one major step closer to a modern, more reliable metro system with the completion of the final large-scale pre-City Rail Link works, Rail Minister Winston Peters, Transport Minister Chris Bishop and Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown say.

“The last few weeks of hard graft represent a major achievement for public transport and freight in Auckland,” Rail Minister Winston Peters says.

“After five years of sustained, weeks-long disruptions, rail work will increasingly be delivered in short, targeted closures timed for periods of lower demand that bring Auckland into line with how modern networks are maintained overseas.

“That sustained disruption has strengthened the network ahead of the City Rail Link to handle more frequent trains and builds on major completed upgrades such as extending electrification to Pukekohe and delivering a third main line through the busiest rail junction – work we started in 2020.

“We thank commuters for their patience with bus replacements, and the many workers across KiwiRail, Auckland Transport, City Rail Link Limited and subbies who put in the hard yards.”

Transport Minister Chris Bishop says the completion of the final large-scale pre-City Rail Link works marks the end of the most disruptive phase of rail upgrades in Auckland.

“With trains now back running fully following the four-week summer closure, the five-year programme to rebuild the busiest and most critical parts of the network is complete,” Mr Bishop says.

“This work has rebuilt Auckland’s rail network from the foundations up, so it is ready to support City Rail Link and deliver more trains, more often, with far greater reliability.

“Successive governments have invested more than $560 million - including $159 million in Budget 2024 - to carry out the work.

“We’d like to recognise the efforts of the 1,300+ people who worked across more than 300 sites during the 2025–26 summer rail upgrade. Over the course of the closure, teams replaced foundations and track, installed new drainage, renewed key rail components, removed two level crossings, and carried out the first full network-wide test of the City Rail Link timetable.

“That test saw 84 trains operating across the network at the same time, the largest number ever run simultaneously on Auckland’s metro rail system.

“The hardest and most disruptive work is now behind us. There really is light at the end of the tunnel.

“While there will still be a few more line closures prior to City Rail Link’s opening, these closures are expected to be much shorter and less disruptive.

“What Aucklanders should expect from here is a more reliable network, fewer long shutdowns, and a rail system ready to deliver the full benefits of City Rail Link.”

Mayor Wayne Brown says the milestone shows tangible progress for Aucklanders after years of disruption.

“It has been a long and frustrating time for Aucklanders, especially businesses who have had to put up with disruption for years, so I thank them for their patience as this project has been completed,” Mayor Brown says.

“It’s the most complex project undertaken in New Zealand but there is payoff coming for Auckland. One of my key policies is to Get Auckland Moving and City Rail Link will deliver a stronger, safer rail network that can support more frequent services, reduce congestion and better connect the city as it continues to grow.”

The summer works also delivered key improvements at major stations. On the Western Line, progress at Henderson Station means both tracks are now operating, restoring peak-time services to their usual 10-minute frequency. 

Major progress has also been made at Takanini, Glen Innes,and Te Mahia with piling largely complete and lift shafts now well underway for new pedestrian bridges that will permanently replace level crossings later this year. 

City Rail Link Ltd, Auckland Transport and KiwiRail are now focused on further testing and commissioning ahead of opening. Additional short closures are planned in the lead-up to City Rail Link opening, with disruption largely limited to weekends and public holidays wherever possible.
