A new inter-agency hub and the first phase of mandatory training for core children’s workers are now underway, as the Government takes further steps to safeguard children from harm.

Child Poverty Reduction Minister Louise Upston says the initiatives are vitally important for some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable children.

“These changes will provide an improved safety net for more than 2,000 children whose sole parents (or sole carers) are expected to be remanded in custody and/or sentenced to a term of imprisonment this year.

“The new in-person hub will co-locate key children’s agency staff at the Oranga Tamariki National Contact Centre, so they can quickly access and share information to identify and address risks to at risk children in this group.

“From now on, when agencies identify these children, a report to Oranga Tamariki will ensure there’s an immediate focus on understanding their needs including safety, wellbeing and the adequacy of their care arrangements.

“This will determine the appropriate response for each child so their needs are met, including referrals to community when statutory intervention is not required.”

The hub will also ensure information is shared safely and appropriately between key agencies to inform an initial assessment within 48 hours.

The testing of mandatory training for core children’s workers is also being rolled out.

“While developing a full package of mandatory training will take time, swift action is needed to fill known gaps. Immediate gains will be made by rapidly rolling out a short, electronic module covering foundational child protection information.”

The foundational module is initially being tested with a subset of core children’s workers from Health NZ, New Zealand Police, Ministry of Social Development (MSD), Ministry of Education, Department of Corrections and Oranga Tamariki.

“We know this type of training will not be new for many children’s workers but by standardising and enhancing existing training, we can ensure more consistent, quality training.”

In October last year the Government accepted all recommendations from the Dame Karen Poutasi Review. The Royal Commission into Abuse in Care also made a range of recommendations regarding child protection. The actions being announced today are part of an ongoing integrated Government response.

“I want to recognise and thank the late Dame Karen for her commitment to New Zealand’s children, and for her outstanding dedication to numerous other public service roles.

“In producing her report, Dame Karen had recommended regular campaigns to support public awareness of the signs of abuse and how to report concerns. I also want to acknowledge the "Dear Children" campaign, which Mana Mokopuna - Children's Commission launched in December.

“It’s been heartening to see that campaign helping to significantly raise awareness of issues and responsibilities related to child maltreatment,” Louise Upston says.
