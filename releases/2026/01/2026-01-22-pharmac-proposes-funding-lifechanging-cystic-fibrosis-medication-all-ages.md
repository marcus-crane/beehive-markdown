Associate Health Minister David Seymour welcomes public consultation on Pharmac’s proposal to fund Trikafta and Alyftrek for children with cystic fibrosis, regardless of their age. 

Pharmac’s proposal, if feedback is positive, will be effective from 1 April 2026.

The proposal includes: 

- funding access to Trikafta for all children with eligible diagnosis (currently only funded for children 6 years and older)
- funding access to Kalydeco for everyone with eligible diagnosis
- funding access to a new treatment, Alyftrek

“Pharmac is now consulting the public on this proposal. It includes funding Trikafta and Alyftrek for children of all ages with cystic fibrosis. The proposal has had significant support from the cystic fibrosis community, so we are expecting positive feedback,” Mr Seymour says. 

“Trikafta and Alyftrek would be funded for all age groups. Doctors would be able to use their clinical judgement to prescribe either of these medicines to any patient who would benefit. 

“These treatments are lifechanging for Kiwis living with cystic fibrosis and their families. If approved, this proposal would give children access to these lifechanging treatments as soon as clinically appropriate. Cystic fibrosis can cause harm very early in life, so waiting to meet age-based eligibility criteria is not an option. 

“In 2023 Pharmac funded Trikafta for children with cystic fibrosis who were 6 years or older in 2023. This left out children under 6 years old with cystic fibrosis. Parents had to choose; wait until children were old enough, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for treatment privately, or move overseas. 

“This has been made possible through Pharmac’s commitment to working with the cystic fibrosis community. It is a great example of what is possible when Pharmac works alongside patients. 

“We’re making the system work better for the people it serves. When people can access their medicines easily, they stay healthier for longer. It also reduces pressure on other parts of the health system.

“Now Pharmac wants to hear from people with cystic fibrosis, their family, healthcare professionals, advocacy groups, and other interested people.”

Consultation closes at 5pm, Wednesday 11 February 2026.
