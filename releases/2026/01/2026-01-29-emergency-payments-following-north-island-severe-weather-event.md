Civil Defence payments will be available for people affected by the severe weather in specific areas of Northland, Bay of Plenty and East Coast to help cover some emergency costs, Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston has announced.

“We want to make sure those communities that are doing it tough because of the latest severe weather event have as much support as possible,” Louise Upston says.

“By the end of today, if you’re based in Rawhiti, Ngaiotonga, Bland Bay (Whangaruru North), Punaruku, Ōakura (Whangaruru South), Mokau, Helena Bay, Mimiwhangata, Whananaki, Waioweka Gorge, Hicks Bay, Te Araroa and have been impacted by the recent severe weather event you may be able to get help to pay for food, bedding, clothing, accommodation or loss of livelihood.

“You don’t have to be on a benefit to qualify for a Civil Defence payment, and non-residents in these areas may be eligible.

“Anyone wanting to apply is encouraged to talk to someone from their local welfare team at a Civil Defence centre, or phone MSD’s general enquiries team on 0800 559 009. Work and Income service centres are open and continue to operate as normal.

“MSD regional teams continue to actively engage with Regional Public Service networks and Civil Defence Emergency Management as welfare assessments are undertaken and will continue to assess the need for Civil Defence payments in other impacted areas.

“We’ll continue to support communities affected by this event,” Louise Upston says.
