Associate Health Minister David Seymour and Health Minister Simeon Brown welcome Pharmac’s proposal to widen access to two medicines for people with stage 3B to stage 4 melanoma.

“Improving access to cancer medication in New Zealand is important to cancer patients, and their families. That’s why it has been a focus of this Government,” Mr Seymour says.

Pharmac is proposing to widen access to nivolumab and ipilimumab for people with stage 3B to stage 4 melanoma from 1 May 2026. 

“This proposal would give people who meet funding criteria another immunotherapy option before surgery, while the cancer is still operable. This lowers the chance of the cancer coming back,” Mr Seymour says. 

“Nivolumab and ipilimumab are immunotherapy medicines that help the immune system better recognise and attack certain types of cancer. Using them together can have a stronger effect on the immune response.

“Clinical advisers told Pharmac that using these treatments together before surgery, then adjusting treatment after surgery based on how well the cancer has responded, can lower the chance of melanoma coming back. Nearly two in three people have a very strong response by the time their tumour is removed, with significant shrinkage or very little active disease remaining.

“Because of this strong early response, many people may not need further treatment after surgery. This can mean fewer ongoing infusions, and fewer hospital visits for people with melanoma, their families, and carers. 

“When used early and together, Nivolumab and ipilimumab means some patients require fewer infusions. This is better for patients. It also frees up health resources by reducing pressure on hospitals and oncology infusion centres. We expect this proposal would save about 1,000 infusion hours each year.

Mr Brown says the Government is focused on ensuring New Zealanders have faster access to more effective cancer care.

“From strengthening early detection through expanded screening, to speeding up treatment and improving access to the latest medicines, our priority is making sure Kiwis can get the right care at the right time,” Mr Brown says.

“New Zealanders elected a Government they could trust to invest in better cancer treatments, which is why we provided a $604 million boost to Pharmac. This investment, including funding for 33 new cancer medicines, is expanding access to life-saving and life-extending therapies for thousands of New Zealanders.

“Today’s announcement marks a further step forward in expanding access to advanced treatment options so more melanoma patients can benefit from improved outcomes,” Mr Brown says.

Consultation on the funding proposal opens at 2pm on Tuesday 24 February and closes at 5pm, Monday 9 March 2026.

Pharmac is engaging with clinicians, the public, and advocacy groups including Melanoma New Zealand to understand the practical impacts of funding these medicines. Feedback will be considered before a decision is made by Pharmac’s Board, or its delegate.
