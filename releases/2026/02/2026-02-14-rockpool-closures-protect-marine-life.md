The Government has taken action to stop the wholesale stripping of marine creatures from rockpools on the east coast north of Auckland.

“I have approved a two-year ban on the taking of a range of invertebrate and seaweed species to put an end to over-collection of marine life from rockpools and surrounding coastline and help protect these important ecosystems,” Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“While most people who visit the coast do the right thing and gather only what is appropriate and legal, there are others who are exploiting it and taking so much that they are collapsing the fragile ecosystems.

The temporary closure will take effect from 12 March 2026. The closure is enforceable by Fishery Officers.

Mr Jones says infringements for breaching temporary closure rules will also be considered as an additional measure.

Oceans and Fisheries Under-Secretary Jenny Marcroft has been working closely with locals, visitors and Fisheries officials to understand the issues and find solutions to the problems.

“As a result, officials have been directed to explore how community volunteers can be supported to encourage visitors to do the right thing. Fisheries New Zealand will also develop multilingual educational material to support this closure and the ongoing management of intertidal fisheries.”

The Ngāti Manuhiri Settlement Trust [requested a two-year temporary fisheries closure](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/consultations/proposed-temporary-fisheries-closure-in-the-hauraki-gulf) over the Rodney, Hibiscus Coast, and East Coast Bays coastline and some Hauraki Gulf islands.

Mr Jones says Fisheries worked with the Ngāti Manuhiri Settlement Trust, which will place a traditional rāhui over the same area and species.

The two-year temporary closure provides statutory support for the rāhui.

“My decision excludes some of the species and areas requested by Ngāti Manuhiri where existing closures and restrictions apply,” Mr Jones says.

The closure includes all seaweed species and invertebrate species (all shellfish and sea life such as sponges, starfish, sea anemone, and sea cucumbers).

This closure does not apply to spiny rock lobster and scallops as there are already existing closures already in place for these species. Kina (sea urchin) is also excluded from the closure and can still be taken within the current recreational fishing limits.

“I decided to allow kina to continue to be taken as managing kina barrens is a priority for me. Officials will continue to actively monitor and manage kina populations.”

The closure does not apply to any aquaculture activities such as marine farming or the collection of spat (small juvenile shellfish) for those activities.

“It’s important that these coastal management restrictions do not impact on marine farming and the aquaculture development so it can continue to support our economy and provide jobs in our communities,” Mr Jones says. 

“I’d like to acknowledge Ngāti Manuhiri Settlement Trust’s valuable contribution to fisheries management and their commitment to this kaupapa.

“I will also be considering further restrictions for harvesting shellfish around parts of the country to ensure sustainability.

“My officials have a broader programme of work under way for managing intertidal shellfish and are developing proposals for Auckland and Coromandel, which are expected to be publicly consulted in the coming months,” Mr Jones says.
