Transport Minister Chris Bishop says a newly completed roundabout at the intersection of State Highway 5 (SH5) and State Highway 28–Harwoods Road east of Tīrau will significantly improve safety on a key regional route.

“The SH5/SH28 Harwoods Road intersection had a poor safety record and is part of a corridor that has seen far too many serious crashes. Completing this new three-leg roundabout is an important step in making this stretch of highway safer for everyone who uses it,” Mr Bishop says.

“SH5 is a critical route for locals, tourists, freight, and agricultural vehicles travelling between Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Improving safety and efficiency on this corridor is essential, and I am pleased to see another project delivered that helps achieve that.

““Between 2014 and 2024, 18 people died and 64 were seriously injured on this stretch of highway.

“Construction of the $6 million roundabout began in August last year, and I am pleased to see it completed on budget and several weeks ahead of schedule. Traffic was flowing through the site today, with temporary speed restrictions lifted as works were cleared.

“This roundabout is one of several safety improvements being delivered along SH5 between Tīrau and Tārukenga Marae Road on the Rotorua side of the Mamaku Range. NZTA has also built a right‑turn bay at nearby Waimakariri Road, and funding has been allocated to complete the design for a similar roundabout at the SH5/SH28–Whites Road intersection. While construction funding for that project has not yet been confirmed, design work ensures it is ready to progress when funding allows.

“We are also making SH5 safer by widening sections of the road to allow the use of wide centrelines, which have proven to be very effective in reducing crashes. The first section east of Whites Road was completed this summer and will be extended to Harwoods Road as funding allows.

“In addition, a section of SH28–Whites Road south of the SH5 intersection is currently being rebuilt, and the intersection itself will receive a new asphalt surface.

“I also want to thank the local MP Tim van de Molen, and other community leaders for their continued strong advocacy for this important project.  

“Delivering practical safety improvements like this roundabout helps save lives and ensures the state highway network continues to support regional growth, tourism, and reliable freight connections. I am pleased to see this project completed and making a difference for road users.”
