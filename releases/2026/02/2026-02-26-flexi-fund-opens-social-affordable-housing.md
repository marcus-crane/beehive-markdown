Applications have opened for the first round of the Government’s Flexible Fund, paving the way for up to 770 new social homes and affordable rentals for New Zealanders in high housing need, Housing Minister Chris Bishop and Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka say.

“Our Government believes in social housing. For families and individuals who are struggling to find a stable, secure place to live, we’re focused on turning housing need into real homes,” Mr Bishop says.

“Last year we established the Flexible Fund to replace the confusing patchwork of social and affordable housing programmes with a single, contestable fund focused on delivering the right homes, in the right places for the people who need them most. 

“The new system uses detailed data and local insights to identify where housing need is highest and which types of homes are required. This allows providers to bring forward solutions that best meet local demand. Instead of forcing good ideas into rigid categories, we can support interventions that target need and offer strong value for money.

“Opening the Flexible Fund for applications today marks the next phase of our targeted investment in social housing and affordable rentals.

“Affordable rentals allow people to pay less than the market rent in a region. They are a missing link in the social housing system. There should be an intermediate option between traditional social housing, where people usually pay 25 per cent of their income, and market rentals.

“That targeted investment is underpinned by our Housing Investment Plan, released last year, which provides a clear blueprint for where funding will go and how it will achieve the greatest impact. The Flexible Fund is a key part of making sure that happens.

“The focus is on value for money, strong housing delivery partners, and ensuring public investment provides homes for as many people as possible.

“The Flexible Fund will support delivery in priority locations including the Far North, South Auckland, Eastern Bay of Plenty, Gisborne–Tairāwhiti, Hastings, and key main centres such as Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch.

“The Flexible Fund is part of a wider push to boost social housing and get better results from every dollar spent. Through Budgets 2024 and 2025 we are already delivering more than 2,000 additional homes, including more one-bedroom and accessible homes where they are needed most. We have sharply reduced the number of families stuck in emergency housing motels, and Kāinga Ora is focused on renewing and maintaining its existing stock as part of its turnaround plan.

“At the same time, we are fixing the wider housing system through our Going for Housing Growth reforms so the market can build more homes overall. The Flexible Fund ensures that alongside those system changes, we are continuing to invest in targeted support for New Zealanders who need it most.”

“The Flexible Fund will support social housing and affordable rentals delivered by community housing providers, iwi Māori providers and other capable organisations. Applicants will need to demonstrate delivery capability, financial strength, alignment with local housing need, and value for money,” says Mr Potaka. 

“This is about disciplined investment. We want warm, dry, safe homes that meet local need and can be delivered on time and within budget. 

“For many whānau, housing security is the foundation for better health, education and employment outcomes. Iwi providers are often best placed to respond to that need because they understand their communities and the pressures they face. The Flexible Fund gives them a clear pathway to partner with the Government to deliver warm, safe homes that support long-term stability for whānau.

“Stage one applications open today and close on 24 April 2026.”
