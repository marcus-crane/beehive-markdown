Foreign Minister Winston Peters will lead a Parliamentary and business delegation to Latin America next week, highlighting the strategic importance of New Zealand’s ties with the region.

“This trip is a timely opportunity to strengthen our relationships in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay – and to identify areas we can work together to navigate an increasingly uncertain global environment,” Mr Peters says.

“Our Latin American partners are important to us and this visit will raise our commercial profile in the region and create opportunities for New Zealand businesses. The delegation will promote New Zealand’s reputation as a provider of innovative, high-quality products and services and help create new commercial linkages. Latin American markets offer exciting potential for New Zealand exporters.”

Mr Peters will be accompanied by a business delegation as well as a group of MPs from across Parliament:

- Nicole McKee, Minister for Courts and Associate Minister of Justice;
- Tim van de Molen, Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee;
- Carmel Sepuloni, Deputy Leader of the Opposition; and
- Damien O’Connor, Opposition Trade Spokesperson.

The delegation will meet with senior government leaders and a range of parliamentary, business and education contacts.

On its way back to New Zealand, the delegation will undertake short programmes in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and French Polynesia.

“The Pacific is central to New Zealand’s foreign policy approach. We are pleased to have visited all Pacific Islands Forum countries at least once during this Parliamentary term and are looking forward to returning to French Polynesia and to making connections in Rapa Nui.”

The delegation departs on Sunday 1 March and returns on Monday 9 March.
