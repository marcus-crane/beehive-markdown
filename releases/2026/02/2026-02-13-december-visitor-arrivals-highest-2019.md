The Government welcomes new data showing New Zealand’s international visitor arrivals continued to rise in December, with strong growth from China and Australia in particular.  

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says Stats NZ’s arrival statistics for December 2025 show New Zealand’s tourism recovery continues to build.   

The December 2025 year was the first annual period to exceed 3.5 million overseas visitor arrivals since the March 2020 year. 

“International tourism is a cornerstone of New Zealand’s economic growth, supporting businesses and jobs in communities right across the country. It’s great to see our Government’s work to boost tourism is paying off,” Louise Upston says. 

“We’re seeing strong growth in visitors from China, with arrivals up by 29 percent (6,400) in December 2025 compared with December 2024, as more Chinese visitors experience New Zealand’s unique scenery and hospitality.” 

Annual figures show overseas visitor arrivals reached 3.51 million in the year to December 2025, an increase of 196,000 on the previous year. This continues to track towards the Government’s goal of returning tourism to pre-COVID levels, now sitting at 90 percent of December 2019 figures.   

“It’s also great to see continued growth from our largest visitor market, Australia, with 1.52 million arrivals in the year to December, up 9.9 percent (137,000 since the previous year). 

Monthly data shows 32,800 more international visitors arrived in December 2025 compared with December 2024. 

The Government is supporting tourism growth through a range of initiatives, including strengthening partnerships with key markets, providing funding for the promotion of New Zealand as a year-round destination and streamlining travel processes. 

Changes that allow eligible visitors from China and the Pacific to travel to New Zealand from Australia with a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA), rather than a visa, are also making a difference. 

A new survey following these changes shows being able to travel with an NZeTA was a deciding factor in people’s decisions to visit New Zealand. An overwhelming 85% of respondents, —including 85% of Chinese travellers and 82% of visitors from Pacific Island Forum countries — said they travelled to New Zealand specifically because the NZeTA option became available. The simplicity and speed of the process meant they could plan trips more spontaneously and confidently. 

“We’re committed to fixing the basics and building the future through backing our tourism and hospitality sector. This data shows our plan is working as we position New Zealand as a top choice for people planning their next holiday.”
