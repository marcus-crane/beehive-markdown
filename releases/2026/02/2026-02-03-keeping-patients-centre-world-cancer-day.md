Health Minister Simeon Brown says World Cancer Day is a chance to highlight the progress made to strengthen cancer care across New Zealand, with patients at the heart of every decision. 

“Cancer affects every New Zealander, with thousands of Kiwis diagnosed every year. On World Cancer Day, we acknowledge everyone impacted by cancer – patients, families, clinicians, and communities,” Mr Brown says.

“Over the last two years, we have taken action to improve cancer outcomes for New Zealanders. We’ve focused on earlier detection, faster access to care, and ensuring patients can benefit from modern medicines and world-class treatment.

“Bringing care closer to home has been an important focus. The newly opened Taranaki Cancer Centre is a great example. Since opening late last year, it is now treating radiation oncology patients who previously had to travel to Palmerston North for weeks at a time. Since December, 460 treatments have been delivered locally, for cancers including lung, prostate, breast, and gynaecological diseases.”

Over the last two years, the Government has delivered a series of initiatives to strengthen cancer services and improve outcomes, including:

- Funding 33 new cancer medicines through a $604 million Pharmac investment, giving patients access to the latest and most effective treatments.
- Expanding breast screening to women aged 70–74, enabling thousands more women to benefit from early detection.
- Progressively lowering the bowel screening age to match Australia with 58 as the first step, improving early detection and saving lives.
- Establishing the Faster Cancer Treatment target, ensuring patients access specialist assessment and treatment sooner.
- Investing in critical cancer infrastructure, including new LINAC machines and upgraded treatment facilities.
- Expanding stem cell transplant services to improve access and reduce delays.
- Commencing work on New Zealand’s first Cervical Cancer Elimination Strategy.
- Investing in the cancer workforce, supporting clinicians to deliver timely, quality care.
- Refreshing the Cancer Action Plan (2019–2029) to ensure the system is well-positioned for the future.

“These actions are about improving the experience and outcomes for people living with cancer – reducing wait times, improving access to treatment, and ensuring Kiwis receive the best care no matter where they live.

“We will continue to keep patients at the centre of everything we do, building on the progress of the past three years to deliver faster, fairer, and more effective cancer care for all New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.
