A scheme that brings student researchers and industry together to tackle challenges that matter to people’s daily lives is open for further applications, Science, Innovation and Technology and Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti says.

“The Applied Doctorates Scheme attracted strong backing from industry last year, and the new call for projects will provide more students the opportunity to solve real world challenges while earning their PhDs,” Dr Reti says.

“Students in the applied doctorates programme will develop advanced research skills while working with businesses to build commercial skills and deliver practical solutions for New Zealand. For industry, this is a chance to work with skilled researchers who bring fresh ideas and deep expertise.

“The first cohort is focused on energy research, with 25 industry-led projects selected from 76 submissions across energy systems, infrastructure, agriculture and high-tech engineering, recognising energy’s central role in supporting households and businesses, lifting productivity and keeping costs down.

“These students will contribute to projects that deliver results for Kiwis, including geothermal innovation with Contact Energy, reducing household electricity costs with Vector, improving energy efficiency at the New Zealand Aluminium Smelter, and strengthening rural resilience through power trading with Victoria University.

“The second cohort of doctoral-level research projects is now open for applications, and the theme for the 2026 call is Aerospace, Defence & Security, sectors that underpin New Zealand’s economic resilience and national security.

“The projects include a mix of fully Government funded and co-funded initiatives, reflecting confidence in the scheme’s direction and purpose. The first group of students are enrolling now and are expected to begin in the middle of 2026.

“The Applied Doctorates Scheme backs high-value science that will deliver results for New Zealanders, building a pipeline of researchers who can turn strong ideas into real economic and community outcomes.”

Established in 2025, the Applied Doctorates Scheme strengthens the connection between universities and industry by equipping PhD students with both advanced research expertise and applied skills needed in modern workplaces. It is supported by a five-year, $20 million Government investment to grow a workforce that can translate cutting edge science into real world benefit. 

The 2025 round sought projects on the theme of New Zealand’s path to energy innovation. The 2026 round of projects will focus on Aerospace, Defence and Security. Applications close 11 May and the projects will be made public week of 2 July. The 2027 theme will focus on Biotechnology and Bioprocessing research.
