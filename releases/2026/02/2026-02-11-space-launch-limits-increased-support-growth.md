A huge increase in the number of space launches allowed from New Zealand will enable our space and advanced aviation sectors to continue their rapid growth, Space Minister Judith Collins and Environment Minister Penny Simmonds announced today.

“The permitted number of launches will rise from 100 to 1000, following a review of space vehicle launch debris regulations,” Ms Collins says.

“When the limit of 100 was first set in 2017, New Zealand had very little launch activity. Since then, the landscape has transformed, to the point where we are the world’s third most frequent launcher of orbital rockets.

“With this strong growth, the current launch limit is expected to be reached this year. This change ensures our space and advanced aviation industries can continue to expand while operating within clear environmental boundaries.”

Ms Simmonds says projections show the new limit will not be reached until at least 2050, providing long-term certainty for industry planning and investment.

“This follows a review of regulations for space vehicle launch debris in our Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf, feeding into a decision grounded in evidence, environmental assessment and responsible sector management.

“The review assessed environmental effects for up to 1000 launches and found the environmental risk to be low. 

“Without lifting the limit, every additional launch after the current cap is reached would require a fully notified marine consent. That would slow innovation, add unnecessary cost, and undermine the Government’s commitment to investment certainty for a sector that is rapidly growing and supporting regional economies.”

The space and advanced aviation sectors are growing rapidly and making a huge contribution to New Zealand’s economy, with the space sector contributing $2.47 billion in 2024, an increase of 48 percent on five years ago. Advanced aviation, which overlaps with the space sector, contributed an estimated $480 million in 2024.

Ms Collins says today’s announcement aligns with the Government’s long-term ambition for the sector, which includes doubling the size of New Zealand’s space and advanced aviation sectors by 2030.

“This is yet another example of the Government fixing the basics while building the future.”
