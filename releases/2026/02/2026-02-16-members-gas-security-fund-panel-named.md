Gas and energy industry specialist Andy Knight has been named as chair of the expert panel appointed to advise the Government on projects applying to the $200 million Gas Security Fund, Resources and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“Mr Knight’s depth and breadth of experience in gas industry regulation and energy production and supply makes him uniquely qualified to lead the panel that will provide expert advice on the technically and economically complex projects targeted by the fund,” Mr Jones says.

The [$200m Gas Security Fund](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/gas-security-fund-seek-expressions-interest) opened for applications on 12 January 2026. It was created to unlock opportunities to improve gas supply and storage by focusing on activities that have short- to long-term benefits, including from existing sites, in response to declining gas production.

“New Zealand’s history of affordable and secure domestic gas has underpinned major parts of our economy - and this Government wants that to continue by shoring up our domestic supply, supported by the import of LNG which can provide flex to supplement our gas requirements in the meantime,” Mr Jones says.

Two other members appointed to the panel are geophysicist Tim Allan, who has extensive international experience in the industry, and John Pagani who brings experience of working with boards and management of energy firms and industry associations in New Zealand and Australia. Officials continue to assess options for two more members to be appointed in due course.

Mr Jones as Resources Minister and Associate Finance Minister Chris Bishop are the decision-making ministers for applications to the fund. 

“The panel members’ direct commercial and technical oil and gas expertise, and experience of New Zealand’s complex gas exploration and market conditions, means they will be able to provide valuable independent advice,”

“These are high-calibre individuals with impressive technical and industry expertise. We look forward to working with them,” Mr Jones says.

The Gas Security Fund is administered Kānoa – Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit. For more information, including how to apply, go to [www.growregions.govt.nz/gas-security-fund](http://www.growregions.govt.nz/gas-security-fund).
