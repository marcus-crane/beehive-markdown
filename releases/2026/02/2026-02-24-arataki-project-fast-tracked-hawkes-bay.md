A new residential development is set to deliver more homes and an economic boost for Hawke’s Bay following the Fast-track approval of the Arataki subdivision in Havelock North says Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop.

CDL Land NZ Limited lodged its application in July 2025 to provide up to 200 new homes across an 11-hectare site.

“Approval has taken just 5 months following the commencement of the expert panel,” says Mr Bishop.

“The project is estimated to generate around $78 million in investment and create approximately 629 jobs over the five-year development period during construction.

“This project will be very important for the people in Hawke’s Bay. It will create work for local people, bring investment into the area, and deliver more homes for families choosing to build their lives in the area.

“Housing affordability continues to be a challenging issue for the people of Hawke’s Bay. Over the last 10 years, house prices in Hawke’s Bay increased by 134 per cent and rental prices increased by 86 percent.

“Hawke’s Bay is another example of how the supply of homes has not kept up with growth. This means locals and temporary workers struggle to find affordable housing.

“This development of hundreds of homes will make a real difference in Hawke’s Bay, where demand for housing is high.

“This is the sixth Fast-track housing project and eleventh project overall to be approved through Fast-track.”
