Road access to one of New Zealand’s most important cultural sites, the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, has been upgraded in time for Waitangi Day events, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

Haruru Falls Rd, which provides a secondary route to the Treaty Grounds without going through Paihia, received a $1.57 million grant from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to seal the remaining 3.7km of metal road.

“Anyone familiar with the road will know that it was a dusty, uneven and sometimes treacherous route because it was partially unsealed,” Mr Jones says.

“This upgrade will ensure safe and resilient access for the thousands of local and international visitors to what is one of New Zealand’s most historic and culturally important sites. The Treaty Grounds also house Te Rau Aroha – the 28th Māori Battalion Museum. These hugely important parts of our history now have a road that goes some way to fitting their stature.”

The sealing project was completed just days before Waitangi Day celebrations.

Mr Jones officially opened the upgraded Haruru Falls Road at a ceremony today along with iwi leaders, trustees of the Waitangi National Trust, Far North Mayor Moko Tepania and other dignitaries in attendance.

The upgrades include drainage, paving, earthworks and fitting of guardrails. Far North District Council contributed $400,000 to the project. 

“The Waitangi Treaty Grounds are a place for all New Zealanders and where much of our country’s history was shaped. It’s a site of national significance and its importance is evident in the more than 160,000 visitors who head to the grounds each year,” Mr Jones says. 

The Treaty Grounds are undergoing an infrastructure upgrade funded with a [grant of up to $10.2 million](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/nationally-significant-sites-be-upgraded) from the RIF. The project involves protecting nationally significant historic buildings from water damage and upgrading other facilities.

So far new toilets, a new carpark and lit pathways have been installed. The Treaty House has been repainted and protected from water with new drainage. 

The upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2026.
