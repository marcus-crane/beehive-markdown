New Zealand and Germany met today to reaffirm our close and enduring partnership grounded in shared democratic values, a commitment to the global order based on international law and a determination to address global challenges collaboratively. We celebrated the strength of our bilateral relationship and expressed our shared intention to further deepen cooperation across strategic, economic, security and people-to-people domains.

We underscored our firm commitment to upholding international law and the UN Charter, and to support multilateralism, with the United Nations and its institutions at its core. We noted with concern the growing pressures on international rules and institutions and restated our shared conviction that collective action is essential to global stability.

New Zealand and Germany recognise the interconnected nature of European and Indo-Pacific security and prosperity. We discussed our shared interests in promoting stability, sovereignty and freedom of navigation. Germany welcomes New Zealand’s ongoing support for Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 illegal full-scale invasion, including financial contributions to NATO-aligned initiatives, deployment of NZDF personnel to Germany and other parts of Europe, and mutually reinforcing sanctions, which aligns with Germany’s longstanding commitment to European security and to countering threats to territorial integrity. Both sides reiterated our opposition to coercive or destabilising actions in any region. 

Germany and New Zealand reiterated that adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the seas and oceans must be carried out, is essential to peace and stability, and both sides express strong support for ASEAN centrality. 

New Zealand outlined the ongoing efforts of Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) members to build Pacific resilience and regional stability and welcomed Germany’s decade-long engagement as a Dialogue Partner of the PIF. Germany supported these initiatives, including through its pledge to the Pacific Resilience Facility, and reiterated its intention to deepen engagement with Pacific partners. We also recognised the implications arising from climate change and sea level rise for security.

We affirmed the need for resilient, diversified supply chains and open, rules-based trade. We were pleased to note that the European Union-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement is exceeding expectations for increased trade and mutual prosperity. We welcomed ambition to upgrade the New Zealand-Germany Double-Taxation Agreement to further deepen economic ties. New Zealand discussed its participation in initiatives to strengthen critical mineral investment and strategic economic partnerships. We also recognised the importance of innovation, energy, space and digital cooperation and partnerships in supporting prosperity in both the Indo-Pacific and Europe. 

As close partners we reiterated our commitment to human rights, democratic governance and fundamental freedoms, emphasising that these principles are essential foundations for security and prosperity.

New Zealand welcomed recent and forthcoming repatriations of Māori and Moriori ancestors and taonga Māori from several institutions across Germany as a welcome example of strong cultural ties between our countries. 

New Zealand and Germany concluded by reaffirming our commitment to deepening bilateral cooperation and working together in pursuit of a stable, secure and prosperous international environment. We welcomed ongoing dialogue at all levels and agreed to maintain close coordination on global and regional issues of shared concern.
