One year on from the Coalition Government’s Fast-track approvals system opening for business, New Zealand is already benefiting from faster approvals, lower costs, and real infrastructure getting underway, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones say.

“Fast-track was set up to fix a problem New Zealanders know all too well. Important projects were stuck for years in delay, buried in bureaucracy, with costs spiralling and communities missing out,” Mr Bishop says.

“Twelve months on, the results speak for themselves. Fast-track is fixing the basics of how we approve infrastructure, and building the foundations for New Zealand’s future growth.

“The first project approved under Fast-track, the Ports of Auckland wharf extension, took just 111 days from when the application was assessed as complete and in-scope by officials, to approval. Without fast-track, the same project was expected to take around five years for a decision.

“That difference is not bureaucratic trivia. It means jobs are created sooner, economic growth is unlocked earlier, and infrastructure is delivered when it is actually needed.

“Fast-track combines multiple approval processes into a single, integrated pathway, while maintaining environmental safeguards through independent expert panels and robust approval conditions.

“Fast-track is not a rubber stamp. It is about applying the same environmental rigour more efficiently, so good projects can get on with delivering.

“One year in, it’s clear to see that Fast-track is already building serious momentum.

“Nine projects have been approved so far, with another nine expected to receive decisions before the end of March.

“The nine approved projects include a new wharf and cruise ship terminal in Auckland, four housing developments across the country, three mining and quarrying projects, and one renewable energy project.

“Over their lifetimes, the projects approved so far are expected to deliver nearly 2,000 new homes, produce more than 260 million tonnes of aggregate, support thousands of jobs, and contribute billions to the economy.”

“Coming down the pipeline we have another 17 projects currently before expert panels, with their decisions expected in the coming months.

“In total, there are 76 projects currently progressing through the Fast-track process, including referral applications being considered, or have been referred by the Ministers, and substantive applications having their application assessed for completeness, or being considered by an expert panel."

Mr Jones says the successful implementation of the legislation shows criticism was unfounded, the obstacles thrown up by opponents overcome, and the guardrails put in place worked.

“I am proud that this Coalition Government has created a process that is the envy of countries around the world. Those companies that have successfully gone through it have noted the time and money they have saved as a result. That’s time and money better spent on growing our economy and creating jobs.”
