Defence Minister Judith Collins departs today for Germany to attend the international Munich Security Conference. 

“In a turbulent and unpredictable world, the Munich Security Conference is an important opportunity to debate key security issues that impact New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

“This year the conference brings together global decision-makers and military leaders from more than 100 countries, working to bolster cooperation, collective security and the peaceful resolution of conflicts."

During the three-day conference Ms Collins will hold bilateral meetings with a number of New Zealand’s long-standing defence partners, including the United Kingdom’s Secretary of Defence, John Healey, and NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte.

She will also speak at a session focused on the interconnected nature of security challenges in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions.

“I look forward to sharing New Zealand’s perspectives on a range of international issues, particularly the interconnected security challenges facing both of our regions such as Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and escalating strategic competition. 

“As a small nation reliant on trade at the bottom of the southwest Pacific, we must take every opportunity to sit at the table and advocate for our interests and values.”

Ms Collins will return to New Zealand on 16 February.
