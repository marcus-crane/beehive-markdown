The Government is taking action to reduce the impacts of wild deer on privately owned production land, Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard and Hunting and Fishing Minister James Meager say. 

“Wild deer are valued for recreational purposes and as a food source but increasing numbers in some parts of the country are causing problems for farmers, growers and foresters,” Mr Hoggard says.

In 2026, MPI will establish a programme to help communities improve the management of wild deer.  The programme will include two trials based around catchment groups to develop and deliver management plans, one in the North Island in the Wairarapa and one in the Hurunui in the South Island. 

“Catchment groups are a good place to start because they involve landowners already working collaboratively on other issues. Wider community interests will have a role, especially hunters and regional councils.

“I’ve met with stakeholder groups such as New Zealand Deerstalkers Association and the Game Animal Council to discuss how hunters can be involved, and representatives of the hunting community will be included on an Oversight Group. I did take the opportunity to stress that despite some reports, no toxins, such as brodifacoum, would be used for deer control. 

“I also recognise the role of government policy in unlocking commercial opportunities for deer recovery, so the programme will also involve sense-checking the system and regulatory settings. I have asked officials to have a good look at the food safety controls currently on hunted meat to make sure they are justified. Any opportunity to open up more opportunities for hunters to get a financial return for their work will be looked at.”

Mr Meager says the hunting community will be part of the solution.

“Hunter-led conservation is an important part of managing wild deer in New Zealand. If we are to make real inroads in tackling the impacts of these wild animals, it will take a collaborative approach across government and stakeholders.”

Mr Hoggard says he expects that once the deer management programme was progressing, that MPI will work with partners to begin addressing other wild browsing animal problems on production land.

“There’s a lot of concern around wild pigs and Canada geese and we need a joined-up effort to address those too.”
