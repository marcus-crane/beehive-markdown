The first new school announced by the Government is open from today in Flat Bush following a blessing this morning, Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“A new school is an exciting start for the school community and it was a pleasure to visit Te Kura Rau Iti this morning. Flat Bush is a fast-growing suburb and this school, with a capacity for 700 students, will provide for local families heading into the future,” Ms Stanford says.

The new school for Years 0 to 6 has come in on time and under budget, making use of the Government’s new approach which has reduced the cost of a classroom while still retaining high-quality specifications for the build.

“We have proven that we can provide repeatable designs for schools in a way that both ensures students are getting quality, and taxpayers’ money is used responsibly,” Ms Stanford says.

“The new school is also free from the unpopular, large barnyard-style classrooms that we promised to address. These weren’t working for students and they weren’t working for teachers.”

The new school has:

- 30 teaching spaces with flexible art spaces
- A library, hall, and administration spaces
- Two hardcourts, and junior and senior playgrounds.
- A school field, available in March.

The new school is a repeatable design, based on Ahutoetoe School, Brookfields School, and Te Pae School which is currently in construction. The school design also includes space for further roll growth when required. The total build is $41 million.

Ms Stanford says the school will also provide the Learning Support initiatives that are rolling out from Term One through the Government’s $746.7 million Learning Support investment. 

“We are supporting our children to get the support they need with their learning whether they’re needing to catch up, get more help, or have specific learning needs. As part of the next phase for the school in the future, there is also a planned learning support satellite unit.”

Local MP for Takanini, Rima Nakhle, says the school’s opening is fantastic progress that responds to Flat Bush’s growth, relieving pressure on nearby schools. 

“Locals have been seeing significant growth in Flat Bush, and Te Kura Rau Iti has been built to respond to that. The opening of the school today is another step in ensuring our community has high-quality learning spaces for our children heading into the future,” Ms Nakhle says.

“This is a great example of delivery in action. We are committed to fixing the basics and building for the future, and today is another step in delivering the funding and resources required to build a world-leading education system.”

“I wish the school team and the community the absolute very best in learning and success in their new school. This is an exciting start for everyone and I look forward to seeing the school’s progress,” Ms Stanford says.
