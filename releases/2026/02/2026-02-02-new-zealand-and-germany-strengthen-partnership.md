New Zealand and Germany have agreed to strengthen their strategic partnership, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced.   

“New Zealand and Germany share deep concerns about global developments across Europe, the Middle East and the Indo Pacific,” Mr Peters, who met his German counterpart Johann Wadephul in the Bay of Islands today, says. “At a time of geostrategic upheaval, it is important to reinforce relationships with trusted partners.”

Following their meeting, Ministers Peters and Wadephul released a [Joint Statement](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint-statement-new-zealand-foreign-minister-winston-peters-and-german-federal-foreign) reaffirming the importance of the New Zealand-Germany relationship. 

“The foundation of our relationship with Germany is our shared interests and values, including commitment to democracy, human rights and a well-functioning and fit-for-purpose multilateral system,” Mr Peters says. 

“The world’s challenges are inter-connected, which is why New Zealand is so committed to doing its part in defending Ukraine, and why Germany is increasing its support for the Pacific. The current strength of the German–New Zealand relationship provides a solid foundation for even deeper collaboration in the years to come.

 “German connections matter to New Zealand. Within Europe it is our largest export market. We partner together on cutting edge science and space research. We welcome German tourists and young people on working holidays, and have strong education links,” Mr Peters says. 

The Ministers also issued a [Joint Statement on Antarctic Cooperation.](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint-statement-antarctic-cooperation-between-government-federal-republic-germany-and)  

 “We both support the work of the Antarctic Treaty System for the long-term protection of Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science,” Mr Peters says.
