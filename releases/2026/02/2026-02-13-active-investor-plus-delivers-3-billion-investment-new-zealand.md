Less than a year after it was refreshed, the Active Investor Plus (AIP) visa is bringing $3.39 billion into New Zealand, Immigration Minister Erica Stanford announced today.

“These results show that the significant changes the Government has made to the visa is achieving our goal of making an investor visa available that attracts high-value global investors and supports the Government’s Going for Growth approach,” Ms Stanford says. 

To date, 573 applications have been made, totalling $3.39 billion. In comparison, 116 applications were received with around $70 million of investment committed over two-and-a-half years under the settings introduced by the previous Government.

Ms Stanford made the announcement today during a visit to Hectre, an orchard‑technology firm that has received AIP investment to support its growth and create high‑skilled jobs.

“Hectre is another excellent example of New Zealand innovation and potential taking flight, supported by great investors who are keen to create value together with us and do business here.

“International investment is critical for lifting productivity, supporting jobs, and helping New Zealand businesses to expand. The results we are seeing indicate strong overseas confidence in our direction and economic ambition.”

Since the April 2025 refresh:

- 573 applications have been received
- $1.05 billion is already invested with $2.34 billion in the pipeline, expected in the next six months
- The Growth Category is the most popular, with most investment flowing through managed funds.

“Investments are already supporting growth across various sectors, including in tech, healthcare, aged care, horticulture, and digital media," Ms Stanford says. 

“Benefits are numerous, with AIP investment helping our companies access critical capital for growth – that is helping local firms to expand, hire more skilled workers, and grow export revenue." 

Ms Stanford says that investment has also been unlocking productive capital for businesses across New Zealand, from cybersecurity and cloud technology to regional infrastructure.

“These investors bring not just capital, but global experience, expertise, and networks. I have had the pleasure of meeting some of these investors over the last year and I have seen firsthand their love for, and commitment to, New Zealand.

“I am delighted that our new visa settings are helping to open up possibility and opportunity for investment. New Zealand is famous for its ingenuity. Overseas investment and partnership with extremely talented people is boosting our economy and helping us to build for the future.

“New Zealand is open for business. I look forward to seeing the jobs, development, and long-term growth our changes continue to generate in key sectors.”

To encourage deeper connection to New Zealand, investor visa holders can also now buy or build one home valued at $5 million or more.
