Transmission Gully has received the green light for a new 110 km/h speed limit for drivers travelling between Wellington and the Kāpiti Coast, says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

The new speed limit will take effect from 12:01am on Monday, 16 February 2026.

“This change is part of a wider effort to fix the basics of our transport network and set it up for the future. We’re committed to providing state highways that help people get where they need to go quickly and safely,” says Mr Bishop.

“Transmission Gully is a critical transport link for Wellington and Kāpiti, carrying around 22,000 vehicles a day and providing a safe, modern, and resilient route between the regions.

“The road, as one of the previous National Government’s first Roads of National  
Significance, was designed and built to support higher-speed travel, subject to meeting strict safety standards. Since opening in 2022, Transmission Gully has recorded low crash rates, with no deaths despite more than 150 barrier strikes. Safety features including two lanes in each direction and a flexible median barrier between opposing lanes help reduce the risk of death or serious injury in a crash.

“The new higher speed limit applies to the 27‑kilometre section of State Highway 1 between the Linden and Paekākāriki interchanges, which is currently posted at 100 km/h. Heavy vehicles and vehicles towing trailers will continue to have a 90 km/h limit.

“Public consultation on the proposed change took place in mid‑2025. Of the 2,061 submissions received, 92% supported raising the Transmission Gully limit to 110 km/h.

“I want to thank drivers for their patience over summer while essential maintenance and resurfacing work was completed. That work has helped bring the road to the point where a higher speed limit can be safely applied.

“Police will apply the same enforcement to 110km/h roads as any other part of the road network. Drivers can expect to see police patrols on New Zealand roads anywhere, at any time. Drivers should continue to drive to the conditions, free from impairment and distraction, and make sure everyone’s wearing their seatbelt.

“Although Raumati Straights was consulted on at the same time, due to constraints on this section of the corridor, including the rail line and proximity to Queen Elizabeth Park, the Raumati Straights were not built to the same design and safety standards as other sections of the Kāpiti Expressway. Technical assessments determined that this section did not meet the minimum safety and design requirements for a 110km/h speed limit.

“Increasing the speed limit on this section would require significant investment in safety improvements. This remains a possibility in the future, but it would depend on further scope development and funding decisions.”

**Notes to editor:**

 

- NZTA will continue to monitor Raumati Straights and consider future improvements as part of wider planning for the State Highway 1 corridor.
- NZTA will work closely with New Zealand Police on speed enforcement. Police will apply the same enforcement approach on Transmission Gully as they do on other 110 km/h roads, focusing on areas with the highest safety risks.
