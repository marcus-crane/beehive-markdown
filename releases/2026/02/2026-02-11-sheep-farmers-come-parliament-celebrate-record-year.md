Agriculture Minister Todd McClay has today hosted a celebratory barbecue for farmers, industry representatives and MPs to mark the upcoming National Lamb Day on 15 February.

“As we honour the legacy of the pioneers behind the first shipment of frozen sheep meat to the United Kingdom, we also celebrate lamb exports exceeding $4 billion for the first time last year,” Mr McClay says.

“Today we acknowledge the red meat sector and its significant economic contribution to New Zealand, as well as the hardworking men and women behind that success.

“Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. Meat and wool export revenue alone is forecast to increase seven per cent to $13.2 billion in the year to 30 June 2026.

“The efforts of New Zealand’s hard-working sheep and beef farmers support tens of thousands of jobs, and the sector is crucial to New Zealand’s ambitious goal of doubling the value of exports in 10 years.

“This Government is focused on building the future. We’re cutting red tape through significant reforms, building trade, boosting farmgate returns, and investing in the health of rural New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

“Since coming to Government, we have concluded, signed and entered into force the NZ–UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, finished negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and secured a high-quality, once-in-a-generation Free Trade Agreement with India.

“We’ll continue removing barriers to trade, opening doors to new partners and making the most of strong trading relationships.”
