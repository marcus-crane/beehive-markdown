Associate Health Minister David Seymour and Health Minister Simeon Brown welcome Pharmac’s proposal to widen access to brentuximab for people with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 

“World Cancer Day is an opportunity to recognise those impacted by cancer. I would like to acknowledge the hardships faced by thousands of Kiwis affected by cancer each year,” Mr Seymour says.

“Improving access to cancer medication in New Zealand is important to cancer patients, and their families. That’s why it has been a focus of this Government.

“Under today’s proposal, brentuximab could be used as a first treatment option for people newly diagnosed with sALCL. Previously patients had to wait until other options had been tried, and proven ineffective. This proposal is expected to improve both survival rate, and quality of life.

“Pharmac will now consult clinicians, the public, and Blood Cancer NZ to understand the practical impacts of funding this medicine. The proposal has had support from the blood cancer community.

“We have allocated Pharmac its largest ever budget of $6.294 billion over four years, and a $604 million uplift. Since then, Pharmac has made decisions to fund 43 new cancer treatments. In the first year of funding, Pharmac anticipates about 2,500 Kiwis will access the treatments they need that weren’t previously available to them. This makes a real difference in the lives of Kiwis. 

“We aren’t stopping there. I will continue to work towards securing more money for Pharmac to get on with what they do best – funding the medicines Kiwis need to live longer and more fulfilling lives.”  

Mr Brown says the Government is committed to improving treatment and care for New Zealanders with blood cancer.

“Last year, I announced a significant expansion of stem cell transplant services for patients with blood cancers and related conditions, helping more people access critical, life-saving treatment sooner. Too many Kiwis currently face distressing delays for these procedures, which is why boosting transplant capacity and reducing wait times is essential.

“The expansion will enable between 27 and 38 per cent more patients to receive allogeneic transplants when they need them, improving outcomes and giving people a better chance at recovery.

“This is about keeping people with cancer at the centre. Alongside investment in new medicines through Pharmac, our Faster Cancer Treatment target, and other initiatives to strengthen cancer services, we are focused on improving access, reducing delays, and ensuring people get the treatment they need, when they need it.”

Pharmac’s proposal, if feedback is positive, will be effective from 1 April 2026.
