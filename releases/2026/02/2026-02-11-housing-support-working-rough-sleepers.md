The Government is making steady progress expanding Housing First support for people sleeping rough, with 199 lease agreements signed since actions were announced in September last year, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

The additional leases are enabling more social housing places for the Housing First programme, which supports people experiencing chronic homelessness into permanent housing with tailored, wraparound support.

So far, 168 new Housing First tenancies have commenced across Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch.

“We know Housing First Works and that is why we are backing the programme with funding for the additional 300 homes announced in September last year,” Mr Potaka says.

“It’s encouraging to see delivery well underway, with well over half of that additional capacity already achieved.

“Housing First providers have also tenanted a further 105 homes on top of the 168 tenancies as a result of existing Housing First funding.” 

Mr Potaka says the Government has provided $10 million in additional funding for proven support services for people sleeping rough.

“This additional funding is focused on services that are already established and working well. Agencies are working with trusted providers to make sure it was directed where it would have the greatest impact,” Mr Potaka says.

That funding is now fully contracted, with outreach and support services operating in the major urban areas to help connect people sleeping rough with housing and wider support.

“We are focused on getting the right homes, in the right places, with the right supports for people sleeping rough, and keeping momentum going.”

**Note to editors:** 

- Since these short-term actions began, MSD has worked with 478 people through its operational tactical plan across Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Christchurch. Of those, 296 people were identified as rough sleepers.
- Outcomes for those 296 people include:
  
  - 66 granted emergency housing
  - 87 referred to transitional housing
  - 144 placed on the public housing register
- Work is also underway to improve the efficiency of transitional housing, including ensuring places are located where demand is highest, reducing turnaround times between tenants, and speeding up placement into transitional housing.
- Two short-term actions led by MSD, strengthening staff guidance on the use of discretion when assessing emergency housing grants, and the redirection of benefits have now been implemented and rolled out nationwide.
