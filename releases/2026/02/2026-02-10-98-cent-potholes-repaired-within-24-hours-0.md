Around 98 per cent of potholes on state highways are now being fixed within 24 hours of being identified each month, showing the Government’s drive to fix the basics on New Zealand’s roads is paying off, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Lifting productivity to help rebuild our economy and build New Zealand’s future remains a major focus for this Government, and accelerating pothole repairs and preventative work is essential to maintaining a safe, reliable state highway network that underpins that growth.

“When New Zealanders made it clear they were frustrated with unprecedented numbers of potholes appearing across the country, we introduced new requirements for NZTA contractors: 95 per cent of potholes on main state highways and 85 per cent on regional state highways must be repaired within 24 hours of discovery.

“To get on top of the issue, we created a dedicated $3.9 billion Pothole Prevention Activity Class over three years, specifically for resealing, rehabilitation, and drainage maintenance. This ensures the funding is used solely for preventing potholes. With roughly $2 billion allocated to state highways, NZTA has been delivering an extensive programme of work, including consistently high volumes of road rehabilitation, a process that rebuilds full road sections rather than relying on resealing alone.

“Over the summer, the Government’s Pothole Prevention Fund is supporting 290 lane kilometres of rehabilitation work, similar to the substantial amount completed last year. Keeping rehabilitation levels this high will significantly reduce the likelihood of potholes forming.

“The improvements are clear. Since the targets came into effect, NZTA has consistently met them each month, supported by smarter repair techniques that make temporary fixes last longer until permanent work can be completed, instead of relying on simple cold-mix patches,” Mr Bishop says.

“Meeting these targets month after month shows how far we’ve come in addressing the pothole problem. New Zealanders can now travel more safely and smoothly, with fewer delays and hazards on the road.

“If you spot a pothole on the state highway network, please report it straight away by calling 0800 4 HIGHWAYS (0800 44 44 49). With everyone’s help, potholes can be found and repaired as quickly as possible.”

**Notes to Editor:** 

- Due to reporting reconciliation, total pothole figures since July 2024 have been updated in the last quarter.
- NZTA has delivered on the Government’s 24 hour pothole repair targets each month since they were introduced, exceeding the targets set in July 2024.
- Potholes tend to be formed in wet conditions, which is why there are a higher number requiring repair in winter months.
- The Pothole Prevention Activity Class includes $2 billion of funding for State Highway Pothole Prevention over three years, and $1.9 billion for local road Pothole Prevention over three years.
- The summer maintenance programme began in October 2025 and will be completed by March 2026.
