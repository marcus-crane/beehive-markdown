Hamilton is set to come alive this weekend as rugby league fans descend on the city for the 2026 NRL All Stars event, backed by the Government. 

“The NRL All Stars event is a unique, trans-Tasman celebration of sport, community and culture, bringing together Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Māori players to represent their countries,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“With a large influx of passionate fans and international broadcast reach, the event will give an economic boost to Hamilton and the wider Waikato region.

“It’s a fantastic event not only delivering an economic boost to the region but helping grow grassroots rugby league from the ground up – one tackle at a time.

Last hosted in New Zealand in 2023 in Rotorua, the All Stars event includes a men’s and women’s game, a welcome ceremony, player appearances and community events.

“It will attract league fans from across New Zealand and Australia to the Waikato, giving a boost to our local tourism and hospitality businesses,” Louise Upston says.

“Events like these generate a buzz in our regions, keeping our communities and local businesses humming. The Government is committed to supporting more events like these, establishing New Zealand as a go-to destination for major events.”

The NRL All Stars fixture is scheduled for Sunday 15 February 2026 at FMG Stadium, Hamilton.
