In an historic moment, New Zealand will host its first-ever State of Origin match next year at Eden Park, a major event expected to draw thousands of international visitors and deliver a significant economic boost for Auckland.

The New Zealand Government and Auckland Council have worked in tandem, alongside the Australian Rugby League Commission, to bring the sporting spectacular to Auckland. 

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says securing one of Australasia’s biggest sporting events represents a major win for fans, tourism and New Zealand sport.

“I couldn’t be more excited to welcome the Blues and Maroons across the ditch for the very first time,” Louise Upston says.

“This is a milestone moment for rugby league in New Zealand, but it is so much more than a game. 

“Hosting State of Origin is expected to attract over 10,000 of our Aussie neighbours, generate more than 50,000 international visitor nights, and inject an estimated $17.4 million into the economy. 

“With a significant Australian audience, our biggest tourism market, this match will showcase Auckland on an international stage, and put New Zealand on the map as a world-class destination for major events.”

The State of Origin series is one of the fiercest rivalries in global sport, pitting Queensland and New South Wales against each other in a high‑intensity three‑match contest. Next year, for the first time ever, one of the series matches will be played on New Zealand soil.

Hosting events has been made even easier because of changes to planning restrictions at Eden Park announced by the Government today, which will unlock the opportunity for more major events to be hosted at the stadium.

The 2027 fixture is proudly supported by the Government’s Major Events Fund and Auckland Council Events.

Dates and ticket details for the State of Origin fixture will be confirmed by the NRL later in the year.
