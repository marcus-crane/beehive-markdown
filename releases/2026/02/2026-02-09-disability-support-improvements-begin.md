From this week, a new nationally consistent approach will begin to benefit disabled people, families and carers who use supports funded by Disability Support Services (DSS).

Minister for Disability Issues Louise Upston says the new approach is significant and confirms the first tranche of the changes announced in September 2025.

“We listened to the disability community who said that the assessment and allocation processes needed to be easier, more consistent and streamlined,” Louise Upston says.

“We’ve also responded to Independent Review findings that disability support services had become a postcode lottery for disabled people around the country.

“From this week, All Needs Assessment Service Coordination organisations (NASCs) and Enabling Good Lives (EGL) sites will use the same approach to assess needs and ensure supports are allocated fairly and consistently – no matter where people live.

“After their assessment, people will get a clear plan focused on their needs and explaining the purpose of their funding. Support will be available if they need it to help them manage their plan.

“Families and carers can also now be considered as part of the assessment. We recognise that better support for the wellbeing of families and carers also greatly improves the disabled person’s wellbeing and quality of life.

“In April, further improvements mean people with flexible funding will get budgets to manage within and current purchasing rules will be removed (including the March 2024 changes).

“We recognise that disabled people are the experts in their own lives. This will give greater choice and control over their supports and spending to around 38,500 people who already receive flexible funding.

“Throughout this stabilisation period, it’s been important for us to continue to listen. These improvements are informed by what more than 1,800 disabled people, families and carers told us during nationwide consultation last year.

“The changes will also provide a more stable foundation to strengthen the disability support system over the longer term.”
