A first-of-its-kind health and rehabilitation centre has opened at Burnham Military Camp to support the health, wellbeing and operational readiness of New Zealand Defence Force personnel. 

“Kiwis who put on the uniform put their lives on the line to defend and protect New Zealand and its people. They deserve the best support possible to proactively care for their minds and bodies, and to help them get back on their feet when they’re injured,” Associate Defence Minister Chris Penk says.  

“The new Military Health and Performance Centre, Tû Manawa Ora, at Burnham Military Camp is the first combined health and rehabilitation facility across the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) estate, bringing together a broad range of services under one roof.” 

The new facility includes: 

- Comprehensive medical treatment centre
- Dental services
- Physiotherapy, rehabilitation and performance spaces
- Psychological resilience, pastoral care, social work and counselling services
- Education, research, simulation and training facilities
- Staff and logistics areas
- Emergency response, including ambulance facilities

“Today’s opening represents a step forward in how the Defence Force looks after its people, setting a new standard for healthcare infrastructure across camps and bases,” Mr Penk says. 

“Providing multi-disciplinary care will benefit both the prevention and treatment of health issues, ensuring Defence personnel are well supported during service and continue to thrive long after they leave the Force.  

“Military healthcare professionals now also have a modern, fit-for-purpose environment that enables the delivery of high-quality health, rehabilitation and performance services, which in turn will improve retention and operational readiness across the Defence Force. 

“Building the centre at Burnham, the largest military base in the South Island, reflects its strategic importance. The camp plays a key role in New Zealand’s national security system, supporting training, operational deployments, humanitarian assistance and disaster response. 

“Completed in just 18 months, the $22 million project is a testament to the combined efforts of the Defence Estate and Infrastructure group, construction partner Hawkins New Zealand, and our Alliance partners Ernst & Young, GHD NZ and Beca. 

“This new centre demonstrates to our Defence people that while they dedicate themselves to serving New Zealand, we are committed to ensuring they have the health, wellbeing and working environments they need to perform at their best.”
