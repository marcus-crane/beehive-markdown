The Government is further protecting productive land by committing nearly $28 million for erosion control projects, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay announced today.

Applications for funding support under the Hill Country Erosion Programme (HCEP) opened today, and councils across the country are invited to submit proposals for eligible projects. This round allocates $27.8 million for erosion control work to be delivered between 2027 and 2031.

The programme helps reduce the impacts of severe weather, protect soil health, and limit downstream damage.

“This programme is one of our most effective tools for supporting farmers and growers to protect their land and prepare for future storms,” Mr McClay says.

“We want to continue safeguarding productive farmland around the country, while reducing the environmental and economic impacts of erosion on local communities.”

Cabinet established the programme in 2007 and Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service’s current $25.2 million investment (2023–2027) is supported by $87 million in cash and in-kind contributions from 14 partner councils and from landowners, reflecting their strong support.

The funding went towards the councils delivering regionally tailored programmes that include treating vulnerable land, working with landowners to create farm-scale erosion control plans, and building regional capability.
