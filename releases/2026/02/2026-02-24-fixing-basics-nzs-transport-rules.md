The Government is continuing its work to fix the basics of New Zealand’s transport system, with public consultation opening today on two packages of practical rule changes to make everyday travel safer and cut red tape for truck operators, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“For most New Zealanders, transport rules are not something they think about until they run into them,” Mr Bishop says.

“It might be a parent unsure whether their 10-year-old is allowed to ride their bike on the footpath, a driver not clear how much space to give a cyclist, an e-scooter rider not sure if they can use the cycle lane, a bus stuck waiting to pull back into traffic, or a truck operator tied up in paperwork just to move an empty trailer between depots.

“We are fixing the basics by making sure the rules are clear, practical, and reflect how people actually use our roads every day. This is about safer school rides, smoother bus trips, clearer guidance for drivers, and fewer compliance headaches for truck operators.

“This is technical work, but it matters in the real world. It affects how parents teach their kids to ride bikes safely, how drivers pass cyclists or horses on rural roads, how buses pull out in traffic, and how truckies get freight from A to B.”

The first package of proposals focuses on lane use and everyday road rules, aiming to make them clearer and safer for drivers, cyclists, bus users and pedestrians.

“We are seeking feedback on five practical proposals to improve the safe and efficient use of lanes and better align the rules with how people already travel,” Mr Bishop says.

Proposals include:

- Allowing children up to age 12 (inclusive) to ride their bikes on footpaths, helping keep younger riders safer and reflecting common practice.
- Introducing a mandatory passing gap of between one and 1.5 metres, depending on the speed limit, to give motorists clearer guidance when passing cyclists and horse riders.
- Allowing e-scooters to use cycle lanes.
- Requiring drivers travelling under 60 kilometres per hour to give way to buses pulling out from bus stops.
- Clarifying signage rules so councils can better manage berm parking.

“Many children already ride on footpaths, although the current rule does not allow them to. Bringing the law into line with reality, with appropriate guidance and expectations around responsible riding, will help families make safer choices,” Mr Bishop says.

“I acknowledge some pedestrians, including older people and members of the disability community, may have concerns. Education and clear guidance will be important, and parents and caregivers will need to ensure children ride at safe speeds and give way to pedestrians.”

The second package focuses on heavy vehicles.

“Freight keeps our economy moving, and truck drivers are the backbone of our supply chains. We have heard clearly from operators that some of the current rules create unnecessary delays and costs without improving safety,” Mr Bishop says.

Under the proposals:

- Some permit requirements would be removed so rental operators can  move empty High Productivity Motor Vehicle truck and trailer combinations between depots and customers without unnecessary delays.
- Driver licence settings would be updated so Class 1 licence holders can drive zero-emissions vehicles with a gross laden weight up to 7,500 kilograms, and Class 2 licence holders can drive electric buses with more than two axles with a gross laden weight up to 22,000 kilograms.
- Signage requirements for load pilot vehicles would be made more practical.
- Overseas heavy vehicle licence holders would be able to convert their licences either by sitting tests or completing approved courses.

“These are practical, commonsense changes. They give operators more certainty to get on with their work, reduce compliance headaches, and support the transition to low-emissions vehicles, all while keeping safety front and centre.

“These two packages of proposals are just part of the wider Land Transport Rules Reform programme. 

“Last year we reduced the frequency for vintage vehicles and private motorhomes needing to get a Warrant of Fitness or Certificate of Fitness, and in recent months we’ve consulted the public on also reducing WOF/COF frequency for light vehicles, simplifying heavy vehicle permitting, and potential safety requirements for vehicles entering the fleet. We’ll have more to say on those proposals soon.

“There’s still a lot more work to do on modernising New Zealand’s Land Transport Rules. We hear the freight and heavy vehicle sectors loud and clear when they tell us there are more changes they’d like to see, and policy work is underway to carefully consider those ideas.

“These changes are just a first step in commonsense reforms across New Zealand’s transport system. The Ministry of Transport and NZTA will build on the momentum of the programme by considering further reforms to Land Transport Rules, informed by issues that have been raised by industry and the public. There is also research underway to inform future work to enable more productive vehicles.

“We encourage parents, cyclists, bus users, disability advocates, truck drivers, transport operators, councils and everyday road users to have their say on the current proposals. Good rules are built on commonsense feedback from people who live by them.”
