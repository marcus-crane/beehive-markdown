The Government is investing $4 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund for infrastructure to support the Bisset Road social housing project in Kaikohe, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka say.

The Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) will support essential infrastructure such as roads, stormwater and wastewater, and infrastructure for carrying utilities like power and telecommunications. 

“The RIF is designed to support projects that deliver regional benefits, and Bisset Road is a prime example. Kaikohe needs more warm, secure, affordable homes, especially for workers for its growing businesses, and this funding will help,” Mr Jones says.

“More widely, the project means Ngāpuhi rangatahi and local tradespeople can gain apprenticeships and hands-on experience as this project rolls out. It means jobs for locals and a stronger regional workforce. 

“The build will help strengthen regional supply chains by using local timber and contractors and will provide good quality, affordable homes for whānau,” Mr Jones says.

The RIF grant follows on from the more than [$50m](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/more-affordable-homes-wh%C4%81nau-te-tai-tokerau) government investment into housing in the Far North last year.

The Bisset Road development, which has been approved for Fast-Track, will provide up to 100 new affordable rentals, meaning rents will be capped at 80 percent of market rates for at least 25 years.

“The project demonstrates how community-led activities can deliver long-term outcomes for whānau, hapū, and communities across Te Tai Tokerau,” Mr Potaka says

The development is being undertaken by community housing provider Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi Limited – the health and social services delivery arm of the iwi authority Te Runanga a Iwi o Ngāpuhi. 

Additional funding comes from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, which is providing a grant of $29.7m, along with a $13.6m loan from Auckland-based social enterprise Community Finance. 

“We’re creating long-term stability for whānau in an area with high housing need, demonstrating what can be achieved when iwi and government work in partnership.” 

“Ngāpuhi is delivering on its plan to provide homes for its people. Together, we’re creating warm homes, local jobs, and opportunities that will last across generations,” Mr Potaka says.

Infrastructure work is underway and expected to finish this year, whilst the whole development project is expected to be finished in 2027.
