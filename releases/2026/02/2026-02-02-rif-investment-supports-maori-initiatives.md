The Government is investing $6.25 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to kick-start two horticulture developments on underutilised land, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka say.

“This infrastructure investment will bring collectively owned Māori land into productive use in Northland and Waikato. It will strengthen local horticulture supply chains and accelerate an iwi-led shift in land use,” Mr Jones says.

The two initiatives being funded are: 

- Ngā Pūriri Pūmau – a kiwifruit development in Te Tai Tokerau, to be delivered by Oromahoe and Rangihamama Omapere trusts, will receive a $4m loan and $200,000 grant.
- Ngāti Hauā Horticulture – a horticulture development in Waikato, to be delivered by Ngāti Hauā, will receive a $2.05m repayable grant.

Ngā Puriri Pūmau will be supported by the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) through funding orchard preparation and infrastructure including irrigation systems, drainage, access tracks, orchard structures, and shelter belts. 

“With a total project value of $20.7 million, the RIF’s $4.2 million contribution has unlocked major local co-investment from Ngāpuhi Investment fund Tupu Tonu, and other key players in the local horticulture sector,” 

“This opportunity transforms underutilised land into high value horticulture and delivers long-term economic benefits for whānau in Te Tai Tokerau,” Mr Jones says.

The project will create around 10 FTE jobs during construction, nine permanent jobs and ongoing seasonal work.

The Ngāti Hauā horticulture project will bring nine whānau owned land blocks, totalling more than 90 hectares into commercial production, growing asparagus, strawberries, and blueberries. The RIF funding will build essential infrastructure, expand packhouse capacity, and support the first crop plantings.

The project will create around 11 jobs during construction, five permanent jobs, and up to 30 seasonal horticulture and post-harvest jobs. 

“This project is helping build a sustainable horticulture industry to support whānau for generations in Waikato,” Mr Potaka says.

The project has a total cost of $5.1m and is supported by co-funding from investors and joint venture‑ partners in Peria LP under the Ngāti Hauā Iwi Trust, alongside the RIF contribution. 

“These initiatives show what is possible when iwi leadership and government support align behind a shared vision. They are delivering productive whenua Māori, stronger regional economies, and opportunities that will outlast this generation, and support generations to come,” Mr Potaka says.
