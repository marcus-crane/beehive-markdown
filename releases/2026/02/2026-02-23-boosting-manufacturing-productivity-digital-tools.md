The Government is expanding a successful University of Auckland programme that helps manufacturers adopt new technologies, boosting productivity and building skills across their workforce.

“In an increasingly digital world, overseas competitors are reaping the rewards of greater automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and cloud computing,” Small Business and Manufacturing Minister Chris Penk says.

“New Zealand manufacturers need these tools and technologies to sharpen their competitive edge, but some are held back by cost or concerns about disrupting their operations, especially where in-house technical expertise is limited.

“That’s why the Government has committed to a three-year funding package to expand the Digital Manufacturing Light programme, supporting businesses to work smarter, run more smoothly and face future challenges with confidence.

“The expansion will see the programme rolled out to support at least 180 small and medium‑sized manufacturers in Auckland and parts of Waikato, Northland and the Bay of Plenty, where around 55 per cent of New Zealand’s manufacturers are located. 

“Digital Manufacturing Light uses low-cost, off-the-shelf technologies and open-source software to help manufacturers introduce new systems into their existing operations without the need for major capital investment or complex infrastructure.

“Businesses taking part in the programme receive a tailored assessment of their needs, help choosing the right solutions, hands-on installation assistance, and training to ensure the new technology delivers real value on the factory floor.

“A key strength of Digital Manufacturing Light is that it works closely with manufacturers and their own technical staff, building the digital skills into the business that will support sustainable, long-term improvements. 

“Digital Manufacturing Light will support manufacturers to move away from manual and often outdated processes, providing real-time insights into machine performance, bottlenecks, and quality issues. 

“The potential benefits are significant. Research from Xero and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research shows that faster digital adoption across small and medium‑sized enterprises could lift national GDP by $8.6 billion. 

“The Government is fixing the basics and building the future for New Zealand. Backing programmes like Digital Manufacturing Light is a smart, targeted investment that helps smaller firms grow, innovate, and contribute to our economy and communities.”

- The Digital Manufacturing Light pilot has been run as a joint project between the University of Auckland and Auckland Council.
- The programme is adapted from the United Kingdom’s ‘Digital Manufacturing on a Shoestring’ programme developed by the [Institute for Manufacturing (IfM) at the University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/).
- From 1 April 2026 funding of up to $475,000 per year will be utilised to facilitate expanding DM Light.
