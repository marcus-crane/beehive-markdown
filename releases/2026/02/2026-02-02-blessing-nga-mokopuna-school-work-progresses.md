Work is set to proceed on the significant redevelopment of a Kaupapa Māori kura in Wellington following the whakatō mauri event at Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngā Mokopuna this morning, Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“Today is a significant milestone and one that many people have been waiting a long time for. It is a pleasure to attend this milestone event and join Ngā Mokopuna and the community to celebrate the redevelopment of their kura,” Ms Stanford says.

“In May 2025, I approved the redevelopment project for Ngā Mokopuna which will see much-needed, major renewals carried out for the kura teaching and learning spaces. 

Ngā Mokopuna is one of three kura across Wellington, Hutt Valley, and Porirua and the redevelopment will ensure that Ngā Mokopuna has the facilities moving forward to match its growing roll and future aspirations.”

The school’s redevelopment includes the replacement of existing classrooms with two new teaching blocks, providing a total of 16 classrooms. 

Work is now moving from enabling works to full construction of classrooms, due to be completed in Term 2, 2027. Construction of a new gym will follow.

“Investing in schools and building for the future is a priority for this Government – every child deserves to learn in warm, dry, safe, and modern classrooms,” Ms Stanford says.

“The Ngā Mokopuna redevelopment has been long deserved and overdue – I am delighted for the community and pleased that an upgrade has been delivered that will support their tamariki to flourish.” 

Construction has been supported through a $50 million investment in Budget 2025 to deliver up to 50 classrooms for Māori Medium and Kaupapa Māori Education. 

Last year, the Government also prioritised Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Hawaiki Hou in Gisborne from within a former bank site.

This infrastructure work is part of a wider programme of investment in Māori Medium and Kaupapa Māori Education.

This includes:

- $10 million to launch a new Virtual Learning Network (VLN) for STEM education (Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics).
- $4.5 million to develop comprehensive new te reo matatini and STEM curriculum resources and teacher supports.
- $2.1 million to develop a new Māori Studies subject for Years 11–13.
- $14 million into training and support for up to 51,000 teachers/kaiako.
- $4.8 million to appoint seven new curriculum advisors for Māori medium and Kaupapa Māori Education.
- $4.1 million to support the sustainability and data capability of the Kōhanga Reo Network.
- $3.5 million to support WAI 3310 Waitangi Tribunal Education Services and Outcomes Kaupapa Inquiry.
