The Government is investing in a suite of events from the Bay of Islands to Tekapo, as part of its $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package.

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says the events announced today span sports, food, culture and innovation, providing something for everyone and creating unforgettable experiences that will drive strong economic benefits nationwide.

“From the thrill of the Solo Trans-Tasman yacht race in Opua to world-class culinary experiences in Wellington, dazzling Matariki celebrations in Rotorua, the Deaf International Basketball Federation World 3x3 Cup in Auckland and epic running festivals in Tekapo and the Nelson Tasman region, these events showcase the best of New Zealand and promise unforgettable experiences for locals and visitors alike,” Louise Upston says.

“We’re supporting events running from May to December, adding vibrancy to our towns and cities and giving visitors even more reasons to choose New Zealand.

“While many are existing events, investment will support new elements and attract more participants and international visitors.

“These events don’t just entertain – they drive economic growth. Accommodation fills up, restaurants thrive, and tills ring in our local shops. 

“Tourism is critical to our economy, and these investments will help attract visitors and strengthen our reputation as a world-class destination for culture, sport and entertainment.”

Louise Upston made the announcement at Wellington restaurant Glou Glou, where she heard first-hand about the Visa Wellington on a Plate chefs collaboration and culinary exchange which aim to attract high-spending food travellers. 

The Government has invested more than $3.2 million in this latest tranche of funding, with further announcements expected in coming weeks and months.

“We’re setting the stage for an extraordinary year. These events will bring vibrancy to our regions, showcase our unique culture and landscapes, and deliver lasting benefits for communities and businesses across New Zealand,” Louise Upston says.
