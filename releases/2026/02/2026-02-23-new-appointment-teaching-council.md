Education Minister Erica Stanford has today announced the appointment of Debbie Francis to the Teaching Council board, providing a valuable addition as the organisation undergoes significant change.

“Ms Francis is a highly respected operator with strong, extensive experience in organisational change and strategy. She has led various change programmes across both the public and private sectors,” Ms Stanford says.

“The Teaching Council has been identified as having a number of serious, pressing issues that need to be resolved in order for it to fulfil its roles effectively and enable trust and confidence heading into the future.

“Ms Francis has shown that she has a strong, clear understanding of changes that need to happen, as outlined in her own report. I have full confidence that she will be a valuable contributor on the recently refreshed board.

“I am pleased to welcome Ms Francis to the role. I am glad that her expertise will join the board as they work to restore the Teaching Council to a position where it is able to operate and serve teachers, children, and the sector, brilliantly.”

Ms Francis was lead partner for the PwC People and Change practice and head of the PwC central government practice. She was also Chief Executive at the 

New Zealand Correspondence School, Deputy Chief Executive for UCOL, and the Director of Strategy and Futures at Lincoln University. She holds a Masters in Public Policy.
