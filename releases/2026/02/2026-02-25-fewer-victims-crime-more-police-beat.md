A tough on crime approach and a near doubling of police foot patrols have driven a huge drop in the number of victims of violent crime since this Government was elected, figures show.

The latest New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey shows there were 49,000 fewer victims of violent crime in the year to October 2025 than two years previously.

“Since day one, we’ve been working tirelessly to restore real consequences for crime, and to place victims back at the centre of the justice system,” Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“We have reformed the sentencing regime so those who cause the most harm are imprisoned for longer, given Police effective tools to deal with gangs, stopped taxpayer funding for the proliferation of cultural reports, made stalking an illegal and jailable offence, given victims of sexual assault the power to determine if offenders are granted name suppression, restored Three Strikes, and much more.”

“A higher visibility of Police in our communities goes a long way to deterring crime and keeping criminals off our streets,” Police Minister Mark Mitchell says.

“It is no coincidence that our back-to-basics approach to policing is having a positive effect on reducing violent crime. Backing our frontline has seen more Police out on the beat, with foot patrols almost doubling since coming into Government.   

“Our investment into the frontline has seen 12 new and expanded beat teams stood up nationwide, including the launch of a beat team in Hamilton this week.

“Our beat officers do an outstanding job at keeping the public, businesses and retailers safe. 

“We know there is a lot more to do but these results show we are heading in the right direction.”

“It’s very encouraging to see we’re continuing to track ahead of our violent crime reduction target, with there now being 49,000 fewer victims of serious violent crime than when we came into Government,” Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“The latest figures show 136,000 New Zealanders were victims of violent crime in the 12 months to October 2025. This huge drop in the number of people affected by violent crime is fantastic progress but our work is far from over.

“Our Government remains committed to restoring the basics in law and order and building a future where New Zealanders can feel safe in their communities.

“This is going to be another busy year. We just announced plans to provide police with the power to issue move-on orders to deal with disorderly behaviour. Our Crimes Amendment Bill is making its way through the house, and legislation to strengthen trespass laws will soon be introduced.”

Children’s Minister Karen Chhour says Oranga Tamariki figures show there has been a 22 per cent drop in serious repeat youth offending compared with when the Government came into office.

“This is well ahead of our target of a 15 per cent drop before 2030,” she says.

“We promised to fix what matters to New Zealanders. Ram raids are down 85 per cent. Kiwis are no longer being expected to live in fear that their cars have been stolen and used by young offenders in a ram raid of our local small businesses.

“Young offenders are avoiding re-offending because they know Courts, Oranga Tamariki and Police are working together more closely. They know now that their actions will have consequences.”
