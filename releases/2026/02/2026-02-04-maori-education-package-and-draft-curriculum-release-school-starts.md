As the draft curriculum in te reo Māori is released for Term 1, Education Minister Erica Stanford is announcing a set of Māori education resources and the launch of a new te reo Māori training programme for 50,000 teachers.

Local MP Grant McCullum was thrilled to host Minister Stanford across three Northland schools showcasing the excellent work of educators in Northland in both full immersion settings, at Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Kaikohe, and mainstream settings at Kerikeri High School, Oromahoe School and Blomfield Special Schools. 

While on school visits, Minister Stanford announced the launch of the new te reo professional learning development programme Te Ataarangi, alongside iwi leaders and esteemed Māori language revitalisation expert, Dr Ruakere Hond. 

“We are firmly committed to properly resourcing our bilingual education system and supporting Māori students to thrive across both English and Māori-medium settings,” Ms Stanford says.

The suite of supports and resources announced included:

- **New te reo Māori language training for 50,000 teachers nationwide**  
  A new digitally available programme, funded through Budget 25, will give teachers right across the country practical support to increase their capability in te reo Māori, suitable for everyday classroom teaching. The optional programme includes tutorials, videos, and self‑paced modules available from Term 2, 2026. Registrations start in Term 1.
- **Kia Rangatira Te Reo**   
  A refreshed and relaunched resource supporting advanced te reo Māori learning in wharekura and secondary settings which has been endorsed by the original author, Ta Tīmoti Kāretu.  The resource is a Māori language text book to support teaching vocabulary, grammar and comprehension.
- **New Ngā Āhuatanga Reo language handbook**  
  A new linguistic handbook for teachers supporting clearer, more structured language teaching for students in Years 4–8. It supports explicit teaching of knowledge essential for Te Reo Rangatira along with consistent, high‑quality language instruction. This will be available from Term 1, Week 3.
- **Seven new classroom texts for Te Reo Rangatira and STEM**  
  From Week 3, Term 1, wharekura will receive seven new text sets supporting Te Reo Rangatira and STEM teaching. Online teaching resources will follow Term 2. These resources bring together mātauranga Māori, advanced language and literacy, and scientific content in ways that reflect Wharekura learning needs. They are intended to help strengthen Māori-medium pathways for opportunities in emerging sectors.
- **New Pāngarau (Maths) products**  
  New hands‑on Pāngarau resources for Years 0–8 will be rolled out to kura from Term 1, with more following in Term 2. These new resources will give ākonga tools to explore mathematical ideas in ways that build conceptual understanding and confidence and are aligned with the new curriculum and the science of learning.
- **Release of Te Marautanga o Aotearoa** a major milestone in the curriculum work programme, delivering a refreshed curriculum for nine subjects for use and sector feedback.

“We’re providing students with the strong learning foundations they need to succeed and backing teachers with practical tools and investment,” Ms Stanford says.

These initiatives were announced as part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to investing in te reo Māori and strengthening kaupapa Māori pathways for students. They reflect progress against the Government’s Māori Education Action Plan and have been supported by Budget 25 investments.

“The redesign of Te Marautanga o Aotearoa provides a knowledge-rich, year-by-year curriculum in te reo Māori that is culturally grounded and aligns with evidence and science around learning, so that teachers know what to teach and have resources to support their work.” 

Ms Stanford was also pleased to visit schools where the Government has made school property investments, supporting redevelopments and growing school rolls.

“This week, I was honoured to be at the dawn blessing at Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngā Mokopuna in Wellington as their significant redevelopment moves ahead.

“Today, I’ve had the opportunity to visit Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngāringaomatariki in Wellsford to follow up on the investment into their school property we made last year at Matariki. I have also visited Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Kaikohe, where we are delivering four classrooms to help with their roll growth.

“I am delighted to have been able to announce significant investment into our education system to raise achievement for tamariki Māori.”
