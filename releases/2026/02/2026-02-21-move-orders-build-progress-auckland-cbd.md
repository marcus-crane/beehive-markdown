New move-on powers for Police, announced today, are a key part of the Government's action plan to create a thriving Auckland city centre, Auckland Minister Simeon Brown says.

"Move-on orders give Police an important tool to address antisocial behaviour that makes people feel unsafe. When people are intimidating others, blocking doorways, or engaging in threatening behaviour, Police need the ability to act.

"These powers build on the work already underway through our city centre action plan announced last year and will help restore confidence that Auckland's CBD is a safe, welcoming, and vibrant place for families, workers and visitors.

“Auckland’s city centre is a vital part of New Zealand’s economy, contributing around 8 percent of our GDP and serving as the gateway to our tourism sector. Ensuring the CBD is safe and welcoming for those who live, work, and visit is essential.”

The city centre action plan is already seeing good progress in making the city centre safer and more welcoming. 

- 146 people have been placed into housing through our Housing First initiative by the end of January – up from 33 when the plan was announced in November last year.
- Crime victimisations have fallen from 1,010 in January 2024 to 638 in December 2025, with a new Police Station opened in the CBD last year and Police increasingly on the beat.

“Our approach balances support with accountability. We’re helping those who need housing and mental health services, while taking firm action against behaviour that intimidates others.

“Auckland Council has also made good progress improving city centre safety, including redesigning Pocket Park to reduce anti-social behaviour, and ensuring street lighting and cameras cross the CBD are operational to support Police.

“Our city centre has never been more important. The International Convention Centre has recently opened, the City Rail Link opens this year, and cruise ships are bringing thousands of visitors into Auckland. 

“I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the progress we’ve seen so far – from frontline Police and outreach workers to council staff and community groups. While we’re heading in the right direction, there’s still more work to do to ensure Auckland’s city centre is a place where everyone feels safe and welcome.

“Our Government is backing Auckland to succeed.”
