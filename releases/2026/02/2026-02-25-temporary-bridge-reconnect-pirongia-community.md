A temporary bridge is expected to be in place on State Highway 39 by mid‑March, reconnecting the community south of Pirongia after the Mangati Bridge was destroyed in heavy floods, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Since the floods on 13 February, NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) , its contractors and consultants have moved at pace to restore access for south of Pirongia.

“A plan is now in place to install a 40‑metre steel‑framed temporary bridge slightly upstream of the existing two‑lane bridge. The bridge will have a 50‑tonne weight limit, with traffic managed by temporary traffic lights.

“Crews have already cleared tonnes of debris from the site, allowing specialist teams to begin work on both the temporary bridge and the permanent replacement. Council partners and landowners have recognised the urgency of this work and supported it every step of the way.

“We expect the Acrow (Bailey‑style) temporary bridge to be operational by mid‑March, subject to fine weather. The approaches are currently under construction, and assembly of the bridge on site is expected to take around four days.

“Work is also underway on accelerated design and procurement so construction of the new permanent two‑lane bridge can begin later this year. 

“Restoring access safely and as quickly as possible is the priority, and I want to thank everyone involved for the extraordinary effort to reconnect this community.”
