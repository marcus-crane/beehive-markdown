An updated Code of Conduct will strengthen integrity across the Public Sector, Public Service Minister Judith Collins says.

“New Zealanders expect the people that serve them to act with the highest integrity, accountability and professionalism,” Ms Collins says.

“The new *Code of Conduct for the Public Sector* resets those expectations and provides clear guidance to public servants.”

The Code is based around the public service values and builds on existing expectations about integrity and conduct. It also introduces new standards to address key findings from the 2025 *Public Service Census,* including merit-based appointments, workplace culture and respectful behaviour.

“Integrity requires strong leadership, sound judgement, and workplace cultures where people feel safe to speak up and do what is right – especially when no one is watching,” Ms Collins said.

“To support this, the Public Service Commission is introducing required training on the updated Code of Conduct and General Election Guidance – which covers how public servants must act before, during, and after an election.

“We’re fixing the basics so New Zealanders have a system that is not only effective, but exemplary – one that consistently serves the public interest and appropriately uses the powers entrusted to it.” 

The updated *Code of Conduct for the Public Sector* is now available on the Public Service Commission [website](https://www.publicservice.govt.nz/guidance/the-code-of-conduct-for-the-public-sector). Integrity learning resources will be available on the Leadership Development Centre in March 2026, when the Code takes effect.
