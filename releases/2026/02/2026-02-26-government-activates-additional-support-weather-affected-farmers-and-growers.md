The Government has classified recent weather events in the Bay of Plenty, Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, and Canterbury as a medium-scale adverse event. This enables additional support for farmers and growers in the affected regions who continue to face weather-related challenges.

“The effects of these weather events continue to be felt in these regions. Today’s announcement unlocks extra support, including tax relief, and it enables the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to consider Rural Assistance Payments and activating Enhanced Taskforce Green for affected farmers and growers,” Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been working closely with local groups to identify the most affected farmers and where support is needed most, including through on-farm assessments.”

Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson is encouraging farmers and growers to seek support if they need it.

“It’s important we help those farmers, growers, and rural communities now facing a lengthy clean-up.

“Farmers and growers needing assistance are encouraged to contact the Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254,” Mr Patterson says.
