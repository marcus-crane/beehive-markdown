Associate Health Minister Matt Doocey has welcomed the ratification of a new collective agreement for dietitians employed by Health New Zealand, following a successful vote by members of the Association of Professional and Executive Employees (APEX).

“I’m pleased for the dietitians across the country that will benefit from this agreement, which recognises the important contribution they make to supporting the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders,” Mr Doocey says.

Around 50 dietitians will receive a 2.5 per cent salary increase in the first year and a further 2 per cent increase in the second year of the 24-month term.

The agreement also provides for increased professional membership contributions and other enhancements to the collective terms and conditions.

“This ratification follows the recent approval of collective agreements for APEX Pharmacy, APEX Psychologists, and PSA Allied, Public Health, Scientific and Technical members, reflecting continued momentum in settling workforce agreements across the health sector. I acknowledge Health New Zealand and union representatives for their work in reaching these outcomes.”
