Climate Change Minister Simon Watts has announced the appointment of Stuart Calman as New Zealand’s Climate Change Ambassador.

“I am pleased to welcome Stuart to this role, given his expertise in foreign policy, trade and development, along with strong climate policy experience,” Mr Watts says.

“Stuart brings an excellent understanding of opportunities for enhanced cooperation with the Pacific and Southeast Asia. A particular focus in 2026 will be supporting Australia in its role as chair of the UN Climate COP31 negotiations, in partnership with the Pacific. Stuart’s expertise will be beneficial in supporting New Zealand’s economic, trade, and climate goals.”

Mr Calman is a senior diplomat who served as New Zealand’s Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) based in Jakarta from 2022-24. He has held leadership roles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade with a focus on energy, climate resilience and sustainable economic development in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Prior to joining the Ministry in 2013, Mr Calman held management roles in the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Economic Development, responsible for climate change, energy and environmental policy.

Mr Calman studied Business, Economics and Development at Massey University and his whakapapa includes Ngāti Toa, Raukawa ki te Tonga and Kāi Tahu. He will take up his new, Wellington-based role effective immediately, replacing Stuart Horne who has taken up the role of New Zealand Consul-General in Honolulu. 

Mr Calman’s appointment as Climate Change Ambassador starts on Monday 16 February 2026.
