Construction is now underway on a rapid‑build inpatient ward at Nelson Hospital, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The 28‑bed ward will allow services to be relocated while major redevelopment work progresses at Nelson Hospital, including seismic strengthening of existing buildings,” Mr Brown says.

The project involves around four months of off‑site construction alongside approximately six months of on‑site works.

“Running these stages in parallel accelerates delivery, maintains high quality standards, and limits disruption to daily hospital operations.

“Once operational, the ward will boost inpatient capacity, easing current bed pressures and improving patient flow while Nelson’s permanent inpatient building is completed.”

The Nelson ward is the next step in the rollout of five rapid‑build wards being delivered nationwide through the Government’s accelerated hospital wards programme. With Hawke’s Bay already underway, the programme is focused on quickly increasing inpatient capacity and improving patient flow, supported by a $90 million Budget 2025 allocation that will add 140 new beds across key hospitals next year.

“These rapid‑build wards can be delivered more quickly and at lower cost than traditional builds, enabling us to expand hospital capacity where demand is greatest. Off‑site construction allows faster delivery, better cost control, reduced disruption for hospitals, and earlier benefits for patients and staff.

“Investing in modern, purpose‑built infrastructure is about supporting better care and ensuring patients remain at the centre of every decision. This new ward will strengthen services across Nelson Marlborough and help ensure people can access the care they need, close to home,” Mr Brown says.
