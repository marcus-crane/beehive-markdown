The Government is delivering for the rapidly growing communities of North-West Auckland, with land now prioritised and earmarked for a much-needed new secondary school in Kumeū, Education Minister Erica Stanford says. 

“This Government is delivering for growth communities and acting now to support families with the schools they need. Protecting land through the Resource Management Act 1991 for a new Kumeū high school is a major milestone for North West Auckland,” Ms Stanford says. 

“This decision is part of a broader programme of delivery that is getting results. Through careful stewardship of public funds and a relentless focus on value for money, we are delivering more school property than ever before.” 

Ms Stanford says the Government has fundamentally changed how school property is delivered. 

“We have halved the cost of building a standard classroom while maintaining quality. That has allowed us to build 187 more classrooms, announce and fund 14 new schools and expansions, and purchase land for five future schools.

“In just two years, we have also invested nearly twice as much in school property maintenance as was spent in the six years prior. This is building for the future, spending wisely and delivering more for communities. 

Ms Stanford says initiating the designation of land for a Kumeū high school reflects forward planning in one of New Zealand’s fastest growing areas. 

“Before Christmas I initiated the process, and a Notice of Requirement (NoR) has been lodged with Auckland Council. The Council is now reviewing the NoR, which is subject to statutory timelines. 

“The land is adjacent to Huapai District School, and I look forward to providing an update later this year.” 

Local MP for Kaipara ki Mahurangi, Chris Penk, welcomed the announcement, saying it delivers on longstanding advocacy for the area. 

“I have long advocated for a new high school in North-West Auckland, both while in opposition and now in government, because I know how important this is for local families,” Mr Penk says. 

“This is a growing community that needs certainty, and I am delighted that we are now delivering for my constituents. Designating the site for a Kumeū secondary school is a significant step forward.” 

Ms Stanford says more school property announcements are expected this year. 

“We are building for the future and making smart investments today so communities have the schools they need tomorrow.”

- Designations are used to facilitate the future education needs of growing communities. Lodging a Notice of Requirement is an important step to signal to the community that planning for their children’s educational needs is moving ahead.
