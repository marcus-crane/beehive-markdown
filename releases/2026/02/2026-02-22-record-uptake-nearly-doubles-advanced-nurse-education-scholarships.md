A record 235 primary care registered nurses will begin advanced education this year – nearly doubling the number originally planned – following strong demand for the Government’s new Registered Nurse Primary Care Scholarships, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Last year we committed to supporting up to 120 primary care registered nurses each year over four years to undertake advanced education. The very high level of demand has shown how strongly nurses want to take up these opportunities, which is why I’m pleased to confirm 235 scholarships have been awarded for this year, with placements beginning from next week,” Mr Brown says.

“This is the highest number of primary care nurses ever supported into advanced education in a single year.”

Of the 235 registered nurses currently working in primary and community healthcare settings, 147 will work towards a Postgraduate Diploma in Prescribing and 88 will undertake a Master of Nursing. The expansion has been achieved within existing funding.

“Nurses who complete these qualifications can become registered nurse prescribers, working as part of collaborative healthcare teams and prescribing from an approved list of medicines. Many will continue along the pathway to become nurse practitioners.”

Mr Brown says this additional training capacity comes at an important time following the recent expansion of prescribing rights announced in December.

“Nurse prescribers can now prescribe 211 additional medicines – covering a wide range of common and long-term conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, respiratory conditions, and menopause symptoms. As more nurses gain these advanced qualifications, patients will see real benefits through faster, more convenient access to care closer to home.

“Growing the number of nurse prescribers is a practical way to improve access to care, particularly for patients who rely on regular, ongoing treatment. Enabling nurses to work at the top of their scope helps reduce pressure on GPs and hospitals and ensures more patients can be seen sooner.

“New Zealand registered nurses already deliver exceptional care in communities across the country. Empowering more of them to prescribe will help build a more responsive and sustainable health system, while strengthening the pipeline into future nurse practitioner roles.

“I want to congratulate every nurse who has taken up this opportunity. Choosing to continue your training while serving your community is a significant commitment, and it reflects the dedication you have to improving care for New Zealanders. Thank you for the vital role you play in supporting patients, families, and communities across the country.”
