The Government is urging people to put safety first, as it gets behind North Island communities facing another period of severe weather, less than one month after the tragic storms of last month and three years since Cyclone Gabrielle struck in 2023.

Severe weather warnings are in place in many parts of the North Island, and flooding has tragically already claimed one life last night in South Waikato. 

Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery, Mark Mitchell, says the Government is doing everything it can to support communities, many of whom are still recovering from last month’s storms.

“Emergency services and Government agencies are working together to support locally-led response efforts, and NZDF, Fire and Emergency, Police, St Johns, and Health NZ have assets pre-positioned in Tairawhiti” says Mr Mitchell. 

“We are getting in behind local Civil Defence as they face another gruelling response, and the Government is ready to surge in assistance to anywhere that needs it.

“What’s most important right now is that you keep yourself and your loved ones safe.  Take these warnings seriously and don’t take any chances.

“Never drive, walk, or swim through floodwaters. If waters rise around you, don’t wait for an alert – get to higher ground immediately.

“If you’re under a severe weather warning, avoid non-essential travel, as driving conditions will be hazardous.

“We are tragically all too aware of the risks that landslides pose. Stay alert for the warning signs and get out if you don’t feel safe.  

“A number of Emergency Mobile Alerts have been issued, but please stay informed through a range of channels - your local Civil Defence Group, MetService, NZTA and radio.”
