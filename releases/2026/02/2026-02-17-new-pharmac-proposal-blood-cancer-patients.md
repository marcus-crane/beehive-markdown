Associate Health Minister David Seymour and Health Minister Simeon Brown welcome Pharmac’s proposal to fund two new combination therapies for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a type of blood cancer.

“Improving access to cancer medication in New Zealand is important to cancer patients, and their families. That’s why it has been a focus of this Government,” Mr Seymour says.

Pharmac is proposing to fund venetoclax with ibrutinib, and venetoclax with obinutuzumab, as first line treatments from 1 May 2026.

“Pharmac heard from the Blood Cancer community and from clinical advisors that venetoclax with ibrutinib or obinutuzumab will make a big difference for people with CLL, especially when used at the beginning of treatment,” Mr Seymour says.

“While CLL isn’t curable, the right treatment means patients can live longer more fulfilling lives. Venetoclax with ibrutinib or obinutuzumab will help patients achieve longer lasting remission, and avoid the need for traditional chemotherapy. Two of these medicines will be available in pill form, which don’t require an IV drip and could mean fewer hospital visits

“Obinutuzumab will be the second cancer medicine available in private clinics. When Pharmac fund a new cancer treatment, people already paying for that treatment privately are forced to make a very difficult choice: spend their savings to continue private treatment undisrupted, or transfer to a public hospital. Patients told Pharmac the latter was hugely disruptive and caused significant stress during an immensely difficult period.

“People currently paying privately for these combinations could receive funded treatment in a private hospital, provided they met the funding criteria at the time they began treatment.”

Mr Brown says the Government is committed to improving treatment and care for New Zealanders with cancer, including blood cancer.

“That’s why this Government has funded seven new cancer medicines that target blood cancer through Pharmac’s $604 million investment – expanding treatment options for patients and their families.

“This announcement means more Kiwis with blood cancer will have access to medicines that improve their quality of life and help them live longer, fuller lives.

“We are also significantly expanding stem cell transplant services for patients with blood cancers and related conditions, helping more people access critical, life-saving treatment sooner.

“Alongside investment in new medicines, our Faster Cancer Treatment target, and wider efforts to strengthen cancer services, we are focused on improving access, reducing delays, and ensuring people get the treatment they need, when they need it.”
