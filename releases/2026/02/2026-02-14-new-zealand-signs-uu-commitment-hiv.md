New Zealand has signed the global Call-to-Action on Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U), sending a strong signal of our commitment to ending HIV transmission and ensuring people living with HIV can lead healthy lives free from stigma and discrimination, Associate Health Minister Matt Doocey says.

“U=U is a clear, evidence-based principle that when someone living with HIV is on effective treatment and maintains an undetectable viral load, they cannot transmit HIV sexually,” Mr Doocey says.

“By signing this Call-to-Action, we are reinforcing U=U as a core part of New Zealand’s HIV response. Increasing awareness helps reduce stigma, encourages testing, supports earlier access to treatment, and strengthens prevention and long-term health outcomes.”

The Call-to-Action encourages countries to embed U=U within HIV guidelines and strategies, improve equitable access to testing and treatment, support community-led initiatives, and strengthen public understanding.

“Endorsing U=U aligns with New Zealand’s National HIV Action Plan, which sets out our goal of eliminating local HIV transmission by 2030 and addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination.

“While treatment uptake and viral suppression rates are strong, it is clear stigma remains a significant barrier for many people. This commitment sends a clear message that discrimination has no place in New Zealand.”

Mr Doocey acknowledged the many advocates, community organisations and people with lived experience of HIV who have long called for New Zealand to formally endorse U=U.

“This milestone reflects years of dedicated advocacy and leadership from communities most affected by HIV. We thank those with lived experience who have shared their stories and challenged stigma. These voices have been instrumental in driving change.”

New Zealand is the fifth country to join the Call-to-Action. In addition, more than 1,100 organisations across 106 countries have signed on to share the U=U message with their communities.

This builds on the significant progress that has been made in recent years, including reductions in locally acquired HIV infections, increased uptake of combination prevention measures, and expanded testing options.

 **Notes to editor:**

- New Zealand joins Canada, the United States, Vietnam and Australia in signing the Call‑to-Action.
- The move is supported by findings from the latest HIV Monitoring Report, which highlighted ongoing progress in New Zealand’s HIV response. This included 98.5% of people diagnosed with HIV on treatment, and 91.7% achieving viral suppression.
