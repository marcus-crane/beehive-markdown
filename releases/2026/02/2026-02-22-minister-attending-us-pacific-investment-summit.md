Customs Minister Casey Costello will travel to Honolulu this week to represent New Zealand at the United States’ Pacific Agenda: Investment, Security, and Shared Prosperity Summit.

“The Summit is an important opportunity for New Zealand to strengthen partnerships that support the Pacific’s long‑term prosperity and resilience,” Ms Costello says.

“Stronger economic connections, resilient infrastructure, and increased investment are central to lifting incomes, growing jobs, combatting transnational organised crime, and supporting communities. These benefits extend across our region, where shared prosperity depends on collaboration and trusted long‑term partnerships.”

Hosted by the United States Government, the Summit will bring together a number of Pacific leaders, senior US officials, and private‑sector investors to discuss reducing barriers to investment, accelerating project readiness, and connecting capital with opportunities across the Pacific.

The inclusion of all Pacific Islands Forum member countries at the Summit reflects the central role of the Forum in regional cooperation. New Zealand welcomes this initiative by the United States, a Forum Dialogue Partner, as an important contribution to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.

“Meeting US private‑sector organisations will also help identify opportunities for investment in priority sectors, including commercial partnerships that complement regional initiatives such as PACER Plus, an [comprehensive agreement](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&rct=j&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beehive.govt.nz%2Frelease%2Fminister-state-trade-heads-brisbane-pacer-plus-meeting&ved=2ahUKEwiEsJiVpeKSAxX3SWwGHWZfBOEQy_kOegQIAxAF&opi=89978449&cd&psig=AOvVaw1yIisy98MRUBwU02LlPOcP&ust=1771478328375000) aimed at fostering sustainable economic development in the Pacific,” Ms Costello says.

“New Zealand remains committed to supporting a resilient, prosperous Pacific. Our success as neighbours, partners and family is closely interconnected — and strong economic and investment cooperation is key to our shared well‑being.”

The Summit takes place on 23 and 24 February.
