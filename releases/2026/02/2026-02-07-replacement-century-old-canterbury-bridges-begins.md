The replacement of two century-old South Canterbury bridges will provide safer and more reliable travel on an important inland route, Associate Transport and South Island Minister James Meager says.

Work to remove State Highway 82’s existing Waihao North River and Elephant Hill Stream bridges starts tomorrow, with replacements expected to take about 12 months to construct.

“The condition of these two-lane bridges has reached a point where it is now more cost-effective to replace them than continuing to maintain them,” Mr Meager says.

“Once these end-of-life bridges are removed, modern replacements will then be built to provide safer crossings and assurance to those travelling on SH82. This highway corridor provides important access to popular destinations such as the Canterbury Lakes, the Mackenzie District and Central Otago.

“It also offers the only convenient alternative route to State Highway 1 for people travelling north and south of the Waitaki River.

“The new bridges will also have no load restrictions, which will make life easier for freight companies and help improve productivity across the South Island.”

“I’m thrilled this important infrastructure is being replaced. These new bridges will go a long way in building resilience to our local transport network,” Waitaki MP Miles Anderson says.

“This investment is another example of our Government’s commitment to fixing the basics and building the future, by helping to ensure our people and goods can safely and reliably get from A to B,” Mr Meager says.

**Notes to Editor:** 

•            The total projected construction costs of each bridge replacement (including contingencies) are as follows:

o           Waihao North River Bridge replacement – $14 million

o           Elephant Hill Stream Bridge replacement – $5.7 million

•            Early/enabling works have been carried out in preparation for the start of work deconstructing the existing bridges. 

•            Due to their close proximity, both bridge replacements are being delivered at the same time, by HEB Construction.

•            Temporary bridges installed at both bridge sites (one Acrow model, and another Bailey model) will allow traffic to continue to flow while the new bridges are constructed. 

•            These two new bridges in South Canterbury are part of the 11 structures included in NZTAs End of Life Bridge Replacement Programme. 

•            NZTA’s bridge replacement programme is prioritised nationally by assessing whether replacement in the short term represents better value than continued maintenance over the medium to long term. This assessment includes the age, condition, and structural performance of individual bridges, and how these factors influence future deterioration, risk, and maintenance requirements.
