Health Minister Simeon Brown is encouraging New Zealanders to use Valentine’s Day as a reminder to look after their own heart health, as well as the people they care about.

“Valentine’s Day is about connection and care, and that starts with looking after yourself. Making time for your heart health is one of the most meaningful gifts you can give the people who love you.

“Heart disease and stroke remain two of the biggest health challenges facing New Zealanders. The good news is that many of the risks are preventable, and even small, positive changes can protect your health for years to come.

“A good place to start is understanding your personal risk. A simple conversation with your GP or nurse about a heart and diabetes check can help identify your risk of a heart attack or stroke, and support early action to keep you well and active for longer.”

New Zealanders can also use the Heart Foundation’s free online heart health assessment at myheartcheck.org.nz to get an indication of their heart health.

“Everyday habits, built into normal life, also make a lasting difference. Regular physical activity helps lower blood pressure, supports a healthy weight, and lifts overall wellbeing. Even a gentle walk is a great place to start, and it’s even better when you do it with family, friends, or someone you love.

“If you smoke, quitting is one of the most important steps you can take for your heart and your future. Support is available, and you don’t have to go through it alone.”

Free support to stop smoking is available through Health New Zealand at [https://info.health.nz/keeping-healthy/activity-diet/quitting-smoking](https://info.health.nz/keeping-healthy/activity-diet/quitting-smoking).

Mr Brown says the Government is focused on prevention and making sure people can get help early.

“We’re backing efforts to reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease, and we’re strengthening access to diagnostics so conditions can be picked up sooner and treated faster.

“Looking after your heart means more healthy time with the people who matter most – and that’s something worth celebrating this Valentine’s Day.”
