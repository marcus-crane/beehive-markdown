Regulations bringing clarity and consistency to the management of methamphetamine contamination in rental properties have now been publicly Gazetted and will take effect from 16 April 2026, Associate Minister of Housing Tama Potaka says.

“For too long, landlords and tenants have faced confusion, inconsistent testing practices, and, at times, disproportionate responses. These regulations set clear, evidence-based thresholds and processes so everyone knows where they stand,” Mr Potaka says.

Under the new rules, a rental property will be deemed contaminated if methamphetamine residue exceeds 15µg/100cm² and must be decontaminated to at or below that level. Where residue exceeds 30µg/100cm², landlords and tenants will have the option of ending the tenancy quickly. In defined circumstances where there is evidence of contamination, landlords will be required to engage professional testers, with testing and decontamination aligned to key elements of New Zealand Standard 8510:2017.

The regulations are informed by expert advice, including from the New Zealand Institute for Public Health and Forensic Science and former Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor Sir Peter Gluckman. They take a precautionary but pragmatic approach, protecting tenants’ health while avoiding unnecessary costs for landlords.

“With the regulations now Gazetted and coming into force on 16 April, the sector has certainty and clearer rules to follow,” Mr Potaka says.

Guidance will be available through MBIE’s Tenancy Services website.
