Foreign Minister Winston Peters has welcomed Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey on her first official visit to New Zealand today. 

“The Commonwealth plays an important role in bringing countries together around shared values,” Mr Peters says. 

“New Zealand welcomes the Secretary-General’s engagement in the Pacific and her focus on reform, and we look forward to continued engagement on priorities of mutual interest.” 

In their talks in Auckland, Mr Peters emphasised New Zealand’s support for a Commonwealth that is effective, accountable, and focused on its core strengths, including democracy, good governance, human rights, and the rule of law. 

Discussions also focused on the Secretary-General’s ambitious reform agenda and the importance of initiatives such as the Apia Commonwealth Ocean Declaration in delivering tangible impacts for small states, including the Pacific.
