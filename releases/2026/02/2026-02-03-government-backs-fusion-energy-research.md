The Government is investing up to $35 million through the Regional Infrastructure Fund to help local start-up OpenStar Technologies position New Zealand at the forefront of the global research into fusion energy.

Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says the loan will support the creation of a specialised facility for OpenStar’s next fusion machine.

“The successful development of fusion is the holy grail of energy production. It could be a game-changer for this country’s energy security, economy and environment,” Mr Jones says.

Fusion energy is an emerging technology that seeks to replicate the process

powering the Sun by fusing light atoms into a larger atom, releasing a vast

amount of carbon-free energy.

“New Zealand’s OpenStar Technologies, led by Dr Ratu Mataira,  is one of more than 50 companies worldwide competing to deliver a breakthrough in fusion energy. OpenStar is developing a different design approach to its competitors which offers advantages in stability, cost and scalability,” Mr Jones says. 

“Over a century ago, New Zealand scientist Ernest Rutherford pioneered nuclear science. Today we are backing New Zealanders to lead the next big breakthrough in harnessing fusion energy, a technology that could deliver significant benefits for our country and the world.

“The Government’s substantial investment in the project will help anchor a bespoke fusion energy research and development facility in New Zealand.

“It will also enable OpenStar to scale up its research and development programme, helping to attract international investment and creating high-value jobs here in New Zealand.

“The project has the potential to uncover spinoff applications for the aerospace and medical technology sectors. These could potentially have enormous benefits in the medium term, while the technology further evolves towards the ultimate goal of delivering fusion energy.

“This funding supports infrastructure that drives economic growth, fosters innovation, boosts productivity and strengthens energy security,” Mr Jones says.
