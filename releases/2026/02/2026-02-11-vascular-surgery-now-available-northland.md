Northlanders will now be able to access key vascular surgery procedures at Whangārei Hospital, marking an important step in improving access to essential specialist care in the region.

“People in Northland who need renal fistula surgery or varicose vein treatment will now be able to receive that care closer to where they live, without having to travel to Auckland,” Mr Brown says. 

“Travelling for treatment can be stressful and disruptive for patients and their families, and providing these procedures locally is a practical step that will make a real difference.”

The new service builds on the vascular outpatient clinics and nurse specialist support that Auckland-based teams have provided for some time. While specialist teams have regularly travelled north to support patients, until now surgery itself could only be completed in Auckland.

“Delivering these procedures monthly at Whangārei Hospital is the next stage in strengthening the vascular service for Northlanders.

“It expands on the longstanding support provided by visiting vascular teams and reflects a commitment to ensuring more care is delivered as close to home as possible.”

Clinical nurse specialists have also been recruited to coordinate care, provide pre- operative and post operative support, and ensure patients have a seamless experience across both local and visiting services.

“Improving access to quality health services in regional and rural New Zealand is a priority for the Government. Strengthening services in places like Northland is an important part of fixing the basics and building a health system that works better for patients across the country,” Mr Brown says.
