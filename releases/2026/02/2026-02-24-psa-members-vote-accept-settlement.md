Health Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed the successful ratification of a new collective agreement covering Allied, Public Health, Scientific and Technical (APHST) members represented by the Public Service Association (PSA).

“I am pleased for the approximately 12,300 workers employed by Health New Zealand nationwide who will benefit from this agreement. Allied, public health, scientific and technical professionals play a critical role in patient care, and this settlement acknowledges their important contribution to the healthcare system.”

Around 12,300 employees will receive a 2.5 per cent pay increase in year one and a further 2 per cent in year two, as well as a $500 lump sum payment.

The agreement also introduces a new pay scale for Sterile Sciences Technicians and establishes a $400,000 national professional development fund to support ongoing training and career progression.

“This ratification follows the recent approval of collective agreements for APEX Pharmacy and APEX Psychologists members, continuing progress on workforce settlements across the health sector. I want to acknowledge Health New Zealand and the unions for their work as these agreements are reached.”
