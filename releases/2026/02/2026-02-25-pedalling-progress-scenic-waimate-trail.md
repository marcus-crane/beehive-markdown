The Government is investing $200,000 in the Waimate Trail as part of its ongoing commitment to grow local tourism, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston announced today.

“I’m thrilled to be partnering locally and investing in this trail that showcases the unique South Canterbury countryside. It will attract more visitors to the region, supporting local businesses, jobs and communities,” Louise Upston says.

This funding will complete stage one of the trail, a 13km stretch from Waimate to Waihao Forks and is part of the Government’s $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package. 

The local community has already raised around 80 per cent of the funding needed to complete stage one of the 67km trail, which traverses limestone rock formations, native forest, and scenic valleys.

“This trail will be popular with both locals and tourists celebrating South Canterbury’s rich history and stunning landscapes. 

“By backing local projects and encouraging tourism in the regions, we’re continuing to drive economic growth,” Louise Upston says.
