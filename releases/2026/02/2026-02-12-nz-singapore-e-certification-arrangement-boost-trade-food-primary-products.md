New Zealand and Singapore have signed a new electronic certification arrangement that will streamline trade and reduce costs, Trade and Investment, and Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says.

Export health certification confirms products meet the importing country’s regulatory requirements, including in animal or plant health, hygiene, and food safety.

The current paper-based system will be replaced by the new arrangement which enables real-time digital exchange of export health certification between New Zealand and Singapore for trade in food and primary products.

“It will streamline border processes, improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance supply chain security and integrity, and help products clear borders and reach markets sooner,” Mr McClay says.

“Singapore is one of our closest trade partners, and last year we marked 60 years of diplomatic ties between our countries. The new arrangement speaks to the strength of this relationship and will enable trade growth.

“It also progresses us towards New Zealand’s aspirational goal of doubling the value of exports in 10 years. This Government is focused on building the future and delivering prosperity for New Zealanders.”

New Zealand’s food and primary product exports to Singapore reached $1.2 billion in the year to 30 November 2025.

The arrangement, signed in Singapore, forms part of New Zealand’s and Singapore’s Joint Plan of Action under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
