More than 1,700 pet bonds have now been lodged with Tenancy Services since the pet bond system started on 1 December 2025, Housing Minister Chris Bishop and Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka say.

“Pets are part of the family for many Kiwi households, so it’s great to see such a pawsitive response, with 1,708 pet bonds now lodged,” Mr Bishop says.

“The pet bond system is a practical way to make it easier for renters with pets to find a home, while giving landlords confidence there are clear protections in place. It’s a reform that is working as intended, without any ruff edges.”

Mr Potaka says the milestone shows the changes are striking the right balance.

“This is about giving renters a fair shot at keeping a pet, while making sure landlords have a clear and reliable process. It’s encouraging to see the system landing well and getting tails wagging,” Mr Potaka says.

Pet bonds can be lodged and managed through Tenancy Services, alongside the general bond, and are available where a landlord agrees to a tenant keeping a pet.

The pet bond rules include:

- Tenants must have the landlord’s consent to keep a pet, but landlords can only withhold consent on reasonable grounds.
- Landlords may require a pet bond of up to two weeks’ rent, in addition to the existing general tenancy bond.
- Tenants are liable for all pet‑related damage to properties beyond fair wear and tear.
- Tenancy Services enables lodgment, top‑ups and refunds of pet bonds and provides updated guidance and forms.

“Our Government is focused on a rental market that works for everyone -young renters, whanau, and the people providing homes,” Mr Potaka says.
