Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has welcomed the official opening of the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC), the country’s largest conference, exhibition and entertainment venue, describing it as a significant milestone.

“Today’s grand opening of this multi-purpose convention space is a game changer for New Zealand’s capacity to host world‑class events,” Louise Upston says.

“The opportunities this venue creates for New Zealand’s tourism and hospitality sector are enormous, whether it be hosting large international conferences, national ceremonies or local events.

“The NZICC strengthens our ability to attract major conventions and events, showcasing the very best of New Zealand to the world. With capacity for more than 4,000 attendees, the NZICC is an incredible space designed not only for business, but for a wide range of cultural events and activities.

“This is a huge moment for New Zealand, helping attract more international visitors to our shores and giving a significant boost to our economy.”

Located in the heart of Auckland, the NZICC has been designed to support large‑scale conventions and events, incorporating state‑of‑the‑art technology, flexible meeting spaces, and sustainable design features intended to serve both domestic and global audiences.

To date, more than 120 events have been confirmed for 2026, including two of Australasia’s largest association conferences – The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO).

“The strong pipeline of events NZICC already has confirmed means more job opportunities for our people in the tourism and hospitality sector,” Louise Upston says.

“I can’t wait to see the first conferences and concerts filling these spaces, putting New Zealand firmly on the map as a go-to-destination.

“New Zealand is open for business – and we’re ready to welcome many more visitors in 2026 and beyond.”

The New Zealand International Convention Centre is owned by SkyCity Entertainment Group, operating in partnership with the New Zealand Government.
