New Zealand has consistently condemned Iran’s nuclear programme, its destabilising activities in the region and elsewhere, and its repression of its own people. 

Iran has, for decades, defied the will and expectations of the international community. The legitimacy of a government rests on the support of its people. The Iranian regime has long since lost that support.

In this context, we acknowledge that the actions taken overnight by the US and Israel were designed to prevent Iran from continuing to threaten international peace and security.  

We condemn in the strongest terms Iran’s indiscriminate retaliatory attacks on Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Jordan.  We cannot risk further regional escalation, and civilian life must be protected.   

We join the international community in hoping this crisis ends as quickly as possible.

We call for a resumption of negotiations and adherence to international law - and we urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution that returns Iran to the community of nations. 

Our thoughts go out to all those affected by the conflict, and to the New Zealand families who are understandably worried about their loved ones in the region. 

We recognise too the courage of the Iranian people who have taken to the streets in recent weeks to demand change, only to be met by violence and murder.  The Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future.

New Zealand Embassies in the region are closely monitoring the situation and will continue to provide support to New Zealanders.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises New Zealanders in the region to shelter in place.  New Zealanders should follow the advice of local authorities and register on SafeTravel. 

New Zealanders requiring urgent consular assistance should call the New Zealand 24/7 Consular Emergency Line on +64 99 20 20 20.
