A major investment into Greymouth and Westport ports will boost coastal shipping and stimulate economic growth across the West Coast, Associate Transport and South Island Minister James Meager says.

The $5.3 million funding comprises of $4.3m for upgrades to the Port of Greymouth, and $1m for a regional safety programme to be shared with Westport Port. 

Crown funding stems from the Coastal Shipping Resilience Fund, with the Grey District and West Coast Regional Councils co-investing an additional $671,200 for both projects.

“Greymouth is the West Coast’s largest port but currently has limited ability to berth larger coastal shipping vessels due to the main freight wharf’s poor condition. Major works are required for it to accommodate freight traffic increases, which is essential if we want to grow the region’s economy,” Mr Meager says.

“This will include the reconstruction of up to 80 metres of currently unusable wharf to allow loading and unloading of cargo vessels. A roll-on, roll-off facility will also be built, to enable front loading craft to move large equipment and freight with ease.

“The upgrade will significantly increase the region’s resilience when completed in early 2028. It will create a much-needed avenue for essential supplies and equipment to be delivered by sea, in the event of a disaster which cuts off road and rail links.

“Additionally, a shared Regional Harbour Master programme will be established for both ports, alongside upgraded navigational aids. This will support commercial shipping’s return to Greymouth and ensure the longevity of both ports’ operations.”

West Coast-Tasman MP Maureen Pugh has welcomed investment, calling it an opportunity to grow the coastal shipping industry and tidy up the harbour.

“This is yet another investment into crucial infrastructure for the West Coast and reflects our commitment to fixing the basics and building the future,” Ms Pugh says.

 

**Notes to Editor:**

•            The Coastal Shipping Resilience Fund was established through the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2024. The $30 million fund invests in projects which enhance the sector’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from events that could disrupt New Zealand’s freight system.

•            This is the second confirmed recipient of the fund, following a recent investment in Eastland Port.

•            Installation of improved navigational aids is expected by the end of 2026, while a shared Regional Harbour Master programme is expected to be in place by the end of 2027.
