Education Minister Erica Stanford has welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations to renew the Primary Principals’ (NZEI Te Riu Roa) Collective Agreement. On 24 February, a ballot with members of the NZEI returned a majority vote to ratify the PPCA settlement, which covers around 1,300 primary principals.

“Primary principals play a key role in our schools and in the teaching workforce. They are dedicated and passionate about lifting educational achievement, and their leadership must be recognised during this important reform programme,” Ms Stanford says.

“Principals lead schools through major sector reforms and deliver on educational priorities, while playing an important role in their local communities. Their leadership is valued.” 

Under the settlement terms, primary principals receive a cumulative 2.5 percent immediately, plus 2.1 percent in 12 months. The settlement introduces a $15,000 Curriculum Change Allowance paid over the term of the agreement to recognise their work to lead the implementation programme. 

The Leadership in Literacy and Numeracy base payment will additionally increase to $10,000 per year over the term of the agreement, as well as other increases and new allowances.   

“The settlement delivers meaningful improvements to primary principal pay and conditions. It reflects shared priorities, with a firm commitment to leading implementation of the new curriculum and lifting educational outcomes for our students.” 

“I thank the Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche for seeing these negotiations through to a successful conclusion. The settlement represents a positive outcome for primary principals covered by the agreement.”
