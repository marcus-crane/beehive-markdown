Long-term tourism concessions that will support jobs, strengthen regional economies, and keep visitor access open at key South Island destinations have been announced by Conservation Minister Tama Potaka.

The decisions include a 38-year concession for The Remarkables Ski Area, and a 30-year guided walking concession on the Milford Track and a 25-year concession for Te Ana-au Caves in Fiordland Te Rua o te Moko. 

“My focus is supporting jobs and regional economies.

“Long-term concessions give operators the certainty they need to invest, train staff, and plan ahead,” Mr Potaka says.

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says the decisions provide important confidence for the tourism sector and the regional economies that depend on it.

“Tourism supports thousands of jobs across the South Island. Giving operators long-term certainty helps businesses invest, retain staff, and deliver high-quality experiences for visitors, while supporting local communities,” Ms Upston says.

A 38-year concession has been issued to NZSki for The Remarkables, supporting jobs across Queenstown visitor economy, including hundreds of roles and local businesses. Public access to surrounding areas will continue.

In Fiordland Te Rua o te Moko, a 30-year guided walking concession for Tourism Milford Limited (Ultimate Hikes) will allow guided walking on the Milford Track to continue long term, supporting jobs across transport, accommodation and tourism services.

“These decisions strike the right balance of protecting our natural environment, supporting regional livelihoods, and ensuring people can continue to enjoy these places safely and responsibly,” Mr Potaka says.

These concessions include enforceable environmental and safety conditions, with the Department retaining full regulatory oversight.
