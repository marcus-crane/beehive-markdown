Innovative Kiwi drones will be trialled by the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) to strengthen capability while growing local industry, Defence Minister Judith Collins announced today.  

“We’re partnering with New Zealand businesses to ensure the Defence Force can protect our people into the future,” Ms Collins says.

“NZDF will buy and trial advanced uncrewed systems from New Zealand company Syos Aerospace, enabling access to mission-ready, combat proven technology.

“We’re further backing Kiwi businesses by bringing together Sysdoc for training support and Hirtenberger Defence Technology for advanced systems support.”

“This will inform future capability decisions on a technology that has rapidly become central to modern military operations.

Delivery of air, land, and sea drones will occur over the coming months, including the SG400 Uncrewed Ground Vehicle, the SM300 Uncrewed Surface Vessel, the SA2 ISR drone and the SA7 one way effector drone. 

The Army and Navy will conduct trials in a range of scenarios, such as transporting supplies, performing maritime patrols, and completing route reconnaissance.

“Last year we announced our Defence Industry Strategy, which details how Defence and industry will work together to deliver the Defence Capability Plan while building a strong, resilient industry that delivers economic growth and grows our export markets,” Ms Collins says.

“Having cutting-edge drone technology developed and supported by local businesses will reduce supply chain risk and strengthen our resilience – exactly what the strategy is designed for. 

“In an increasingly contested world, we’re building the future by equipping our Defence Force with innovative Kiwi products to keep our people safe.”

**Notes to editor:**

- **Syos Aerospace:** Founded four years ago in Mount Maunganui and now a world-recognised innovator in uncrewed systems, Syos won the 2025 NZ Hi-Tech Company of the Year award. By partnering with Syos, the NZDF is plugging into a fast-moving technology company whose products are combat tested. For instance, Syos drones and USVs have already seen operational use in the conflict in Ukraine
- **Sysdoc:** A New Zealand consulting firm specialising in learning development and digital training solutions. Sysdoc has a long track record with the NZDF (15+ years, 100+ projects) in modernising training and documentation. Sysdoc will design learning and training materials for the new systems.
- **Hirtenberger Defence Technology (HDT) Ltd:** This company is known for things like advanced fire control systems, including mortar targeting software. The NZDF is exploring integration of the new drones with Hirtenberger’s Arcfire, a Fire Control System, designed and built in New Zealand, and the NZDF battle management system.
