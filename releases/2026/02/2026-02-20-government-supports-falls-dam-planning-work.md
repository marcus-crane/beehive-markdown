The Government is investing in the future resilience of Central Otago’s primary industries with a $2 million Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) loan to support pre‑construction work on the proposed replacement of Falls Dam near St Bathans.

Associate Regional Development Minister Mark Patterson says the funding will enable work on assessing options for replacing the 90-year-old dam.

“Falls Dam is a critical piece of regional water infrastructure, supporting around 8,000 hectares of productive land across horticulture, viticulture, and sheep and beef farming,” Mr Patterson says.

“The dam is nearing the end of its life and is already failing to deliver enough irrigation during dry years. This pre‑construction programme will ensure the region has the information it needs to plan for a secure and sustainable water future.”

The loan recipient, Manuherikia River Limited (MRL), will use the funding to confirm regulatory requirements, consenting, engineering and detailed design, procurement, construction costs, and financing options. MRL will contribute $2 million in co-funding towards the pre‑construction programme.

“A reliable water supply is fundamental to Central Otago’s economic resilience. A new Falls Dam would provide dependable water for farms and rural communities, improve our climate resilience by storing winter and spring flows, and support farm conversions to higher‑value land uses like horticulture and viticulture,” Mr Patterson says.

“I look forward to seeing the outcome of this pre-construction programme, which all going to plan will set the region on a strong path for the future,” Mr Patterson says.

The pre‑construction phase is expected to take around two years to complete.
