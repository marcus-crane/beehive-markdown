New Zealand’s ability to support communities following natural disasters and other major emergencies will be improved by an investment into a key coastal bulk ship upgrade, Associate Transport Minister James Meager says.

The Rangitata, which was vital in delivering disaster relief after Cyclone Gabrielle, will receive $3 million from the Coastal Shipping Resilience Fund to improve its ability to carry different types of cargo across a wider range of ports.

“The ship was a major asset for Gisborne and Napier, carrying containers between the two when major road links were washed out. This summer’s tragic storms have again underscored how important this infrastructure is,” Mr Meager says.

“When land routes fail, coastal shipping becomes critical for making sure fuel, building materials and other vital supplies can still get to those in need.”

The investment will fund a material handler for the ship, a piece of deck-mounted machinery that can load and unload bulk cargo, to be operational by the end of 2026.

“This will mean the Rangitata can transport a wider range of bulk items and operate without relying on port-side cranes and infrastructure, facilities which may not be usable after a significant event,” Mr Meager says.

“The ship can access smaller ports which are particularly vulnerable during natural disasters, including those where road and rail connections can be cut-off for long periods. It can deliver bulk supplies directly to communities which may have been isolated for days.

“Another key advantage is the material handler is powered directly from the ship, rather than from land, so it remains available wherever the vessel is deployed.

“We are a Government dedicated to fixing the basics, delivering results, and building the future. That’s exactly what this investment does. It will strengthen our country’s resilience and improve our ability to bounce back from devastating natural events.”
