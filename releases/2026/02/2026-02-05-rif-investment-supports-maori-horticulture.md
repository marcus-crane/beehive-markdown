Government investment in two horticulture developments on underutilised Māori land will unlock economic potential in Northland and Waikato, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka say.

“These Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) investments will bring collectively owned Māori land into productive use in these regions. They will strengthen local horticulture supply chains and accelerate a shift in land use,” Mr Jones says.

The two initiatives being funded are: 

- The Mid-North Kiwifruit Project – a kiwifruit development in Te Tai Tokerau, to be delivered by Oromahoe and Rangihamama Omapere trusts - will receive a $4m loan and $200,000 grant.
- Ngāti Hauā Horticulture – a horticulture development in Waikato, to be delivered by Ngāti Hauā - will receive a $2.05m repayable grant.

The Mid-North Kiwifruit Project will use its funding for orchard preparation and infrastructure including irrigation, drainage, access tracks, orchard structures and shelter belts. 

“With a total project value of $20.7 million, the RIF’s $4.2 million contribution has unlocked major local co-investment from key players in the local horticulture sector,” Mr Potaka says.

“This opportunity transforms underutilised land into high value horticulture and delivers long-term economic benefits for whānau in Te Tai Tokerau.” 

The Ngāti Hauā horticulture project will bring nine whānau-owned land blocks, totalling more than 90ha, into commercial production, growing asparagus, strawberries and blueberries. The RIF funding will be used to build infrastructure, expand packhouse capacity and support the first crop plantings.

“This project is helping build a sustainable horticulture industry to support whānau for generations in Waikato,” Mr Jones says.

The project has a total cost of $5.1m and has co-funding from investors and joint venture partners Peria LP under the Ngāti Hauā Iwi Trust. 

“These initiatives show what is possible when iwi leadership and government support align behind a shared vision. They are delivering productive whenua Māori, stronger regional economies and generational opportunities,” Mr Potaka says.
