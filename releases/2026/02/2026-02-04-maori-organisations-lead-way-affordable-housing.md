One year on from the Government’s $200 million investment to accelerate new affordable rental housing for whānau Māori, hundreds of homes are now moving from planning into delivery on the ground, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

“Since the investment was announced, 463 homes have been approved across 11 Māori-led housing projects, with 392 homes now contracted for delivery. Momentum is building, with over 260 homes already progressing through consents, infrastructure works and earthworks,” says Mr Potaka.

All of the homes are located in priority regions with high housing need, Te Tai Tokerau, Ikaroa–Rāwhiti, Tāmaki Makaurau, Waiariki, Te Tai Hauāuru and Hauraki–Waikato, helping to increase the supply of affordable rentals where it is needed most.

“Partnering with Māori housing providers is a practical way to address housing deprivation while building long-term housing capacity.

“This mahi is getting more homes built and into communities, while backing Māori organisations to lead delivery for their own whānau. These organisations understand their whenua, their people and the long-term needs of their communities.

“By increasing the supply of stable, affordable rental housing, we’re supporting better outcomes for whānau and Tamariki, and because these homes will be retained as affordable rentals for at least 25 years, this is an enduring investment in Māori housing.”

The three largest programmes supported through the funding include:

- Toitū Tairāwhiti Housing Limited, delivering 150 homes across Ikaroa–Rāwhiti
- Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi, delivering 100 homes across Kaikohe
- Ngāti Whakaue Tribal Lands, delivering 80 homes in Rotorua

Homes are being delivered progressively, with construction continuing across multiple sites and further projects in the pipeline for approval.

“The progress in Māori-led affordable housing reflects the Government’s broader focus on fixing the housing system and enabling long-term supply.

“Alongside this work, the Government is focused on unlocking land for housing, supporting infrastructure, and reducing the barriers and costs that slow down building.

“One year on, the progress we’re seeing in Māori-led housing highlights what can be achieved when we focus on delivery, by fixing the immediate shortages while building a stronger foundation for the future. That approach will continue as we work to make it easier to build the homes New Zealand needs to support economic growth and future prosperity.”
