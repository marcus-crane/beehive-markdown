Midwives are now able to offer a wider range of funded immunisations, supporting families from pregnancy through the early months of a child’s life, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“In addition to providing pregnancy vaccines, midwives will now be able to administer funded vaccines to mothers after birth, babies, and eligible family members until the baby is 12 months old,” Mr Brown says.

“This change will improve access to vaccination for expectant mothers, new parents, infants, and close family members, helping to ensure timely protection against vaccine‑preventable diseases.”

In August last year, community midwives became funded to deliver antenatal immunisations to pregnant women. This expansion builds on that progress.

“Midwives are trusted health professionals who see families regularly during pregnancy and after birth. Extending the vaccines they can provide gives mothers and babies more opportunities to get the protection they need, when they need it.

“Providing these vaccinations as part of routine maternity care reduces barriers and makes it easier for families to stay up to date.

“This broader access is particularly important during outbreaks such as measles and the pertussis epidemic. Infants are most at risk from these illnesses, so making vaccination more accessible helps protect newborns and prevent serious disease.”

Health New Zealand, the Ministry of Health, the Midwifery Council, the New Zealand College of Midwives, and the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) are working together to deliver this initiative.

“Immunisation remains the best protection. By supporting midwives to offer a wider range of funded immunisations, we are making it easier for families to access essential healthcare and ensuring more Kiwis are protected from preventable illness,” Mr Brown says.
