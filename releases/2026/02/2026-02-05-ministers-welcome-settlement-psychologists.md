Health Minister Simeon Brown and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey have welcomed the ratification of a new collective agreement for psychologists employed by Health New Zealand, following a vote by members of the Association of Professional and Executive Employees (APEX).

“I’m pleased for the approximately 670 psychologists nationwide who will benefit from this agreement. It recognises the skill, dedication, and professionalism of psychologists who care for patients and their families every day,” Mr Brown says.

“Just as importantly, it provides greater certainty for the workforce and supports the vital role psychologists play in delivering services to people and communities across the country.”

Around 670 psychologists will receive pay increases of 2.5 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent in the second year, over a 24-month term starting in January 2026.

The agreement also strengthens professional pathways, with expanded development opportunities and a new salary step to recognise senior expertise across the profession.

“Our psychologists support Kiwis at some of the most challenging moments in their lives. By supporting this important workforce, we’re helping ensure patients remain at the centre of the health system and can access safe, timely, and quality mental health care,” Mr Doocey says.
