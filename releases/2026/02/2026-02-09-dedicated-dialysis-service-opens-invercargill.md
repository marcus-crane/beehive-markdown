Southland’s new dialysis unit has officially opened, improving access to life-saving treatment for patients across Invercargill and the wider Southland region, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“The opening of this new unit at Southland Hospital is a significant step forward for renal care in the South,” Mr Brown says.

“Until now, many Southlanders have had to travel to Dunedin three times a week for dialysis – a 2.5-hour journey each way. This new facility means more people can receive the care they need closer to home.”

The purpose-built unit features five haemodialysis spaces to treat outpatients and eligible inpatients from across the hospital, along with a dedicated area for peritoneal dialysis training and follow-up care.

“In time, the unit will also support training for patients who wish to undertake home haemodialysis, giving people greater independence and flexibility in managing their treatment.”

Previously, dialysis services in Invercargill were delivered from a space originally intended as an ‘away-from-home’ facility for visitors, before growing demand saw it accommodate some regular dialysis patients. 

“With demand increasing, a fit-for-purpose dialysis service in Southland became essential. This new unit increases the number of dialysis chairs from two to five, improving access for patients.”

Initially, the expanded service is expected to support six to eight haemodialysis patients each week, with numbers projected to grow over the next six months.

“For patients and their families, dialysis isn’t just a treatment - it’s part of everyday life. Being able to receive that care locally reduces stress, keeps people connected to family and community, and supports better long-term health.

“This new facility is about making sure Southlanders can receive the care they need, closer to home,” Mr Brown says.
