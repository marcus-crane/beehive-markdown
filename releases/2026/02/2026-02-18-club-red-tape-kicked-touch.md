Sports clubs, RSAs and other community clubs are set to benefit from changes allowing them to choose between a club licence or an on-licence for serving alcohol, Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced today.

“Clubs are the backbone of local communities. They’re run by volunteers, they host local events, and they bring people together. But the current law limits what they can do and who they can serve alcohol to,” says Mrs McKee.

“At the moment, clubs can only serve alcohol to their members and their members’ guests. 

“That effectively stops them from hosting events for non-members such as fundraisers, birthdays, community events, or even simply letting locals enjoy a drink after a big sports game.

“These events represent significant revenue opportunities for clubs, but unless they apply for a special licence every time, they’re forced to turn people away. Those people, and their money, often just end up somewhere else anyway to no benefit of the club.

“This change gives clubs real choice. They can keep their club licence if it suits them, or they can apply for an on-licence and serve the wider public under the same rules as bars and restaurants – including having a trained duty manager on site whenever alcohol is being served.

“With greater freedom to host events, attract more customers, and grow revenue, clubs will be better placed to keep fees low for members, fund travel for sports teams, upgrade facilities, and invest in new equipment. These are real, tangible benefits that flow straight back into local communities.

“Opening clubs up to the wider public also means the community can enjoy facilities they currently can’t access. Many clubs have fantastic spaces – great clubrooms, well-run bars, and affordable hospitality. This reform means more New Zealanders will finally be able to enjoy them without all the red tape.”
