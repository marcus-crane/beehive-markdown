Health Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed the ratification of a new collective agreement for pharmacists employed by Health New Zealand, following a vote by members of the Association of Professionals & Executive Employees (APEX).

“I’m pleased for the approximately 300 pharmacists nationwide who will benefit from this agreement. It recognises the valuable work they do and the high level of skill and care they provide to patients and their families each day,” Mr Brown says.

“Importantly, it also helps provide greater stability for the workforce and supports the essential role pharmacists play in delivering services across our health system.”

The agreement also includes uplifts to professional membership contributions and other improvements to the collective agreement.

“This is another step toward building a more stable and supported pharmacy workforce that can continue delivering timely, quality care for New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.
