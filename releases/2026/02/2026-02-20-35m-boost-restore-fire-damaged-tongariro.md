The Government is investing $3.5 million in the restoration of 3000-plus hectares of Tongariro National Park destroyed by two major fires last year, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

“Tongariro is a Dual World Heritage site, a taonga, and a cornerstone of the Ruapehu District economy. The fires have damaged biodiversity, disrupted recreation, and affected the livelihoods of families and businesses across Ruapehu District,” Mr Potaka says.

“That is why we are investing $3.5m from the International Visitor Levy (IVL) over five years to fund weed control, pest management and biodiversity monitoring. 

“The IVL ensures visitor revenue goes back into maintaining and improving the places that support local jobs, businesses and communities.”

Ngāti Hikairo ki Tongariro is working alongside DOC to deliver Maunga Ora, a restoration plan based on science, tikanga and mātauranga Māori.

“Recovery is already visible, with native plants pushing through the charred ground. But without sustained weed control and pest management, including managing deer, that regeneration will be at risk,” Mr Potaka says.

“I want to acknowledge the commitment of Ngāti Hikairo ki Tongariro, DOC staff and the wider Ruapehu community who have been working on the ground since the fires. Their partnership is critical to restoring the mauri of this sacred landscape.

“The investment restores ecological resilience while backing the regional economy and people who depend on it.

“Tongariro is our taonga and restoring its mauri is essential. That’s why the Government is working to secure its long-term future.”
