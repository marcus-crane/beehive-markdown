Science, Innovation and Technology and Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti will visit India this week to attend the flagship artificial intelligence (AI) Impact Summit, strengthening international AI partnerships and unlocking opportunities for New Zealand. The theme for the summit is ‘AI for People, Planet and Progress’.

“Attendance at this summit ensures New Zealand has a seat at the table, along with senior international Ministers and officials, to help shape global AI standards, while providing opportunities to strengthen international partnerships and drive economic growth,” Dr Reti says.

“As highlighted in the New Zealand AI Strategy, AI has enormous potential to lift productivity and grow our economy, with some estimates predicting that generative AI alone could add $76 billion, around 15 per cent of GDP, by 2038.

“Our government is focused on unlocking economic opportunity through AI adoption, while ensuring appropriate guardrails. That’s why we are investing up to $70 million over seven years to support innovative AI research and applications, develop world-class expertise, and sharpen New Zealand’s competitive edge.

“This visit is also a chance to strengthen our science, innovation and technology relationships and promote New Zealand as an outstanding destination for international education.

“India is a growing powerhouse in science and technology. While New Zealand already has strong links between universities and research organisations, there is significant potential for greater research collaboration between our two countries. 

“International education partnerships bring students and export earnings into New Zealand, while AI adoption will lift productivity, support higher incomes, and help drive economic growth.”

While in India, Dr Reti will attend the AI Impact summit, meet with science and education counterparts, engage with leading technology firms and undertake a range of education focused engagements. Dr Reti departs New Zealand on 14 February and returns on 21 February.
