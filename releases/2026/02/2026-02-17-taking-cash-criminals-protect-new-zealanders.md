Money seized from criminals will once again be redirected to protecting New Zealanders, with a new funding round for the Proceeds of Crime Fund opening on 30 March 2026, says Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee.

“We are taking money off criminals and using it to fix what matters for victims by reducing violent crime,” says Mrs McKee.

“Following its refocus last year, the Fund now supports tightly targeted initiatives that directly contribute to the Government’s goal of reducing the number of victims of violent crime.

“We want high-impact proposals that make a measurable difference to reducing violent crime and keeping New Zealanders safe. 

“This includes initiatives that stop lower-level offending before it turns violent, and initiatives that go after organised criminals by breaking the gang business model that profits from violence and misery.”

“Government agencies are invited to apply using the updated funding proposal template and are encouraged to partner with community organisations to deliver outcome-focused programmes.

“Under Labour, money taken from gangs was funnelled back into a programme delivered by a life member of the very gang fuelling New Zealand’s meth problem. We put an end to that. 

“New Zealanders expect that when assets are seized from organised crime, that money goes toward preventing more victims and that’s exactly what we are doing.

“We have already funded a range of initiatives to improve public safety. This includes practical safety improvements in Auckland’s CBD, such as better lighting, expanded CCTV coverage, and additional security patrols.

“We have also supported community-led initiatives such as the Meke Academy, which works with young people at high risk of serious offending in Hawke’s Bay to reduce offending, cut drug use, and help young people gain qualifications and improve literacy and numeracy skills.”

The 2026 funding round will run from 30 March to 29 May. Approved initiatives must meet strict criteria and will be short-term investments of up to three years.
