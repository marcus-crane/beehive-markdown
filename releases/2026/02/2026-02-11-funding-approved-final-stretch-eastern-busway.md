The final stretch of the Eastern Busway in Botany can now get underway, Transport Minister Chris Bishop and Auckland Minister Simeon Brown say.

“The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) and Auckland Council have confirmed $101 million in funding to build the Botany link route at Guys Reserve, meaning more efficient transport choices are on the way for Aucklanders living in Botany,” Mr Bishop says.  
“This is the final piece of the $1.4 billion Eastern Busway project. It’s a key part of Auckland’s rapid transit network, connecting East Auckland to the wider region and providing faster, more reliable journeys.

“Connecting Botany to Pakuranga and Panmure, with largely separated busways, means travel from Botany to Auckland's city centre will take a reliable 40 minutes by bus and train.

“By 2028 the Eastern Busway is forecasted to carry 18,000 passengers per day, with 24,000 passengers per day by 2048.

“Alongside the City Rail Link, which opens this year, these projects will reshape the way people get around Auckland. The already-open Panmure to Pakuranga busway is proof of how rapid transit can give people better access to jobs and opportunities across the city.”

“The Eastern Busway is a major joint investment by the Government and Auckland Council, delivering 7km of dedicated busway, five new bus stations, and the Reeves Road Flyover,” Minister Brown says.

“Completing the full busway through to Botany Town Centre is a key milestone. It will integrate with the future Airport to Botany Busway and improve public transport options for people living and working in East Auckland.

“Some claimed that removing Labour’s Regional Fuel Tax in Auckland would stop this project. We axed the tax, Aucklanders are saving money every time they fill up, and the Eastern Busway is being delivered in full. Actions speak louder than words.

“Construction on the final section will begin in March, with work continuing at pace along Tī Rākau Drive to deliver the rest of the corridor.

“I look forward to getting out on site in the coming months with Minister Bishop and Mayor Brown to mark the start of construction and see this important project moving forward for Auckland.“

**Notes to editor:**

- The Eastern Busway is delivered by an alliance of Auckland Transport with Fletcher Construction, ACCIONA, AECOM and Jacobs, in partnership with mana whenua.
- The project includes 12km of dedicated walking and cycleways, 7km of busway and 5 new stations. It will deliver wide-ranging benefits for the area, increasing access to jobs and education, and attracting investment and growth.
- In mid-February, construction along Tī Rākau Drive will move into its next milestone configuration as traffic heading towards Botany shifts temporarily onto the new busway lanes, opening up the next construction area for work to begin. As Auckland Transport continues to construct the busway along Tī Rākau Drive, two lanes will always remain open in each direction for vehicles.
- People can already use the busway between Pakūranga and Panmure Station, where they can connect to trains to the city and the south. When the City Rail Link opens in the second half of this year, people will be able to easily get to even more places on a bus and direct train such as Eden Park, New Lynn and Henderson.
- The Eastern Busway will open in 2027.
