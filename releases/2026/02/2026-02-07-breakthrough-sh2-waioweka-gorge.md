After three weeks of intensive work, SH2 through Waioweka Gorge will re-open to the public tomorrow Monday 9 February for single-lane controlled access, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Ever since the recent severe weather caused flooding and landslips that completely closed the gorge, NZ Transport Agency and its contractors have been working incredibly hard to re-establish this vital connection between Ōpōtiki (Eastern Bay of Plenty) and Matawai (Tairāwhiti).

“It’s difficult to overstate how big the task has been for the crews on the ground. 

“Crews have been working from both ends of the gorge, clearing massive slips, blocked culverts and widespread debris at 40 sites, including eight sites with severe damage. 

“NZTA has now confirmed one lane will open to the public for essential travel only under piloted convoy conditions at 7am tomorrow 9 February.

“This is really encouraging news, and I’d like to thank all the crews who have been working so hard to make it possible.

“There are a few very important things for locals to keep in mind, though. 

“While geotechnical investigations have confirmed that the road is safe, it’s still an active worksite, people should only travel if they must, and be prepared for the road to close at short notice if weather conditions or risk assessments change. 

“While restoring access is important, doing it safely is critical. This is a vulnerable route and NZTA is actively monitoring for any further slip movement.

“Crews will remain working on the other side of the road, clearing the remaining debris, improving drainage and opening culverts to reduce the risk of further issues. 

“I expect this stretch of SH2 will remain a worksite for some time. People should travel with extreme care and be mindful of workers on the road. Give them a friendly wave as you travel through. 

“Anyone planning to travel in the convoy is advised to allow plenty of extra time to get to the departure point. Convoys will be leaving promptly on schedule.”
