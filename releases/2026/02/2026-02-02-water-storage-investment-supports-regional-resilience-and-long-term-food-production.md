Investment through the Māori Development Fund to support early work on a proposed water storage reservoir near Kaitaia will help strengthen regional resilience and support food production, Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka says.

The project, led by Te Make Farms Ltd and owned by Ngāi Takoto, is focused on improving year-round water security in Northland, where variable weather can place pressure on land use and supply.

“Reliable water infrastructure is one of the basics that underpins productive land use, regional jobs, and food supply,” Mr Potaka says.

“That’s why the Government is focused on fixing the basics early, by supporting practical work that helps landowners plan properly and make informed decisions.” The Māori Development Fund co-investment is supporting Te Make Farms Ltd to commission technical advice and assessments, including preparatory work for a future resource consent application. 

Mr Potaka says getting the fundamentals right at the front end gives projects the best chance of delivering long-term value.

“Once a water storage facility is in place, Ngāi Takoto expects to significantly increase the amount of land in production, strengthening output and resilience while keeping the land in Māori ownership.”

The co-investment positions Te Make Farms Ltd to progress the project over time and attract further investment, with ownership and decision-making remaining with the whenua owners.
