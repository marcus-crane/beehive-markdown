Associate Education Minister David Seymour has today announced that Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei will open a charter school called Te Kura o Ngāti Whātua ki Tamaki in Term 3 2026.

“Every child deserves the opportunity to learn and grow in ways which are more specific to their needs. Today’s announcement demonstrates the innovation enabled by the charter school model,” Mr Seymour says.

“At Te Kura o Ngāti Whātua ki Tamaki, students will participate in real-world learning through iwi-led and city based partnerships. This will include collaborations with Māori businesses, partnerships with universities and tertiary education providers, and international school exchanges.

“Learning will be digitally enabled, utilising AI and emerging technologies. It will also strengthen cultural ties through kapa haka and Ngāti Whātua tikanga.

“When it comes to education, one size does not fit all.

“Charter schools show education can be different if we let communities bring their ideas to the table.

“These schools have more flexibility in return for strictly measured results.

“The charter school equation is: the same funding as state schools, plus greater flexibility plus stricter accountability for results, equals student success.

“It will join the charter schools announced in the last year which will open in 2026. This takes the total number of charter schools to 20. We expect more new charter schools to be announced before the end of the year, along with the first state schools to convert. 

“I want to thank the Charter School Agency and Authorisation Board for the work they have done getting charters open. They considered 52 applicants for new charter schools. They tell me this round the choices were very difficult. 

“This is just the beginning. I hope to see many more new charter schools opening, and state and state-integrated schools converting to become charter schools.”
