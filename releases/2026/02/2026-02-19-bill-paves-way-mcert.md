The Government has introduced legislation to Parliament to establish the new Ministry for Cities, Environment, Regions and Transport (MCERT), a key step in delivering its ambitious reform agenda across housing, transport, urban development and the environment.

The Environment (Disestablishment of the Ministry for the Environment) Amendment Bill paves the way for the Ministry for the Environment to integrate into MCERT alongside the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, the Ministry of Transport, and the local government functions of the Department of Internal Affairs.

“The new agency will be at the heart of tackling some of New Zealand’s greatest economic and environmental challenges, from housing affordability and our infrastructure deficit to climate adaptation,” RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop says.

“The Ministry for the Environment is the only agency forming MCERT that was established by statute. That means it is the only Ministry that requires legislative change to enable the new department to be created, and we are moving swiftly to make that happen.”

Environment Minister Penny Simmonds says the amendment to the Environment Act will formally disestablish the Ministry for the Environment and transfer its statutory responsibilities to the Secretary for the Environment.

“MCERT will administer the Environment Act, with its chief executive fulfilling the role of Secretary for the Environment, ensuring a seamless transition and continuity of environmental oversight.

“Environmental functions remain a core part of the new Ministry’s work. Bringing related portfolios together in one department will provide integrated, practical advice that both protects our environment and lifts prosperity for communities across New Zealand.”

MCERT is set to be established from 1 April 2026 and become operational from 1 July 2026. A chief executive for the new agency will be appointed in the coming months.
