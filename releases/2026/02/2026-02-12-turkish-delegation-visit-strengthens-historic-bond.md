The friendship forged after the Gallipoli campaign more than a century ago is stronger than ever, following an official visit by a senior Turkish delegation, Veterans Minister Chris Penk says.

The delegation comprised Mr Ömer Toraman, the Governor of Çanakkale — the province encompassing the Gallipoli Peninsula — Mr İsmail Kaşdemir, President of the Gallipoli Historical Site Directorate, and Mr Kerem Yenigün, District Governor of Eceabat.

During their time in New Zealand, the delegation met with Foreign Minister Winston Peters, laid a wreath at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, visited the popular Gallipoli exhibition at Te Papa, and met with officials.

“It was a privilege to engage with our Turkish friends once again. We greatly appreciate the time they have taken to travel across the world to New Zealand. Their visit demonstrates the strength of the bond between our two nations,” Mr Penk says.

“Our relationship, forged through shared sacrifice during the First World War, has endured and evolved across generations. Every year, many New Zealanders travel to Türkiye as a rite of passage to pay their respects on the Gallipoli Peninsula as part of Anzac Day commemorations.”

Mr Penk acknowledged the continued generosity of the Turkish Government and people in welcoming New Zealand visitors to Gallipoli.

“Honouring the sacrifice of all those who served on the Peninsula remains deeply meaningful for New Zealanders,” Mr Penk says.

“With growing instability around the world and increasing unrest, it is more important than ever to strengthen our collective resolve to uphold peace and understanding.

“The relationship between Türkiye and New Zealand stands as a remarkable example of enduring reconciliation, and a testament to mutual respect and shared values.

“We must heed the lessons of history and commit to working together for a peaceful and cooperative future that acknowledges the past.”

“While those shared sacrifices at Gallipoli will always provide a foundation for the relationship, we continue to collaborate to extend our connection in a range of other areas, including through youth engagement and cultural exchanges.”
