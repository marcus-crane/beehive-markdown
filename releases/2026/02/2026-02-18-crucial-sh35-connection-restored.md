State Highway 35 will once more connect Tairāwhiti to eastern Bay of Plenty, when it reopens at 7am tomorrow, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

It’s been three weeks since heavy rainfall and flooding caused slips above and below the road, closing the road between Pōtaka and Te Araroa isolating the communities in between.

“NZ Transport Agency crews have been working alongside local contractors since the storm at the end of last month to restore access as quickly, and safely, as possible,” Mr Bishop says.

“While there have been multiple slips along this stretch of state highway, the focus has been on two particular areas – the Waikura slip between Pōtaka and Hicks Bay, and the largest slip of all, the Punaruku slip, closer to Te Araroa.

“A quarter of a million cubic metres of rocks and soil came down in the Punaruku slip, and workers have shifted 25,000 cubic metres of it to restore access.

“Now, NZTA has confirmed the section of SH35 from Pōtaka through to Hicks Bay and around to Te Araroa will be open daily between 7am and 7pm from tomorrow morning. That means people and freight will again be able to travel all the way through to Gisborne.

“Outside those opening times, the road will close again to allow crews to continue working.

“We know how important this is for medical appointments, to replenish supplies and reconnect with family and friends.

“It’s been a tough three weeks for communities stuck in between the cordons, and while there have been limited convoys in place, the work to restore public access is no mean feat. I’d like to thank the community for their patience and support over this period, and East Coast MP Dana Kirkpatrick for her strong local advocacy.

“I’d also like to thank all the crews who have been working so hard around the clock and in all kinds of weather conditions to make this re-opening possible.

“The road may be open, but it’s still very fragile. Crews will be working on it for some time to come. People travelling through will need to remember to take extreme care - the journey will take longer, the road will be down to single lane in multiple locations, and lower speeds and traffic management will be in place

“For communities up and down SH35, the sight of hi-vis vests, hard hats and rollers has become all too common since Cyclone Gabrielle. There’s going to be more of that to come and I’m thanking people in advance for their support – it makes all the difference for the crews on the ground.”
