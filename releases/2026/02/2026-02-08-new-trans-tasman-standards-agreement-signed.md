A new agreement between Standards New Zealand and Standards Australia means improved products and opportunities for local businesses and households, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson says.

“This agreement is what this Government is all about – fixing the basics and building the future. It will make it easier to operate across New Zealand and Australia, reducing costs for businesses and improve the quality and safety of goods and services that consumers rely on every day,” Mr Simpson says.

In August 2025, Prime Minister Luxon and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese affirmed in their Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting the importance of trans-Tasman standards and ongoing partnership.

“By aligning standards and adopting trusted international rules in areas like artificial intelligence, data management and cybersecurity, New Zealanders can have greater confidence that new technologies are being used safely and responsibly.

“Reducing fees and red tape will also free up businesses to invest in innovation and growth, supporting jobs, strengthening digital trade, and helping New Zealand businesses compete internationally - delivering long-term benefits for the wider economy.”

The two national standards bodies have signed a new Standards Development and Distribution Agreement and Statement of Operating Procedures.

Mr Simpson says the agreement reaffirms the commitment to trans-Tasman standards alignment.

“It ensures our standards system reflects modern science, technology, regulatory and business practice. It’s a win for New Zealand businesses, consumers, and our economy.”

Mr Simpson commended Standards New Zealand and Standards Australia for their close cooperation and focus on economic growth.

“Harmonised standards with Australia are a priority for this Government. The standards relationship between Australia and New Zealand is internationally unique and highly-valued, having delivered significant economic benefits to both countries.

“The new agreement has support from industry stakeholders on both sides of the Tasman and lays the foundation for future joint trans-Tasman standards development with Australia.”
