Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka today congratulated the finalists for this year’s Ahuwhenua Trophy competition.

The three finalists for 2026, Mātai Pacific Iwi Collective and Otama Marere Trust which are both based in the Bay of Plenty, and Northland’s Ngāti Hine Forestry Trust, were announced at a function at Parliament today.

The trophy celebrates the vital role Māori farmers and growers play in New Zealand’s economy.

"This year’s finalists exemplify excellence in horticulture, driving growth in the food and fibre sector while creating jobs in rural communities,” Mr McClay says.

“The hard work of Māori growers and their staff will help achieve New Zealand’s aspirational goal of doubling the value of exports in 10 years, while meeting the global demand for high-quality, safe and sustainable food and fibre.”

The competition was expanded to include horticulture in 2020, recognising the growth of horticulture on whenua Māori, which has increased by 50 per cent since 2017.

“Māori orchards, such as apples and kiwifruit, and agribusinesses provide employment and vital reinvestment back into marae, papakāinga, kura, and education scholarships,” Mr Pokata says.

“The prosperity and wellbeing horticulture generates for Iwi and Māori across the motu has far reaching impacts. I tautoko the outstanding work these finalists are doing.”

Each Ahuwhenua Trophy finalist will host a field day to demonstrate their growing operations. These field days and a second round of judging will determine the overall winner. The winner will be announced on 5 June in Whangārei.
