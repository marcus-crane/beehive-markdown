Reliable, affordable electricity is on the way for a kura (school) and five marae north of Kaitaia with a grant of up to $1.26 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF), Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka announced today.

“Marae and kura often double as vital civil defence centres for locals in times of crisis. The solar power generated from this project will supply six essential community hubs with reliable, reduced cost power, improving the region’s energy security and strengthening its resilience during emergencies."

The project called Whiti Mai Te Rā is forecast to save the marae and kura more than $100,000 per year in energy costs. 

"The funding will pay for solar panels and batteries at Te Rangi Āniwaniwa Kura and at five rural marae north of Kaitaia. A diesel generator will also be installed to ensure the kura has additional power if required in a civil defence emergency. 

"The funding recipient Aupouri Ngāti Kahu Te Rarawa Trust is partnering with Northland power company Kaumātua Energy, who will install and maintain the systems and act as the electricity retailer. Kaumātua Energy will also co-fund 15 percent of the $1.48 million project."

Mr Potaka says the initiative delivers long-term value and responds directly to the needs of the community.

“Whiti Mai Te Rā will strengthen communities by improving resilience, enabling critical infrastructure, and supporting energy security. 

“The government is proud to partner this locally led solution, which will ensure essential community facilities can support people for generations to come,” Mr Potaka says.

Installation of the solar panel and batteries begins in March 2026, starting with the kura before rolling out to the five marae.
