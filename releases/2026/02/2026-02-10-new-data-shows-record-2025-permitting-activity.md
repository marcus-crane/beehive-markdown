New Zealand’s exploration and mining pipeline is strengthening, with record levels of mineral permit applications received and decided in 2025, Resources Minister Shane Jones says.

New data from New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals (NZP&M) shows the agency received 551 applications last year, up from 450 in 2024, and made 521 decisions, compared to an annual average of 363 since 2017. Of the 178 approvals for new activity, 163 related to gold.

“Nine out of 10 new permit applications granted last year targeted gold, with the South Island set to benefit most from this activity. The West Coast alone accounted for more than 40 per cent of new gold‑related approvals, reinforcing its position as one of New Zealand’s most active and enduring mining regions,” Mr Jones says.  

“What is particularly encouraging is the good spread of applications across the development lifecycle. The mix of prospecting, exploration, and mining permits reflects healthy progression through the development pipeline. Tier 2 hobby permits are being converted into the newly created Tier 3 permit class, which applies a more proportionate and fit‑for‑purpose regulatory burden to small‑scale activity.

“This demonstrates a sector that is gathering momentum and investing in New Zealand’s future. A strong exploration pipeline, coupled with a notable uplift in mining stage activity, shows companies are not only seeking new opportunities but progressing them with confidence.

“The results also highlight strong activity among mid‑sized mining projects — operations that play an important role in regional economic growth and capability building. Multiple operators advancing projects rather than a small number of large ventures dominating the landscape is positive for the sector’s resilience.”

Across the sector, 237 change applications were decided in 2025, reflecting a high level of variation and optimisation activity as operators refine work programmes and permit conditions — a clear indication of active management of mineral assets.

“What we’re seeing is a sector that is humming — investing, exploring, and planning for long-term activity. This momentum is good for regional economies, good for jobs, and good for New Zealand’s broader resource development strategy,” Mr Jones says
