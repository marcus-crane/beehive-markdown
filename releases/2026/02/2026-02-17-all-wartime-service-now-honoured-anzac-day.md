Legislation to formally recognise all those who have served New Zealand in times of war as part of Anzac Day commemorations has passed in Parliament today.

“Honouring our service personnel on Anzac Day is one of our most enduring national traditions,” Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“It binds us to our history and to the story of who we are as a country, while providing an opportunity to reflect on the courage and extraordinary sacrifice of those who have served to defend and protect New Zealand and our allies.

“However, the Anzac Day Act was in desperate need of updating. It failed to acknowledge conflicts after 1966, meaning many service personnel were excluded from official commemorations under the law. The modernised law more accurately reflects public sentiment about who we honour on Anzac Day.”

Veterans Minister Chris Penk says, increasingly, New Zealanders are using the occasion of Anzac Day to reflect on the loss of loved ones in war and in warlike situations, including United Nations missions, other multi-force groupings, and service alongside allied forces.

“Kiwis also commemorate the loss of family members who served as civilians in medical units, and the Merchant Navy during the two World Wars. Others remember those who tragically died while training for conflict.

“The updated Act will now also cover the service of members of allied forces who participated in the first landing on Gallipoli, including personnel from countries such as France and India.

“These changes are well overdue, and come into effect before Anzac Day 2026, meaning that this year will be the first time our national commemoration formally recognises all those who have served New Zealand in times of war.

“We will remember them.”

Mr Goldsmith says the passage of the legislation strengthens the integrity and relevance of one of New Zealand’s most important days of remembrance.

“Preserving the memory of those who fought to defend our country, and of those who served in other vital roles during times of war, is a critical part of safeguarding New Zealand’s history and national identity.”
