NZTA has applied for statutory approvals for the Northwest Busway project under the Fast‑track Approvals Act (FTAA), marking a major milestone for a project that will deliver faster, more frequent and more reliable public transport for Auckland’s growing northwest, says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

“The project, similar to the successful Northern Busway, will provide a busway alongside State Highway 16 (SH16) between Brigham Creek and the city centre, and seven stations connected to the local bus and road network,” says Mr Bishop.

“People in the northwest are crying out for better transport options in one of the region’s largest planned growth areas, where an additional 100,000 people, along with 40,000 new homes and 40,000 new jobs, are expected by 2051.

“Lodging under the FTAA represents progress for the Northwest Busway, which is going to provide more transport choices for communities in the northwest. This is about building the future of public transport in New Zealand. Auckland is our largest city, and this will help support jobs and drive growth.

“The Northwest Busway includes a park and ride station at Brigham Creek and stations at Westgate, Royal Road, Lincoln Road, Te Atatū, Point Chevalier and Western Springs. It will be able to move up to 9,000 passengers per hour in each direction, the equivalent of four motorway lanes. It will also provide a reliable 25-minute journey time from Brigham Creek to the city centre – all day, every day.

“Construction is already underway on the new Westgate Station, which will open later this year, and works on the Brigham Creek Station are expected to start next year.

“The busway will increase the capacity of State Highway 16 by nearly 20% during peak times by freeing up space on the motorway for freight and those that need it.

“Aucklanders want better, faster and more reliable public transport and this project is a priority for this Government, so I welcome the progress being made by NZTA with the lodgement of statutory approvals for the project under the FTAA.

“The approvals will enable NZTA to construct the project in stages as further funding is made available.

“The Northwest Busway project has received around $550 million, covering statutory approvals, design and site investigations, construction of the Westgate Station and Brigham Creek Station and Park & Ride, and targeted property acquisition.

“The Northwest Busway project is part of an integrated plan to provide better connections to the wider transport network and maximise investment in other public transport projects like City Rail Link.”

**Notes to the editor:**

- The northwest of Auckland is home to 90,000 people and is one of the city’s largest planned growth areas.
- 60 percent of residents commute out of the area for work and education, which means the Northwestern Motorway regularly suffers from congestion and delays.
- This project covers an 18km corridor and navigates a heavily built-up urban environment. This means it requires underpasses and structures to navigate motorway interchanges, and it impacts some utility assets and property which also add to the cost.
- The whole project has a benefit cost ratio of 2:1, with the first stage at 6.3:1 so for every dollar that’s spent we’re getting high benefits in return.
- Stage 1 will see new stations at Brigham Creek and Lincoln Road as part of a $330m - $380m package of work.
- Stage 2 will include the separated and bi-directional busway from Brigham Creek to Te Atatū, along with the stations at Royal Road and Te Atatū, the second stage of Westgate station, and the city centre connection at Newton at an estimated investment of $4,100m - $4,600m\*.
- The Point Chevalier and Western Springs stations are to be delivered as a third stage.
