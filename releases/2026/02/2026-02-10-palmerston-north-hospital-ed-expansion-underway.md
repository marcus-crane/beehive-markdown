Construction is underway to expand and upgrade Palmerston North Hospital’s emergency department, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This redevelopment is a practical, front-line investment that will make a real difference for patients and staff, helping to reduce wait times while improving safety, privacy, and the overall flow of care,” Mr Brown says.

The $14.455 million project is part of the Government’s $100 million hospital infrastructure programme funded through Budget 2025, accelerating improvements across health facilities nationwide.

“The upgrade will increase emergency department capacity by around 40 percent, delivering 15 additional points of care, a new mental health assessment room, and redesigned spaces that support better patient flow, privacy, and safety.

“Palmerston North Hospital’s emergency department was built 25 years ago, and demand now far exceeds what it was designed for. This redevelopment will deliver a modern, efficient, patient-centred environment that is better equipped to respond to growing demand and seasonal pressures, including winter.”

Palmerston North Hospital’s emergency department is the central hub for emergency care across the MidCentral district, supporting Whanganui Hospital, Dannevirke Community Hospital, and Horowhenua Health Centre.

“This investment strengthens the wider regional network and helps ensure people across region can access timely emergency care close to home.”

Mr Brown says the Government’s $100 million investment programme is delivering 21 local projects across the country to expand and upgrade clinical spaces, strengthen essential infrastructure, and reduce the risk of disruption to critical health services.

“Our Government is focused on practical improvements that strengthen hospital services and put patients at the centre, with targeted upgrades that lift capacity where it is needed most, including here at Palmerston North Hospital.”

The emergency department will remain open throughout the redevelopment, which is expected to be completed in June 2026.

“This work is being carried out while keeping services running, ensuring patients can continue to access care as we build the capacity Palmerston North needs for the future,” Mr Brown says.
