Education Minister Erica Stanford is highlighting the clear, critical need for major change within the Teaching Council following the significant and serious findings of two recent, external reviews. 

“The findings of recent reports on issues within the Teaching Council are some of the most serious that I have seen. The reports make it abundantly clear that there are various, highly concerning failures and problems that need to be addressed,” Ms Stanford says.

“The issues identified are not just minor or technical in nature that require slight adjustments. We have recently seen significant revelations that highlight key issues which should not be understated. 

“While the reports identified numerous shortcomings, they identified above all that there has been an inadequate focus on ensuring child protection, a paramount function of the Council that should be their top priority. 

“Various issues have been identified with leadership, culture, purpose, and the priorities of the Council. The organisation has not appeared to see themselves as a regulator, and ultimately have not been supporting teachers sufficiently.

“Teachers have long questioned the use of the fees within the organisation and these reports show teachers were right to do so. Teachers should be well supported to succeed in their roles, and this is something I have confidence will be addressed.

“These and the other pressing issues raise serious questions concerning the capability of previous boards. A regulatory standards setting body should hold itself to the very highest level, enabling trust and confidence. These reports show previous boards have failed to do this. 

“Boards play a key role in organisational culture. As Minister, I have appointed new members to the board to restore sound governance and effectiveness of the Teaching Council. I have confidence in the new board’s ability to govern the Council, but note the organisation has a very long way to go to restore confidence.

“Ultimately, the Teaching Council needs to undertake their duties competently, ensuring within that child safety, that teachers are well supported to deliver a world-leading education system, and that parents, the public and the sector have confidence in their activities.”
