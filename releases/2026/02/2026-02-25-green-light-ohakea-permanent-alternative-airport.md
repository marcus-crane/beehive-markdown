New Zealand’s international aviation links and resilience will be significantly strengthened by a move to make RNZAF Base Ohakea available as an alternative runway for wide body aircraft 24/7, Associate Transport Minister James Meager says.

“The Government has approved funding for Airways New Zealand to provide round-the-clock air traffic control at the airport, resolving a long-standing constraint for airlines and one which has been a handbrake on New Zealand’s economic growth,” Mr Meager says.

“Under aviation safety rules, commercial flights must nominate an alternate runway in case their destination airport is closed due to weather or another event.

“Currently, Ohakea can’t be used as an alternate airport overnight when flights need to divert, due to the lack of air traffic control services.  Our investment in round-the-clock air traffic control will mean an alternate landing option for large international aircraft unable to land at Auckland or Christchurch.

“This simple solution increases the commercial viability of flying to New Zealand for major airlines. Aircraft can carry less fuel and fly these routes with full passenger and freight loads. This directly benefits our tourism operators, exporters and regional economies and is yet another example of how we are fixing the basics and building the future.”

This decision marks the completion of a key action of the Aviation Action Plan, launched in September last year, which contains 25 actions to grow and future-proof the sector.

Working together, government and industry have already     achieved 10 actions, including Ohakea, since its launch less than six months ago. These are:

•    Outlining a set of coordinated industry-led recommendations to address long-standing workforce challenges, to be taken forward by the Aviation Council. 

•    Developing and delivering new rules to allow for safe innovation and growth in advanced aviation in consultation with the sector.

•    Confirming New Zealand’s voluntary participation in the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation at the 2025 International Civil Aviation Organization General Assembly. 

•    Commencing work alongside industry with Australian counterparts to develop regional collaboration on sustainable aviation fuel uptake and supply.

•    Assisting flight schools to update pilot training programmes to better align with the needs of airlines. 

•    Identifying the new skills needed for the advanced aviation industry for the next 10 years.

•    Providing input to the National Infrastructure Plan on the minimum operating network requirements for air transport. 

•    Identifying all the costs borne by the aviation sector, such as fees and charges, from government agencies 

•    Assessing future infrastructure requirements including support for fleet expansion, jet fuel demand and electricity and transmission needs for next generation aircraft. 

In addition, the Government is securing vulnerable regional routes by supporting small airlines through loans and providing investment for interlining arrangements.

“I’d like to acknowledge the Aviation Council’s leadership of these initiatives. This progress has only been possible because of the continued commitment from government and industry to work together to grow and future-proof our aviation sector,” Mr Meager says.

“With these practical solutions, we’re reducing the barriers and costs for airlines and the sector, signalling New Zealand is open for business to international trade and tourism while strengthening resilience, growing our workforce and supporting long term growth.”
