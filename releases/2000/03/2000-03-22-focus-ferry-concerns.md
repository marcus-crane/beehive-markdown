The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche is to travel by fast ferry to the Marlborough Sounds tomorrow morning.

"I want to see first hand the wash and wake effects of all ferries – fast and conventional – in the Tory Channel area," he said today.

Once in Picton Mr Gosche will travel on a small boat to the Tory Channel entrance so he can see for himself the effects of a fast ferry leaving the Sounds.

He will then attend a meeting with a wide range of interested parties including local iwi Te Atiawa, Guardians of the Sounds, Department of Conservation officials, ship operators, commercial and recreational boat operators and fishers. The meeting will be hosted by the Marlborough District Council.

Mr Gosche will be accompanied by officials from the Maritime Safety Authority who chair the Tory Channel Users Group.

"The main purpose of this visit is to meet with all parties and assure myself that they are working constructively together to identify and put in place reasonable and practical measures to ensure the safety of navigation in the Tory Channel Queen Charlotte Sounds area," he said.

Mr Gosche is the third Cabinet Minister to visit the area this year.

"This Government is committed to working with all parties so that a resolution can be achieved," he said.
