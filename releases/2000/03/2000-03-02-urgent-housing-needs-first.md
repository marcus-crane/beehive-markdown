State house sales under the Home Buy scheme are to end, the Minister of Housing Mark Gosche said today.

Mr Gosche said the priority was to preserve decent, affordable rental housing for those on low-incomes and in serious need.

“We must have a good supply of state houses for rent. We cannot afford to sell off any more Housing New Zealand properties if we are to meet the urgent demand for housing from those on low incomes,” he said.

Mr Gosche said it was imperative to maintain a good supply of state houses.

"Income related rents for low income state house tenants will be introduced by the year end.  
The demand for state houses will rise once low income people can afford to live in them again."

The priority is to preserve existing rental housing stock and the Home Buy scheme was reducing it by around 700 homes a year."

"Housing New Zealand is there to provide rental accommodation, first and foremost,” said Mr Gosche.

“This is the key priority for the Government,” he said.

Mr Gosche said whilst the Home Buy scheme had ended, about 350 applicants at an advanced stage in the pipeline would be still allowed to buy their home if they wished. These people should have already received a letter from Housing New Zealand.

These were the estimated 140 cases where the buyer was near completion of the Home Buy process and another approximately 210 cases where tenants had been prevented from completing the sale process because of Housing New Zealand’s inability to date to establish a saleable title.

“This recognises that some people were at an advanced stage in the scheme and we believe it only fair they should be allowed to complete the purchase if they so wish.”

Officials were already looking at alternative home ownership options for those on low incomes.

Mr Gosche said the Government will overtime expand the state housing stock in areas of greater need, and is taking a special look at Maori and Pacific housing needs and studying new housing approaches for people with mental health disabilities.

Over the past seven and a half years the total state housing stock was reduced by nearly 11,000 state houses - around 3000 were to Home Buy tenants.
