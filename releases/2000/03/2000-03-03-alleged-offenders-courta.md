Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins is pleased that police have two alleged offenders before the courts.

Charges relate to the abduction and rape of a Chinese woman in a Manurewa reserve on Sunday February 20.

"The Asian community understandably was outraged after hearing of this crime," George Hawkins said.

"I want to express my sincere condolences to the victim and family. I also believe now is a time for healing and a time for communities to come together against crime.

"I want to assure those of the Asian community that the Labour/Alliance Government and the New Zealand Police share a nationwide regret and abhorrence that crimes such as this have occurred," George Hawkins said.

George Hawkins will be speaking to the Asian community at the Te Atatu Community Hall, Te Atatu Road at 7:30pm tonight \[Friday March 3].
