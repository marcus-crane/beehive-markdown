Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the new government was retaining the Wanganui offices of Health Benefits Ltd and had overturned the previous National Government's decision to move the whole service to Wellington.

The Prime Minister was speaking during her visit to Wanganui today, where she opened a new technology block at Wanganui Girls' College, and a new computer graphic design building at Wanganui Polytechnic.

HBL is responsible for the monitoring and processing of subsidy claims from health professionals.

The HBL centre in Wanganui deals with claims made by pharmacists.

"Increasingly such claims are handled electronically. An advantage of this technology is that the services can continue to be performed satisfactorily outside the main centres

"HBL's continued existence in Wanganui is an excellent example of these technological advances working to the benefit of regional New Zealand. It also demonstrates the new government's commitment to jobs in regional cities. The previous National Government was intent on closing HBL in Wanganui.

"The coalition government, as part of its overall strategy to breathe new economic life into our regions, will lend its full weight to these developments.

"I congratulate Whanganui MP Jill Pettis for the success of her campaign to keep an HBL presence in her city," Helen Clark said.
