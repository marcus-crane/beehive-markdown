A retention payment scheme that has been offered to some Air Force flying instructors has been successful, the Minister of Defence Mark Burton said today.

"Contrary to media reports based on a claim by United MP Peter Dunne, the retention payment scheme offered earlier this month has been readily accepted.

"Of the 20 flying instructors currently eligible, 19 have accepted the retention offer", Mr Burton said.

"The purpose of the scheme is to retain key personnel.

"The retention payment is restricted solely to qualified flying instructors who are not subject to a return of service obligation. During the course of the scheme, 38 flying instructors will be eligible to receive the one-off $25,000 taxable bonus in return for signing on for a further 18 months.

"All of these pilots are in critical flying positions or flying related appointments. The scheme will run to 12 March 2001.

"I don't know where Mr Dunne got his information that only two pilots have accepted the retention offer – but he is quite wrong," Mark Burton said.
