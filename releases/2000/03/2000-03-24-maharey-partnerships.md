Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey stressed the importance of building partnerships between government and the community today.

Speaking to delegates at Labour's Waikato/Bay of Plenty regional conference in Rotorua, Mr Maharey said the new Government would be characterised by the way it actively sort to work with people and their communities in partnership.

"Labour has brought a new way of working to government. We believe in directly involving New Zealanders in the decision making process.

"National moved away from any real relationship with most New Zealanders. The lesson they learned is that when a government becomes isolated it no longer has a mandate and is doomed to be thrown out of office.

"The Government is building a new partnership with business and local communities.

"Examples of this include our plans to establish District Health Boards, the Prime Ministers Local Government Forum and the work WINZ is doing with beneficiary advocate groups to improve the responsiveness of its services.

"Partnership is set to become the defining characteristic of the fifth Labour Government," Steve Maharey said.
