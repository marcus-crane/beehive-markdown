Education, and Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard has welcomed the announcement from Sky Television that they will trial a bilingual service on its digital platform during this weekend's Warriors Rugby League Game.

Viewers will be able to opt for a Maori or English commentary for the Warriors game against St George Illawarra.

"I congratulate Sky on this initiative," Trevor Mallard said.

"I have long felt that digital television provides exciting potential for broadcasting in Maori language – particularly sports broadcasting.

"I hope Maori language learners will utilise broadcasts like this as a way of enhancing their learning. I have listened to Maori language radio sports commentary and found it quite amazing and not as hard to follow as I expected," Trevor Mallard.
