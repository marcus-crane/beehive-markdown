The Acting Minister of Communications Trevor Mallard has today announced the government's auction of the 2 GHz spectrum will start on 10 July this year.

“This spectrum auction is particularly exciting given that part of it can support third generation cellular technology which will eventually provide high speed mobile data and voice applications," said Trevor Mallard.

“Implementation of this technology is critical to New Zealand’s economic development.

"In December last year, Cabinet agreed to delay the auction to enable further work on some of the competition issues which could potentially arise out of it.

"To address those competition issues we have decided to place a cap on the amount of ‘third generation spectrum’ that can be acquired by individual bidders in the auction.

“That means that no bidder will be able to purchase more than 15 MHz of spectrum in the third generation band (1920 – 1980 MHz) plus its ‘natural pair’ (2110 – 2170 MHz).

“This cap will allow at least four competitors to provide third generation mobile services.

“By imposing this cap we should see vigorous competition in the provision of these new services that will benefit the economy as a whole.

“In addition, the Government has decided that preferential bidding access to one 15MHz block of third generation spectrum will be given to those parties able to demonstrate some commitment to involve Maori in the development of this spectrum.

"We will announce the criteria for who will be eligible to bid for this spectrum at auction later," Trevor Mallard said.

To enable changes to be made to the auction catalogue and rules and to give the industry time to prepare the auction will not start until 10 July.
