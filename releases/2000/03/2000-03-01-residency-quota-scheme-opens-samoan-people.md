Registrations for this year's Samoan Quota Scheme will open on 1 May 2000, the Minister of Immigration, Hon Lianne Dalziel, said today.

"Procedural changes introduced last year to reduce queues have worked well and both the New Zealand and Samoan governments are happy with the scheme's operation," Ms Dalziel said. Prior to the changes, the applications needed to be lodged in person, and there were also immigration consultants lodging numerous registrations, adding to the backlog.

Up to 1100 Samoan citizens may be granted residence in New Zealand under the scheme.  
To qualify, the principal applicant must:  
\- be a Samoan citizen, born in Samoa or born overseas to a Samoan citizen who was born in Samoa,  
\- be resident in either Samoa or American Samoa at the time of registration,  
\- be aged between 18 and 45,  
\- meet the standard health and character requirements,  
\- display a minimum level of English language ability, and  
\- have an acceptable offer of employment in New Zealand.

A Samoan citizen applying to live in New Zealand must register for this year's quota between 1 and 12 May. Registration forms are available from NZIS branches, as well as various travel agencies, from 1 March 2000. The completed form must be posted to the NZ Immigration Service (NZIS), PO Box 2277, Apia, Samoa.

Registrations must be sent to the NZIS by mail and received before 12 May. To be valid, there must be only one completed Registration Form per envelope. People will be advised after 22 May whether their bid to lodge a residency application has been successful.
