The suggested "tourist tax" in Kaikoura is misguided and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the true benefits of tourism to local communities, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said today.  
"The call for a tax on tourists from the Kaikoura Ratepayers' Association is a regrettable one.  
"Every one of the 800,000 visitors to the Kaikoura region each year is already contributing to the local economy.  
"Tourism employs 118,000 New Zealanders – that's one job in twelve. I expect the figure is even higher in Kaikoura.  
"The indirect benefits of tourism are spread throughout a community. Petrol stations, supermarkets, retails shops, cafes, pubs and so on all benefit. Successful businesses pay wages and pay local body rates. The range of services available to residents in Kaikoura is significantly greater than it would be, if the flow of visitors was suddenly cut off.  
"This government is committed to the development of a National Tourism Strategy and is working closely with the industry on its development," Mark Burton said.  
"A key objective of the strategy will be to encourage a broader spectrum of support for tourism in the public and private sector alike to realise our tourism potential.  
"Punitive measures like the tourist tax suggested in Kaikoura are completely the wrong approach," Mr Burton said.
