The formation of a World Trade Organisation panel to hear New Zealand's dispute  
with the United States about tariffs on lamb was good news, Minister for Trade  
Negotiations Jim Sutton said today.  
The WTO confirmed the three-member panel today NZ time.  
The panel members are: Professor Tommy Koh, from Singapore, who will chair the  
panel; Shishir Priyadarshi from India; and Meinhard Hilf, from Germany.  
Mr Sutton said he was pleased the procedural step of forming the panel was now  
done.  
"We can get down to the business of challenging the legality of the action taken  
against our lamb exports by the United States," he said.  
"Now the hard work begins. We need to convince the panel of our view that the US  
tariff is contrary to its international obligations."  
New Zealand is taking the case against the US on a joint basis with Australia,  
which is also affected by the lamb tariffs.  
Presentations before the panel are scheduled for late May and early July. A  
final outcome, including the hearing of any appeals, is likely to be early next  
year.
