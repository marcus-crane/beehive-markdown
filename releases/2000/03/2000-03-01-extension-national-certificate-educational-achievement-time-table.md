The timetable for implementing the National Certificate of Educational Achievement will be extended for one year to help make its implementation as smooth as possible.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today that the change would now come into effect for Year 11 students (5th form) in 2002.

"NCEA is a huge change to senior secondary school students' qualifications. It is a system the new Government supports but I am not prepared to let it begin when I am not convinced that schools are completely ready for it.

"To implement the new system is going to require some fairly comprehensive professional development for teachers and more support materials in place.

"An extension of one year will enable the Government to make available additional resources for teacher support. Expert panels developing the standards and supporting assessment material for Years 12 and 13 have already begun to meet and I want to give that process more time so that the job is done properly.

"If schools are under-prepared to implement the new system it risks failure. My decision today is based on the need to put student needs first. We cannot risk students' future because the sector was not properly prepared for the changeover," Trevor Mallard said.

Secondary schools will be sent a letter about the extension today.
