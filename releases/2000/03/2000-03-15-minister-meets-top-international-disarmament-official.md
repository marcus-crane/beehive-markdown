Matt Robson, Minister of Disarmament will meet with the head of the Vienna-based CTBT organisation tomorrow.

Dr. Wolfgang Hoffmann is the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty organisation (CTBT).

He is visiting New Zealand following visits to Singapore, Canberra and Sydney.

New Zealand is an active signatory to the CTBT treaty, which bans all nuclear explosions and tests in all environments – underwater, underground and in the atmosphere.

This month a nuclear test monitoring station on the Chathams was officially opened as part of New Zealand's contribution to the CTBT Treaty. Its function is to detect any clandestine testing in this region.

Matt Robson will discuss Dr. Hoffmann, his visit next week to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and his visit to the CTBT base in Vienna.

"We will be talking about ways in which New Zealand can attempt to shift the disarmament talks internationally which have become dangerous stalled in recent years," says Matt Robson.

The United States, Russia and China have not yet ratified the CTBT Treaty.
