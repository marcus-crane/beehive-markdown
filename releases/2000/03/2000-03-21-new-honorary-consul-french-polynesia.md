New Zealand’s new Honorary Consul in French Polynesia is local Air New Zealand manager Alan Roman, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

French Polynesia is an important market for New Zealand exports, which reached $108 million in 1999, and of increasing significance for foreign policy reasons.

“As French Polynesia gains more powers of self-government, and takes a more active role in regional affairs, New Zealand needs to develop a closer relationship with its Government,” Mr Goff said.

Responsibilities of the Honorary Consul include facilitating contacts between French Polynesia and New Zealand, provision of visitor visa and immigration application forms, and assistance with general inquiries about New Zealand.

Like previous New Zealand Honorary Consuls in French Polynesia, Mr Roman is the Manager of the Air New Zealand office in Papeete. He has had a long association with New Zealand since joining the airline in 1980.
