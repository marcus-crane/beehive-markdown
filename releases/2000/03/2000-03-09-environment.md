The diversity of creatures and plants with which we share our country are an important part of what makes New Zealand New Zealand, the Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, said today.

Announcing the launch of the preliminary report of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on biodiversity and private land, Ms Hobbs said landowners have a critical role to play in maintaining New Zealand’s native plants and animals.

"Landowners and their communities cannot be required to act with public spirit and generosity but we cannot achieve our biodiversity goals without them," she said.

A committee consisting of former Federated Farmers President, John Kneebone (Chair), lawyer, Mark Christensen, Ecologist, Dr Judith Roper-Lindsay, and farmer and conservationist, Kevin Prime, compiled the report.

Entitled "Bio-What?" the report recommends developing a national accord on biodiversity between key parties with a focused national policy statement under the Resource Management Act to define roles and establish a methodology for local government.

It also recommends a suite of non-statutory guidance and greater government assistance with information, research and incentive schemes to help councils apply the national policy statement and to support local measures and local communities.

"Halting the decline in New Zealand’s biodiversity will not be achieved through forced compliance nor from increased public funding alone," Ms Hobbs said.

"We need private landowners who understand and accept the importance of this issue, and we need to encourage and assist them to make the right decisions.

"The advisory committee has offered its view on a general approach to the issue. Now its time to hear from others."

The Advisory Committee will receive submissions on the preliminary report until 16 June, 2000.
