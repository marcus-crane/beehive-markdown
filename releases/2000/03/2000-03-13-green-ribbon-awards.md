The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, is looking for good examples of local environmental initiatives. She is seeking nominations for the annual Green Ribbon Awards.

The awards are given to recognise outstanding contributions by individuals, organisations or businesses to addressing New Zealand’s environmental problems.

"We know that there are many people out there who, in their own quiet way, are making a difference for the environment," Marian Hobbs said. "We want to hear about them.

"Some examples of what we are looking for include environmental education projects, initiatives to reduce waste and energy use, or good land management techniques to reduce the impact of farming on the environment."

The Minister said it was important to recognise and reward efforts to improve and protect our environment. Many of the 25 previous winners have been influential in encouraging others into good environmental management, she said.

The awards will be made in five categories: Business and Industry, Rural, Community and Local Government, Maori, and Education.

Nominations close on 22 April 2000 (Earth Day) and the Minister will announce the winners on World Environment Day (5 June). Information about the awards can be obtained from the Ministry for the Environment or from their website: [www.mfe.govt.nz/management/awards](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/management/awards)
