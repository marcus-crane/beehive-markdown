Tourism Minister Mark Burton and Mäori Affairs Minister Dover Samuels today announced a joint project to assist in “Closing the Gaps” in the Tourism industry.  
"Tourism is this country’s largest single earner of foreign exchange and Mäori have a long history of involvement in the industry", said Mr Burton. “As a vehicle for Mäori economic development, I consider that tourism is second to none.”  
The project is being commissioned by the Office of Tourism and Sport and Te Puni Kökiri to quantify the involvement of Mäori across the spectrum of the industry, as business owners and operators, as investors and as employers and employees, and to identify opportunities for Mäori in tourism industries. The study will also identify any barriers to Mäori participation and performance.  
“The project will formulate policies and identify opportunities for improved participation and performance by Mäori in tourism. Such work is vital to close the gaps for Mäori in tourism”, said Mr Samuels.  
“This Government has made a very strong commitment to closing the gaps between Mäori and non-Mäori. The Prime Minister has clearly signalled in allocating to me both the Mäori Affairs and the Associate Tourism portfolios, that this Government believes a healthy partnership between Mäori and tourism will enhance economic development.”  
Mr Burton said that other work being done to close the gaps includes the development of a National Strategy for Tourism, which will include Mäori tourism issues. In addition, a subcommittee of the Tourism New Zealand Board is currently making good progress on the usage of Mäori images in marketing New Zealand internationally.  
The project will be advertised this week. More information is available from the Office of Tourism and Sport and Te Puni Kökiri.
