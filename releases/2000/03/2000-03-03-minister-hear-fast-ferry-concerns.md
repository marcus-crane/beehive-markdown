The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche is to meet with iwi and community representatives to discuss concerns associated with fast ferry operations in the Tory Channel and inner Queen Charlotte Sound.

He is to travel by fast ferry when he travels to the sounds later this month.

"I want to see the effects of fast ferry wash first hand and that is why I am travelling down by fast ferry," said Mr Gosche.

"Locals see this as a crucial issue and we want to hear from all interested parties."

Mr Gosche said a risk assessment report compiled by Australian consultants for the Marlborough District council would be revisited.

"There is an urgent need for quality information on the safety risks involved. Our officials will analyse that report to ensure its conclusions are robust," he said.

Mr Gosche said it was important to piece together a comprehensive, coherent picture of the environmental effects and safety concerns associated with the wash.

"We believe a monitoring programme is vital to any action to address environmental concerns through the Resource Management Act."
