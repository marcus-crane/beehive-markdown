Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the Government’s further intentions to close the education gaps for Maori and Pacific Island students in Porirua East with a contribution of $120,000 towards the ICAN school project.

The money will support eight schools - Porirua East, Glenview, Cannons Creek, Maraeroa, Russell and Natone Primary Schools along with Brandon Intermediate and Porirua College – which have formed a co-operative to strengthen education for their students.

“There are nearly two thousand students at these schools, and four out of five are Maori and Pacific Islands children,” said Trevor Mallard.

“This government is committed to strengthening education for urban Maori and Pacific Islands communities, and that’s why I see it important to make a contribution towards this initiative.”

Trevor Mallard congratulated the schools for taking up the challenge to help themselves and work together. He also thanked the multi-disciplinary engineering company Opus for the support it was giving to the project in form of advice, guidance and services.

“The mana of this project is with the parents, schools and the wider community of Porirua East,” said Trevor Mallard.

The Minister of Education signed the Funding Provision Agreement with ICAN overview group chairman, Ashley Blair, and the Chairman of Porirua College, David Stanley.

He then witnessed the Memorandum of Understanding between ICAN and the Opus CEO, John Rutledge.
