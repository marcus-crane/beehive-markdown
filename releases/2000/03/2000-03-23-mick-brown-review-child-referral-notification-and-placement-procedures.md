Former Principal Youth Court Judge Mick Brown will conduct independent reviews into how the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services responds to referrals of child abuse or neglect, and places at risk children, the Minister of Social Services and Employment, Steve Maharey announced today.

The two reviews would focus on obtaining information on the current procedures administered by Child, Youth and Family for care and protection notification, and for placement of children and young people. The reviews will gather information from and consult with interest groups, community-based professionals, Police, relevant health and education services, the Office of the Commissioner for Children, Maori interests, and also Child, Youth and Family.

“I want to ensure the very best care and protection possible is available to those children and young people who may be suffering from neglect, abuse, or otherwise be at risk.

"The reviews will place a particular focus on the processes the Department uses when dealing with Mäori, reflecting the large number of Mäori who are involved in child care and protection cases, and among children placed in care outside their immediate families.

“I know that Child, Youth and Family social workers and staff work in a most difficult and trying area. However children’s interest groups, community child protection specialists, and the department itself have raised sufficient concerns about responses to care and protection cases and the level of placements for me to seek these reviews so that any necessary improvements can be made.

"There have also been a number of high profile cases in recent years which have caused public concern.

“The terms of reference for the reviews will include placements with extended family members and with whanau, hapu and iwi kin groups.

“They will look at how effective procedures are, assess their strengths and weaknesses and make recommendations on improvements.

"I am delighted that Mick Brown has agreed to undertake these reviews. Mr Brown is a former District Court Judge and was Principal Youth Court Judge. As such, he made a significant contribution to the development of new approaches to offending by young people in New Zealand.

"The reviews will be undertaken sequentially, with the first to be completed by 30 June 2000. Mr Brown and the review team will be provided with management support by the Ministry of Social Policy," Steve Maharey said.
