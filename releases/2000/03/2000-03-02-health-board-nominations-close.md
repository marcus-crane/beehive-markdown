Nominations for health boards close at 5pm tomorrow (Friday), Health Minister Annette King says.

"There has been a steady stream of nominations. While they have not yet been counted it appears the public has responded positively to the opportunity to get involved in decision making.

"The Ministry of Health and the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit will now analyse the nominations and present me with a proposed shortlist.

"Once I have agreed upon the shortlist officials will undertake interviews on behalf of Ministers before providing me with recommendations.

"After consultation with my Cabinet colleagues, extra directors will then be appointed to the boards of existing Hospital and Health Services.

"This is the first step towards district health boards," Mrs King said.

The new directors are expected to assume their roles in May.
