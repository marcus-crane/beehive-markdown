Fringe benefits will be made subject to a three-tier tax as the Government moves  
to address a long-standing unfairness in the FBT regime, Revenue Minister  
Michael Cullen announced today.  
"The purpose of the change is to reduce the over-taxation of fringe benefits  
received by low-income and middle-income people, and to limit opportunities for  
tax avoidance by high-income people," Dr Cullen said.  
Fringe benefit tax, currently set at a rate of 49 percent, will rise to 64  
percent in tandem with the introduction on April 1 of the new 39 percent income  
tax rate.  
"The rate of fringe benefit tax must be tied to the top personal tax rate to  
prevent those on high-incomes avoiding the higher tax rate by substituting for  
taxable income fringe benefits such as expensive cars and low-interest loans,"  
Dr Cullen said.  
"But currently all fringe benefits are taxed at the top rate, even when the  
people receiving them are not top income earners. The fringe benefits of those  
people are being over-taxed.  
"This is a long-standing problem which has been around since the FBT was first  
introduced in 1985. The Government will ameliorate this by shifting to a  
multi-rate system.  
"Employers will be able to choose FBT rates that better correspond to the  
remuneration of individual employees. They may choose between paying a flat rate  
of 64 percent on all fringe benefits, or using rates of 27 percent, 49 percent  
or 64 percent, whichever is the most appropriate. The tax rate will be based on  
the employee  
?s tax rate. The latter option will involve a square-up process at  
the end of the year. Benefits not attributed to an individual employee will be  
subject to FBT at a flat rate of 49 percent."  
"The Government will also introduce measures to prevent employees negotiating to  
be paid by different but associated employers, to limit their ability to avoid a  
higher fringe benefit tax.  
"The multi-rate system will introduce greater accuracy into the taxation of  
fringe benefits. But we have to balance that achievement against the fact that  
it will also cause some increase in compliance costs for the employers who  
choose to use it. We have tried to minimise these costs wherever possible," Dr  
Cullen said.  
The changes to the fringe benefit tax system will be included in a bill to be  
introduced into Parliament later this month.

Questions and answers ? multi-rate fringe benefit tax  
What sort of fringe benefits have to be attributed?

Employers will be required to attribute all cars used solely or predominantly by  
one employee, all low-interest loans, and other fringe benefits with a taxable  
value exceeding $1,000 over the year. For example, if an employee earns $45,000  
a year working for a company involved in transportation, and receives subsidised  
transport valued at $1,200 over the year, the employer would have to attribute  
and therefore apply the 49 percent FBT rate to that fringe benefit.

Can I attribute all fringe benefits?

Some employers may wish to also attribute low-value benefits, especially where a  
large number of their employees receiving fringe benefits have low-incomes. For  
example, if a company provided medical insurance to its workers with the premium  
per person costing $800 over the year, it would be able to attribute these  
benefits should it wish.

However, those who decide to attribute these low-value benefits, must attribute  
the entire category to all recipients. In other words, employers cannot just  
attribute the medical insurance they provide to low-income employees and apply  
the non-attributed rate of 49 percent to the medical insurance provided to  
high-income earners.

Group benefits such as pool-vehicles cannot be attributed unless there is a  
predominant user.

Will these changes affect my fringe benefit tax return filing obligations?

Currently, most employers file fringe benefit returns quarterly, with a small  
number filing annually or by income year. Under these changes, quarterly filers  
could opt to pay FBT at a flat 49 percent or 64 percent rate for the first three  
quarters in the year. In the year-end fourth quarter, the employer would  
undertake the square-up process whereby benefits attributed to individual  
employees would be taxed on that employee?s tax rate based on income received  
from that employer. Employers filing annually or by income year can choose  
between paying a flat 64 percent, or undertaking the square-up.

For quarterly filers, FBT returns are currently due on the 20th day of the month  
following the end of the return period. In recognition of any increase in  
complexity and compliance costs, the due date for the fourth quarter square-up  
return will be extended from 20 April to 31 May.

Do I have to undertake the square-up?

Employers can opt not to undertake the square-up and simply continue to file at  
64 percent in every quarter. This could be an appropriate option for either  
employers with predominantly high-income employees, or for employers who only  
provide a small number of fringe benefits. However, the fourth quarter payment  
is final, and therefore an employer could not pay 64 percent on all benefits and  
then seek to undertake a square-up for that year at a later date.
