Education Minister Trevor Mallard today outlined details of education legislation to be introduced to Parliament this year.  
The legislative programme for education was approved by Cabinet this week and includes two major education amendment bills  
Trevor Mallard said the first bill to be introduced within a few weeks would cover the end of bulk funding of teacher salaries; school enrolment schemes; school governance; membership of student associations and human rights issues.  
“All schools will benefit from the additional funding and flexibility that only bulk-funded schools have enjoyed  
"School governance will also be made more flexible, particularly where schools wish to combine their boards, or where communities want a system of governance that is tailor-made to their circumstances.  
"The bill will tighten existing enrolment scheme law to ensure that any school enrolment schemes include clearly defined geographic zones. Every student within that zone will have the absolute right to attend their local school, and out-of-zone places will be determined by ballot.”  
A further Amendment Bill to be introduced later this year would strengthen further aspects of the Education sector.  
Issues covered in that bill will include:  
\- Teacher registration requirements and the establishment of an Education Council  
\- The establishment of a Parent Advocacy Service  
\- Processes to report student achievement
