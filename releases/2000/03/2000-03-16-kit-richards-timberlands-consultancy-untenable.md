"The consultancy arrangement between Mr Kit Richards and Timberlands West Coast Ltd is untenable in the view of the shareholder," Minister Responsible for Timberlands West Coast Pete Hodgson said today.

Timberlands is a state-owned enterprise. The shareholding ministers are Mr Hodgson and the Minister of Finance, Dr Michael Cullen.

"I have conveyed the shareholder's view to the chairman of the Timberlands board, Mr Warren Young, this afternoon," Mr Hodgson said.

"I anticipate hearing back from the chairman in due course."

Mr Richards resigned as Timberlands' general manager, planning, on January 28. His departure followed public disclosure of an e-mail message in which he urged his correspondents to apply pressure to the Government to change its policy in respect of native forest logging.

Timberlands' chief executive Mr Dave Hilliard told a Parliamentary select committee today that Mr Richards had since been contracted as a consultant to the company.
