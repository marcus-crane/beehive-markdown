It was never my intention to represent the Crown in the tripartite discussions about Pakaitore says Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Tariana Turia.

"To my knowledge the representatives for the Crown have not yet been chosen.

"I am not the Minister of Local Government or the Minister of Conservation, I did not expect to be the Crown's representative in the tripartite discussions.

"The Dominion and the Wanganui Chronicle have chosen to misrepresent my comments by only reporting a part of what I said.

"It was a deliberate attempt by those newspapers to sow seeds of dissent and division which do not exist," Hon Tariana Turia said.
