The retired Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum has been asked to undertake a Ministerial Inquiry into Mr Peter Ellis's case, Justice Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"I want to emphasise that it is extremely rare for further inquiry to be conducted into matters that have been considered by the Court of Appeal. However, in this case the Court itself indicated that there were matters that might be more appropriately addressed by an inquiry of this kind."

Peter Ellis twice petitioned the Governor-General for the exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy, in 1997 and again in 1998.

As a result the case was referred back to the Court of Appeal. In its subsequent judgment, the Court indicated that in its opinion no miscarriage of justice had occurred in Mr Ellis's case. However, the Court also commented that there were matters that might more appropriately be the subject of further inquiry. The Court was unable to resolve all matters fully because of the form in which some of the evidence was presented and the nature of its appellate role.

Following this judgment, Peter Ellis petitioned the Governor-General for a third time in October 1999, requesting a pardon and a Royal Commission of Inquiry into his case.

"I have asked Sir Thomas Eichelbaum to look into the matters that the Court of Appeal indicated it could not appropriately consider," Mr Goff said.

"In particular, I have asked Sir Thomas to identify current best practice for investigating mass allegation sexual abuse cases, and to determine whether these practices were followed in Mr Ellis's case. I have also asked Sir Thomas to seek the opinion of at least two internationally recognised experts in the area."

"I recently met with representatives of the crèche children's families. I understand and sympathise with their concerns. The need to minimise the distress for the crèche children was one of the key factors that influenced the shape of the inquiry. This was why I have established a Ministerial Inquiry and not a Commission of Inquiry. A Ministerial Inquiry is more flexible, more low key and more discreet. It is also likely to be speedier and much less of a burden on the taxpayer."

The terms of reference for the inquiry are below.

ENDS

TERMS OF REFERENCE – MINISTERIAL INQUIRY INTO THE PETER ELLIS CASE

The Minister of Justice appoints you to inquire in the manner set out below into matters which may be relevant to the assessment of the reliability of evidence given by the children who attended the Christchurch civic crèche against Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis and to report on whether there are any such matters which give rise to doubts about the assessment of the children’s evidence to an extent which would render the convictions of Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis unsafe and warrant the grant of a pardon.

You are to:

(1) (a)Review the reports and memoranda listed in the schedule and;  
(i) identify the processes, practices and procedures currently accepted internationally as best practice for investigating mass allegation child sexual abuses and interviewing children in these cases; and  
(ii) identify any risks associated with a failure to adhere to best practice.

(b) On the basis of the evidence given at both the depositions and the trial, assess whether the investigation into the events at the Christchurch civic crèche case and interviews of children were conducted in accordance with best practice as now understood.

(c) If you conclude that the interviews were not conducted in accordance with best practice, identify the nature and extent of any risks which arise, which might affect the assessment of the reliability of the children’s evidence. In conducting this task you are not required to attribute or apportion blame to particular individuals who undertook the interviews. The focus of the task is on the evaluation of systems and techniques and their impact on the children.

In undertaking the tasks referred in (1) above, you are to invite, and consider, written submissions from the Crown Law Office (on behalf of the Police, Department of Social Welfare and Specialist Interviewers), Peter Ellis, the families of children who gave evidence at the Ellis trial, and the Commissioner for Children.

(2) For the purpose of the assessment and the conclusions under (1) above, you are to:

(a) Seek and evaluate opinions from at least two internationally recognised experts (if possible with experience in mass allegation child sexual abuse) on whether there are features of the investigation and/or interviews of the children (on the basis of the evidence at depositions and trial) which may have affected the reliability of the children’s evidence, and if so, their likely impact.

(b) In selecting the experts from whom opinions are to be sought you are to:  
(i) invite and consider submissions from the Crown Law Office, Mr Peter Ellis, the families of children who gave evidence at Mr Ellis’s trial and the Commissioner for Children; and  
(ii) make such further inquiries as you consider necessary to ensure that the experts from whom opinions are sought reasonably reflect the range of professional views.

(3) In light of your assessment and conclusions in (1) and (2) above, you are to report by 31st August 2000 on whether there are any matters which give rise to doubts about the assessment of the children’s evidence to an extent which would render the convictions of Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis unsafe and warrant the grant of a pardon.
