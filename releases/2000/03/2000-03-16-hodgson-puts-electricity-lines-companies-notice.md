Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson has given electricity lines companies a firm warning that they will have to improve services and accountability or face regulation.

In a speech today to the Electricity Networks Association, representing lines companies, Mr Hodgson challenged the industry to self-regulate in problem areas or accept Government intervention.

"Make haste," Mr Hodgson told the companies. "If I can be convinced that you have solved pieces of the jigsaw in the interests of all consumers, the I will be inclined to accept your solution ahead of my own. Where you have not reached agreement, or where your interests are secured at the expense of customers', then a regulatory response from Government can be expected."

Mr Hodgson cited billing, supplier switching and high, increasing fixed charges as problem areas. He said he had instructed officials to "take a tough line" when tightening the valuation rules for lines companies. He warned of prosecutions for lines companies that did not comply properly with the information disclosure regulations. And he challenged companies to advance demand-side management or accept Government measures to do so.

Mr Hodgson acknowledged that other parts of the industry, including retailers, also needed to improve their performance.

He welcomed discussion amongst lines companies about establishing an industry Ombudsman scheme, which he said would be "a good positive move".

The report of the Ministerial Inquiry into the Electricity Industry is due on June 12. Mr Hodgson said the Government would be doing some "prompt decision-making" after that and any necessary legislation would be introduced in the second half of the year.

"Consumers need to start receiving some gains," Mr Hodgson said.
