Foreign Minister, Hon Phil Goff, today congratulated the successful candidate in Taiwan's Presidential election, Chen Shui-bian, and urged him to build on the momentum of his election victory to seek renewed dialogue with Beijing.

Mr Goff welcomed the peaceful exercise of democracy in Taiwan. He said the election of Chen Shui-bian offered a new opportunity for Beijing and Taipei to work to resolve their differences. "I am encouraged by Mr Chen's commitment to work to this end", he said.

Mr Goff said that he hoped that both sides would see this as an occasion for a new start to their dealings. A reduction in tension across the Taiwan straits will contribute to the security of the entire region, Mr Goff said.

"The way forward in the relationship between China and Taiwan is something for China and Taiwan to work out. But it is, nonetheless, something in which New Zealand, and all other countries of the region, have an interest in seeing move ahead peacefully and constructively.

"New Zealand has an important economic relationship with Taiwan, and we hope that it will continue to flourish during Mr Chen's time in office," Mr Goff concluded.
