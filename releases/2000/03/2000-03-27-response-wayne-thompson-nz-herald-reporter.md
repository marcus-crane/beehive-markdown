The Minister of Local Government Hon Sandra Lee says the Government will be paying close attention to the findings of the Auckland Mayoral Forum's report on The Future of Local Government in the Auckland Region.

"I have only just received a copy of the report today," she said, "and I look forward to studying its details."

"I will be discussing the report's recommendations with my Government colleagues including the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Auckland Issues, and also with the Auckland Mayoral Forum in due course."
