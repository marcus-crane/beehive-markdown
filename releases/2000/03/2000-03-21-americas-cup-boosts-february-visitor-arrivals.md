A big jump in overseas tourist numbers in February has highlighted the economic benefit to this country of major events like the America's Cup, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said today.  
The Minister was commenting on the release of Statistics New Zealand’s International Visitor Arrival statistics for February.  
International visitor arrivals increased by 9.3% in the year ended February 2000 to 1,641,582 arrivals.  
"The 14% growth performance in the month of February was particularly interesting and there would appear to be a direct link with the America’s Cup," Mr Burton said.  
"Arrivals from the key America’s Cup participants was very strong – Italy grew by 104% over the previous February (to 1545 visitors) and the United States by 15.5%.  
"Across Europe the increase was 23.6 percent in February. Coupled with continued strong performance from Australia (up 18.3% in February) and the resurgence of Asia (up 18.8%) the growth achieved reflects the solid base upon which the sector is now expanding. Japan is the only under-performing market and this reflects the weakness of the domestic Japanese market.  
"I am encouraged by these statistics", Mr Burton said, "because they reflect an injection of wealth into the New Zealand economy of an estimated $380 million in the year ended February."

This earnings estimate is based upon the increase in arrivals over the year and the average spend per visitor as of December 1999.  
"Clearly, the America’s Cup has had a profound impact on New Zealand and it highlights the importance of such events for generating direct benefits and for leveraging New Zealand’s position in the competitive international tourism marketplace. I look forward to the completion of the America’s Cup Economic Impact Study that has been commissioned by the Government and is to be released in July," Mr Burton said.
