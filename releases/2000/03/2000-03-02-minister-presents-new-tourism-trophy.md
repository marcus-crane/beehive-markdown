The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has marked the opening of the New Zealand Tourism Awards entry process by presenting a new trophy that will be awarded to this year's winner of the Small Operator Award.

The award is one of the Special Awards and recognises the significant contribution that small operators make to the New Zealand tourism industry. It is open to any tourism enterprise that employs less than five full-time equivalent staff.

Mr Burton said the Small Operator category is a significant one.

"Of the 16,500 tourism businesses in New Zealand, around 80 percent or 13,500 employ less than five people.

"These 13,500 tourism businesses are spread throughout New Zealand and have a crucial contribution to make to regional growth and employment. As Minister of Tourism I am delighted to be able to recognise this contribution."

The Small Operator Trophy – a carved model of a waka - was presented by the Minister to the chief executive of theTourism Industry Association, Glenys Coughlan. The TIA has taken over management of the New Zealand Tourism Awards. The gala evening announcing the finalists will be held in Wellington on August 11th 2000.

The New Zealand Tourism Awards categories cover all sectors of the tourism industry, ranging from activities and attractions, accommodation and transportation to retailing, environmental and cultural tourism products. The awards recognise innovation in areas like the environment, arts and cultural and training and development.

Entries for the New Zealand Tourism Awards opened this week.
