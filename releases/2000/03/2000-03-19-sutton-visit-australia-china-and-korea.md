Minister for Trade Negotiations Jim Sutton is to visit Australia on March 22-24  
before travelling on to China and Korea to progress trade issues.  
Mr Sutton will be the first minister from the new Government to visit China and  
Korea.  
His visit to Canberra completes an initial round of key meetings with Australian  
counterparts, after visits there by Prime Minister Helen Clark, Foreign Minister  
Phil Goff, and Defence Minister Mark Burton.  
While in Australia Mr Sutton will discuss a number of bilateral trade issues  
with counterpart Mark Vaile, as well as meeting with Agriculture Minister Warren  
Truss, several other Ministers, and key Opposition leaders.

"I will also have half a day in Melbourne to update myself on developments in  
the Australian dairy industry. The Australians are on the brink of significant  
dairy deregulation, and there may be opportunities for New Zealand dairy  
companies in this regard," he said.  
Mr Sutton said his visit to China and Korea reflected the importance New Zealand  
placed on its relationship with North Asia.

"China's reforms are opening up great new potential for New Zealand exporters  
and its pending accession to the World Trade Organisation will do much to turn  
that potential into reality," he said.  
"However right now there are outstanding issues which require Ministerial  
intervention to ensure a fair deal for our traders. The wool quota is one such  
issue and I will be taking the opportunity to discuss our access problems with  
Chinese Ministers."  
Mr Sutton said his visit also provided an opportunity to build a relationship  
with trade and agriculture counterparts in Beijing, and with business and local  
leaders in Shanghai, which was an increasingly important market and investment  
destination for New Zealand firms.  
In Korea, the Minister will address an APEC Forum on the subject of trade  
liberalisation and meet with ministers, businesspeople and representatives of  
New Zealand firms.  
"I will have some views to convey on the liberalisation of Korea's beef market,  
access for our stonefruit products, and problems being experienced in the velvet  
market," Mr Sutton said.  
"I will also be making a plug for New Zealand technology exports to the Korean  
market."  
"Following its spectacular economic recovery, with 10% growth last year, Korea  
is again a billion-dollar market for New Zealand and I want to ensure our  
businesses can make the most of their opportunities there"
