Minister for Trade Negotiations Hon Jim Sutton says that the Korean economy has  
rebounded from crisis faster than any other in Asia.  
Mr Sutton is currently visiting Korea, to attend the Asia Pacific Economic  
Co-operation Seoul Forum.  
The rebounding of the Korean economy opened up many new opportunities for New  
Zealand exporters, he said yesterday.  
"Our bilateral trade with Korea recovered by more than a third last year, to  
total $1.5 billion, which means we are back in business after Korea's economic  
crisis." Korea is New Zealand's fifth-largest export market.  
"New Zealand exports to Korea were worth just under $1 billion last year, driven  
by strong recoveries in Korea's manufacturing industries and consumer spending,"  
Mr Sutton said.  
"The outlook for New Zealand's important primary commodities such as timber and  
food is good, but it is apparent to me that there are also abundant  
opportunities in Korea for high-tech and value-added New Zealand exports."  
Mr Sutton said that during a meeting with Korea's Minister of Information and  
Communications Ahn Byung-yup, he was impressed by plans the Korean Government  
was developing to transform Korea into a knowledge-based economy.  
"Minister Ahn expects internet connections in Korea to double from 10 million to  
20 million by the end of this year.

"Such an explosion in information technology development offers major  
opportunities for New Zealand's innovative software and telecommunications  
industries, and will change the way other exporters do business in this market."  
Mr Sutton said there was also great potential in Korea for New Zealand's  
education and tourism services.  
"Korea's large and affluent middle class places a high value on seeking quality  
education in English-speaking countries.  
"Koreans are also travelling overseas again and New Zealand is well-placed to  
build on its good reputation to become a favourite destination for them."
