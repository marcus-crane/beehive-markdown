Professor Peter Gluckman has resigned as the convener of the Independent Biotechnology Advisory Council (IBAC), Pete Hodgson, Minister of Research, Science and Technology announced today.

The 10-member council was established by the previous Government in May 1999 to provide an independent source of advice and information on biotechnology for government and the public.

Professor Gluckman resigned to be more involved with a University of Auckland start-up company working on novel pharmaceuticals for treating brain disease. He was concerned to avoid any possible conflict of interest with IBAC.

"I am grateful for Professor Gluckman’s efforts in getting IBAC up and running, and giving it a clear sense of direction," Mr Hodgson said. "His contribution has been valuable and significant."

Mr Hodgson said he expected to appoint an acting convener shortly from amongst the sitting members of IBAC.
