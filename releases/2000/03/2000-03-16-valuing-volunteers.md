The Lottery Grants Board has set up a special $500,000 Fund to support International Year of Volunteers 2001, Board Chairperson and Internal Affairs Minister Mark Burton announced today.  
"The Fund is open to all non-profit-making community groups for 'one-off' projects to value the work of volunteers," Mr Burton said.  
"It provides a great opportunity to promote the range of voluntary work being carried out in communities all around the country, and to come up with new avenues to develop and upskill those who give so freely of their time to help others."  
With this in mind the Lottery Grants Board has identified two areas for funding - promotion and facilitation, Mr Burton said.  
"We are keen to help as many community groups as possible so have decided on a maximum grant level of $5,000 which will go to fund projects like publications and brochures and costs associated with volunteer training seminars."  
The closing date for applications is July 26 with a meeting to distribute funds to be held on October 26, 2000.  
Further information on funding criteria and application forms are available by calling freephone 0800 824 824.
