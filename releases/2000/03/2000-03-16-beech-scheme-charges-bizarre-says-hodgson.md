"The idea that ministers might have committed a crime in stopping the Timberlands West Coast beech scheme is kind of bizarre," Minister Responsible for Timberlands West Coast Pete Hodgson said today.

Mr Hodgson was responding to news that a group calling itself Rural Action New Zealand had filed criminal charges against himself, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister of Finance Dr Michael Cullen alleging that the cancellation of the beech scheme perverted the course of justice.

"It appears that those filing these charges are themselves guilty either of wishful thinking, or not much thinking at all," Mr Hodgson said.

"They are either wasting their money or somebody else's."
