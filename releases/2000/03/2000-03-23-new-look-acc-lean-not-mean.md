The Government ticked off another election pledge today with the passing of the Accident Insurance (Transitional Provisions) Bill and the Accident Insurance Amendment Bill. Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen said the Bill represents a major policy plank for both Labour and the Alliance partners in the coalition Government.

The new Act takes effect on April 1 2000. From this date new employers and employers whose private accident insurance contracts expire, will be insured automatically by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). From July 2000 ACC will handle all workplace accident insurance. Dr Cullen said the Act's passage marks the first part of a two-stage legislative programme to improve the ACC scheme. "This first stage is to unwind the private insurance market and lift the performance of ACC."

Also contained in the Act is the revival of the Accredited Employers Programme, where larger employers with good injury prevention and rehabilitation systems can pick up some of the risk themselves, in return for cheaper ACC levies.

Dr Cullen said the Act demonstrates the can-do and will-do attitude of the Coalition Government. "We have delivered on our promise to the public by removing private accident insurers from the workplace and we have delivered on our assurance to employers that the Coalition's ACC scheme will be cheaper than both the old ACC and private insurers. The new risk weighted average premium is $1.16 compared to the current $1.23 per $100 of wages. As well the cost of long-term claimants, 'the tail' has been stripped down from 67 cents to 40 cents for every $100 of wages and will continue to fall over time. I pay tribute to ACC's performance in this area."

Dr Cullen pledged to keep the new-look ACC lean but not mean. "In recent years ACC has lifted its game by refocussing on meaningful rehabilitation programmes. The Corporation will have no doubts regarding the high standards that this Government expects and demands – a steady focus on injury prevention, rehabilitation and fair compensation as well as a highly efficient operation.

"This Government expects Crown Entities like ACC to operate with prudence and compassion – never forgetting that the people who come through its doors are accident victims in need of professional help and support."

Dr Cullen said only a proper State-based system with true 24 hour, no fault cover can give long lasting security to all concerned. He expects opposition to the Act to die down once employers realise that they will not be paying more under a state system.

The second Bill, to be introduced in the middle of this year, will deliver on the Coalition's other accident compensation priorities such as fairer compensation, improved coverage and definitions. This Bill is expected to replace the Accident Insurance Act 1998 next year.
