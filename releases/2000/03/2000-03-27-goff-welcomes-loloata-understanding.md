The Loloata Understanding reached last night represents a significant and welcome achievement by both the Papua New Guinea Government and Bougainvillean leaders, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

"When talking with the parties to the conflict last week, it was clear to me that there was a genuine commitment to address the outstanding issues of autonomy for Bougainville and a referendum on the island's future.

"After so much violence and devastation that has crippled the island and deprived a whole generation it is a relief to see that commitment result in the Understanding.

"Although there is still work to be done, last night's Understanding agrees to a substantial level of autonomy for Bougainville and notes that the parties will address the issue of a referendum.

"I urge the PNG Cabinet and Parliament and Bougainvillean leadership to pick up what has been signed on their behalf and to take the process further forward," Mr Goff concluded.
