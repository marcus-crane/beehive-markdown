The Minister for Information Technology Paul Swain has today released Ministry for Economic Development briefing papers which support the government's online strategy.

Paul Swain said the Ministry's advice supports the government's plans to bring the ecommerce issue to the forefront of New Zealand's economic activity.

"The Government is going to establish an active partnership with local government, community and industry to transform New Zealand into an information economy," Paul Swain said.

"Our ecommerce strategy is part of the policy mix that will provide the vision and leadership New Zealand needs to transform itself from a commodity dependent, export based economy to one that adds value through knowledge and information.

"The papers emphasise the key role ecommerce will play in the future of an inclusive, innovative economy which will benefit all New Zealanders.

"In the middle of this year we will hold an ecommerce summit where the government will present a draft of its ecommerce strategy for discussion.

"It is vital that we receive proper feedback on the ecommerce strategy from the people who are actually out there working in the ecommerce environment," he said.

Mr Swain has also today released a paper from the Ministry of Justice outlining the need to address the legal framework required to facilitate ecommerce and to deal with electronic crime.

"Ecommerce covers a broad spectrum of activities and has the potential to expand New Zealand's economic base. But for New Zealanders to reap the benefits it requires an active response from the government," Mr Swain said.
