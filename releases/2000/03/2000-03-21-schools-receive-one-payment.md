Schools which are not bulk funded will receive news of a one-off payment next week as part of the Government's policy to move towards a fairer funding policy for schools.

During question time in Parliament today, Trevor Mallard said $15.1 million would be allocated to in the form of a one-off payment and schools would be notified of the amount late next week.

"This money was earmarked by the National Government to be distributed to schools which switched from central funding to bulk funding," Trevor Mallard said.

"National would have given this money back to Treasury. The new Government believes that this money was available for schools and it should be given to schools.

"Later this year I will be announcing a new funding system for schools so that the money previously earmarked for bulk funding will be distributed to all schools on an equitable basis."

Further details of the one-off payment will be released next week and schools would receive the payment next month.

Trevor Mallard also criticised bulk funded schools that he said were spreading misinformation about the effect of the Government's policies on their schools.

"Schools are making public statements about losing staff as a result of this policy, yet no school has shown me proof that any permanent staff will lose their jobs. We also recognise that there are some positive more flexible arrangements that bulk funded schools have enjoyed and that flexibility will be incorporated into the new system.

"For the past three years, bulk funded schools have received more than their fair share of the schools' funding kitty. This Government is prepared to pass on more funding to schools, but it will go to all schools – not just bulk funded schools," Trevor Mallard said.
