Minister of Forestry and Minister Responsible for Timberlands West Coast Ltd Pete Hodgson has appointed Nelson lawyer and former Labour MP John Blincoe as an adviser to assist him in implementing the Government's indigenous forests policy.

Mr Blincoe has begun working in Mr Hodgson's office this week on a short-term part-time basis.

"I am pleased to have Mr Blincoe's services," Mr Hodgson said. "I am also grateful that he has been able to begin work so promptly after I approached him about it just a few weeks ago."
