Schools which did not opt for bulk funding of their teacher salaries have been sent notification of how much money they will receive through a one-off payment announced in Parliament last week.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said letters sent to schools today included details of centrally resourced schools' share of the $15.1 million fund.

He said the money was available because the previous Government over-estimated the number of schools that would be enticed into bulk funding. It will be distributed as part of schools' quarterly operations funding payment on April 3.

"National would have given this money back to Treasury. The new Government believes that this money was available for schools and it should be given to schools. "

Trevor Mallard said the extra money each school will receive was based on a formula which took account of the size of its roll and its socio-economic decile rating. Payments would range from $700 for a small primary school in a high socio-economic area to $80,000 for a large secondary school in a low socio-economic area.

“The schools to share this funding comprise the 70% of state schools that have continued to have their teachers’ salaries paid through central resourcing.

“The Government is committed to a fair system of funding schools which encourages positive educational programmes to flourish. Those schools that stayed with central resourcing will be able to devote the extra money we are giving them to the educational priorities they see as most important. Bulk funded schools have praised the schemes they have been able to develop through the extra money. Centrally-resourced schools deserve a slice of that cake."

The Government has previously announced that it would abolish bulk funding for most schools in January 2001. Ministry officials are currently carefully working through the details of redistributing the long-term savings to all schools. The details of the redistribution will be released by the end of August, after consultation with the sector.

Trevor Mallard said following that announcement, he would ask boards to make a formal decision as to the use of the extra money and to communicate that decision to the Ministry.

"I have asked schools to start thinking how they will work through that process and where the priorities in their schools lie.

"Further changes to incorporate some of the flexibility valued by bulk funded schools will be introduced later in the year.

“We all want to ensure that the redistribution of bulk-funding money leads to the best educational outcomes for our kids. This one-off payment to centrally resourced schools announced today is the first step in the right direction," Trevor Mallard said.
