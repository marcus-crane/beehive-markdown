Education Minister Trevor Mallard said all secondary school boards would have student representatives from next year.

In Parliament today, Trevor Mallard said only 73% of secondary school boards had student representatives and the Government felt that students at all secondary school students should have the right to a say in board decisions through an elected member.

The change will be made as part of the Education Amendment Bill introduced to Parliament yesterday and due for debate next week.

"This step is necessary because in 1991 the National government decided that the very people those schools are set up to educate didn't need a say in that education. Since that time, senior students have not been represented on school boards as of right – despite that being an important aspect of the Tomorrow's Schools changes introduced by the previous Labour Government.

"Many secondary schools do have student representatives on their boards and I have never heard any complaints about the contribution they make.

"Student elections will be held by October of each year. This will enable a 'hand over and training' period from one years' representative to the next.

"An October election will also ensure the student representative is well established in their role before the next school year begins.

"I do not understand why National had so little faith in the ability of young people to contribute to the decision-make process where it has such a direct impact on their lives.

"At the time, the Human Rights Commission told National that making student representation optional was a "retrograde, unfortunate step" that went against the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. We think National should have listened to that advice," Trevor Mallard said.
