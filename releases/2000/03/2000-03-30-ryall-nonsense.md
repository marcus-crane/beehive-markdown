Housing Minister Mark Gosche said claims about the Government's housing policies by National's housing spokesman Tony Ryall were utter, desperate nonsense.

"Low income state house tenants are expecting income related rents and we will be delivering on this commitment before the end of the year," Mr Gosche said today.

"Mr Ryall and the National party's market rents have left thousands of Kiwi families living in poverty."

"This government's commitment is to those families and households."

"The housing pledge on our commitment card and our manifesto said Labour in government would 'restore income-related rents for state housing so that low income tenants pay no more than 25 percent of their income in rent."

"We will do this and we will do this before the end of 2000 – well ahead of the three-year term we had originally planned for."

"Recent studies show that 64 per cent of families living in Housing New Zealand homes were below the poverty threshold."

"Social service organisations and academics throughout the country have identified housing costs as the largest single cause of poverty in our country."

Earlier this month Mr Gosche visited iwi in Opotiki and locals told him that Mr Ryall, a neighbouring electorate MP, had never visited their rohe and looked at the housing problems there.

The last housing minister that had visited the area had been from the previous Labour government.

"Mr Ryall should be ashamed to let housing conditions like that go on for years in his own backyard," said Mr Gosche.

Mr Gosche said the government's income related rents initiative will be a key part of the first budget.
