The Ministerial Inquiry into Telecommunications began its work last week, meeting with key industry participants and a group of major telecommunications users. The Inquiry panel will meet with consumer groups in the near future.

The Inquiry was established to assess the regulatory regime for telecommunications, and recommend any changes. It has been asked to investigate and include particular comment on a range of issues, including:

„X the environment for telecommunications network access and interconnection, including Telecom¡¦s 0867 initiative;  
„X the development of an information economy;  
„X the Kiwi Share obligations; and  
„X numbering.

Mr Hugh Fletcher chairs the Inquiry. Other members are Ms Cathie Harrison and Mr Allan Asher. The Inquiry is due to report at the end of September.

The inquiry panel has now decided on the main features of the process it will follow in meeting the terms of reference and reporting to the Minister of Communications. This is as follows:
