The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, has accepted an application from the New Zealand and Central South Island Fish and Game Councils for a Water Conservation Order on the Rangitata River. Acceptance of the application will allow it to be considered on its merits. It does not constitute any form of approval for the application.

The Minister will now appoint a special Tribunal of three to five people to report on the application and recommend whether an order should be made or the application declined. The public will be able to make submissions to the Tribunal supporting or opposing the application.

The aim of water conservation orders is to preserve the outstanding values of waters in their natural state, or to protect waters that are modified but nevertheless contains outstanding characteristics. The Rangitata application seeks to protect what is regarded as an outstanding sports and native fishery.
