Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré is welcoming a campaign aimed at youth discrimination in Christchurch.

The Yellow Triangle Prevention Project is launched today by a coalition of young people, youth groups and other people opposed to the Christchurch Police's Yellow Triangle Scheme.

"I commend this group for taking steps to advance an issue they are concerned about," Laila Harré says.

"I have raised similar concerns about the Yellow Triangle Scheme and am discussing the issue with Police Minister George Hawkins."

The Yellow Triangle Prevention Project aims to raise awareness of the discriminatory nature of the scheme and stop it being implemented nationwide by the New Zealand Police.

It is promoted as a way to reduce car theft by using a yellow triangle sticker to identify vehicles that shouldn't be driven by under-25s.

The Christchurch Youth Council recently decided to reject the scheme.

"There's a real feeling among young people in Christchurch that his scheme reinforces negative stereotypes about youth, and the Yellow Triangle Prevention Project is a chance for these concerns to be heard," Laila Harré says.
