The Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister, Steve Maharey, said the Modern Apprenticeships scheme launched today is a key component of the Government's comprehensive employment and skills strategy.

Modern Apprenticeships is a new work-based education initiative, targeted at young people, providing a mentored and supported training pathway into highly valued skills and qualifications. Modern Apprenticeships programmes will be piloted by Skill New Zealand during the latter part of 2000 and following evaluation will be extended nationwide from 2001.

"The Government is determined to dramatically increase the number of young people entering apprenticeship training. Over the 1990s the average age of people in industry training rose so that by last year only 10 percent of trainees were in the 16 to 19 age bracket.

"The Government is not prepared to sit back and allow a significant segment of this generation of young people to drift off into long-term unemployment or a low-skilled future.

"Modern Apprenticeships fit well with the series of steps we are taking to ensure New Zealanders are well positioned for today's knowledge society.

"We want to make Modern Apprenticeships a viable option for small and large employers. Apprenticeship Coordinators will be appointed to assist employers to recruit and manage the training of apprentices. The Coordinators will also provide ongoing mentoring, training support and problem solving advice to apprentices.

"The Government will be looking to industry, education and training providers – including polytechnics and ITOs – local authorities and iwi to develop partnerships around the delivery of this initiative.

"Reflecting the Government's determination to close the gaps, Apprenticeship Coordinators will be explicitly accountable for the outcomes for Maori and Pacific Island trainees.

"Modern Apprenticeships will lead to a nationally recognised trade qualifications at levels three and four of the National Qualifications Framework. We want Modern Apprenticeships to be seen as a high prestige training option which many young New Zealanders will aspire to.

"The Government has carefully considered similar programmes in Australia and the United Kingdom. In learning from their experiences we have developed a distinctive New Zealand scheme which will meet the needs of trainees and their employers.

"We will be investing $5.5m in Modern Apprenticeships this financial year to fund piloting and the roll out for the first half of 2001. The Government is aiming to have 3,000 modern apprentices in training after the scheme goes nationwide next year," Steve Maharey said.
