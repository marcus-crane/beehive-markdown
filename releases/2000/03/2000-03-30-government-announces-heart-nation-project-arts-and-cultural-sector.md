Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced that Hamish Keith has been appointed to convene the Heart of the Nation project to develop a strategic plan for the arts and cultural sector.

"This government has a vision for a vibrant arts and cultural sector which all New Zealanders can enjoy, and through which a strong and confident cultural identity can emerge.

"We also believe a strong creative industry sector can provide employment and contribute to economic growth, building on the success of projects like the filming of Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.

"The Heart of the Nation project aims to involve the arts and cultural sector in developing a strategic plan which will enable arts and cultural activities to flourish.

"Mr Keith will embark on a consultative process with key stakeholders and interest groups. We intend harnessing the energy, passion and wisdom of people involved in the arts and cultural sectors to develop workable structures and processes, and to contribute to policy development.

"The Heart of the Nation project will identify goals and objectives, recommend strategies, and identify issues for the government to consider in how to support the implementation of the strategic plan for the sector."

Judith Tizard said Mr Keith is expected to report back to the government by 31 May 2000.
