South Island freshwater eels will be introduced to the Quota Management System by October 1 this year, Minister of Fisheries Pete Hodgson said today.  
Mr Hodgson said the South Island eel fishery was being brought into the QMS ahead of other species because of the Crown’s obligations under the 1998 Ngai Tahu Deed of Settlement.

"This represents a significant component of the Settlement between the Crown and Ngai Tahu," Mr Hodgson said. "I am pleased that the changes announced today will enable the fishery to be introduced to the QMS within the specified timeframe.

"As well as meeting the Settlement obligations, bringing eels into the QMS will enable long term sustainable management of this important fishery for the benefit of all New Zealanders."  
The change will be made by amendments to the Fisheries Act 1996.
