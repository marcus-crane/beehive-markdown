The Attorney-General, Hon Margaret Wilson, announced today the appointment of Dr Susan Glazebrook as a Judge of the High Court.

Since 1988, Justice Glazebrook has been a partner in the law firm, Simpson Grierson. She is a leading specialist in taxation, banking and finance law.

Justice Glazebrook was president of the Inter-Pacific Bar Association in 1998. She is a board member of the New Zealand Pacific Economic Co-operation Council. She is also a trustee of the National Provident Fund and a director of Counties Manukau Health.

She has been a member of a number of committees providing advice to the Government and the commercial sector on taxation and public policy matters. In 1991, she was a member of the State Sector Reform steering committee, responsible for the review of the state sector reforms and in particular the State Sector Act and the Public Finance Act.

Justice Glazebrook has published extensively, including co-authorship on two editions of a leading commercial text entitled "The New Zealand Accrual Regime – A Practical Guide".

Justice Glazebrook graduated from Auckland University with a LLB (Honours) degree and MA degree with first class Honours in History. In 1988, she completed her doctorate in French Legal History at Oxford University. She has worked in France with a Government-funded organisation responsible for the resettlement of political refugees and was a part-time lecturer in the Department of Commercial Law at Auckland University.

The Attorney-General said that Dr Glazebrook's appointment further cements the commercial expertise of the High Court bench. The Attorney-General is pleased that Dr Glazebrook, who has combined a highly successful career in commercial law with an accomplished academic background, has agreed to take up her new position.

The new Judge will be sworn in on 14 June. She will sit in Auckland.
