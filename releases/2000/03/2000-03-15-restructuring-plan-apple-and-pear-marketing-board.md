The Minister of Agriculture, the Hon Jim Sutton, said today that he was  
delighted to confirm the restructuring plan of the Apple and Pear Marketing  
Board.  
The plan, submitted under the Apple and Pear Industry Restructuring Act 1999,  
was passed with overwhelming support by a grower referendum earlier this week.  
Mr Sutton's confirmation of the board's restructuring plan is the last formal  
involvement of the minister in the board's restructuring. As of April 1, it will  
be corporatised into ENZA Limited.
