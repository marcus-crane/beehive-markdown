The Minister of Local Government Hon Sandra Lee has cautioned the Rodney District Council today, saying it must set about fulfilling its statutory responsibilities or it may confront the prospect of central government intervention.

“I encourage the councillors who have remained in their posts to carry out their duties and to rebuild their electors’confidence in the local democratic process,” Ms Lee said. “A failure to do so inevitably invites intervention.”

“Without pre-judging any previous advice I have received on the Rodney situation, I am simply reminding the remaining councillors of their responsibilities under the law, and I encourage them to act accordingly for the benefit of the people they represent.”

“The future prosperity of residents and businesses in Rodney District now hinges on the willingness of its local authority to exhibit good governance,” said Ms Lee, “and I urge the councillors not to disappoint the people who trusted them with their vote.”

The Local Government Minister is currently undertaking statutory consultation on the recommendation of the Ministerial Review Authority to appoint a commissioner to run the council. The parties that the Minister has to consult, including the Rodney District Council, have up to 20 working days to respond to her with their views on the recommendations. That consultation period concludes on 5 April.

"I will continue in the meantime to monitor the actions of the council carefully," Ms Lee said.
