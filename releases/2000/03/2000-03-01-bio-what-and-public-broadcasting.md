The Minister for the Environment and Biosecurity, Marian Hobbs, will launch "Bio-what?" in the Waikato next Thursday (March 9).

"Bio-what? " is the report of a ministerial advisory committee appointed early last year to consider how to protect remaining natural areas on, or affected by, the use of private land.

The launch will take place at Bill Garland's farm at Kairangi, south of Cambridge, at noon.

The report considers who should be responsible for biodiversity, what rights landowners have, who should bear the costs of sustainable management and how to progress the objective without alienating the very people who need to be involved.

John Kneebone, a former president of Federated Farmers, chaired the committee.

Marian Hobbs, who is also Minister of Broadcasting, will be in Hamilton the previous evening (March 8) to talk about the future of public broadcasting.

She will address a public meeting, organised by the Hamilton Labour Women's Branch, at St Peter's Cathedral Centre, Victoria Street at 7.30pm.

MP Dianne Yates will chair the meeting.
