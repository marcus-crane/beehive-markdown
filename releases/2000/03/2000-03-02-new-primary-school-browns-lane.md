The new subdivision of Browns Lane, Howick South, will have a new primary school in 2001, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The decision to establish the contributing primary school - for children up to year six (standard four) - follows consultation with the local community and other schools nearby.

Trevor Mallard thanked all parents and schools who participated in the consultation process.

“I have carefully considered their views and I know the establishment of this school will be warmly welcomed by the growing community of Browns Lane."

The Minister of Education said existing schools in Howick were reaching capacity, and the latest forecasts indicated that there would be about 600 extra 5-10 year olds in the Browns Lane area by 2006.

While there was sufficient capacity at Somerville and Howick intermediates in the short term, it was expected that a new intermediate school, or a full primary school would be needed within the next few years.

Shortly, the Ministry would call community nominations for the establishment board of the primary school. The board is responsible for appointing staff, including the principal, and working with the Ministry to ensure the school is set up successfully.

Point View School and Somerville Intermediate School, in Howick, opened in 1997.
