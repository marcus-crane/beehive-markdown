Marine oil spill specialists and conservation experts have been mobilised and  
are responding to the recent sinking of the fishing vessel Sea Fresh One on the  
eastern side of the Chatham Islands the Ministers of Transport and Conservation  
confirmed today.

"This is a very serious incident. The Maritime Safety Authority have declared  
it a Tier Three Response which means the authority has taken direct control of  
the situation," the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said today.

"The situation is being closely monitored," he said.

Conservation Minister Sandra Lee said it was always a concern when potential oil  
spill incidents occurred near vulnerable areas.

"The Department of Conservation is monitoring this situation very closely and  
has an emergency response team ready if needed, to protect the Chatham Islands  
Oyster Catcher (bird) and other species that might be affected if oil reached  
the coast," said Ms Lee.

"DOC is also working closely with the MSA," she added.
