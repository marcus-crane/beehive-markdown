Police Minister Hon. George Hawkins has welcomed a higher police street presence in central Wellington.

Wellington Central Police have opened a Beat Section which will operate from a community policing kiosk in Cuba Street.

There, six staff will focus on inner-city policing and will see five community constables walking the beat.

"The new Beat Section will show an obvious police presence in and around Wellington's central area, including Cuba Street and Manners Mall," George Hawkins said.

"The police and the Wellington City Council will share rental costs. This is a shared commitment to making inner city streets safer," he said.

Two police officers also suggested a return to wearing police beat-helmets.

"Walking the beat, talking to shop owners and shoppers, and generally being a part of the community is an essential part of modern policing," George Hawkins said. "It is taking the best of yesterday's policing and making it work for today.

"Clearly the sight of uniformed officers walking the beat ensures shoppers, particularly older people, feel safer when in the city.

"Other districts throughout the country could do well to adopt a similar approach to community policing," George Hawkins said.
