The Ministry of Fisheries will review the monitoring system for managing  
southern bluefin tuna, Minister of Fisheries Pete Hodgson said today.

Southern bluefin tuna is a valuable species caught off the west coast of the  
South Island and the northeast coast of the North Island.

The review of the monitoring system follows an increase in fishing effort in  
the fishery by New Zealand vessels in the1999 season, and subsequent  
overcatch of New Zealand's catch limit by 37 tonnes. The catch limits are  
set by international agreement between Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

"Improvement to the tuna catch monitoring system is necessary to allow  
better control of catch levels as the limit is approached," Mr Hodgson  
said. "It is important that catch is controlled because of our concern about  
the sustainability of fishing for southern bluefin and our international  
obligations."

Following last season's bluefin overcatch, the New Zealand catch limit for  
the 2000 season of 420 tonnes will be reduced by 37 tonnes. The Ministry of  
Fisheries will be discussing the review of the catch monitoring system with  
domestic tuna fishing interests.
