Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is eagerly anticipating the outcome of a High Court case on predatory pricing.

The case was taken by the Commerce Commission against Carter Holt Harvey last year and judgment is expected any day.

Today the Commission advised Mr Anderton that it is waiting on that decision to provide guidance on how to deal with predatory pricing.

Mr Anderton complained to the Commission about petrol prices. He wants an explanation for why major petrol companies charge lower retail prices in the few areas of the country where they face competition from small independent suppliers.  
He also says retail petrol prices have not fallen enough compared to falling prices of crude oil.

The Commerce Commission investigated price fixing in the petrol industry twice recently. After one of those investigations, three companies were fined more than a million dollars. Last year the Commission found no evidence of collusion in retail price increases associated with increases in the price of crude oil.

"As Minister for Economic Development I am very concerned to ensure that New Zealanders enjoy the lowest possible prices for petrol to ensure that money is spent on productive, job-rich enterprise rather than on fattening the profits of oil companies. The regions of New Zealand need to be assured that they are not paying excessive prices because of a lack of fair competition," Jim Anderton said.

"The Commission is continuing to monitor petrol prices. At the moment it is only able to act if there is evidence of collusion or an intention to create a dominant market position. The Government is currently reviewing the Commerce Act.

"Petrol companies need to explain to the people of New Zealand why they charge 5 or 6 cents a litre less in Tauranga, and certain streets in Auckland when they face competition from a small competitor. If they can afford to charge less there, why can't they afford to charge less elsewhere?

"The outcome of the High Court case will doubtless provide valuable guidance on the best way to respond to the pricing policies of the major companies."
