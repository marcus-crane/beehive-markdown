“It is up to councils, in consultation with their communities, to decide on the services and the levels of service that councils should be providing,” the Minister of Local Government said today.

“Different communities may come to different conclusions on how services will be provided. “The test of any decisions taken by Wellington City Council regarding its assets should be in the hands of its community.”

The Alliance and Labour, now in Government, fought the election on a policy of ending asset sales. At local government level this means no longer encouraging the sale or further privatisation of locally held utilities or other strategic assets.

The Minister said that “the era of selling off the family silver for a quick buck is over. This Government will ensure that the processes and criteria through which decisions about the retention and management of assets are made are no longer biased towards privatisation.”
