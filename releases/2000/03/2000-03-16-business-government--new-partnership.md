The Coalition Government is inviting the business community to take part in a new style partnership relationship, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Speaking at the Employers and Manufacturers Association Business Environment 2000 conference in Auckland, Dr Cullen said the Coalition Government is pro-business. "It isn't a government that sees business as a cash cow to be milked to fund lavish social programmes. Nor is it a government that leaves business to the mercies of global market forces in the mistaken belief that markets create a natural order of things.

"We are seeking partnerships with business and communities – hand-on rather than arms-length government. But sometimes I get the feeling I am dealing with the protest movement of the new millennium. Business has mobilised around issues like ACC, the Employment Relations Bill, tax and so on."

"The business community needs to take care it does not become its own worst enemy by being sucked into a cycle of perpetual grievance over government policies it opposes.

"I believe business needs to see the changes we are making to industrial legislation as contributing more to a sustainable pattern of development, not as being anti-business.

"The government does not believe in a wild-west business environment. Business can and should grow in a civilised and equitable way. For example, a negative feature of the Employment Contracts Act was that it tended to empower the 'cowboy bosses'. Its time to put balance, common sense and good faith in the employment relationship." Dr Cullen said.

However he acknowledged there has been some relief to criticism over changes to the ECA and ACC. "There has been a certain sweetness over the support we have received from the business community over some of our other initiatives, most notably the economic development strategy. Without a trace of irony, employers concede that the last government did little for manufacturers and exporters." Dr Cullen said.
