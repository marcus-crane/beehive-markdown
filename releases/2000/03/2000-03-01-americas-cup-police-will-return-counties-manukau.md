Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said police officers who have been seconded from Counties Manukau police district to the Americas Cup special operations team, will be returned.

George Hawkins was responding to newspaper articles that suggest Manukau may permanently lose police to the viaduct basin.

"I have contacted Police Headquarters and have been advised that once the Americas Cup special operations team is disbanded, all officers will return to their original police districts," George Hawkins said.

He said claims are not correct that Auckland district commander Supt. Howard Broad is to make a "formal request" to permanently increase police numbers at Auckland's viaduct basin.

"Counties Manukau, along with Waitakere/North Shore need, and will get, their full allocation of frontline police officers," George Hawkins said.
