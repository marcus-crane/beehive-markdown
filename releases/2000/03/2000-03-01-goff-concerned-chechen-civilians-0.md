During a call today by the new Russian Ambassador, Gennady Shabannikov, Foreign Minister Phil Goff expressed serious concern over the humanitarian plight of civilians in Chechnya and on reported atrocities against civilians and detainees.

"The international community understands Russia's concern to combat terrorism. However, the relentless and indiscriminate use of force in civilian areas is not a proportionate response and the lasting hatred that such actions create will almost certainly encourage on-going terrorist and guerilla activity," Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff urged Russia to allow a permanent international monitoring presence in Chechnya, given the numerous reports of atrocities and human rights abuses."We are pleased that Russia has appointed its own Special Representative. But the Special Representative appears to have no direct mandate to investigate or report on complaints.

Mr Goff asked why the UN Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, had been denied access to Chechnya and why the Red Cross had not been granted access to detainees held by Russian forces.

"The Ambassador stated that the Russian Central Government was not behind human rights violations but there had regrettably been individual violations. He said 130 cases were currently under investigation and those who were found guilty would be punished.Mr Goff concluded, "the Russian Government must investigate and act upon any findings of atrocities and torture on detainees. It should allow reputable international rights organisations to monitor its actions and the situation on the ground.

"There must also be urgent relief applied to the high levels of suffering and distress visited on the civilian population caught up in the war. A durable resolution will only be found through political dialogue and negotiations".

GOFF DISAPPOINTED THAT PINOCHET NOT BROUGHT TO TRIAL  
Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today that he regrets the fact that the former  
Chilean dictator, General Pinochet, has not been brought to trial.  
Mr Goff said that he accepts the principle that a person assessed as medically  
unfit cannot be brought to trial.  
"However, the fact that General Pinochet may now never be held to account will  
deeply disappoint the families of those who were victims of savage human  
rights abuses following the military coup in Chile in 1973.  
"They understandably will feel that justice has not been done. Ironically the  
judicial system has been kinder to Mr Pinochet that his regime was to its many  
victims.  
"Nevertheless, the International community can at least take heart that the  
principle has been laid down that dictators who are responsible for human  
rights abuses are no longer beyond the reach of the rule of law.  
"The fact that he was arrested and that his claim of immunity was rejected has  
taken us a lot further along the road towards curbing human rights abuse  
around the world.  
"It will reinforce the message that leaders whose regimes violate human rights  
will be vulnerable to international legal action."
