Latest research from NZ on Air, reinforces her contention that New Zealanders want more local content, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, said today.

"The 1999 Local Content Survey shows that we value local content but that we're barely holding our own," Marian Hobbs said.

Three documents released by NZ on Air illustrate what broadcasting looks like, how audiences perceive it and where it might go.

"We need to look creatively and critically at how television is meeting our needs," Ms Hobbs said. "This research will be a useful reference point as we develop broadcasting policy.

"Television's potential, in particular, as a vehicle for New Zealand content and New Zealand talent has not been realised. The record of the last 10 years since the passing of the current Broadcasting Act is one of under-performance."
