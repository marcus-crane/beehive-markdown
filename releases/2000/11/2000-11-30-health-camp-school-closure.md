Te Kura Hauora in Rotorua will be closed next April, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The closure of the school, which is on the grounds of the Princess of Wales Health Camp, will be effective from April 6 next year.

Trevor Mallard said today’s decision followed ongoing problems with the governance, management, structure and staffing at the school, and over the relationship between the school and the camp.

“It has been made clear to me that the separate governance arrangement hindered effective delivery of services to the children and their families.

“However schools consulted have expressed the view that effective child and family health and education services must be offered. With that in mind, I want to see collaborative health and education interventions offered through the Princess of Wales Health Camp.

“The Ministry of Education will now negotiate a service agreement to ensure that education will continue to be provided to children referred to the Princess of Wales Health Camp from the beginning of the second term in 2001. Such arrangements are already in place in situations like child, youth and family residential centres.
