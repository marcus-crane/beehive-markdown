"We have done it. Tairawhiti has now got a blueprint and a structure to develop the region and boost jobs," said Jim Anderton Deputy Prime Minister today as he launched the 44 page report of the groundbreaking Tairawhiti Development Taskforce.

"Six months ago I said that if I couldn¡¦t help Tairawhiti as Deputy Prime Minister, it couldn't be done, but we have done it. What I found in Tairawhiti were committed people and groups with the ideas and strength to boost Tairawhiti. My colleagues Hon Parekura Horomia and Janet Mackey MP and I have worked with the local councils, runanga, companies and individuals," Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Anderton said today.

"This is a major achievement as we have together developed a cooperative approach to mobilising community resources to help the region. We have achieved much, and we have also laid the path for future development. Today I hand over the chairing of the Taskforce to the Mayors of Gisborne and Wairoa two excellent local representatives who will lead the implementation of the next stage of the report," said Jim Anderton.

Achievements include:  
„h Creating the Taskforce with all the key players in the region, and a commitment from them to continue working together.  
„h The announcement of a regional road, port and rail review to develop proposals for securing the transport networks in and out of the region. The process will involve the Taskforce, the Ministry of Economic Development, local regional and district councils, the Ministry of Transport, Transfund, and Transit New Zealand.  
„h Providing 2000 computers for schools and communities in the region (Project Rorohiko).  
„h $2.3 million from the Ministries of Education, Maori Affairs and Economic Development for installing the computers, providing software and training support to get them running.  
„h Establishment of thirteen regional hubs of computers around Tairawhiti.  
„h Young people undertaking the Army's Limited Service Volunteer training scheme.  
„h A calendar of events and activities for the region so that regional support could be provided to activities that are underway.  
„h $240,000 over three years by the Ministry of Agriculture for an advisory service to improve productive use of Maori land in the Tairawhiti region.  
„h A home safety advertising campaign on local radio stations.
