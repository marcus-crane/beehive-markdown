Minister of internal Affairs Hon. George Hawkins said Waitangi Day is a celebration for all New Zealanders.

"Waitangi Day is a day where New Zealander's pay respect to the Treaty of Waitangi. Furthermore, communities throughout New Zealand take pride in New Zealand's one nation two peoples identity.

"That is what Waitangi Day is all about," George Hawkins said.

"This February 2001, the Crown will not be attending celebrations in Waitangi.

"I believe all communities have a share in Treaty of Waitangi celebrations, and this year the Crown will be attending celebrations at centres throughout the country," George Hawkins said.
