Cabinet Minister Lianne Dalziel will deliver the opening address to the annual conference of the National Assembly of People with Disabilities (DPA) in Hamilton tomorrow.

Lianne Dalziel said her appointment, as Minister for Disability Issues would send a strong message to the Disability Sector that the government remains committed the Disability Strategy.

"The Disability Sector should be encouraged that my appointment will ensure the momentum of work already achieved will not subside. Given my current responsibilities for Special Education and Senior Citizens, I am well placed to step into this role.

"This will also ensure that the Disability Issues portfolio stands apart from Health as it has done since Ruth Dyson was the first Minister appointed to take up the role.

"When I address the DPA conference tomorrow, I will be reinforcing the work the Ruth has already done, and that I am personally committed to continuing."

"The DPA paid tribute to Ruth untiring efforts in placing this strategy high on the agenda and I want to assure the DPA that I will carry on her personal commitment to the Disability Sector. I will be working closely with Ruth to ensure a seamless continuation of work on the Disability Strategy.

"I am no stranger to Disability Issues having sat on the select committee that worked through the Humans Rights Bill which for the first time included disability as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. At the time I was opposition spokesperson on disability issues and I worked closely with DPA then. I want to resume this close working relationship with DPA as we enter into the next phase of the Disability Strategy."
