Spouses and partners of long-term business migrants are now eligible for multiple entry open work visas and permits, the Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

"The situation we had in the past actually discouraged people from applying for Long-Term Business visas because spouses were required to qualify for work permits in their own right if they wanted to work.

"These spouses were expected to meet normal work visa or permit policy criteria including the requirement that no other New Zealander was available to undertake the work. This was the case even when the business that was the subject of the Long-Term Business Visa application, was intended to be a family business.

"This was a problem identified by the Business Migration Liaison Unit, immigration consultants and many of the businesspeople who attended the Business Forum in Auckland last month.

"I've decided that spouses and partners of people holding Long-Term Business permits, can now be issued with multiple entry open work visas and permits. I believe this policy will help to make New Zealand a more attractive destination for business migrants.

"This move to assist the partners of successful Business Visa applicants, will also make our Business Visa policy more competitive with other countries promoting similar schemes for business migrants."
