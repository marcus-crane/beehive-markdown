"The rebound in business confidence shown in the latest National Bank survey  
suggests the winter of discontent is over and that the economy is in for a good summer," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"Particularly encouraging is that a net 16.6 percent of respondents now expect their own businesses to pick up activity over the next 12 months.

"Farmers and manufacturers are leading the return to optimism, reflecting the fact that this is very much an export-led recovery," Dr Cullen said.
