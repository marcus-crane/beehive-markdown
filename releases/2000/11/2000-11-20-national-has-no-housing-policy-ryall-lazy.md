"It is clear that the National Party has no housing policy," Housing Minister Mark Gosche said from Melbourne today.

He was commenting on recent criticisms made by National's Housing spokesman Tony Ryall. Despite his regular comments on housing policy, Mr Ryall recently revealed that his party had no housing policy and that they were in fact, 'back to the drawing board.'

"Mr Ryall has obviously been looking at the drawing board for 12 months and still come up with nothing, he is as lazy in opposition as he was in Government."

"Next month this Government will deliver a key promise when we restore income-related rents for state house tenants who have endured a 106% rent rise since 1992 thanks to the previous Government's market rents. Inflation over the same period rose 12%, while private rents rose 23%."

"So far statistics show that more than 58% of some of the neediest state tenants are going to be $20 - $60 better off each week. I know this is going to make a huge difference in the lives of some of our most vulnerable families."

From December 1, 2000 all state house rents will depend on a tenant's income. Low-income tenant's will pay no more than 25% of their income on rent. A new social policy allocation process will also be used from next month. The new policy delivers on a key election promise - two years ahead of time.

"Furthermore our Government is continuing to spend more than $700 million a year on accommodation assistance for low-income families renting from private landlords or purchasing homes."

"We have also introduced a new social allocation process to ensure the neediest families get help first."

"We are beginning to address the legacy of poverty left by the previous Government. "
