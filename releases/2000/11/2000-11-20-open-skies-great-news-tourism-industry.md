The Open Skies Agreement with Australia has enormous significance for the New Zealand tourism industry, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said.

"Australia is New Zealand largest tourism market, representing nearly a third of visitors.

"Australia is also a key link in travel to New Zealand from other countries. Nearly 60% of visitors to New Zealand from other parts of the world also visit Australia on the same trip.

"The Open Skies agreement will remove many restrictions on routes and capacity and will minimise other administrative barriers to easier travel.

"Inbound tour operators will be able to further customise their packages and independent travellers will have far more choice and flexibility when booking a holiday to New Zealand.

"To retain its position as a premium tourist destination, New Zealand must seek to offer its overseas visitors a quality and hassle-free experience – and today's agreement will do much to assist that," Mark Burton said.
