The Minister of Defence Mark Burton and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton have confirmed that work is proceeding on the disposal of Hobsonville Air Force Base.

"Officials are investigating the early sale of a small site on the Base in accordance with the Public Works Act,” the Ministers said today.

"The Public Works Act requires that due process be followed including offer back obligations to former owners where appropriate.

"All legitimate interests including those of Maori will be protected. The process is a fair and detailed one, and it can take some time to work through.

"The current owner of the site, the New Zealand Defence Force, is working with the Ministry of Economic Development, Land Information New Zealand, Office of Treaty Settlements, Department of Conservation, Te Puni Kokiri and the Waitakere City Council to facilitate the sales process.

"This sort of co-operation is a hallmark of this Government’s new approach to regional economic development," Mark Burton and Jim Anderton said.
