The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Margaret Wilson, has advised Tainui that the final capital payment due to Waikato-Tainui under the 1995 Deed of Settlement will be made tomorrow.

"As the directors have been unable to instruct the Crown where to pay the funds the cheque will be delivered to the registered office of Waikato Raupatu Trustee Company Limited," said Ms Wilson.

"The disposition of the payment is a matter for Tainui alone. The Crown's legal obligation under the Deed of Settlement to make the payment of $13,628,792.90 has now been discharged".
