Justice Minister Phil Goff today released Dr Francis Small's report on the Ministerial Inquiry into INCIS.

"While the Inquiry did not set out to apportion blame for the failure of the INCIS project, it has identified numerous, interrelated and complex reasons why the INCIS project did not achieve its objectives," Mr Goff said.

"No single cause resulted in the failure. But the combined effect of the causes meant that INCIS would almost certainly fail.

"The Inquiry's report describes the way in which the INCIS project progressed over time, identifies many problems and weaknesses with the project, and captures lessons that can be learned from those experiences.

"The report also recommends a series of measures that address issues relating to the approval, selection and management of information technology projects in the public sector. It acknowledges that most of these lessons have been identified by the parties involved and, in many cases, improved procedures already put in place.

"Government has a responsibility to ensure that public funds are spent wisely and that, in higher risk areas such as the provision of information technology solutions, appropriate mechanisms and governance frameworks are in place to ensure risks are appropriately mitigated.

"An officials group, chaired by the State Services Commission, will consider the Inquiry's recommendations against current practices in the state sector, and recommend further changes where necessary. They will report back by 31 March 2001."
