The idea of hosting and guesting and the etiquette behind those ideas has existed for centuries, it is not new, says Hon Tariana Turia.

As Max Beerbohm states 'Mankind is divided into two great classes, hosts and guests'.'

"The polite host ensures the guest are accorded the dignity and respect a guest deserves. They do this by providing them with all that the guest could possibly deem necessary.

"The polite guest, in turn, accords the dignity and respect to the host who is hosting them by accepting what is provided by the host. Thus developing a considerate and respectful relationship.

"I believe people today, do not expect guests they have invited into their houses, to take over the running of their house. I do not expect somebody, I invite into my house, to take over the running of my house. This would seem a little odd.

"Most parents would be embarrassed when their children forget their manners. I believe the fast living urban lifestyle changes often results in people forgetting their manners.

"For decades hapu and iwi have been pursuing ways in which they can be polite and responsible hosts within their rohe. I am sure they will continue to do so", said Tariana Turia today.
