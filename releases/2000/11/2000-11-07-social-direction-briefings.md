The Government is inviting a range of local body and community representatives to a briefing and discussion on the Government’s social policy direction, the Minister of Social Services and Employment Steve Maharey announced today.

The first of the briefings would be held in Auckland on 17 November. Other briefings and discussions would be held later in Christchurch and Wellington. Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey, Justice Minister Phil Goff and Women's Affairs Minister Laila Harré will attend the first feedback meeting in Auckland. Other Ministers are attending the Christchurch and Wellington meetings.

“This year the Government has been active across all social policy areas, implementing its health, education, housing and other social sector policies and programmes.

“We would like to complete the year by bringing an invited cross-section of representatives from these social sector areas up to date on what has been happening and where we are heading.

“These are designed to be small informal briefings that provide an opportunity for a number of Government Ministers to give an overview of the Government’s broad social policy direction, and to have a discussion with representatives from the community about that direction,” Steve Maharey said.
