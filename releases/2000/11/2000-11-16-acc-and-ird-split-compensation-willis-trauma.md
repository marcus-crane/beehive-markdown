Revenue and Accident Insurance Minister Michael Cullen has instructed ACC and IRD to work out the level of appropriate compensation to be paid to an Auckland couple - after an ACC dispute that dragged on for 14 years.

"I have asked IRD commissioner John Perham and ACC Chief Executive Garry Wilson to appoint an independent assessor to decide the level of compensation which should be paid to Jan and Murray Willis.

"Given the nature of the dispute with IRD over the ACC categorisation of their worker, it is sensible that the cost of compensation be split between them."

Dr Cullen said he was impressed with the apology that Commissioner John Perham had given to the couple at yesterday's finance and expenditure select committee.
