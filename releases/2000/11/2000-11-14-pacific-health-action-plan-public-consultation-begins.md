Health Minister Annette King is encouraging Pacific people to attend fono to be held around the country to help develop a strategy aimed at improving Pacific health.

The fono, which begin tomorrow, are being held so people can discuss the goals and objectives underlying the development of the Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan.

Mrs King said the plan provided the first real strategic approach to improving the health of Pacific people, and reducing health disparities between Pacific people and other New Zealanders. "The plan has a long term approach aimed at supporting Pacific people in taking leading roles in addressing the health concerns of Pacific communities.

"The action plan seeks to enhance primary care, screening programmes and mental health services for Pacific people, improve the health of Pacific children and increase the size of the Pacific workforce. The plan also focuses on improving community services for key Pacific health issues such as diabetes, asthma, injury prevention and immunisation, and to improve the collection of quality Pacific health information.

"One of our Pacific providers has immunised 90 per cent of the children in their practice, well above the national average. Through an approach aimed at developing Pacific providers we want to improve access to primary healthcare and other community based services and make this type of success the norm."

In October Mrs King announced the names of 14 primary care providers who will receive funding from the $1.5 million she announced on June 7 when reinstating the Pacific Island Provider Development Fund.

"The development of the Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan and key initiatives such as the reinstatement of the Pacific Island Provider Development Fund are important steps in turning the health status of Pacific people around," Mrs King said.
