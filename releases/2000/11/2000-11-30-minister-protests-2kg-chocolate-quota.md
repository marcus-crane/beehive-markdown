Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton distributed 2 kilograms of chocolate to diplomats at a function in Wellington today to demonstrate the barriers on many New Zealand agricultural exports.

The United States imposes a quota on New Zealand chocolate – only one kilogram of low-fat chocolate and one kilogram of "normal" chocolate is able to be exported to the United States each year.

Mr Sutton told the Diplomatic Club – a group of diplomats based in Wellington – that access to markets was a key part of agricultural sector negotiations taking place in Geneva now.

He said that while complaints about the "big three" products barred access – dairy, rice, and sugar – were well-known, there were many other products that faced similar problems. For New Zealand, these included chocolate in the United States, sliced deer velvet into South Korea, and pastries into Japan.

"Taken individually, the impact of these barriers may be small. But collectively, the thousands of such examples have a real impact on New Zealand and on other countries."

Mr Sutton said New Zealand was not being ideological about trade access, nor were we seeking to ruin the environment or hinder rural development.

"Non-trade objectives such as these are not in question. It is the instruments used to pursue them that need to be looked at."
