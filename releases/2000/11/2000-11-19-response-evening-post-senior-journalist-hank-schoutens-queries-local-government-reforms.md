Rates

The review of the local government funding powers review will encompass the  
Rating Powers Act 1988, the Rates Rebate Act 1973, relevant provisions in  
the Local Government Act 1974 and other legislation conferring funding  
powers on local government. The objective of the review is a range of  
funding mechanisms for local government that will help them to identify and  
achieve objectives that meet the current needs, interests and aspirations  
of local communities.

Legislation resulting from the review is scheduled for enactment by the end  
of next year, so it can come into force for the financial year commencing  
in July 2002.

Elected Member Remuneration

The Government has decided, after a comprehensive review process, to  
implement a significant change to the current system for determining local  
authority elected member remuneration. The proposed change will require an  
amendment to the Local Government Act to empower the Higher Salaries  
Commission to undertake all future remuneration determinations for local  
authority elected members. At present the Minister of Local Government  
has a statutory obligation to issue these determinations. The decision to  
employ the services of a specialist agency, rather than the Minister, is  
intended to remove any perception of a politicised process and to provide for a more accurate means of determining appropriate levels of remuneration than that  
which is currently available. It is intended that the costs incurred by  
the Higher Salaries Commission when undertaking this task will be met by  
local authorities. The necessary amendments to the Local Government Act to  
effect this change will be included in a Local Government Law Reform Bill  
that I hope to introduce to the House before the end of the year.

Local Electoral Bill

The purpose of the Local Electoral Bill is to modernise the provisions for  
the conduct of local authority elections and polls, and to provide  
legislative flexibility to accommodate new technologies and processes as  
they arise. It introduces a form of preferential voting, the Single  
Transferable Vote (STV), as an option for local authority elections in 2004, and beyond. It also provides for limits on candidate campaign expenditure, and for  
candidate profile statements to be included with voting documents.

It is intended that the Local Electoral Bill be introduced to the House  
before the Christmas break and enacted in May 2001.

Review of the Local Government Act 1974

The review is intended to rectify a number of difficulties which have  
become apparent with the current Act in recent years. The style of much of  
the Act is overly detailed, prescriptive and outmoded while the Act itself  
no longer reflects a consistent and coherent view of the role and purposes  
of local government. This state of affairs imposes costs on local  
authorities and necessitates almost continuous amendment of the Act in an  
effort to adapt it to an ever changing range of circumstances. The task of  
keeping the Act up-to-date has become increasingly difficult and points to  
the need for a more flexible legislative framework that is better able to  
respond and adapt to the demands of an increasingly diverse society.

The review of the Act is being carried out by officials from both central  
and local government working together. At this stage it is anticipated  
that new local government legislation to replace the existing Act will be  
ready for introduction in December 2001.
