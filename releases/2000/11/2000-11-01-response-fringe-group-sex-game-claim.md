Education Minister Trevor Mallard has responded to absurd claims made by the tiny Christchurch-based fringe group Concerned Teachers.

A statement from one of two identified members of the group, criticises the Minister for pointing out that schools have a legal requirement for consulting over sex education while "promoting a game about sex".

"I totally reject his fabrication," Trevor Mallard said.

"The health subject is a voluntary option which is seen as a useful subject for students wishing to pursue careers like nursing. If a student chooses to study health, their parents are consulted about the sexuality aspects of the subject. Under section 105D of the Education Act, if a parent objected to a student’s participation in the sexuality aspect of the subject, they could have their child withdrawn.

"The 'sex game' that Mr Calvert refers to is not a board game students play, as he implies in his statement. It is academic exercises to show that students have an understanding of sexuality issues in relation to oneself and others. In this case, they have to show that they have an understanding of the connections between sex and sexuality and health outcomes.

"It is an assessment activity that requires the person being assessed to design and make up a board game – not to play it. It is also only in a draft form and was released for use in teacher professional development.

"It has not been used by any students. Schools would have to consult with parents before they decided to use this activity. Any parent would also have the right to withdraw their child.

"I am getting sick of fringe groups that throw guinea pigs up and make things up about sex," Trevor Mallard said.
