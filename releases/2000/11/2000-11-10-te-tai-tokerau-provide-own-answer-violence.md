Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment Tariana Turia announced, in Whangarei today, a whanau development initiative, a comprehensive family violence service to address violence within Te Tai Tokerau.

"This is a new and highly innovative service which will provide a comprehensive family violence service, including safe houses, counseling and a 24 hour call centre in the Te Tai Tokerau rohe for whanau in need.

The initiative will receive $1.254m this year and $1m in each of the following two years.

"The Labour Alliance Government is committed to a bottom up approach. I acknowledged the effort this community has made in facing up to the issues, identifying its own priorities and developing its own solutions.

"I believe the strengthening of our whanau is the most critical development issue we are facing today. This initiative is whanau-based and involves resolution activities for the whole whanau alongside individual and whanau counselling.

"A unique feature of this initiative is that it provides for integrated family violence services to whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori under the one roof in Te Tai Tokerau.

"The service is to be provided by Te Hauora o te Tai Tokerau, a Charitable Trust with 15 trustees from eight iwi and seven community organisations. Te Hauora o Te Tai Tokerau is an experienced provider.

"Through addressing the crisis needs of whanau, intervention and prevention strategies as well, it will have a positive long term impact on whanau, hapu and iwi", Tariana Turia said this morning.
