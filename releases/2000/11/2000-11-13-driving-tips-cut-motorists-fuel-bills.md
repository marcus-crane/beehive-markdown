Motorists can slash their fuel costs by 10-20% a year with the help of a new driving tips brochure now available from service stations and the AA, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

The '7 Habits of Highly Efficient Drivers' was published by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) in conjunction with BP, Challenge, Gull, Mobil, Shell and the AA. Brochures are available from those outlets.

"The advice in the brochure will help motorists operate their vehicles more efficiently and therefore more cheaply," Mr Hodgson said.

"Not only is this good for the driver's pocket, there are significant environmental gains to be made in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.

The tips in the brochure cover driving practices, vehicle maintenance and trip planning.

"Some of these tips are quite simple but surprisingly effective," said Mr Hodgson.

The tips are also available on EECA's website www.eeca.govt.nz
