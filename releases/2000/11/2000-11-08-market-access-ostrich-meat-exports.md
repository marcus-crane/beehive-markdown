Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton today welcomed the opening up of the  
Netherlands market to ostrich and emu meat imports from New Zealand.

The first shipment of half a tonne of ostrich meat has arrived in  
Amsterdam.

Ostrich and emu were a relatively new meat for New Zealand, Mr Sutton said.  
It was taking domestic consumers some time to get used to the new meat and  
ostrich and emu growers were looking to develop export markets.

There had been some issues which had to be resolved before European Union  
import approval was received.

So far, there is only one processor and exporter of ostrich meat to Europe,  
Ostex Ltd, an Alexandra-based company. It has developed a chemical residues  
monitoring programme as required by the European Union.

Mr Sutton congratulated the company for its initiative in developing the  
European market and for its ability to complete regulatory requirements for  
exports.

"Market access to the Netherlands is very much an example of a wide group  
of people working together to reach a common goal. These include Ostex, the  
Ostrich and Emu Standards Council, MAF Food, MAF Food's compliance and  
investigation group, the Brussels-based veterinary services counsellor, and  
MAF Verification Agency."

Mr Sutton said the exports of ostrich and emu meat from New Zealand  
demonstrated the diversity of the New Zealand agriculture sector.
