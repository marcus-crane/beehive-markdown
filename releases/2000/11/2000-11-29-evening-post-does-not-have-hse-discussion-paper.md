The Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson says the Evening Post appears to be wrong in claiming it has been leaked a copy of a draft discussion paper on Health and Safety.

"It seems from the story in the Post that the document it has been given is an old copy of a 3-page paper used to consult interested parties in the preparation of the discussion paper. It is not the paper itself, which is a much more extensive publication. There have been changes as a result of the consultation.

Ms Wilson said her main concern was that employers and employees might get the impression from the story that the government has made its mind up on some issues.

"We haven't. We've been consulting and plan to continue consulting in order to get the best possible Health and Safety law, which can be supported by employers, managers, employees and unions.

"Virtually all the information featured in the front page main story of the Evening Post yesterday is old news and has been made public previously, and has been available on the internet for months.

"Governments are asked to consult and we are happy to do so but the process becomes difficult when one party to the consultation indulges in positional bargaining and seeks to place the government in a bad light.

"In this instance the government operated a "no surprise" policy by consulting with all main employer/employee groups before the discussion paper was released to ensure it reflected their views

"This example of bad faith does not make the process easy but the government will persist with developing a rational process for policy making".
