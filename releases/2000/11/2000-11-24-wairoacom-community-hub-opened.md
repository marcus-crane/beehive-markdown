"Access to computers is essential for all communities. I am pleased to open the first of 13 community hubs of 20 computers for Tairawhiti here in Wairoa. This region as part of the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce has itself identified their need for community access to computers, and this is one step that helps to make this a reality," Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Anderton said today.

The announcement is a part of the report of the groundbreaking Tairawhiti Development Taskforce which is being released today (Friday 24 November).

"The surplus Government computers will be used to set up the other 12 community hubs over the next six months. My colleagues Hon Parekura Horomia, and Hon Trevor Mallard have been involved in helping locate resources for the hubs.

"The Ministry of Economic Development has sought sponsorship and Telecom and Ihug have both assisted and have provided the latest technology to connect this hub to the rest of the world. Telecom have also helped in other ways and Affco have provided furniture.

"As part of the Taskforce we considered the entire region and a vast range of long term options, and this issue was one raised by local people that we were able to follow up immediately. Other issues have been identified with approaches that will require more work," said Jim Anderton.

The Tairawhiti Development Taskforce has been meeting since May 2000. The Mayors of Wairoa and Gisborne invited Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Parekura Horomia and Janet Mackey MP to help improve prospects for jobs and businesses in the Tairawhiti region.

The Taskforce has been made up of local people, runanga, agencies and government, to bring a “whole of government” approach to the development and initiation of a sustainable development programme on the East Coast.

The full report will be released during two public meetings at: 10.30 am at the Wairoa Community Centre, Marine Parade; and 2.30 pm at the Army Hall corner of Fitzherbert & Stout Streets, Gisborne.
