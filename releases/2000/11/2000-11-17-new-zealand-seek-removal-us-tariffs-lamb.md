New Zealand would request an immediate end to the tariffs on NZ and Australian lamb at a public hearing on the lamb in Washington, Acting Trade  
Negotiations Minister Paul Swain said today.

Paul Swain said Ambassador Bolger would speak at the hearing on behalf of  
the New Zealand Government.

"He will make a strong case calling for an end to the tariffs on our lamb  
exports to the United States. The Australian Government, and the lamb  
industries in both countries are also participating in the review."

The hearing is being held as part of a mid-term review of the safeguard  
measure President Clinton imposed on lamb imports in July 1999. The US  
International Trade Commission is required under US trade law to review the  
safeguard measure to see whether it has been effective in helping the US  
lamb industry adjust to import competition.

Paul Swain said the review was an entirely separate exercise from the World  
Trade Organisation dispute settlement case New Zealand and Australia are  
pursuing against the United States.

"That process is continuing independently in order to achieve the same  
result: the removal of the trade restrictions on our lamb," he said.

Paul Swain said that the tariffs on lamb imports had clearly done nothing  
to help the long-term viability of the US lamb industry and there was  
therefore no justification for keeping them.

"We said all along that the tariffs would do nothing to help the US lamb  
industry. Economic data made available by the ITC itself shows that the US  
industry has continued to decline. The US industry is in no better  
position now than when the tariffs were imposed, despite having the import  
relief it wanted.

"I expect that the American industry will argue equally robustly at the  
hearing to keep the tariff restraints.

"But with the economic evidence against it, the US lamb industry will be  
hard pressed to satisfy the ITC that it has made good use of the period of  
import relief to improve its competitive position."

The ITC Commissioners' report on the safeguard measure is due with the new  
President and Congress by 21 January 2001. The President must then decide  
whether the measure should be retained, modified, extended or terminated.

Paul Swain said that the review process would not allow for an outcome  
until well into next year.

"Meanwhile the Minister for Trade Negotiations is continuing to take every  
opportunity to impress upon his American counterparts how unacceptable New  
Zealand found the decision to impose the safeguard measure in the first  
place."
