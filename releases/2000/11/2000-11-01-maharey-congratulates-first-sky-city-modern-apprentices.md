Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey signed up the first two hospitality sector Modern Apprentices at a ceremony held at their workplace, Auckland's Sky City, this afternoon.

Elliot Hammond and Josephg Tahaafe became the first two of six Modern Apprentices that Sky City will take on this year during the pilot phase of the programme. Auckland-wide, Modern Apprenticeshsips are being offered this year in the hospitality, agriculture, forestry, plastics, engineering, telecommunications, carpentry and wool handling industries, and in the public sector. Mr Maharey paid tribute to the continuing investment in staff training made by Sky City.

"The Government has been delighted with the positive response of employers and young people to Modern Apprenticeships. I applaud Sky City, already known for being a hospitality industry leader in training investment, for getting involved with the programme at its inception.

"Josephg and Elliot's Modern Apprenticeships demonstrate the importance of the strong partnership with business which underlies the success of the scheme.

"They have begun work-based mentored training at Sky City which will lead to national qualifications in their industry. Their apprenticeships will be coordinated by the Manukau Institute of Technology using qualifications developed by the industry ITO, the Hospitality Standards Institute.

"Modern Apprenticeships is an innovative response to the skills shortages being experienced by many industries. Josephg and Elliot join 500 other young people who will begin their qualifications this year, and the 3000 Modern Apprentices we want to see signed up by 2002," Steve Maharey said.
