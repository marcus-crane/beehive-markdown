Papakura High School is one of nine schools around the country to benefit from a new Government initiative to address gymnasium deficiencies in state secondary schools.

Manurewa MP George Hawkins said he is delighted by the announcement which gives the school $700,960 towards a new gymnasium.

"My office was able to break the news to the school on Friday and they will receive formal notification from Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

"This is brilliant news which will help Papakura High School deliver its sporting and physical education programmes more effectively.

"This new programme was especially approved by Cabinet to provide help for schools which had serious deficiencies in the size of their gymnasium space. Other schools already have the ability to address their gym deficiencies through the roll growth programme.

"Nine schools have received the news that they will receive funding from the $4.9 million set aside for the programme. The amounts range between $314,000 and $917,000 depending on the schools roll and the size of their current facilities.

"We have a brand new health and physical education curriculum becoming compulsory from next year, yet the gym facilities in some schools aren't good enough for it to be taught properly.

"I'm looking forward to hearing about the plans that Papakura High School has to use this funding," George Hawkins said.
