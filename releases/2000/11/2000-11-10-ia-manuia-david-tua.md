The Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and MP for Maungakiekie Mark Gosche has wished world heavyweight boxing contender David Tua well when he fronts up for the world title in Las Vegas on Sunday.

"The 'Tuaman's' determination, humour and humility has won the hearts of thousands and I wish him well," he said.

"David went to Otahuhu Intermediate and Otahuhu College in my electorate and I know the community is very proud of him."

"Only last month David took one look at the devastating rate our children are being injured and killed in car crashes and he immediately took time out to film road safety advertisments free of charge," said Mr Gosche.

"We even sent some David some of the Let's Get On road safety taulima tattoos last week and next thing he was wearing one during his warm-up bouts."

Mr Gosche contacted the Tuaman last week thanking him for the advertisment and wishing him all the best for Sunday.

"David boxes below a Samoan and New Zealand flag and the Samoan community in New Zealand is very excited about the bout on Sunday and I join with them in wishing him all the best in his quest for the title."

"Ia manuia le fa'agatama David Tua," said Mr Gosche.
