Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said he was finding many examples of Kiwi ingenuity and the new Kiwi invention CrazyCatch was clearly one. This new sports game has been awarded an Enterprise Award of $10,000 in the second round of the Enterprise Awards Scheme, so that its inventors can manufacture the game and develop markets.

"These grants and the whole jobs machine have been created by this Government to foster the 'Kiwis-can-do attitude' and get this country working," said Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Anderton.

"CrazyCatch has been invented by a sports mad New Zealand couple in their backyard after their three sons kept breaking windows, and by getting an Enterprise Award this product can be manufactured and sold," said Jim Anderton.

CrazyCatch was invented by Andrew and Louise Sinclair of Auckland, who applied for a grant through the Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award Scheme earlier this year. Already cricket coaches and players are using the game, and Dayle Hadlee of NZ Cricket and Kaushik Patel of Auckland Cricket have looked at CrazyCatch and are supportive.

There were seventeen grants issued in this the second Enterprise Awards Scheme round by Industry New Zealand, and the results of the next round will be announced in late November/early December.

The Enterprise Awards Scheme exists so that small businesses and entrepreneurs can apply for 50% of the total costs of a project, and the scheme will fund up to $10,000 in any one year.

The first round of 22 Enterprise Award winners was announced in September 2000, grants ranged in value from $800 to $10,000.
