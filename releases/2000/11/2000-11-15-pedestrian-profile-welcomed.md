A new report on walking in New Zealand has been welcomed by the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche.

The New Zealand Pedestrian Profile has been developed in conjunction with the National Pedestrian Project, the New Zealand Road Safety Trust and the Land Transport Safety Authority.

"This is an extremely useful report, it will tie into the National Transport Strategy that we are currently developing with local Government as well as the 2010 Road Safety Strategy," said Mr Gosche.
