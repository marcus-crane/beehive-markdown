The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Parekura Horomia said he is aware of the turmoil of the last year at the Taurawhiri i te Reo Maori, the Maori Language Commission.  
Mr Horomia made his comments on the release of the Taura Whiri i Te Reo Maori annual report.

When he came into office, Mr Horomia instigated regular meetings with the Commission and they continue.  
Mr Horomia said he had discussed the problems of the past and that some of the Chairman's comments were fair .  
"It is important for concerns to be raised so they can be dealt with. I am open to free and frank discussion because problems do not go away if people do not talk about them."

Mr Horomia said he has been encouraged by the determination of the Maori Language Commission to carry on and the fact it wants to encourage more New Zealanders into Te Reo. He said he noted the optimism in the chief executive's report.

"This government has been pushing for more effective and efficient action between government agencies. I'll be looking for the same cooperation between the Taura Whiri i Te Reo Maori and Te Puni Kokiri."
