Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today launched TriStyle Homes exporting prefabricated houses to Japan made from Northland timber.

"Exporting houses to Japan! This is another initiative from the Labour Alliance coalition Government designed to get New Zealand back to work and support New Zealand regions and business," said Jim Anderton.

TriStyle represents the first sector initiative in the Industry Development programme, the latest part of the range of programmes run by Industry New Zealand as part of the Government jobs machine. Other such initiatives will follow.

"This exciting project is the first in-depth project where Industry New Zealand has worked closely with a company to identify the barriers to exports and work around them using Trade New Zealand.

"The project is linked to the national wood processing strategy and shows how we can add value to wood products rather than exporting logs," said Jim Anderton

Over the years, New Zealand has planted large areas of commercial forest. Log exports and wood processing's contribution to the economy will over the next decade significantly increase.

Many forests are coming to maturity and New Zealand will have a generous supply of raw timber logs. Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand are working with industry to remove barriers to export so that New Zealanders can reap the benefits of our timber resources.
