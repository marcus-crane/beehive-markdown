Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins is pleased Police have focussed on increasing the numbers of Maori, Pacific Islands and ethnic officers.

The Royal New Zealand Police College had 350 recruits enter for the 1999/2000 year: "Of those 350, around 20% were either Maori, Pacific Islands or of ethnic decent. Maori recruits made up 16.6% of all recruits," George Hawkins said.

Women also feature positively with 23.7% of all recruits being female.

Currently, 10.8% of Police staff are Maori, with 3% of Police staff affiliating to the Pacific Islands community, and 16.2% of Police staff are women.

Police have sought to increase the number of Maori recruits by holding Marae based recruiting seminars, advertising targeting Maori and Pacific Islands people, up-skilling support to assist Maori and Pacific Islands people to meet recruitment criteria.

Police also hold recruitment stands at relevant ethnic events.

"These are excellent initiatives designed to ensure the New Zealand Police reflects, and is representative, of the communities it serves.

"In Counties Manukau much work has been done to encourage Maori and Pacific Islands people apply to become police officers," George Hawkins said.

Ethnic New Zealanders make up 8% of the country's population. But ethnic New Zealanders are under-represented among Police recruits in 1999/2000.

"Both individuals and our communities have much to gain from having Police reflect the community," George Hawkins said. "I wish to encourage more people from our diverse ethnic communities to consider a career with the New Zealand Police."
