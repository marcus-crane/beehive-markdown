Students in South Auckland schools will benefit from a $1.1 million library literacy programme run by the National Library of New Zealand, the Minister Responsible for the National Library, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

The money will fund four years of a pilot project for schools in Mangere and Otara.

"We know that such skills are a key to correcting inequality," Marian Hobbs said. "This programme is good news for schools in these areas. They'll have ready access to the National Library's expertise and resources to strengthen and enhance their students' literacy and information skills.

"I have no doubt that this pilot will make a measurable difference to the Government's programme to improve skills and education across society."

School Services will work with 29 schools in Mangere and Otara, which are also part of a Ministry of Education initiative to raise achievement levels. All but three of the schools are decile one, the lowest socio-economic rating. These South Auckland schools comprise 10% of all decile one schools in New Zealand.

"For many students in decile one schools, access to information at home through computers or reference books is very limited," Marian Hobbs said. "Therefore schools and their libraries and on-line access play a pivotal role in bridging the information and digital divide.

"As well as access to the information, students also need the skills to interpret and evaluate what they find. This pilot scheme helps teachers provide the necessary skills."
