Community organisations planning events to commemorate Waitangi Day 2001 will receive $70,000 more from the Government than they did last year.

The Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon. George Hawkins, has announced that the 'Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund 2001' has $170,000 available for community groups throughout the country to organise commemorative events.

"We have increased this contestable fund so that more communities can receive assistance to participate in our national day," Mr Hawkins said.

The 'Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund 2001' supports activities which acknowledge the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

It is designed to encourage a country wide participation in the commemorations.

Proposals must encourage community participation and achievement, promote a cultural experience or event and provide participants with an opportunity to learn more about the Treaty.

The Fund is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs. Applications should be sent to Ingrid Kamstra, Community Development Group, Department of Internal Affairs, Box 805, Wellington (email ingrid.kamstra@dia.govt.nz) by Friday, December 8, 2000.
