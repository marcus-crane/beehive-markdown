The Government is not supporting or facilitating the World Council of Whalers conference which is being hosted and organised in Nelson by Te Ohu Kai Moana and Nga Iwi o Te Tauihu o Te Waka a Maui. The Government directs neither of these organisations.

Our position is that we are pursuing a goal of ensuring the maximum conservation of whale species and stocks, and Government agencies must behave in line with the Government position. We do not see this as cutting across the rights of the host organisations but rather remaining consistent to our own principles.

The Government acknowledges and makes provision for Maori customary uses of beached whales, where whalebone is taken for traditional purposes. The Department of Conservation will continue its work with local iwi and hapu to develop mutually agreed appropriate procedures to manage stranded whales.
