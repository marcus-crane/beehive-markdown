Mexican visitors to New Zealand will no longer require visas from 1 December this year, Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

“New Zealand is committed to broadening its relationship with Mexico as a key part of its Latin American strategy," the Ministers said.

“The visa waiver will stimulate tourism, education and stronger people-to-people links. It will contribute to the expansion of trading and economic relationships between New Zealand and Mexico.

"Mexico is currently New Zealand’s largest Latin American trading partner, with exports worth $NZ180m and Mexican imports worth $NZ129m in the year to June. But the opportunities there and in the wider Latin American region are greater still.

"Between them, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru together spend more than NZ$480 billion a year on imports.

"The Government has committed itself through the Latin America Strategy to minimise administrative barriers to closer relations with the region.

"The visa waiver with Mexico, which follows waivers already in place for Chilean and Argentinian visitors, is another important step in that process. It will take New Zealand’s relationship with Mexico to a new level.

"The visa waiver will apply for visits to New Zealand of up to three months by Mexican citizens. The Mexican Government already operates a similar arrangement for New Zealanders visiting Mexico," the Ministers concluded.
