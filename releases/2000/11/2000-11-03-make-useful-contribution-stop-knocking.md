The Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon Mark Burton, has vigorously defended his department’s role in managing the government’s gaming review.

“I have every confidence in the staff who have been assigned to, and specifically recruited for the review, and I know they will do it rigorously and objectively,” he said.

“The review is being managed by the Policy Group of the Department of Internal Affairs, which is separate from the Gaming and Censorship Regulation Group. They will not be protecting any vested interests either within the department or outside it. I know they are dedicated to an outcome that will work for the country as a whole.”

"It's fair to say that the Government's commitment to having this review has been widely welcomed by the many industry and community interest groups I have met with during the course of this year."

“The terms of reference require the review to work from 'first principles' and to cover all forms of gaming.”

“Importantly, there will be public consultation early next year when a discussion document will be released. There will be further opportunity for the public to have their say during the Select Committee process, after new legislation has been introduced in the House towards the end of next year.”

“I will be working personally with the review team, along with other Cabinet Ministers, to ensure that the terms of reference are met.”

“The review team comprises individuals, recruited from outside the department, who will provide a fresh perspective, as well as experienced staff with a thorough understanding of the current regulatory environment and what is wrong with it.”

"I am disappointed that one individual has resorted to abusing officials. The review will be usefully advanced by all those with an interest engaging positively and contributing the benefit of their experience and opinions to the process."

Copies of the discussion document will be distributed widely when it becomes available. It will be sent to all known key stakeholders as well as the 700 or so organisations that made submissions to the previous review. Special efforts will be made on this occasion to distribute the document to small rural communities and to Maori groups, iwi, Pacific Island and other ethnic communities. It will also be available on the web site of the Department of Internal Affairs at www.dia.govt.nz.

“I invite any group that has not already expressed an interest to contact the Department of Internal Affairs at Gaming Review, Department of Internal Affairs, PO Box 805, Wellington, to be included on the distribution list," said Mr Burton.
