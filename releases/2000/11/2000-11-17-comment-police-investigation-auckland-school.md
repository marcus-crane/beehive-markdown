Acting Education Minister Steve Maharey says Ministers have been briefed on the issues surrounding the arrest of an Auckland teacher.

"Matters involving police investigations were often devastating on school communities and the Ministry of Education and other agencies are working closely with the school involved to offer support to students, families and staff.

"While a suppression order remains in place, the Government will not make any further public comment on this issue," he said.
