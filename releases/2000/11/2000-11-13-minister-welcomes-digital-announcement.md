The Minister of Broadcasting Marian Hobbs has welcomed today's announcement that TVNZ and TelestraSaturn are proceeding to develop a digital televsion partnership.

"It creates the opportunity for further detailed discussion on the introduction of a digital television service for New Zealanders wherever they live," she said.

"I am pleased to see the level of co-operation between both parties. It is creating a win for both companies and for New Zealanders interested in investing in digital technology.

"TVNZ and TelstraSaturn have still to finalise all details but this is a positive start."

Marian Hobbs said plans are proceeding for the development of a charter for TVNZ.

"Today's announcement does not detract from the programming objectives that will be contained in the Charter," she said. "The digital partnership could increase the opportunities for even greater variety."
