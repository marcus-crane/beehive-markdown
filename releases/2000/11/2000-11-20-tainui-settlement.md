The Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations, Margaret Wilson says that following yesterday's meeting of Te Kauhanganui o Waikato Inc, it appears that the vacancies on the executive body, Te Kaumaarua have been filled.

"This resolves the uncertainty about governance and clears the way for the Crown to pay the settlement money," said Ms Wilson.

"The Crown requires a duly signed resolution directing it to transfer the final payment to a specificed account".

"Once this final legal formality is completed the Crown will immediately transfer the funds as directed".
