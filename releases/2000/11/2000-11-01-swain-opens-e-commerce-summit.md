Swain opens E-commerce Summit

Minister for Information Technology Paul Swain has welcomed more than 500 businesses to the government's e-commerce summit in Auckland, and challenged them to think about the future.

Paul Swain says the key to e-commerce success in New Zealand's future is a proactive government in partnership with the private sector.

When I think of New Zealand in the future I think of a vibrant, exciting, proud country where attitude, enterprise and innovation are celebrated and where our young people want to work and live. A New Zealand that other countries look to as an example of how to get things done. E-commerce is fundamental to that.

"This summit is about government's commitment to advancing e-commerce in New Zealand. Proof of that commitment will be evident in the government's e-commerce strategy that I am launching here later today.

"We will be seeking feedback on that plan from business – we need that feedback to ensure we get the plan right for them.

"In the next two days summit attendees will hear first hand stories from businesses who got involved in e-commerce early on and how it has worked for them as well as from international experts on e-commerce.

"This summit is about getting moving and getting things done. We want participants to take part, to get excited and to go away inspired. E-commerce is fundamental to New Zealand's future. This summit is an important step along the way," Paul Swain said.
