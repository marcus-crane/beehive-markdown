Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said Youth at Risk programmes operated around the country are producing positive changes in behaviours.

Police information shows Youth At Risk programmes are helping young people to positively change their behaviour.

For example: Glen Innes has achieved a 94% "success rate", Mangere a 59% success rate. Other high result areas include Wainuiomata which has achieved a 92% success rate, and Nelson with a 93% success rate among youths taking part in the programmes.

"The Police gauge 'success rate' by the reduction of offences and incidents by young people on the Youth At Risk programmes," George Hawkins said.

"The recorded successes of the Youth At Risk programme demonstrates why this Labour/Alliance Coalition Government increased funding to Youth at Risk to support children and families and to tackle youth crime.

"It is clear Youth At Risk programmes help reduce youth crime, especially serious and persistent re-offending by young people. Workers in this valuable area ought to be congratulated," George Hawkins said.
