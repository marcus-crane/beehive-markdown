Cullen welcomes Swain aboard

Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed Paul Swain's appointment as associate Finance Minister and associate Revenue Minister.

"Paul will bring to these areas considerable expertise from his work in commerce and communications and through his relations with business generally.

"I am proposing to delegate to him in the finance area responsibility for State Owned Enterprises and Crown Research Instututes in terms of my role as shareholding minister.

"In the revenue area, I intend to delegate the tax simplification and compliance cost issues that will fit in most readily with his other ministerial responsibilities.

"This will be of considerable assistance to me in reducing my workload while ensuring better coordination across government activities," Dr Cullen said.
