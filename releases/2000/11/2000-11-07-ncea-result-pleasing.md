Acting Education Minister Steve Maharey said he is pleased by results of a PPTA survey that show well over half of secondary school teachers support the new school qualifications system.

"While teachers have indicated that they have some issues with the implementation, I am heartened at the endorsement given to the need for change," Steve Maharey said.

"The traditional examination system has passed its use-by date. The NCEA, with its mixture of external examinations and internal assessment, offers us an exciting system that challenges the most gifted students while providing all students with an opportunity to gain a qualification that will show prospective employers what they can achieve.

"The Government is determined that the National Certificate in Educational Achievement be implemented as smoothly as possible.

"Education Minister Trevor Mallard made a decision earlier this year to delay its implementation from 2001 to 2002 in order to work on the process for transition. That includes quite intense professional development for teachers.

"The Government also recognises that the transition period and the first few years of the new system will impact on teacher workloads. We are currently considering the recommendations of a Ministry of Education and PPTA joint forum on workloads.

"And we already have a range of initiatives and work in progress to address workload. They include a staffing review group, a freeze on new curriculum, and on-line resources for all teachers to access. The Government also expects that schools will use the considerable increase in operational funding for resources that will ease teacher workload and improve learning," Steve Maharey said.
