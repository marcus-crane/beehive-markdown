E-commerce summit a success

Information Technology Minister Paul Swain says the government’s e-commerce summit has been an inspirational event which has left the government a lot of work to get on with.

The two-day summit in Auckland wound up this afternoon. It was a sold out event featuring international and local experts and e-commerce success stories. Paul Swain presented the government’s e-commerce strategy to the summit yesterday and businesses have been feeding back on it.

“The messages that have come though loud and clear from the summit attendees is that the strategy is a good start but needs further work,” Paul Swain said.

“What businesses have said is that the strategy needs to be more aggressive. That partnership between business and government is the key to success and that there is a real sense of urgency around this.

“What I have promised as a result of the summit feed back is that before Christmas I will meet with key industry sector groups to take the strategy forward. That we will set ourselves bolder e-commerce targets. That we will effectively measure progress, and I have given an assurance that things will happen.

“This e-commerce summit was a success because of the calibre of speakers and the ideas and energy brought to the event by all of the businesses who attended. It was a fantastic event.

“My challenge to business is how can the private sector work together to make it all happen in partnership with government,” Paul Swain said.
