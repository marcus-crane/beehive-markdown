Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said hundreds of thousands of dollars in performance bonuses paid to Police recruits is excessive.

Police recruits were paid $625,500 in performance bonuses from July 1 1999 to June 31 2000.

George Hawkins said: "Recruits received $695,250 in performance bonuses from July 1 1999 to November 8 this year.

"I am looking at whether bonuses should be paid to recruits, especially when they are already being paid to train," George Hawkins said.

"Nurses, dentists, doctors, lawyers, fitter and turners, even journalists have to pay for their training. And they certainly do not receive performance payments while they are studying.

"Is it proper to use tax payers money to pay bonuses to Police recruits? I am yet to be convinced that it is," George Hawkins said.
