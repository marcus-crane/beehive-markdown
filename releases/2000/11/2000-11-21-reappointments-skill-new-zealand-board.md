The Government has reappointed consultant and former Secretary for the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Angela Foulkes and educator Remana Henwood to the Board of Skill New Zealand, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

Skill New Zealand oversees a range of initiatives designed to build a highly skilled and adaptable workforce. It prepares school leavers to start their working lives, assists unemployed people to re-enter the workforce, and facilitates training to raise the skills of people currently in employment. Mr Maharey said the appointments will ensure that the Board continues to have the capability and expertise to provide leadership for Skill New Zealand, particularly in the areas of working with key stakeholder groups including industry, educators, and Maori training providers.

Angela Foulkes, reappointed for a second three-year term, is a consultant and associate for Sue Wood & Associates. She is also a Board member of Workbridge and an audit member for the Polytechnic Programmes Committee.

"Ms Foulkes’ extensive experience and links to the industry training sector has been of great benefit to the Board. Ms Foulkes has been involved in a wide range of government taskforces and advisory groups on industry training and industry issues", Steve Maharey said.

Mr Henwood, reappointed for a second three-year term, has held a range of secondary school teaching positions including Assistant Principal at Northland College, dealing with a predominantly Maori roll. He is also a part-time lecturer for the Auckland College of Education outpost in Kaikohe.

"Mr Henwood’s in-depth knowledge of Maori educational needs and careers advisory experience will be particularly valuable to the Skill New Zealand Board in working with Maori training providers and on strategies to improve educational outcomes for Maori trainees", Steve Maharey said.
