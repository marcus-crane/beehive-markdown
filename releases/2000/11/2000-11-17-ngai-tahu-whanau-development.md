Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment and Maori Affairs Tariana Turia announced today an initiative aimed at strengthening all whanau within the Ngai Tahu rohe.

The Minister made the announcement at a hui to celebrate Maori women, organised by the Christchurch Maori Women's Welfare League in Christchurch tonight.

"This is an exciting innovative iwi-driven, whanau-based programme that will improve the development opportunities available to whanau. This initative acknowledges the potential within whanau and seeks to realise that potential.

"The initiative will establish a network of whanau development workers, or 'Pouarahi' to work with whanau. They will play a critical role in ensuring they can access resources and entitlements and assist in planning based on their needs and aspirations.

"The planning done at the whanau level will be integrated into the comprehensive development of the iwi to improve the overall development of Ngai Tahu.

"This model was developed and promoted by Ngai Tahu to address the need to strengthen the whanau residing within their tribal boundaries whether they are of Ngai Tahu descent or not. It will receive $112,000 in this financial year which will advance it's progress.

"By taking a 'whole of government' approach, we should see an improvement in the access to, and utilisation of, effective services to whanau. This will also result in less wastage of taxpayers money through the co-ordination of health and social services and provide a more organised way of delivering those services.

"This is another example of the Labour Alliance Government's commitment to a holistic approach to the strengthening and development of whanau", said Tariana Turia tonight.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

What is the purpose of this initiative?  
To build the capacity at the whanau level that integrates social and economic development with comprehensive tribal development.

Is this for Ngai Tahu whanau only?  
No. This is an inclusive initiative that will develop the potential Maori whanau within the Ngai Tahu tribal boundary, whether they are of Ngai Tahu descent or not.

As stated in the proposal "It is completely consistent with the responsibilities Ngai Tahu has to care for all Maori resident within te rohe o Ngai Tahu."

What are the responsibilities of the Pouarahi?  
Supported by the Papatipu Runaka and the iwi, the 'whanau development workers' will play a major facilitation and liaison role between the whanau and service providers and including iwi and government agencies to developing whanau capacity from within through:

\* Targeted education and workforce development.

\* Improved management of whanau resources.

\* Strengthening and restoration of whanau identity as fundamental to collective wellbeing.

\* Improved co-ordination of health and social services as an immediate response to need.

\* Improved utilisation of Government funding in health and social services through the mobilisation of consumer purchasing power in an organised way.

How will the whanau be involved in the development?  
This initiative is based on enabling whanau to set their own priorities, respond to their own needs and realise their own aspirations
