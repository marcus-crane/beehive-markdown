Associate Social Services and Employment Minister Tariana Turia praises the work and career of Dame Margaret Bazley whose retirement on 30 June 2001 was announced yesterday.

"Dame Margaret has had significant involvement with Maori communities, spanning over 40 years. She has been an advocate for whanau, hapu and iwi and her links with them will remain strong.

"Dame Margaret will always be remembered fondly for her ability to go out to the communities and promote government goals, and discuss the issues she was presented with. This includes the promotion of Iwi social services which was legislated for under the Children Young Persons and their Families Act 1989.

"Recently at a meeting we attended with iwi, it was most apparent that she was amongst friends.

"She has set the standard for all Chief Executives to follow by forming relationships directly with iwi and I commend her for that", said Tariana Turia.
