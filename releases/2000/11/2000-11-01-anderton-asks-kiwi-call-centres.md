The Minister of Industry and Regional Development, Jim Anderton, today asked companies to look at siting their call centres in New Zealand rather than overseas.

"When a New Zealand customer rings their company, having a New Zealand voice answering the call, from a local centre, has to be good for the company and for our country," said Jim Anderton.

"I want to invite companies to site their call centres in New Zealand rather than overseas. We have a skilled population, strong telecommunications infrastructure and there are government agencies locally and nationally who can help you find a location. So I say to the customer services managers and CEOs, think local when you're thinking about where to put your call centres."

Jim Anderton made the comment today when opening the new Levin call centre facility for Contact Energy, "I see call centres as having great potential for our regions. The Government is rolling its sleeves up to play our role in facilitating the expansion and success of our regions, and call centres can be a part of this."

The call centre employs 90 people and operators are trained to understand hundreds of different products and services.

"Today Contact Energy needs to be congratulated for this major commitment to Levin. You are training local people, you are investing in Levin, and you are showing a commitment to customer service. This effort is to be applauded as showing the way for other companies to locate their call centres in New Zealand rather than offshore," said Jim Anderton.
