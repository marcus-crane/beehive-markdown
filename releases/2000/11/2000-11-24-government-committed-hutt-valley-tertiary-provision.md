The Government is committed to continued tertiary provision in the Hutt Valley, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The Central Institute of Technology has been experiencing financial difficulties. The Government has made available a $3.2m Crown loan to give the Institute time to prepare a plan to secure the future of tertiary provision in the Hutt Valley. CIT and Hutt Valley Polytechnic announced last week that they are considering collaborative approaches.

Mr Maharey said it is important that students and potential students are given an assurance that, whatever the outcome of the talks between CIT and Hutt Valley Polytechnic, students can enrol at either institution in confidence that there will be ongoing provision of quality tertiary education in the Hutt Valley.

"It is very important that students in the Hutt Valley have continued access to quality tertiary education. In any option being considered, the Government will want to ensure the best outcome for students and also that students in current programmes of study are not disadvantaged.

"The Hutt Valley Polytechnic and CIT initiative is pleasing. CIT is clearly in a difficult position and seeking a local solution in a cooperative manner seems sensible," Steve Maharey said.
