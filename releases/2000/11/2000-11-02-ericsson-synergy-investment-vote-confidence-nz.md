The new multi-million dollar Ericsson-Synergy Mobile Internet Applications Centre will be a major addition to New Zealand's growing high-tech sector, say Government ministers Pete Hodgson and Jim Anderton.

The global telecommunications company Ericsson and New Zealand infotech and management consultancy Synergy announced today their decision to establish the centre in New Zealand, creating about 150 jobs. Head office will be in Wellington, with an office in Auckland and possible expansion into other centres.

The centre will be developing mobile internet applications and solutions to be marketed around the world.

"This investment is another step in the transformation of our economy to one in which innovation, technology and skill play a much greater part," Mr Hodgson said. "It will provide jobs for high-skilled New Zealanders, strengthen New Zealand's innovation networks and generate millions of dollars in overseas earnings."

Minister of Economic Development Jim Anderton said the Ericsson-Synergy development showed that active Government economic development and industry policies were paying off. Industry New Zealand would increasingly be involved in supporting such major new job-creating investments, and the Government would look at how it could help this development through Industry New Zealand.

Mr Hodgson said Trade New Zealand, through its Investment New Zealand division, had worked extensively with Ericsson over the past year on the potential for expanding the company's R&D activity in New Zealand. Investment New Zealand staff had explored ideas and introduced the company to a range of contacts and opportunities in the technology sector.

"Today's announcement endorses Investment New Zealand's strategy to focus on technology as a key sector for international investment," Mr Hodgson said. "Ericsson is a world-leading telecommunications company. This new investment is a vote of confidence in New Zealand as a country willing and able to support high-tech knowledge-based industry."
