Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson has welcomed a report indicating that Auckland electricity supply security risks for the coming summer appear to have lessened.

Mr Hodgson today released the report, from an industry working group set up in September to address the risks.

It says the risk of electricity supply failing to meet demand in Auckland over summer has reduced to a level at which the use of normal demand management techniques, such as ripple control of water heating, should be enough to prevent problems.

The working group now expects a risk to security of supply to exist for only 1% of the time from mid January to the end of March 2001, rather than the 7% forecast in September. The report assumes that the new plant at Otahuhu B will remain unavailable through this period.

The report notes that some risk remains, if any presently operating generating plant becomes unavailable or in the unlikely event of a sustained transmission failure. Supply might also come under pressure if temperatures from mid-January to the end of March are extreme. If there are any difficulties they are expected to occur on hot afternoons, when air-conditioning load is heaviest.

"I am pleased to see the industry, under Transpower's leadership, working together to avoid disruption to consumers," Mr Hodgson said. "Co-operation of this type will be increasingly important as the Government's proposed industry self-governance arrangements take effect.

"I look forward to a further report from the Working Group around the end of November. I will be particularly looking for assurance of continued co-operation by the industry to ensure that significant disruption is avoided."
