Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey launched a new $1.9m nationwide computer network for Student Job Search in Auckland this afternoon.

Opportunities for summer employment are important to provide students with work experience and with savings for their coming year's study. An additional $3m was invested in Student Job Search in the Budget to assist it to find more work for students over the summer and to upgrade its technology. Asia-on-Line's internet portal is being used to create a customised Virtual Private Network offering a vastly improved service to students and employers.

"The network we are launching today gives Student Job Search state-of-the-art technology.

"It provides a nationally networked system operating from one computer, rather than six regional networks, which the organisation has been used to. The new technology opens a variety of possibilities for Student Job Search to make its service more efficient in new ways.

"The system allows for efficient e-mail contacts with employers, on-line job boards, a reduction in telephone costs and an interface with the Department of Work and Income to enable the speedy exchange of information needed to confirm eligibility for the Community Wage Student and student allowances," Steve Maharey said.
