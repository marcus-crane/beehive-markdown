Manurewa MP George Hawkins has welcomed news that Manurewa schools have gained funding grants from the Government's Financial Assistance Scheme.

George Hawkins said the Ministry of Education has provided eight Manurewa schools with grants totalling $216,722. Additional to this, Manurewa schools boards of trustees contributions total $101,114. This means a total of $317,836 is being spent on school improvement projects in the electorate.

This funding is on top of the $2.17 million extra operational funding for Manurewa schools, as announced on August 17, and the one-off $314,290 payment to centrally funded schools as announced on March 29.

"There are some really exciting developments planned like Weymouth Intermediate's new modernised library, Rowandale School's new swimming pool changing shed, and Hillpark School's computer cabling for its junior school," George Hawkins said.

"It is excellent to see Manurewa schools benefiting from the assistance scheme.

"I am excited to see Manurewa schools using the funding for information and communication technology and also improvements to playgrounds," George Hawkins said.

The Financial Assistance Scheme supports projects that are partly funded by the schools and communities. This year, the Government granted $22 million to the scheme with schools contributing $17 million.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard has announced that 880 school property improvement projects in 719 schools, ranging from upgraded classrooms to an auditorium, have been approved under the scheme.

He said the Financial Assistance Scheme is a feature of the Government's $403 million dollar works programme for schools for 2000/2001, which also pays for classrooms to meet roll growth, new schools and general modernisation of existing schools.
