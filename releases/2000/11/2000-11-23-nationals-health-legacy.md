Health Minister Annette King says cancer patients are being sent to Australia for treatment because of "yet another ticking time bomb" left by the former National Government.

"They left a series of ticking time bombs in health in areas they did little or nothing about, despite the advice they received from health officials and professionals," Mrs King said.

"The situation with cancer patients is the prime example, particularly in Waikato.

"National health spokesman Wyatt Creech keeps on whining and asking what we're going to do about it. That is pure hypocrisy. We are doing something. They did little or nothing.

"In January 1996 then Health Minister Jenny Shipley was told clinicians around the country were considering turning cancer patients away because they could not cope with demand. Then Health Minister Bill English was warned of the same thing because of a crisis at Mid-Central Health.

"And on 14 May 1999 Mr Creech was warned of the current crisis at Waikato, of unacceptably long waiting times for radiation treatment, of equipment breakdown, of staffing shortages, and of a 14 percent increase in demand.

"That's three National health ministers, no action, and a crisis for this Government.

"We are taking action. We are sending acute patients to Australia for treatment. And we have bought the three linear accelerators, two for Auckland and one for Waikato, that the National Government was told were needed last year."

Mrs King said other "ticking time bombs" included lack of health workforce planning, unsettled Hep C claims, pent-up wage frustrations, and premature announcements of uncosted building programmes.

"It's a sorry record, but they've never said sorry."
