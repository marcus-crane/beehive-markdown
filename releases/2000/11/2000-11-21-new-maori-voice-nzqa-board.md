The Government has appointed Trevor Moeke, Te Mangai Paho chief executive, and reappointed Massey University educationalist Judith Carter to the Board of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The Authority provides qualifications quality assurance, assessment, and examination services in New Zealand and overseas. Mr Maharey said the Authority has a number of new challenges ahead of it and it is essential that the Board is composed of high calibre people committed to quality education.

"Trevor Moeke has 20 years experience working in areas of Maori education and training, including projects with wananga, polytechnics, and industry training organisations. He has been appointed for a four-year term.

"Mr Moeke's in-depth knowledge of Maori educational needs and the private tertiary provider sector will greatly assist the Authority's growing role in the development and support of Maori tertiary education providers and qualifications.

"Judith Carter is Director of Teacher Education at Massey University's College of Education. She has been reappointed for a second four-year term.

"Ms Carter has made a valuable contribution to the NZQA Board during her first term. She brings extensive education sector experience, having been an education lecturer, a secondary school teacher and principal, and a senior school inspector, and having been involved in a number of government reviews of the school curriculum", Steve Maharey said.
