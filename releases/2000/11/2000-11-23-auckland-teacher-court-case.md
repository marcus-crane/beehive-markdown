The school that employed a teacher who is facing a range of charges in the North Shore Court is being offered intense support from several government agencies, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said the man had been granted interim name suppression by the court and Ministers were mindful that they should not make any comment that might be seen to breach that court order.

"However, the public can be assured that the students, their families, staff and the wider school community are being offered intense support to help them through this situation.

"The welfare and care of the students is paramount and has been the major concern of everyone. Everything possible is being done to provide a full range of support for the students.

"The response is a co-ordinated interagency approach, at both the school and the national level," Trevor Mallard said.
