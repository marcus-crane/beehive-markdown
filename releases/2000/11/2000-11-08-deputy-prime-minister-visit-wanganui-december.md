Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said today that the Labour Alliance Coalition Government will work with people in the region around Wanganui and he and other Government representatives will come to the area on 15 December to meet with community leaders.

"Jill Pettis MP and Wanganui Mayor Chas Poynter have made strong representation to me and I have listened carefully to them, and at their insistence, I am making a special effort to come to Wanganui before Christmas," said Jim Anderton.

Mr Anderton said he is looking forward to meeting with the regional partnership steering group.

"We have already done a lot of preliminary work with local people and government agencies on addressing economic development issues in the region.

"The region has put together a partnership between iwi and the district councils in Wanganui, Ruapehu and Rangitikei to provide leadership and direction for economic development initiatives at a local level.

"I am keen to work alongside that group to ensure that the Government plays its part to the full and that the commitment to enhanced regional development is delivered," said Jim Anderton.
