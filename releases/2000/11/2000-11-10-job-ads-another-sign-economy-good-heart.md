"The latest ANZ job ads data, showing ad volumes increased in October for the seventh consecutive month, are yet more evidence that the economy is now firmly in recovery mode," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The series also reinforces the positive September quarter Household Labour Force Survey showing unemployment at its lowest level in 12 years and both the employment and workforce participation rates up.

"The ANZ figures echo these trends and point to continuing job growth," Dr Cullen said.
