The column Rudman's city ( NZ Herald on 17 November), criticises the QE ll National Trust for their handling of the Glenoaks property in Howick.

I note that the decision not to retain the full property in QE ll ownership was taken under the previous government. However, because of the allegations made about the decisions of the Trust at this time, I have checked the nature and context of those decisions with my officials.

The Trust has limited resources and must manage its funds and assets prudently if they are to retain public and government support and if they are to maximise the amount of land they can protect through covenant or by ownership

The Trust's chairperson, Sir Paul Reeves, has stated its position on Glenoaks most recently in a public statement to a resource consent hearing on 16 November. (I have appended that statement, for your information.)

In summary, after anguishing for 18 months about whether it was practical to continue to hold the property, the QE II National Trust board concluded that the cash bequest it received from Mr Clarke for the development and upkeep of Glenoaks was not sufficient. The Trust also concluded that alternative suggestions for fundraising would not adequately bridge the shortfall.

The morality of selling the property was addressed by the Trust taking into account Mr Clarke's concerns that the day to day management of Glenoaks should not become a drain on Trust resources. After an assessment, the Trust reluctantly concluded that the property was draining their resources, and had to be disposed of.

The Trust decided in the circumstances that the only affordable option enabling them to best meet the wishes of the late Les Clarke was to protect the area with significant conservation and open space value. Covenants protect the indigenous vegetation on the property, the natural character and amenity value, and provide for public access. The property has been offered for sale and a subdivision consent granted by the council. The protected area will enable the public to enjoy the natural landscape values of both the property and the coastal vista of the Hauraki Gulf.

I am precluded from expressing any view on the merits of the subdivision because of my cabinet post as Minister of Local Government. But my views on the need for open space and my concerns about urban subdivision are a matter of public record dating back to my years in local government.

I have been assured that the sale of the property will be used by the Trust to further its work in open space protection in accordance with its Act. The late Les Clarke closely identified with and supported these purposes. His generosity has resulted in the protection in perpetuity of the special features of Glenoaks and will significantly enhance the Trust's ability to protect open space in New Zealand.
