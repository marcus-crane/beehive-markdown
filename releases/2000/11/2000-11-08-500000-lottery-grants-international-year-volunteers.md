Half-a-million-dollars in Lottery grants has gone to community groups around the country in recognition of the United Nations International Year of Volunteers 2001, Lottery Grants Board Chairperson and Internal Affairs Minister Mark Burton announced today.

The grants awarded are in keeping with the United Nations themes for the Year and have a particular emphasis on training and promoting volunteers, Mark Burton said.

“Volunteering spans most sectors and the grants awarded reflect this.”

Mr Burton pointed to the $5000 which went to the Kiwi Conservation Club for a weekend gathering for volunteer leaders from throughout the country.

“KCC leaders come from many backgrounds and most are simply parents with an interest in conservation. The Lottery grant will enable them to get together to exchange ideas and learn new skills and activities for working with the children.”

The cross section of groups funded was further illustrated by the $2000 awarded to Otago Museum for a promotional campaign to raise awareness of volunteering at the museum and the $1000 to Horowhenua Sea and Rescue to train volunteers in search methods and track and clue awareness, Mark Burton said.

The full list of grant recipients is attached.
