"The Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 (LGOIMA) provides that charges for the supply of 'official information' must be reasonable.

"The Office of the Controller and Auditor-General has examined some of the issues surrounding the contracting out of local authority regulatory functions, including what responsibility contractors have to disclose information under the LGOIMA. In its report Contracting Out Local Authority Regulatory Functions (November 1999), the Controller and Auditor-General's office noted that 'contracting out…does not relieve the local authority of the liability to perform… any function or duty imposed (by any Act)'.

"The report also states 'the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 applies to information held by an independent contractor of a local authority, making that information subject to request under the Act—but only to the extent that the local authority itself is entitled to have access to that information under the contract. An individual's right to complain to the Ombudsmen about matters of administration does not apply to the acts or omissions of local authority contractors. Unless a contractor is designated as an 'officer' of the local authority…(the) complainant jurisdiction may be excluded by a decision to contract out a particular function or a component of it.'

"The report concludes 'in our view it is important to understand, from a public policy perspective, that "the buck" continues to stop at the local authority and not the person who is contracted to perform a regulatory function or service. To the extent that rights of access to information, due process, or complaint may be diminished by a decision to contract out, steps should be taken to preserve those rights by safeguards within the contract."
