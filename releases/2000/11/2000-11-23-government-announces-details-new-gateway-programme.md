Twenty-one schools across the country will pilot the Government's new Gateway – Te Tomokanga programme in 2001, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Gateway – Te Tomokanga is a new initiative which enables senior secondary students (Years 11 to 13) to participate in structured workplace learning. It assists schools to make learning relevant and to broaden students’ options by offering them both traditional and work-place learning. Students pursue individual learning programmes, which allow them to gain new skills and knowledge in a workplace in their local community. The learning is hands-on and practical.

“Gateway offers students new learning choices and new opportunities to begin nationally-recognised qualifications. For example, students looking to go into the hospitality industry will be able to start on a career pathway while they are still at school.

"Twenty-one schools (deciles 1 –5) have been selected to participate in 20 pilots nationally. In Manukau, three schools will be working in partnership. (Please refer to attached list)

"The Gateway would be open to all senior secondary students in the pilot schools.

“This is not a work experience programme, nor is it a programme for under achievers. It is a programme designed to assist schools to make learning relevant to the needs of all students, and to ensure that young people have a smooth transition from school to work.

"The pilot programmes will enable the Government to test delivery models of workplace learning, integrated with the existing school curriculum for senior secondary students. Schools were selected by Skill New Zealand to represent a mix of locations and sizes. Careful consideration was also given to ensure that opportunities for Maori and Pacific Islands students were well represented. The selected schools are situated in both rural and urban areas and provide a blend of co-educational and single sex environments," Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey said he was encouraging employers to take the initiative and contact participating schools in the regions where the pilots are located, or their local Skill New Zealand office.

“Gateway – Te Tomokanga strengthens links between schools and businesses. Employers benefit in the longer term with opportunities to enhance their staff recruitment and selection. Being part of Gateway is a practical way for businesses to contribute to their local communities and to build up the skills in their industry,” Steve Maharey said.
