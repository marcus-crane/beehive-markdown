Health Minister Annette King says she will move an amendment at this week's Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council meeting in Sydney that the draft food standards code should include mandatory labelling of saturated fats and sugars.

Mrs King accepted a petition yesterday from the National Heart Foundation calling for mandatory labelling of saturated fats, and told the foundation she had received the support of Cabinet last week to move the amendment.

Mrs King said she had also received submissions from diabetes organisations urging the importance of sugar labelling.

"I have a duty as Health Minister to listen to health groups who have sensible and practical proposals to put forward. The mandatory labelling of sugars and saturated fats is vitally important for consumers, and the changes to the draft food standards code will only require minor amendments."

Mrs King leaves on Wednesday afternoon to join Australian health ministers in Sydney for the health ministers' regular six-monthly meeting on Thursday and the ANZFSC meeting on Friday.
