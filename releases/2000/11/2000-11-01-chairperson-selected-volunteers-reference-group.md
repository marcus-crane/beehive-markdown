Wellingtonian Nick Toonen will head the 11-member International Year of Volunteers 2001 Ministerial Reference Group, Internal Affairs Minister Mark Burton announced today.

Mr Toonen, who is currently CEO of the New Zealand Association of Citizen’s Advice Bureaux, was elected to the role by the Group membership, Mark Burton said.

Te Warana Ratima of West Auckland, who volunteers with marae/iwi/hapu groups for Ngati Whatua, has the role of Deputy Chairperson.

The IYV Ministerial Reference Group was set up in October to advise the Minister on issues surrounding the Year and to direct and co-ordinate the programme for the Year.

Mr Burton said at its first meeting last week (October 26/27) the Group drafted a National Plan of Action for the Year.

"This draft will be finalised by the Group at a meeting later this month and will then come to me. I expect to be able to publicly release it shortly after that time."

Other members of the IYV Ministerial Reference Group are Denise Henigan (Nelson), Pam McLeod (Taupo), Cheryll Martin (Auckland), John Thornley (Palmerston North), Ekara Lewis (Te Anau), Carol Quirk (Wellington), Jane Poa (Hawkes Bay), Karen Roberts (Wellington) and Bella Tari (Kaikohe).

"The Group was selected for their contacts and networks within volunteer groups, and also for their grass roots volunteering experience," Mark Burton said.
