Foreign Minister Phil Goff leaves this afternoon to attend an Australian Justice Ministers meeting in Adelaide and the APEC Ministerial meeting in Brunei.

In Adelaide Mr Goff will take part in the Australian and New Zealand Justice Ministers' Crime Prevention Forum. The full day meeting is on Friday 10 November.

"This is the inaugural meeting of the Ministerial Forum which will enable us to share ideas and experience across the Tasman on successful ways to prevent crime," Mr Goff said.

On Saturday 11 November Mr Goff travels to Brunei to attend the Foreign Ministers segment of the APEC meeting (12-13 November). This will be a key part in the lead up to the APEC Leaders Meeting to be held on 15-16 November.

"New Zealand is looking for this meeting to maintain the momentum towards APEC's shared vision of a community of open and interdependent economies. This meeting will search for practical ways to help all countries in the region improve their economic and social performance.

"The APEC meetings are an invaluable opportunity each year for us to build on our relationships in the region."

Mr Goff returns through Singapore on Tuesday 14 November, and arrives back in New Zealand Wednesday 15 November.
