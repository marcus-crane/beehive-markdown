New Zealand has won more support for nuclear disarmament at the annual United Nations disarmament session, says Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Matt Robson.

The UN's First Committee of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution "towards a nuclear-weapon-free-world: the need for a new agenda" on Wednesday (November 1) in New York, with 146 votes in favour, three against, and eight absentions.

"I am very pleased with the outcome. At this year's meeting, our ambition has finally been rewarded. The prize of the session is the new support for the "New Agenda" approach to nuclear disarmament - a massive upswing of 56 votes over last year," Mr Robson said.

New Zealand is one of seven countries which has lobbied to convince nuclear powers of the need to adopt a new approach to disarmament. Other "New Agenda" states are Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, South Africa and Sweden.

The United States, Britain, NATO countries, Australia, Japan and China voted in favour of the resolution, compared to last year when they either opposed the resolution or abstained from voting. France and the Russian Federation shifted ground from straight-out opposition to an abstention.

"The New Agenda countries have plugged away on the practical disarmament steps agreed, with New Zealand in the Chair, at April's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. Our persistence is paying off: the strategy to draw countries onto a new path to nuclear weapons elimination is working," said Mr Robson.

The idea of a Southern Hemisphere free of nuclear weapons, being developed by Brazil and New Zealand, also won overwhelming support, although not from the United States, Britain and France.

But the US Britain and France were persuaded to join the Russian Federation as co-sponsors of the resolution promoting the world-wide ban on nuclear testing. India, Pakistan and North Korea have yet to join the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and China and the United States need to ratify their signature.

"We have put the spotlight on hold-out countries which need to ratify the treaty before it can enter into force," said Mr Robson.

The New Zealand delegation to the First Committee was led by Disarmament Ambassador Clive Pearson. The decisions taken will be put to the General Assembly formal plenary next month for final adoption.
