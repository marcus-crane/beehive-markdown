GSFNZ Establishment Board

Basil Logan will chair the Government Superannuation Fund New Zealand Establishment Board. Other members are: Helen Bowie, David May and Tim McGuinness.

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the Cabinet had approved the appointments today.

"I am delighted with the Board's composition. I believe it has the right mix of expertise and experience for this important job."

The Establishment Board will dissolve on the appointment of the inaugural GSFNZ Board that will be set up under the GSF Amendment Bill now before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. The Bill allows the GSF to diversify its investment portfolio and splits it out from the Ministry of Economic Development into a stand-alone organisation.

The Establishment Board's brief will be to:  
· determine the best management structure for the GSFNZ, including both Fund asset management and GSF schemes administration  
· manage the transfer of functions from the MED to the GSF  
· develop a Statement of Intent for the GSFNZ  
· begin preliminary modelling to determine the strategic asset allocation for the Fund.
