Mana Motuhake leader Sandra Lee, who is also deputy leader of the Alliance, paid tribute today to a leading Maori elder, Joseph Tukaki of Matakana Island near Tauranga, who passed away during the weekend.

She said Mr Tukaki had served with distinction as an office holder in several key posts of Mana Motuhake, including as a well-respected member of its governing secretariat.

Ms Lee said he also represented Mana Motuhake on the Alliance Council, the governing body of the Alliance.

"I will sorely miss this kaumatua's contribution, both politically and personally," she said. "He was a man who had a vision for the development not just of his own people but for all people."

"While he was a good strategist who had a fine understanding of policy detail, he will be missed the most for his superb diplomatic negotiating skills," said Ms Lee.

A funeral service for Mr Tukaki will be held at Opureora Marae on Matakana Island, near Tauranga, tomorrow morning.
