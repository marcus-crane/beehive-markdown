A new 24-hour national freephone service to report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect is already being developed, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey confirmed today.

Mr Maharey was responding to calls from Children's Commissioner Roger McClay advocating the establishment of a freephone service.

“Child, Youth and Family has established a call centre in Auckland.

"Except in six sites around the country, people calling 0508 FAMILY (0508 326 459) are connected to the call centre during business hours, Monday to Friday.

"If they call after hours, the call is redirected and a staff member in the caller’s area is alerted to the call. By next year, the 0508 FAMILY service will be nationwide and it is planned to have the call centre staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week," Steve Maharey said.
