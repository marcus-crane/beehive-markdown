An international reference group comprising leading post-compulsory education specialists is being appointed to assist the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The reference group will provide an expert stream of advice on international developments in post-compulsory education and training and act as a sounding board for the Commission. The reference group comprises leading educationalists from Finland, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Australia. Additional members are also being sought from North America.

“New Zealand is not the first country to undertake a major review of its tertiary education system and this group will ensure that the perspectives of other countries, including Australia and England, are considered.

"The establishment of this group will greatly assist the Commission to explore the wide ranging issues the Government has set for them and responds to stakeholder suggestions about how its thinking can be kept up to date with international developments, “Steve Maharey said.

The international reference group comprises:  
\* Johanna Lasonen, Institute for Educational Research, University of Jyvaskyla, Finland;

\* Margareta Ronnback, Director of Education, National Agency of Education, Stockholm, Sweden;

\* Edward Walsh, University of Limerick, Ireland;

\* Ray Griffin, Waterford Institute of Technology, Ireland;

\* Nicholas Fox, Head of Learning Development, Learning Business Link, Kent, UK;

\* Chris Robinson, Managing Director, National Centre for Vocational Education Research, South Australia;

\* Mike Long, Senior Research Fellow, Centre for the Economics of Education and Training, Monash University, Australia; and

\* Simon Marginson, Associate Dean (Research), Director, Monash Centre for Research in International Education, Monash University, Australia.

The International Reference Group will be a “virtual” group by communicating largely by e-mail and virtual conferences.
