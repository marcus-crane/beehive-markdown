I refer to your email of 10 October in which you sought responses to four questions on public libraries in relation to a Listener article you are writing. Your questions, and my responses, are set out below.

Local Government Act 1974, section 601(4)(a) states that residents of the district shall have the right to join their library free of charge - and yet I've been finding that there are provincial libraries charging an annual membership fee - how does that work?

Your question would probably be better addressed to the local authorities that run the libraries in question. To my mind, an annual membership fee does not seem consistent with a right to join the library free of charge, although I am aware that the statutory obligation extends only to residents of that local authority district, and that some libraries charge a membership fee to people from outside the district.

In general terms, I and the Alliance Party believe that access to most library services should be free and publicly funded. I would be most concerned if the charging approach that you outline was having the effect of discouraging access to the learning opportunities that modern libraries can provide, especially for the disadvantaged of our communities.

It's been suggested to me that Government should look again at the funding/rating of libraries, as there is a disparity in rural areas in what people are paying for their local library (farmers pay more via rates, basically, for the same service) - is this a possibility?

I do not believe the Government should dictate to local communities how they should fund particular services. Within the options provided in legislation, the way in which any function is funded is a matter between a local authority and its community. Local authorities are required to develop and consult on a funding policy which describes the way each function of the local authority will be funded. The funding policy must be reviewed at least every three years, at which time the community is able to express its views about funding, including the funding of libraries. These consultations include considering what funding options should be applied to any function.

The Coalition Government is currently conducting a review of local government funding powers. This will look at the types of considerations that local authorities must apply when deciding their funding policies, as well as, the range of funding options that are available.

Could library costs be moved from general rate to Uniform Annual Charge?

Yes presently, as noted above, under the Local Government Act the choice of what options are used to fund different functions is a decision between a local authority and its community. This may include, where appropriate, uniform annual charges.

Also, in March (16) you replied to the Society of Authors re considering amendments to legislation to preclude councils making user charges in libraries - your letter stated that you would be looking into the matter - has this issue been addressed further?

The financial management provisions of the Local Government Act 1974, Part VIIA, include the development of a funding policy by councils at a function by function level. Currently, Part VIIA requires local authorities to explicitly consider issues of public and private benefit when determining their funding policies. They then may select funding mechanisms that approximate their judgement about relative public and private benefit for different functions. As indicated in my letter to the Society of Authors, I am concerned that the introduction of Part VIIA has resulted in increased pressure to use user charges.

The issue that I indicated I was investigating, was whether the current arrangements produced a bias toward user charges and how to ensure that public and community interests are appropriately reflected in local government funding decisions. These issues form part of the current Terms of Reference for the Local Government Funding Powers and Process Review that my Department is undertaking. That review is still in progress and it is intended that there will be a further opportunity for public participation.
