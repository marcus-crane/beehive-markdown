The next stage in developing a New Zealand Tourism Strategy gets underway next week with the convening of eight focus groups in Auckland and Wellington.

Invitees include a range of industry stakeholders along with experts from outside the tourism industry.

The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton is encouraging full participation.

"We need the contributions of a wide range of experts, not just tourism experts, to ensure that the strategy process will deliver a sound set of propositions for sustainable tourism in New Zealand".

The focus groups will cover a range of topics including competitive position, sustainability, cultural issues and tourism customers in the 21st century. The meetings are being held between Friday 1st and Thursday 7th of December.

"The focus groups will review aspects of the work carried out so far to ensure that the team working on the Strategy have captured the right information and are focusing on the right questions," Mark Burton said.

"They will also provide an opportunity for experts from a range of areas and tourism stakeholders to share their knowledge and exchange ideas on the future of Tourism in New Zealand."

"A tourism strategy will not be put on the table at these focus groups, rather the outcomes from the groups will contribute towards developing the strategy."

The Chair of the Strategy Group Evan Davies stressed that the focus groups are not the only avenue for comprehensive consultation on the Strategy.

"There will be further opportunities for those stakeholders who cannot be involved in the focus groups to have an input."
