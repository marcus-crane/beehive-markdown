Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today he has accepted with great regret the resignation of Norman Kingsbury as Chair of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission.

The Commission was established in April to advise the Government on how it can rebuild New Zealand's tertiary education system to meet the needs of the knowledge society. Its first report, Shaping A Shared Vision, was published in July. Further reports will be forthcoming over the next year on the shape of the tertiary system; encouraging cooperation and collaboration; relevant learning opportunities and the funding of learning and research.

"The Government farewells Norman with great regret from the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission. TEAC, under his chairpersonship, has worked extremely hard this year producing an excellent vision statement that will be the foundation of its work in the years to come.

"At the same time Norman has achieved a sea-change within the NZQA to the point where a once-struggling organisation is now leading the focus on quality issues across the tertiary sector. Much of the Authority's recent success is directly attributable to Norman's personal standing within the education community. I am very pleased that he will be able to focus his energies on this important work until his successor Chief Executive is appointed," Steve Maharey said.

Dr Kingsbury said that the Commission was working very well as a group, the first report had been very well received and work was in progress on the second report.

"The Secretariat is satisfactorily established and talented people have been recruited. Consultation with a wide variety of groups is proceeding. The cooperation and interest of the Associate Minister has been much appreciated.

"As the Commission is now in good order, it seems timely for me to cease my involvement. A number of exciting projects have been instituted at NZQA and I want to ensure that these are successfully handed over to my successor when he or she is appointed," Dr Kingsbury said.

Dr Kingsbury's resignation takes effect from Wednesday, 8 November 2000.
