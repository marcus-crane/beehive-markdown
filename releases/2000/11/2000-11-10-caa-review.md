Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today that the Ministry of Transport has announced the members of the independent team charged with reviewing the Civil Aviation Authority.

Mr Tom Gott from Price Waterhouse Coopers will lead the review.

Technical expertise will be provided by international aviation experts Jerry O'Day and Don Spruston.

Mr O'Day is a former Royal Australian Navy test pilot with an extensive background in management with the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

Mr Spruston is a former head of aviation safety regulation with Transport Canada. He was a member of the 1998 Ministerial Inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority.

The Minister has commissioned the review in order to examine some of the concerns that industry representatives have expressed to him since taking office. This review will be undertaken in conjunction with the scheduled triennial performance review.

The terms of reference for the review provide for a more in-depth assessment than the typical triennial performance review. The review team is expected to advise the Minister on any changes in the Authority's systems policies and practices which could enhance the Authority's performance and improve its relationship with industry, while recognising its fundamental obligation of protecting the public interest in aviation safety.

The review is expected to get underway in mid-November. The review team will report to the Minister in the new year. After consideration of the review recommendations, he will report to Cabinet with any proposed action resulting from the review.
