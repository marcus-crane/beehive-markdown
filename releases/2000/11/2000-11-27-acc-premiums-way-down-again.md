For Immediate ReleaseMedia Statement  
ACC premiums on the way down - again  
ACC premiums are on the way down again, almost a year after the Government introduced legislation to remove private insurers from work place accident insurance.  
Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen announced his plans today to lower the average risk weighted premiums.  
Dr Cullen says an improvement in ACC's injury prevention programmes and a commitment to getting people back to work earlier is behind the drop in premiums.  
He says while ACC has recommended slightly lower premiums in most instances, as Minister he is obliged to ensure a prudential margin in the premium rates.  
Residual claims levy  
Currently 40 cents per $100 earnings  
New Rate 35 cents per $100 earning  
A reduction of12.5%

The second ACC legislation, the Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Bill is expected to become law later next year.
