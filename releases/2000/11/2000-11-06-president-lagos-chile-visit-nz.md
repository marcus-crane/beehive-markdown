Helen Clark said she was delighted that President Lagos was taking time to visit New Zealand for talks before the Apec leaders' meeting in Brunei next week.

"This will be the fourth occasion I have met President Lagos this year. I attended his inauguration in Chile in March, and then was with him at meetings of the Progressive Governance group of social democratic leaders in Berlin in June, and New York in September.

"Apart from previewing matters arising at the Apec meeting, I will be keen to continue the discussions the President and I have had on closer economic relationships between Chile and New Zealand.

"The issues are more complex for Chile than for New Zealand but we intend to keep up dialogue on the matter. I know President Lagos will be very interested to hear more about the closer economic partnership which is being developed between New Zealand and Singapore," Helen Clark said.

President Lagos will meet with the Prime Minister in Auckland on Sunday 12 November and be the guest of honour at a State luncheon at the Carlton Hotel. Further details of President Lagos' visit will be confirmed later in the week.
