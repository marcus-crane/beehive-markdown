What Jim Anderton wants to know is whether John Carter supports having kiwi bank branches in rural areas, and will he guarantee that if he ever gets back into government those branches won't be closed.

The Deputy Prime Minister again confirmed that the kiwi bank will charge lower fees than existing banks charge now.  
"It will cost them less than they are paying now and the service will be better," Jim Anderton said.

"The existing banks have to cover the entire costs of their network from banking alone, and they made a profit of $1600 million last year. The kiwi bank will only have to cover the marginal costs of providing banking - including any security upgrades where necessary. When the overseas-owned banks are making such healthy profits, it suggests there is room in the market for a people's bank too.

National MP John Carter has visited Southland and challenged Jim Anderton on whether branches can be set up in rural towns.

"To suggest people in small towns won't have buildings available that could serve as a bank is more than a little insulting, I think John Carter must go round with his eyes closed, his government ensured many towns have empty shops.

"There have already been high profile robberies of security vans where money has to be transported great distances across Southland because many towns don't have banks. The kiwi bank restoring banking facilities to rural towns will also increase safety.

"Obviously those electorates where the local MP is enthusiastic will have a much better chance of getting a bank. Now it's up to John Carter: Does he support having kiwi bank branches in rural areas, and will he guarantee that if he ever gets back into government those branches won't be closed?"
