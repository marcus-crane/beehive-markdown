Information Technology Minister Paul Swain is encouraging small to medium sized businesses to make use of the e-commerce guide launched at the government's e-commerce summit.

"This free guide, put together by the Ministry of Economic Development, is a great practical tool for small to medium sized businesses wanting to get into e-commerce," Paul Swain said.

"The guide is designed to give businesses basic information about e-commerce and how to best take advantage of it.

"It explains what e-commerce is and the changes it is likely to make to the way we do business.

"It looks at the experiences of a few New Zealand Businesses that have taken the plunge and are successfully using e-commerce and the Internet as business tools.

"And it provides some practical guidance on how to get started and where to get help.

"The guide is available online at: http://www.med.govt.nz/consumer/elcom/guide/index.html or in hard copy through business development agencies around the country.

"And for those who want just an indication of what's in the guide there is a shorter brochure form available. Brochures can be found at sites including Citizens Advice Bureau and libraries.

"This is a handy resource that businesses should find very useful. It doesn't cost anything and I encourage businesses to get hold of one," Paul Swain said.
