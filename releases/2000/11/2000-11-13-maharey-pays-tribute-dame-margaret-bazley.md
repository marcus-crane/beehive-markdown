Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey is paying tribute to Ministry of Social Policy Chief Executive Margaret Bazley whose retirement from the public service was announced today.

"The Government wants to place on record its appreciation for Dame Margaret's dedication and hard work within the public service for more than 40 years.

"As Minister of Social Services and Employment, and the current Minister to whom Dame Margaret reports, it falls to me to formally thank her for the significant contribution she has made to public administration in New Zealand.

"In 1999 Margaret Bazley was made a Dame Companion of The New Zealand Order of Merit in recognition of the work she has completed on behalf of successive governments during a life-long career in the public service.

"Dame Margaret is currently involved in establishing the new Ministry of Social Policy.

"I am sure that the many Ministers to whom Dame Margaret has reported will want to join with me in wishing her a happy retirement. On behalf of the Government I extend our very best wishes," Steve Maharey said.
