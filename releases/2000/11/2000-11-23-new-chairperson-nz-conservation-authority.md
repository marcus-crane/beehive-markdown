The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the new Chairperson of the NZ Conservation Authority is Kerry Marshall of Richmond, Nelson. She said Mr Marshall had served as a member of the NZ Conservation Authority's board since 1996, and was the choice of the other members to act as its Chairperson on the retirement of his predecessor Sir Duncan McMullin in August.

"We are fortunate to be able to harness Kerry's substantial experience with public sector organisations," Ms Lee said. "I have no doubt that he will use his skills to best advantage for the Conservation Authority."

The NZ Conservation Authority is an independent statutory body appointed by the Minister of Conservation to advise on the Department's policy and activities at the national level. It is closely involved in conservation planning, policy and management advice.

Mr Marshall is a past president of Local Government New Zealand, a former Mayor of Tasman District, and the current Chairperson of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission. His term of appointment as Chairperson of the NZ Conservation Authority runs until 31 May 2002.

Ms Lee has also paid tribute to Sir Duncan McMullin for his heartfelt and notable contribution while he served on the Conservation Authority.

The Minister also announced today that the immediate past chairperson of the Nelson/Marlborough Conservation Board, Hugh Canard, had been re-appointed to the local board to replace departing member Scott Nicol. She said Mr Canard had originally not been re-appointed to the local board in August because although he shared with Mr Nicol a strong commitment to conservation, she had accepted advice that it was time for a change.

"With Mr Nicol's departure creating a vacancy, I have studied the representations made on Mr Canard's behalf and I am well satisfied that he is the best available replacement to serve the interests of conservation in the region yet again."
