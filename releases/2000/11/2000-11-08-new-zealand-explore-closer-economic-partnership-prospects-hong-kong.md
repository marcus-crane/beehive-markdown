Hong Kong is a dynamic North Asian economy, and a key trading partner for  
New Zealand, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The two countries enjoyed excellent relations.

"I welcome Mrs Chan's reported comments, which confirm that Hong Kong has  
been re-evaluating its previous policy of not entering into bilateral trade  
agreements, favouring instead the multi-lateral route to trade  
liberalisation.

"On my instructions, New Zealand officials have briefed Hong Kong officials  
on the Singapore-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership agreement, and are  
to hold exploratory discussions on the concept of a CEP between New Zealand  
and Hong Kong."

Mr Sutton said that, with the agreement of Cabinet, these discussions would  
now become more structured, but it was not yet a formal negotiation.

"It is my hope that we will be able to move quite quickly to that stage."

Mr Sutton said such a development would of course entail Cabinet  
endorsement of a detailed negotiating brief and extensive public outreach  
and consultation.
