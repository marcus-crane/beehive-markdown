"Children in Tairawhiti will now have access to computers thanks to the Tairawhiti Taskforce and Project Rorohiko," said Jim Anderton Deputy Prime Minister today as he launched the 44 page report of the groundbreaking Tairawhiti Development Taskforce.

"Access to technology is a major part of participating in our community and our children particularly need to be able to use computers in today's increasingly high tech world. Two thousand computers will be installed over the coming months through Project Rorohiko. They will be of huge benefit to the people of Tairawhiti," said Jim Anderton.

The funding has come from the Ministry of Education $800,000, the Ministry of Economic Development $750,000 and Te Puni Kokiri $750,000.

"People in the region identified access to computers in schools and communities as a major issue and we have been able to deliver. The Hon Trevor Mallard, Minister of Education and Hon Parekura Horomia, Minister of Maori Affairs and I were able to secure funding to get surplus government computers installed and provide training and support.

"The Ministry of Economic Development has sourced software and accessories for the computers, and the Ministers and various departments have seen this as a priority," said Jim Anderton.

Achievements of the Taskforce which will be implemented in the months to come include:  
„h Creating the Taskforce with all the key players in the region, and a commitment from them to continue working together.  
„h The announcement of a regional road, port and rail review to develop proposals for securing transport networks in and out of the region. The process will involve the Taskforce, the Ministry of Economic Development, local regional and district councils, the Ministry of Transport, Transfund, and Transit New Zealand.  
„h Establishment of thirteen regional hubs of computers around Tairawhiti.  
„h Young people undertaking the Army's Limited Service Volunteer training scheme.  
„h A calendar of events and activities for the region so that regional support can be provided to activities that are underway.  
„h $240,000 over three years by the Ministry of Agriculture for an advisory service to improve productive use of Maori land in the Tairawhiti region.  
„h A home safety advertising campaign on local radio stations.  
„h A commitment to work toward processing 60 per cent of logs in the region.

The Tairawhiti Development Taskforce has been meeting since May 2000. The Mayors of Wairoa and Gisborne invited Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Parekura Horomia and Janet Mackey MP to help improve prospects for jobs and businesses in the Tairawhiti region.

The public meetings today where the full report was to be released were at 10.30 am at the Wairoa Community Centre, Marine Parade; and 2.30 pm at the Army Hall corner of Fitzherbert & Stout Streets, Gisborne.
