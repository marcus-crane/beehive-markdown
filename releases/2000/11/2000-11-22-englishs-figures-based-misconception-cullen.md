22 November 2000Media Statement  
English's figures based on misconception - Cullen

"Either Mr English has completely failed to understand how the proposed New Zealand Superannuation Fund will work or he is being mischievous," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen was responding to a statement by Mr English that at its peak, the Fund would contribute only around 14 percent of NZSuper costs.

"In fact, the contribution will be closer to 25 percent. Mr English is counting only the amount which will be directly drawn down from the Fund.

"But the Government will receive a further revenue stream from the Fund in the taxes paid on the Fund's earnings.

"It seems an extraordinarily silly mistake to make since obviously the point of establishing a capital investment Fund is to generate income from the accumulated assets," Dr Cullen said.

"The Government has always been very clear that we are only talking of partial pre-funding. We have never said, or even implied, that the Fund will be able to fully meet future New Zealand Super costs.

"Rather than trying to score petty political points, Mr English should explain what National's alternative is. What would it do to make up the 25 percent contribution  
the Fund would provide?

"For someone on Mr English's salary, a 25 percent cut to the pension might not look too frightening. But it would tip many elderly New Zealanders into poverty," Dr Cullen said.

"And is it too much to ask for Mr English to try to be just the tiniest bit consistent? First he criticises the scheme as a "monster." Now he criticises it because it will not be big enough. If he wants to be taken seriously on this issue, he will have to do better than that," Dr Cullen said.
