The Minister of Corrections, the Hon Matt Robson, has announced the shortlist of possible sites within southern Auckland on which to build the new women's prison.

"Two sites in Manukau City have been shortlisted after a rigorous selection process," he says.

One site (SA001) is located on the western side of Price Road in Manukau City.

The site is bounded by the Manukau Harbour to the west, a small stream to the north, Puhinui Reserve to the south and Price Road to the east. The site is 58 hectares.

The other site (SA032) is located off Roscommon Road in Manukau City.

McLaughlins Mountain/Matukutureia abuts the site to the west, beyond which to the south-west are the stonefields. Adjacent land to the west includes a working quarry.

An oil tankfarm occupies land to the north, and an industrial subdivision has been approved for the land between the site and Roscommon Road.

Visy Board occupies land adjacent to the southeast corner of the site. The site is 46 hectares.

Mr Robson says extensive consultation on the sites will now begin.

"My Department will consult widely on the sites between now and Christmas. They will then recommend a site from the shortlist.

"I will decide on the site in February 2001. By then there will have been further technical analysis of the sites' suitability, as well as extensive community consultation.

"I will then seek a designation under the Resource Management Act to allow the new prison to be built on the site.

"The Department has set-up an 0800 number (0800 263 880) offering further information.

"The Department will be running open days and public meetings within Manukau City (see below), as well as face to face briefings of community groups and other interested parties. An information pack is also available."

Mr Robson says key reasons for shortlisting the two sites include:

Both sites offer excellent access to Manukau City. Although close to an urban centre, neither is in a residential area, nor in an area identified for future urban expansion.

Both sites are close to the new Manukau courthouse on Wiri Station Road.

There is a public transport service feeding Manukau Central. The sites are close to the motorways and the railway corridor.

Economic impact

The new women's prison will provide 75 direct and 28 indirect jobs. Staff wages and salaries are estimated to be $3.5 million per year. A further $900,000 will be spent on other goods and services.

During construction, there will be an additional boost to the local economy. The direct impact on employment is likely to be an additional 125 jobs with additional wages and salaries of around $18 million over the 18 month construction period.

"I want people to come forward and make their views known through the consultation process.

"Constructing a new prison is the easy part. Getting communities behind modern prisons and contributing to the rehabilitation that takes place in them is more difficult.

"Politicians and officials alone cannot create a prison system that keeps our communities safe. But together, we can get the job done."

The shortlist of sites in southern Auckland for the men's prison will be announced before Christmas.
