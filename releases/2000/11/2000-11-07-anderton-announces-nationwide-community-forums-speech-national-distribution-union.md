"A chance for community organisations and unions to talk with Government," is how Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton described the three forums he announced today for Government and the community sector, following on from the successful Government Business Forum.

The Government will be holding three forums in Auckland Wellington, and Christchurch. The first will be in Auckland on the 17th of November, and a range of groups in the community will be invited to talk with relevant Government Ministers.

"We are inviting unions and community organisations to discuss the issues that the government is working on. Unions recognise they have a legitimate place at the table with business leaders as they make decisions affecting workers. So, too, the Government wants to work alongside all productive New Zealanders.

"Also I want to announce to you today that I intend to host a few forums myself - informal get-togethers at my state house, Vogel House.

"I want to bring together informally unions and community organisations - as well as businesses - to look at how they can contribute to economic development and to develop their ideas for the government," said Jim Anderton.

Dates for the following two Community Forums have yet to be finalised.
