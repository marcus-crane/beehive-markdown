Auckland Central MP and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, has expressed dismay over the decision by Fullers Group to cancel its daily ferry service between Gulf Harbour and Downtown Auckland.

Fullers has cited a lack of patronage as the prime reason for ending the service on December the 22nd.

"It is very disappointing to hear of the demise of the Gulf Harbour to Downtown Auckland service because ferries do have a great deal to offer in improving public transport in Auckland," Judith Tizard said.

"Hasty decisions are ones we can live to regret.

"I expect Fullers and the Auckland Regional Council to work closely to resurrect a reliable ferry service for the residents of the growing area of Gulf Harbour and to expand the service throughout the region.

"Indeed, the new system of patronage-based funding for public transport gives the Regional Council and operators the incentives and the tools to keep a sharp eye for public transport opportunities, and engage in strong marketing."

On the other side of Auckland, the ferry service running between Half Moon Bay and Downtown Auckland "has been a roaring success, and an example the ARC and operators should be working very hard to emulate for the residents of Gulf Harbour.

"Ferries can offer a pleasant alternative to travel by land. They have a valuable place in Auckland's public transport future," Judith Tizard said.
