There has been a constant criticism that Wellington bureaucrats have been the driving force of policy development rather than the Ministers they are supposed to serve says Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment Hon Tariana Turia.

"Our whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori have bared the brunt of exclusive policy decision-making processes which have become the norm for Government departments and the evidence is blatantly obvious.

"There is evidence both in New Zealand and internationally that the indigenous people are the most capable of directing their own development, however they are too often excluded from sitting at the decision making table.

"The Labour Manifesto supports an inclusive policy development process and intends to implement that practice. A big part of Labour's Maori Development policy is to build the capacity of whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori to better provide for themselves.

"I have yet to see the public service facilitate a 'by Maori for Maori' policy development approach that is inclusive of our whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori. The public service must start at home. It must look at itself and ensure it has the necessary capacity at all levels to deliver on the Government's policy," Hon. Tariana Turia said.
