Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee and Sir Peter Blake today witnessed the signing into law of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park Bill by the Governor General in Auckland.  
"It is appropriate that the first enactment of this millennium celebrates and protects this special part of New Zealand. This Act is a commitment by this Government to future generations, about the care for the waters and islands of the Hauraki Gulf," Sandra Lee said.  
"As a Gulf resident, I have campaigned along with many others, for this day. I am proud to stand alongside former Ministers and a myriad of Gulf users to find a better way to manage the Gulf.  
"The Hauraki Gulf is world famous for its beauty and natural quality. Today it is a venue for the America's Cup regatta, but this new Park recognises that the Gulf has been a home and a haven for a thousand years. In this new millennium there will be an even greater need to provide for the needs of nature, wildlife and commerce within the park which now forms the front doorstep to metropolitan Auckland and the rich farmland of the Hauraki."  
The Minister was joined at the ceremony by Sir Peter Blake, a prominent supporter of the new Park.  
"From my boyhood when I learned to sail in these waters, I have loved this place. To me this is one of the very special places on the globe," he said.  
The new Hauraki Gulf Marine Park Act comes into effect today. The Park covers some 1.2 million hectares of sea extending from Mangawhai to Whangamata and including the Firth of Thames, Hauraki Gulf and Waitemata harbour. The park is composed of all Crown reserves within this area including Little Barrier Island, much of Great Barrier, Tiritiri-Matangi, Rangitoto, Cuvier and the Aldermen Islands.  
"The National importance of these places is now recognised by this our first 'National Park of the Sea' and the Act ensures that they will be protected in perpetuity," Sandra Lee said.
