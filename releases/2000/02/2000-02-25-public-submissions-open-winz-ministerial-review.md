The team undertaking the Ministerial review of Work and Income New Zealand has begun receiving written public submissions, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said the review team, headed by Don Hunn, was prepared to receive written submissions from groups and individuals in the community with an interest in WINZ.

"For example, I expect that some of the major beneficiary organisations would like to make submissions," Trevor Mallard said.

"However, organisations and individuals should be mindful that the submission process is just one way the review will measure the department's external relationships. An independent survey is also being conducted on behalf of the review team in this area.

"People who are making submissions must be mindful that the review is largely an organisational one. Consequently, submissions should cover organisational and management issues.

"Mr Hunn is not expected to respond to individual cases or specific, individual problems that people might be experiencing with WINZ or any other department.

"Submissions should be framed within the terms of reference," Trevor Mallard said.

Submissions to the review close at 5.00pm, Friday, 17 March 2000 and should be addressed to:

Mr Don Hunn  
Ministerial Review Team - WINZ  
C/o Office of Hon Trevor Mallard  
Minister of State Services
