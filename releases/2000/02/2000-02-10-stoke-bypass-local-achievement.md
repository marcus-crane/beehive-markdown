"The new Stoke bypass proves a community can work together and realise a common goal," Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

He was speaking at the opening of a new 7.2 km Stoke Bypass near Nelson today.

Nelson taxi driver Mike Rodwell, who collected 20,000 signatures for a parliamentary petition to have the bypass built, drove Mr Gosche to the new road.

"Mike and many others were worried about the safety of hundreds of Stoke children who had to navigate their way to four schools down a suburban street that saw more than 28,000 vehicles travelling down it each day.
