The Minister of Social Services and Employment, Steve Maharey, announced today that an external WINZ Advisory Board was being disestablished as he moved to effect a culture change within the department.

Mr. Maharey said he had instructed WINZ Chief Executive, Christine Rankin, to disestablish her Advisory Board to the Chief Executive, because he wished to avoid any potential conflict over the strategic direction he had set for the department. The terms of reference for the former board specifically charged it with being a sounding board for Mrs Rankin to use when determining the future direction of WINZ.

“Mrs Rankin and I have discussed my expectations for WINZ regularly since the election. My associate ministers, Ruth Dyson and Parekura Horomia, and I, have adopted a firm hands-on approach to our oversight of WINZ. We are determined to provide clear direction on the sort of culture we wish to build within the WINZ and we do not see a role for this board any longer.

“Our objective is to achieve a culture change within WINZ that reflects the roles and responsibilities of a core public sector department. An advisory board made up of private sector representatives charged with influencing strategic direction could be in conflict with this objective.

“I am advised that the seven-member board has met six times since it was established on 26 May 1999. The board’s costs to date total $23,679”, Steve Maharey said.
