The findings of a just-released report on the health of New Zealanders have been welcomed by Minister of Health Annette King.

“Our Health, Our Future provides the information we need for sound decision making.

“The findings of the report will be fed in to the primary care and disability support services strategy, as well as our overall New Zealand Health Strategy,” Mrs King said.

“The Ministry of Health has started work on the health strategy, which will provide a comprehensive framework to deal with New Zealand’s health problems.

“We are aware of most of the issues that this report raises. What Our Health, Our Future does is provide reliable data which identifies and quantifies the issues. We need this information before we can develop solutions which will work.”

Mrs King said the report contained both bad and good news.

“It is positive to see the health gains New Zealand has made over the past half century, particularly in terms of how long people can expect to live.

“However, there is much that needs to be done. For example, the findings reinforce the significant health disparities between rich and poor, Pakeha and tangata whenua.

“We have committed ourselves to reducing the gap in people’s health-related quality of life.

“One of the most positive findings in the report is that there is the opportunity to significantly reduce illness and the number of people dying younger than necessary.

“We will look to capitalise on these opportunities. I have already announced my intention to ban smoking in restaurants and cafes. This report showed that tobacco consumption is a significant factor in disease and early deaths.”
