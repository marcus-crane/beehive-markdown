The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, has thanked the Chair of TVNZ, Roseanne Meo, for her service on the board.

"I appreciated her willingness to stay on as chair after her term expired at the end of December and I understand completely her decision to resign now," Ms Hobbs said.  
"Roseanne has invested a huge amount of energy and drive in pursuing the objectives set down for TVNZ by the former government. I know just how hard she worked promoting the digital television proposal which the Labour-Alliance government has put on hold."

Ms Hobbs said the process for appointing a new chair for TVNZ is under way and she hopes it can be concluded within a fortnight.

Meanwhile she will consider whether it is necessary to appoint an acting chair of TVNZ pending the permanent appointment.
