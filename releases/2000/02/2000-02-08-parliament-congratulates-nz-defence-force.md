Parliament's appreciation of the efforts of New Zealand military personnel in East Timor was expressed when Parliament reconvened today after the Christmas recess.  
The business of the House, after the swearing in of Paul Swain, began with a notice of motion from Defence Minister Mark Burton.  
The motion read: "That this House note its pride in the outstanding performance of New Zealand Defence Force personnel involved in the INTERFET operation in East Timor; and congratulate them on their contribution to establishing the secure base on which the new United Nations administration can now build with the East Timorese people."  
The Minister's comments were supported by National MP Wayne Mapp and New Zealand First MP Ron Mark. Both MPs were part of the parliamentary delegation that Mr Burton led to East Timor last week.
