PROFESSOR Gordon Wright, one of three members of the Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry team, is standing down, Health Minister Annette King said today.

Mrs King said Professor Wright, a Queensland-based pathologist, was a valued member of the team, whose departure was regretted.

"However I quite understand that Professor Wright is unable to continue as a member of the inquiry team because of the delay caused by the decision to shift the inquiry hearings to Gisborne. The extended timeframe for the inquiry has unfortunately caused conflicts with Professor Wright's other professional commitments."

Mrs King announced last week that all the inquiry hearings would be held in Gisborne, rather than Auckland, to meet the justified concerns of Gisborne and Tairawhiti women. That decision meant the formal hearings would begin in March, not February as originally planned.

"While I am sorry that the delay has meant Professor Wright is not able to continue, I am very grateful for the extensive professional work he has already done for the inquiry. I know the advice he has given has been valued by the other members of the Inquiry Team, Ailsa Duffy QC and Druis Barrett," Mrs King said.

Mrs King said she expected to be able to announce a replacement for Professor Wright shortly.
