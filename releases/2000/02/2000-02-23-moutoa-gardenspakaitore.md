Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that Whanganui Iwi and the Wanganui District Council and Crown representatives met today to discuss a way forward with respect to Moutoa Gardens/Pakaitore.

The discussions were convened in Wellington by Te Puni Kökiri and included a delegation from the Wanganui District Council and Whanganui Iwi. Helen Clark, Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Tariana Turia and Wanganui MP Jill Pettis were in attendance.

It was resolved today to agree to a process of tripartite discussions and to meet again in early March to find a long term solution.

"The Crown has been the missing party in this long running dispute," said Helen Clark.

"My government is determined to move forward quickly to fulfil its Treaty obligations.

"I believe Wanganui District Council and Whanganui Iwi are showing tremendous courage in agreeing to work with us to resolve these issues," Helen Clark said.
