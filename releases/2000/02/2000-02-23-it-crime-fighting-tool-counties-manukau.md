Counties Manukau Police will soon get a successful computerised crime-fighting tool that will help them catch burglars and solve other crimes.

Police Minister and Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins, said a successful computerised crime fighting tool called M.A.P.S \[or Map based Analytical Policing System] will be set up in Counties Manukau by the end of July.

M.A.P.S. is a crime analysis tool that uses screen based maps to enable officers to analyse information and intelligence on criminals and crime, and directs police patrols to crime hotspots.

"M.A.P.S has proven to be a huge asset to Wellington police since November 1999 in their fight against burglaries, youth offending and violent crime," George Hawkins said.

"Too many burglaries go unsolved in Counties Manukau. M.A.P.S. will provide police with information that will help solve crimes.

"The previous National government muddled the way it approached police IT needs. Its Think-Big-Bang INCIS project repeatedly cost us tens of millions of dollars, and the $7.6 million mainframe cost $500,000 a month to run.

"National's IT expert Maurice Williamson had warned his Cabinet that INCIS would not do what the police expected. Microsoft had warned them that it was wasted money. Despite hearing that, Jenny Shipley, John Luxton and the National Cabinet ignored that expert advice.

"I have decided enough is enough. This INCIS mainframe - the big brain but no braun INCIS hub - will be sold. The computer terminals and hardware will stay.

"In the future the Government will take a smaller modular approach to developing crime fighting IT systems. These systems will be tested to insure information and intelligence can be stored on gangs and criminal activity and processed. If successful, the modules will be approved.

"The M.A.P.S tool which will finally be set up in Counties Manukau is a good example of a modular system that works," George Hawkins said.
