The East Timor tour of duty for New Zealand service men and women will be reduced to six months.  
The Minister of Defence, Mark Burton, and the Chief of New Zealand’s Defence Force, Air Marshal Carey Adamson, said today the current contingent would be replaced two months earlier than planned.  
The first group to rotate will be the No.3 Squadron helicopter detachment who will return to New Zealand next month followed by the Army elements of the First Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, in May.  
Mr Burton recently returned from a fact-finding visit to East Timor.  
"The length of the tour of duty was an issue raised with me by a number of the New Zealand personnel I met.  
"Conditions in East Timor are extremely harsh. I am delighted that we have been able to come up with a workable solution that allows us to reduce the tour of duty, while maintaining a significant presence in Timor by increasing the number of rotations from two to three.  
"This is a decision that is important for the morale and health of our armed forces."  
As part of the transition from INTERFET to the United Nations mandated UNTAET, 96 service people will leave Timor at the end of this month.  
"It was intended to leave the remaining 660 people in theatre till June. Today’s decision will be welcome by both the personnel deployed and their families," Mr Burton said.  
Air Marshal Adamson said the New Zealand force will continue to operate in the Suai region with a small number of personnel forming the national command element in Dili.  
"The first of the rotation forces based on No.3 Squadron will deploy to East Timor next month followed by members of the Christchurch-based Second/First Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, in May."
