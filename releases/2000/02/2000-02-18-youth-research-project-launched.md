The Youth First research project enables young people to send a clear message to the government about the realities of growing up in New Zealand, said Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré.

Speaking at the project's launch at Auckland University, Ms Harré said Youth First recognises that adults don't have the best solutions to the problems faced by young people.

"For too long the government has left the very people affected by youth policies out of the decision making process," Ms Harré said.

"I believe solutions to the problems faced by young people must be driven by young people, and this project is an opportunity for that to happen."

Ms Harré said Youth First tribunals being held around the country will generate valuable information on the issues faced by young people from different walks of life.

"There's no such thing as a panacea for the problems facing young people, and developing effective policies means recognising that New Zealand's youth population is not a homogenous group," she said.

"The responsibility will then lie with policy makers to stop, listen and respond constructively to what young people have said."
