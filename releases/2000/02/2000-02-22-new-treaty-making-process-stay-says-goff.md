Treaty-making procedures that have been on trial in Parliament are to be implemented on a permanent basis, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"The new procedures essentially require all multilateral treaties to be presented to the House for Select Committee consideration before being ratified, acceded to, accepted or approved," Mr Goff said.

"The tabling procedures have worked well in practice and have provided a positive opportunity for Parliament to consider treaties before New Zealand becomes party to them," Mr Goff said.

"The new process is consistent with both the new, more consultative parliamentary environment as well as our commitment to provide better information about New Zealand's international obligations."

Mr Goff said some technical adjustments and other changes would be made to improve the process, in line with recommendations from the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee which reviewed the trial period.
