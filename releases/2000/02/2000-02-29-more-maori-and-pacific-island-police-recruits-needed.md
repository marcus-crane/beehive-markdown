Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has called for more police officers from Maori, Pacific Islands and ethnic cultures.

Maori and Pacific Islands people are over represented in the crime statistics. There are complex and well entrenched reasons for this, George Hawkins said.

"There are also many bright young Maori and Pacific Islands people who should think of a career in the police.

"If we recruit more Maori and Pacific Islands people into the police, this will build trust, develop contacts with these communities, go a long way toward dealing with crimes and preventing crimes from occurring," George Hawkins said.

He said the New Zealand Police is often viewed as a predominantly male and caucasian institution.

"While there have been moves to try and address this, I want the police to campaign for more recruits from Maori, Pacific Islands and ethnic cultures to achieve a more balanced racial mix of officers."

New Zealand culture is forever changing. We have more ethnic groups living in New Zealand than ever before: "Groups from Asia make up a significant part of New Zealand's population.

"Police should also be seeking those who have the language skills that reflect migrant communities. If we have more representation in the police from those groups, the community will be the winner," George Hawkins said.
