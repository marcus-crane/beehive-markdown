The Maori Broadcasting Committee has agreed with Te Mangai Paho's current contract tendering process, which it understands will see contracts run for 12 months, chairman Hon Parekura Horomia, said today.

"There has been much speculation surrounding Maori broadcasting and after many hui with all interested parties including the Minister of Broadcasting Hon Marian Hobbs, Maori Ministers and Maori members of Parliament it is now appropriate to announce the Committee's plans," Mr Horomia said.

The committee supports the year-long contracts as they avoid making long term commitments that may eventually compromise this Government's ability to implement a long term Maori broadcasting strategy.

The Committee has also agreed to develop a long term Maori framework to consider immediate issues of concern for Maori broadcasters such as training and funding as well as more high level concerns such as the role of broadcasting in Maori language revitalisation.

Mr Horomia said this will require consultation with experts from within the industry as well as with whanau, hapu and iwi.

"The Committee looks forward to developing a more strategic and integrated approach to Maori broadcasting."
