Minister Responsible for Timberlands West Coast Pete Hodgson today welcomed the decision by the company to end the consultancy arrangement with Mr Kit Richards.

"The Government's position from the outset has been that the arrangement was untenable," Mr Hodgson said. "I conveyed this view to the chairperson of the board, Mr Warren Young, on Thursday last week, soon after I learnt of the arrangement.

"In the intervening period Mr Young has been in consultation with his chief executive examining the precise terms of the arrangement and the precise tasks undertaken by Mr Richards.

"Last night I raised with Mr Young a number of points that he was unable immediately to answer, mainly because he had been occupied with a High Court hearing involving the company.

"Those outstanding points have now been answered and the company has taken its decision."
