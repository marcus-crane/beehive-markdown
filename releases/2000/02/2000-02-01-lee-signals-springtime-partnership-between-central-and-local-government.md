Local Government Minister Sandra Lee is signalling a 'springtime of partnership' between central and local government under the new coalition government.  
Releasing the Internal Affairs Department briefing to the incoming Local Government Minister, Sandra Lee said the new government would work closely with local government in the economic and regional development of New Zealand.  
"The new Government will invest in regional development. Changing technology, demographic changes and the need to ensure resources are used sustainably and distributed fairly mean that both central and local government have a responsibility to develop infrastructure, including water, ports, our roads and transport services."  
The briefing papers highlight the need for an overhaul of the Local Government Act 1974.  
"Local Government has endured a long period of restructuring which has often been designed to privatise publicly-owned assets. This Government will not be encouraging that. We want to invest in assets such as water. We won't be  
arranging the sale of them.  
"There will be a priority on improving democracy at the local level. I propose, in consultation with Auckland local authorities, to bring in legislation this year in line with Government policy to put the assets of Infrastructure Auckland under democratic management.  
"I also propose reviewing the legislation relating to LATEs (Local Authority Trading Enterprises) to allow councils to give consideration to social as well as economic goals.  
"I would like to see local authorities given more flexible powers to do what their communities want them to do. At the moment, local government can only do what is specifically allocated to it in the law."
