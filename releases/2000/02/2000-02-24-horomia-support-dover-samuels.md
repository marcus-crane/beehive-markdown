Associate Minister of Mäori Affairs, Parekura Horomia today reiterated his wholehearted support for Mäori Affairs Minister Dover Samuels.

Parekura Horomia refuted claims that he was after Minister Samuel's job, and said he had placed his whole-hearted support behind Minister Samuels.

"Along with the Minister of Mäori Affairs, Sandra Lee, Tariana Turia and myself are here to achieve one thing – close the gaps between Maori and non-Mäori. That is what our focussed effort will be on and we have the mandate of the people to do this. Any outside attempts to undermine us in our efforts will not get traction. The kaupapa is too important and our commitment to our people is unstinting.

"Of course there are bumpy bits for all of us in these early days of a new Government, but I can assure you unequivocally that I am committed to ensuring that our work in the Mäori Affairs portfolio makes a difference for Mäori.

"I am also working to make a difference in the other portfolios I have responsibilities in.  
"I work to and with Dover Samuels on the Mäori economic development portfolio and we support each other in our efforts to reduce the disparity gaps for Mäori. I know my colleagues are working equally hard at making positive gains for Mäori".

"If I can effect positive change for Mäori in the three portfolios I have responsibilities in - education, employment and Mäori economic development, then I know I will have been successful in assisting the Minister of Mäori Affairs to reach our common goal," Mr Horomia said.
