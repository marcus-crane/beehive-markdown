Minister of Disarmament Matt Robson welcomed indications from China that it wants to see the Conference on Disarmament's work this year include preventing an arms race in outer space.

"I hope that this is an indication that we can expect China's support on some other key initiatives that are important to New Zealand," said Matt Robson.

"I hope to attend the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva next month, and I intend to make sure that New Zealand plays an important part in shifting the stalemate in disarmament talks.

"It is important to us to get negotiations under way on a treaty banning the production of 'fissile' material used in nuclear weapons (the 'Cut-Off' Treaty).

"This is the next essential step towards nuclear disarmament.

"We also want the conference to agree on a framework for dealing with wider issues of nuclear disarmament. We hope China and Russia will support us in pushing for this broader programme at the conference.

"All three issues – the 'Cut-Off' treaty, nuclear disarmament generally and prevention of an arms race in space - are important at this point."

Disarmament talks have stalled recently. The United States has rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Russia has still not ratified the START II Treaty. Nuclear tests by Pakistan and India have also contributed to the stalemate.
