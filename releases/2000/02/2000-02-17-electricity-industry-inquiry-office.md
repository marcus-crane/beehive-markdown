PRESS STATEMENT

The Ministerial Inquiry into the Electricity Industry has released an Issues Paper today.

The paper briefly describes the current industry structure and regulatory framework, and expands upon issues which the Inquiry has been asked to make particular comment. It is available on the Inquiry website or by contacting the Inquiry office, as below.

The Government has established a Ministerial Inquiry to examine regulatory arrangements for the New Zealand electricity sector. The members of the Panel are Hon. David Caygill (chair), Dr Susan Wakefield and Mr Stephen Kelly. The Inquiry will evaluate whether the current regulatory regime meets the Government’s objective of ensuring electricity is delivered in an efficient, reliable and environmentally sustainable manner. Where existing arrangements are found not to achieve the Government’s objective, the Inquiry Panel has been asked to recommend changes.

1.1 The purpose of the paper

The Inquiry Panel prepared the paper to provide a starting point for submissions. The Panel is interested to know whether the issues raised present difficulties in achieving the Government’s objective and to identify any problems not covered in this paper. Submissions need not be limited to the specific issues raised in the paper, but may address any issue within the terms of reference. Where problems exist, the Panel seeks comment on the best means of addressing the problem. In evaluating possible solutions to problems, the terms of reference require the Panel to have regard to, amongst other things, industry specific regulation, general legislation (such as the Commerce Act), industry self-regulation, and the impact of new technology.

1.2 Timetable for submissions and hearings  
The Panel is to submit its final report to the Minister of Energy by 12 June 2000. To meet this deadline, the Panel has set the following timetable:

4pm, Monday, 13 March 2000 deadline for receipt of written submissions.  
Monday, 20 March 2000 hearings of oral submissions begin in Wellington.

Parties making written submissions should indicate whether they wish to appear before the Panel to speak to their submission.
