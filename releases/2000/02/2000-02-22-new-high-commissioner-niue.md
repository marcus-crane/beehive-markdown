New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Niue will be career diplomat John Bryan, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"The South Pacific is a high priority and has a special place in this Government's foreign policy. It is very pleasing to announce the appointment to Niue of someone with Mr Bryan's extensive experience and background, including two previous assignments in the Pacific," Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff said that Niue and New Zealand shared a close constitutional relationship, strengthened by the bonds of history and kinship.

Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974, and New Zealand has an ongoing responsibility to provide necessary economic and administrative assistance.

Like the Cook Islands and Tokelau, the people of Niue hold New Zealand citizenship. There are approximately 18,000 Niueans in New Zealand compared with 1700 living on Niue.

Mr Bryan has served previously in Apia, Suva, Singapore, Bonn, New York and most recently as Consul General to Brisbane. For the last three years he has been Director of Consular Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Mr Bryan takes up his posting in May, replacing Michael Pointer who is returning to Wellington.
