I ask our whanau, hapu, iwi to get together and discuss who can best represent their interests on the interim health boards says Associate Minister of Health Hon Tariana Turia.

"These nominations are for the placement of people on to the current Health and Hospital Services boards which are to become the interim district health boards. It will be these interim health boards that make the decisions on health service provision until the first election of the District Health Boards in October 2001.

"It is vital that our whanau in every region nominate capable people to represent their health needs at these boardroom tables to ensure the necessary services are provided. Nominees need to understand whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities and their development processes to ensure the health needs of those communities can be met locally and seamlessly throughout this transitional period.

"The reason the health boards are to be locally based, is so that our communities who know best what they need can ensure those services are available. This provides great opportunities for our communities to develop services specific to local demand.

"You have until 3 March to send in your nominations. I urge you all to talk to your whanau, hapu and iwi to decide who can best serve your interests on the interim health boards that will contribute to your overall development," Hon Tariana Turia said.
