Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said his visit to the Hutt Valley 101s showed what can be achieved when the community and police work together. The 101 scheme is the type of community involvement that makes a difference, George Hawkins said.

"The work that the 101s do is excellent. They provide an extra set of eyes and ears for the police.

"The 101 team provides foot and static patrols around the Hutt area and works in conjunction with the local police. This is another excellent way for the police to keep in touch with their communities. Many of the people in the scheme go on to full-time employment," George Hawkins said.

George Hawkins also visited the Hutt Valley Police Station, met with frontline police and discussed local policing needs with Wellington District Commander Supt. John Kelly.

"I was given briefings on burglary offending and how Wellington police are tackling criminals in this area. Of particular interest was intelligence driven policing, where police target specific offenders to put them before the courts. This visit was very worthwhile," George Hawkins said.

He said initiatives such as intelligence driven policing and the Hutt Valley 101s should be encouraged in other communities.

101 team members are referred to the police by Work and Income New Zealand. They are interviewed and vetted by police and if accepted, join in helping to create a safer community for all.

"I met 101 members who have been inspired by their work. Some have gone on to full-time employment and others will have a future with the police," George Hawkins says.

The 101 Patrol Group was set up in 1996 by the Hutt Valley Police. It has been taken up by Hamilton, Gisborne and Papakura and is being considered by Waitakere/North Shore and Christchurch.
