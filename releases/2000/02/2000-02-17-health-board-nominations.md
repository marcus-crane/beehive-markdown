Minister of Health Annette King today urged communities to nominate people they believe will be effective on their local health boards.  
Nominations for additional directors to the existing Hospital and Health Services boards are being taken now.  
Advertisements calling for nominations will appear in newspapers this Saturday and there will also be advertising on iwi radio stations.  
"The first elections for district health boards will not be held until October next year, but there is an opportunity now for communities to have their say through nominating people to existing boards of Hospital and Health Services.  
"These boards will become district health boards when legislation is passed later this year and they will operate until the elections next year, " Mrs King said.  
"Over the next two weeks anyone can nominate themselves or another person to be considered for appointment. The Ministry of Health and the Crown Company Monitoring Unit are coordinating the process and will take nominations up until March 3.  
(The selection criteria that will be used to select directors is attached.)  
"As the boards will operate under the Companies Act until new legislation creating district health boards is passed later this year, the additional directors will need to be able to fulfil the current role as well as aid the move to the district health boards.  
"A key aim of this Government is meeting the health needs of local communities, through increasing community involvement in decision-making.  
"I expect both new and existing board members to be very receptive to hearing and considering community views, and to be clear about what both the Government and the community expects of them.  
"The first opportunity for communities is now. More will come. I urge communities to make the most of them to ensure they are well served by their district health boards," Mrs King said.
