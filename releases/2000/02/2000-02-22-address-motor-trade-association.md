MTA President Jeff Dobson, members of the MTA Executive, ladies and gentlemen.

Kia Ora Koutou, Greetings and Talofa Lava.

It gives me great pleasure to join you at this “Back to Work” Cocktail Function.

Although many of us have only been “back at work” six weeks, the New Year break already seems an aeon ago.

For an incoming Minister, the task of coming to grips with the issues, and working out how to implement the policies on which the Government was elected, make this the busiest time of the electoral cycle.

I met with Jeff and Stephen last week to discuss various issues facing MTA members, including the frequency of WOF inspections.

From that meeting, and from my past involvement with the Transport Select Committee I am very aware that your organisation has an excellent reputation within the industry. And with over 4,700 members including garages, service stations, panel beaters, and tow truck operators the MTA clearly represents a wide range of industry activities.

Whatever happens on the issue of the frequency of WOF inspections there is no doubt that these inspections play a vital role in ensuring road safety – both in the private and commercial sectors.

Safety on the roads is a key issue for the Government. New Zealand’s safety record, though greatly improved, is still not good when compared with overseas experience. Five hundred deaths a year is far too many.

Another big issue is the country’s land transport system.

Over the years it has served us pretty well, but in recent years a number of issues have cropped up.

The most visible of these issues is the congestion in our major cities – Auckland’s congestion alone costs New Zealanders some $800 million per year. Yet, at the same time we have an alternative – passenger transport, which is underutilised.

Then there’s the State Highway and rural roading networks which are having difficulty keeping pace with the demands of a growing economy and society.  
During the 1990s traffic volumes, on average, by 4 percent per year. This has created demands for new roads, and upgrades on existing roads. The number of road projects “in the queue” for funding has grown to the extent that now projects can only be funded if they are expected to generate benefits which are at least four times as great as the expected cost. So some worthy projects have to wait for funding.

There are environmental issues to deal with too. In Auckland, Christchurch and even occasionally on Taranaki Street here in Wellington we have localised “hot-spots” where ambient air quality falls below World Health Organisation guidelines.

So what is the Government going to do about it?

There are some things that we can do quickly to ease some of the pressure points.

This Government has made some commitments on public transport which I’d like to move on for a start.

There needs to be a very thorough public debate on our road safety strategy for the next decade. I expect that this work will take up most of this year. But we may need some shorter term improvements in road safety to bring us closer to 2001.

I also want to keep up the pace on the environment by getting on with the implementation of measures to reduce vehicle emissions into the air.

The larger task is to work out the components of a land transport policy which will promote efficiency in our investment in land transport, improve environmental outcomes and road safety to a significant degree, safeguard community values and aspirations, and keep the door open for pragmatic innovation.

We have put forward a number of ideas in our manifesto which we wish to explore.

We will not proceed with Better Transport Better Roads.

However I don’t wish to embark on another four years debate; some good points have come out of the discussion of the last five years. I would like to widen the consensus and operate pragmatically, making gains where I can.

I am talking about these issues – and the issue of who pays and how – with road users and road providers, including of course local government.

From this, I hope to develop proposals that we can all discuss to find a way forward. I shall address bottlenecks as quickly as I can but consistency is important, and I shall need a little time to work through the issues.

I wish you all well and thank you for the invitation to be here tonight.
