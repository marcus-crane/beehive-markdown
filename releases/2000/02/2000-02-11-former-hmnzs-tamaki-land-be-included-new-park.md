The Minister of Conservation, Honourable Sandra Lee, today announced that Defence Land at Point Takapuna on Auckland’s North Shore would be protected as a reserve within the proposed Hauraki Gulf Marine Park.  
“This Government has listened to the forceful representations made by the local community urging the protection of this land, rather than allowing its sale for residential development. The new reserve will protect an outstanding suite of historic sites which record the long history of Maori with the site, and its importance as a cornerstone of Auckland coastal defence works," Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee said.  
The Government move on the land is contained in the Supplementary Order Paper on the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park Bill, which is expected to be enacted next week. The Bill, which has been under consideration for many years, was held up last year, over the issue of the former HMNZS Tamaki Land.  
Ms Lee said she was proud to deliver so soon on a commitment made so firmly in both Labour and Alliance election manifestos.  
“Our move to protect this land was heralded by Grant Gillon’s private Members Bill in 1997 which sought to establish that the land was a reserve, and to have it included in the Park.  
The coastal strip that contains the concentration of historic defence works will become an historic reserve. The Department of Conservation will begin developing this reserve in the next few weeks with a view to opening it to the Public in the autumn. The balance of the land will be recreation reserve when it is no longer needed for defence purposes.
