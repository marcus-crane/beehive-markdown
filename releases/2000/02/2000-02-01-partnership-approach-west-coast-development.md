The Government is hoping to have a regional development strategy for the West Coast ready to go by April.

Consultation with West Coast community leaders is underway on the best structure to ensure the Coast controls its own resources within the new Government's industry and regional development programme.

Officials from Treasury and the Ministry of Commerce are meeting West Coast mayors and the Chairman of the West Coast Regional Council this week to consult  
on a package of measures.

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Timberlands  
Minister Pete Hodgson and Local Government Minister Sandra Lee are taking  
responsibility for the West Coast's development.

'The end of logging in publicly-owned endangered native forests makes it particularly  
urgent for the Government to provide the resources and opportunities the Coast  
needs,' the Ministers said.

'The Government is taking a partnership approach to the West Coast's development.  
We are consulting closely with the Coast on the best package possible and the  
Coast itself will have a key role in putting a development programme in place.

'The Government is committed to ensuring that the West Coast has the resources  
and support needed to boost jobs and sustainable economic development.'

'A smooth and constructive process of consultation should see a partnership  
programme agreed to and ready to roll as early as April,' the Ministers said.
