The previous government's uncoordinated approach to social service funding has cost Waitakere City an important community resource for at risk teens, says Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré.

A $28,000 funding shortfall has forced the Waitakere Abuse and Trauma Counselling Service to close its school-based service for teenage victims of sexual abuse and family violence.

Ms Harré says although there's a proven need for the service in west Auckland it falls between the gaps in health, education and social welfare when it comes to funding.

"This service is disappearing as a result of the last government's failure to address cross-sector funding issues," she says.

"There are many more examples like this where good services have failed because of a lack of funding coordination."

Ms Harré visited the Waitakere Abuse and Trauma Counselling Service last week to discuss the problem with coordinator Robyn Bigelow.

Ms Bigelow says the teenage service to high schools started as a Crime Prevention Unit pilot several years ago.

Despite a positive evaluation and community demand the service struggled to stay afloat, and after being downsized it stopped at the end of last year, she says.
