Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today the appointment of Kevin Brady as the Deputy Controller and Auditor-General. Mr Brady replaces Wayne Cameron, who was appointed Auditor-General for the State of Victoria, Australia, last year.

Mr Brady has worked in the Audit Office in various roles since 1971. He is currently an Assistant Auditor-General working in the area of local government. In the 1980s he held regional directorships, with the Audit Office, in Wellington and Palmerston North. He was made an Assistant Auditor-General in 1988.

Mr Brady has been appointed as the Deputy Controller and Auditor-General by the Governor-General, His Excellency the Rt Hon Sir Michael Hardie Boys, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The position of the Deputy Controller and Auditor-General is a statutory appointment under the Public Finance Act 1977.

Mr Brady, who is 52 years old, is a chartered accountant and has a Masters in Public Policy from Victoria University of Wellington.

In the last nine years, Mr Brady has written several major reports, on behalf of the Auditor-General, on aspects of local government. His efforts in that area were recognised in 1996 when he was made a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He has also written reports in the environment and health portfolios.

Mr Brady acts as secretary of the South Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions. In that role, he is currently coordinating a major training programme for auditors from twelve South Pacific countries.
