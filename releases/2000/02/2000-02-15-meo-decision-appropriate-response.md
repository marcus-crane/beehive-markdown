Prime Minister Helen Clark said today the decision of Rosanne Meo to step down immediately as chairwoman of the TVNZ board was an appropriate response to yesterday's meeting between the TVNZ directors and the shareholding ministers, Michael Cullen and Marian Hobbs.

"The ministers made clear the Government's dismay at the lack of accountability in the Hawkesby affair. In light of that, Mrs Meo has made the decision to go immediately rather than wait until her contract expires next month.

"The Government is moving now to recruit new board members. There are in total four positions to fill.

"When new appointments are made a start can be made on establishing a charter for TVNZ which brings its public interest objectives into better balance with its commercial objectives," Helen Clark said.
