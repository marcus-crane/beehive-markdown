Information presented to Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins by a group who believe it could explain the Crewe murders, has been handed to police.

George Hawkins passed on the information on to acting Police Commissioner Rob Robinson last week.

Mr Hawkins initially had a private secretary, Gerry Cunneen, examine the information and prepare a brief.

“Mr Cunneen reviewed the information, but does not believe there was enough substance to the information to shed new light on the murders,” George Hawkins said.

“I came to the same conclusion that there was not enough hard evidence to bring a conclusion to the Crewe murder inquiry.

“However, the proper place for the matter is with the police. And I have asked the acting Police Commissioner to examine the information and to advise me of his conclusions,” George Hawkins said.
