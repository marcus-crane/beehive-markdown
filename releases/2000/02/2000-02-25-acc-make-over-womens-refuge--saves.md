Women's Refuges are to have a new industry risk classification unit following an ACC acknowledgment that none of the old classifications are appropriate for the work it does", said ACC Minister Dr Michael Cullen.

He said the decision is based on common sense - something the old ACC and the old legislation lacked from time to time. Under the old system Women's Refuges were classified at a rate more appropriate to fire fighters or professional rugby players.

"The re-classification will mean that Refuges save thousands of dollars on their ACC bills, freeing up money to spend on their important core business – providing care and counselling for abused women and children.

"I am confident ACC can offer Refuges a premium rate equal or better than the premium they are paying now to a private insurer. ACC is taking seriously the Government's instructions to pick up its game and offer a scheme that is cost effective, sensible and compassionate.

"Returning workplace accident to a singe state owned provider is not about going back to the ACC of the bad old days. This decision shows ACC is on the right track," said Dr Cullen.
