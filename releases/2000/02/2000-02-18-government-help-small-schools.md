The usual revision of agreed teacher staffing entitlements at primary schools with rolls of under 160 students will not be applied this year in cases where the school’s roll has fallen, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Trevor Mallard told principals at a conference in Wellington today that this represented a preliminary step in the Government’s intention to conduct a review of staffing arrangements for small schools, many of which were in rural areas.

"Small schools face some challenges that the general public is largely unaware of. It is a huge job to deliver the curriculum to a class which may have students from half a dozen year levels in it. Just because a school is 10% of the size of a bigger school does not mean that 90% of the administrative work disappears. In small secondary and area schools the challenges are even greater and it makes delivering the curriculum adequately almost impossible.

"It is for reasons like this that small rural schools will be a priority in the staffing review.

"And it is for this reason that I have decided that the usual 1 March roll revision at primary schools with rolls of under 160 students will not be applied this year in cases where the school’s roll has fallen.

"When it is likely that there will be relief for small schools following this review, it does not make sense for some schools to lose staff because of roll drop. It could, for example, mean that they have to go through the agony of losing a teacher, only to find that they are entitled to re-employ that teacher next year or the year after.

"However, this change will not affect schools with a roll of 160 students or more, or where surplus staffing provisions were notified before the end of last year," Trevor Mallard said.

Schools will be sent a circular this month outlining today’s announcement.
