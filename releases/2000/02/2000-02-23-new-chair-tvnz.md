The Chair of NZ Post, Dr Ross Armstrong, is to be the new chairperson of TVNZ, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

Dr Armstrong, aged 61, has been a director of NZ Post since 1991 and is also chair of the Crown Research Institute, Industrial Research Ltd.

Marian Hobbs says Dr Armstrong's appointment to TVNZ recognises his governance experience in state-owned companies, his familiarity with technically-oriented industries and his broader arts and cultural interests.

"Apart from having provided sound leadership of a large and complex state owned enterprise, Dr Armstrong is regarded as having particular skills in managing commercial matters alongside public policy transition issues and resolving situations where multiple interests exist," Marian Hobbs said. "Dr Armstrong is proud of his record in leading successfully the government's biggest business and the country's second biggest employer in a manner which balances its commercial and social responsibilities."

Marian Hobbs says she will now work with Dr Armstrong on choosing an appropriate mix of board members to fill other vacancies. Two members' positions expire at the end of March and a third position has been unfilled since August last year.

Dr Armstrong's term is for three years.
