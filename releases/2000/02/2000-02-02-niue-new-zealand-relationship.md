The Premier of Niue, Hon Sani Lakatani, accompanied by the Deputy Premier and officials, visited New Zealand from 31 January to 3 February at the invitation of the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Hon Phil Goff.

While in New Zealand, the Premier met with Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Ministers of Finance, Social Services and Employment, the Attorney-General and Pacific Island Affairs and held detailed consultations with Mr Goff.

The Premier and Mr Goff jointly decided that in the context of the 100th anniversary next year of the establishment of links between Niue and New Zealand, it is timely to undertake a comprehensive review of the partnership and its operating process.

Since Niue attained self government in free association with New Zealand in 1974, many changes have occurred in both countries. Of concern to both governments has been the continuing decline in Niue.
