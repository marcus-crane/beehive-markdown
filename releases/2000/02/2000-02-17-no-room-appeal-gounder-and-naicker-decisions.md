The Minister of Immigration, Hon Lianne Dalziel, said today there were no grounds for appealing Deportation Review Tribunal decisions allowing Rudra Nana Naicker and Janardan Gounder to remain in New Zealand.

Ms Dalziel has received a Crown Law Office opinion on the decision. She said that it matched the legal advice she had already received from her own legal section in the Department of Labour, under which the Immigration Service operates.

"I have read the opinion from the Crown Law Office and agree with them that there are no grounds for appeal," she said.

A Minister's right of appeal from a decision of the Deportation Review Tribunal is restricted by s117(1) of the Immigration Act 1987 to errors of law.
