Greater participation by whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori in the contracting process is necessary to improve the services of Child Youth and Family Services says Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, Social Services and Employment Hon Tariana Turia.

In response to Te Puni Kokiri's review released this morning on the contracting processes of the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services (CYFS), Hon Tariana Turia says it provides a useful guide to CYFS to begin the improvement of its current processes.

"I have met with TPK and CYFS to discuss the report and I am pleased CFYS has already began work on implementing the recommendations.

"It is important for whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori to be supported to find their own solutions. This demands their participation at all levels of the decision-making process from contracting to service delivery. Government must create the opportunity for Maori people who are skilled to fully participate in this development.

"The capacity of the sector must also be assessed to identify what skills exist and what development must occur to better equip the sector to provide services to whanau, hapu iwi and Maori in a safe and supportive environment.

" At present there is little consistency on the awareness and application of the Treaty of Waitangi to the sector. This along with the fragmentation across the sector has impacted on it's ability to provide services in a safe and consistent manner.

"The provision of services that are holistic and integrated has been successful for indigenous people in other countries. In Aotearoa, New Zealand similar success occurs when whanau, hapu and iwi form relationships with government which are respectful and trusting. It is this type of relationship which will help eliminate the 'gaps'," Hon Tariana Turia said.
