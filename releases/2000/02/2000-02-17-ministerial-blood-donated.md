The Health Minister today pledged to lead by example and give blood more regularly.

Annette King's commitment was a response to the New Zealand Blood Service's call for more donors. The service has launched a campaign to recruit 12,000 new donors over the next 12 months.

"I've given blood on a number of occasions throughout my life. But I am going to start giving blood more regularly," Mrs King said.

"It feels rewarding to give blood. The donation only takes 45 minutes and can save the lives of up to three people.

"I encourage all New Zealanders to donate blood if they are able. After all, up to 80 per cent of us will need blood during our lifetimes. And, as they say, blood truly is the gift of life," Mrs King said.
