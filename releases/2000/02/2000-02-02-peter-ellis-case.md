The Justice Minister Phil Goff commented today on the Peter Ellis case.

"The Governor General sought my formal advice last year on an application for a pardon and a Royal Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Mr Ellis.

"It is not appropriate at this point for a member of the Executive to consider advising the Governor General to grant a pardon when the Court of Appeal has twice concluded there has been no miscarriage of justice.

"The Court of Appeal did, however, in its last judgement note there were issues that might be more appropriately considered by a Commission of Inquiry.

"I have read the Thorp Report and Court of Appeal decision on the Ellis case.

"Some elements of the case are of concern to me.

"I have asked the Ministry of Justice to consider the application and the comments of the Court of Appeal and to provide advice on what kind of inquiry is appropriate.

"I am awaiting that advice," Mr Goff concluded.
