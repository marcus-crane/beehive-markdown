Racing Minister Annette King today announced she has called a Community Racing Forum at Parliament Buildings on June 1.

Mrs King said the forum would allow clubs that race at category D venues and related groups the opportunity to express their concerns.

"More importantly, however, it will allow them the opportunity to discuss a strategic direction for community racing.

"Some of the problems this sector faces are unique to community racing. What I would like to hear are new ideas to develop opportunities and to solve old problems.

"If a way can be found for community racing clubs to thrive, then the racing industry overall will benefit. I believe solutions and innovations will be more effective if they come from the community clubs themselves," she said.

Mrs King said New Zealand had just witnessed the most successful round of thoroughbred yearling sales, "from the top $3.6 million colt to the record average for the last day's sale.

"Courage Under Fire broke the Australasian record for successive wins and captured the hearts and imagination of New Zealanders," she said.

"A healthy community racing fraternity will help build on such outstanding achievements, and the opportunities that come from them. A united and strong industry has enormous potential for New Zealand.

"My hope is the community racing forum will be an important step in enhancing that potential."
