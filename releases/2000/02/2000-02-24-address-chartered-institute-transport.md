Ladies and gentlemen

This is the first major speech I have given as the Associate Minister of Transport.

I bring the greetings of Hon Mark Gosche, the Minister of Transport, alongside whom I am working both as his associate minister and in my Auckland role.

Given the important responsibilities that I have been given to ensure that Auckland, as our largest city, develops in a way that benefits the whole of New Zealand, it seems to me entirely appropriate that this first speech is to the Auckland branch of the Chartered Institute of Transport.

If there is any single group of people who understand the problems that Auckland is facing, then it is the people in this room.

Government policy

This government has only been in office for less than three months, and we are still in the process of developing the detail of our transport policies.

There is much to do and we are rapidly establishing our priorities in terms of the Labour on Transport policy document on which we campaigned, as well as the policies of our coalition partner.

My goal today is not to deal with the detailed implementation of these policies. That is something on which we will consult widely with a broad range of community groups.

Today I want to take an overview of the problems we face and the principles that we are going to apply to tackle those problems.

Nationwide approach

As you would expect, my focus in this speech will tend to be on Auckland. Not only is Auckland our home, but it is our largest transport problem area.

I intend to deal mainly with Auckland’s land transport problems, because those are the ones that face every Aucklander every day. This does not in any way down play the importance of other transport issues – it simply recognises the reality of daily life for Aucklanders.

However, I want to make it clear that this does not mean that this government is only interested in Auckland.

The transport problems of rural and provincial New Zealand are perhaps less dramatic, but they are nonetheless very real. Anyone here who uses the roads of Northland or the Coromandel, for example, is unlikely to accept that we have a transport system that is working as effectively as it could.

The transport problem

I doubt that I have to convince anyone in this room that Auckland has serious land transport problems.

One study suggests that road traffic congestion is costing Aucklanders up to $850 million a year.

While some of this congestion can only be measured in time and personal frustration, for the freight industry it is measured in financial costs – and that financial cost is added to the costs of the goods they carry, so that we all pay. The Manufacturers’ Federation estimates…. (detail)

Our road infrastructure daily demonstrates that it is inadequate for the task that it is asked to do.

The public transport system, which is necessary for its users and for motorists as well as being a lifeline for the many Aucklanders who do not have cars, urgently needs upgrading and development.

We face increasing pressure on our air and water resources – not to mention our open spaces.

At the same time, transport noise is a serious problem in many residential and commercial areas.

We still have a significant road safety problem.

Motorists and their passengers as well as pedestrians and cyclists face daily threats to their lives in many parts of the city.

Urban problems

While the problems of the transport system are now generally well known, they are only part of the bigger set of problems we face in Auckland.

The rapid growth of the Auckland region is not just creating a series of transport problems, real though these are.

It is also creating a range of other problems, not the least of which are growing pressures on the environment and increasing concerns about communities being disrupted and divided.

And if Aucklanders have taken one message from the Regional Growth Strategy it is that in the lifetime of many of us alive today this city will have doubled in population. With more than two million people space will be at a premium. The old solution of roads that gobbled up our open spaces won’t wash any more.

There are also real questions of access. It is great to live in the city of sails if you have access to the wide range of social, educational and cultural opportunities that are available.

If you can’t access those opportunities because you have no transport or you are struggling to find affordable housing, then life isn’t so great.

Finding the answers

Transport is one of the key influence shaping our city.

The Auckland Regional Growth Strategy made it clear that many of our problems are the result of past decisions that have turned out to be too narrowly focussed.

Turning these problems around will require a comprehensive effort.

We cannot solve the “road safety problem” or the “passenger transport problem” or the “pedestrian problem” in isolation from each other.

We need a concerted strategy to tackle all these issues. We are working on the way we develop such an approach so that we involve everyone who has an interest in the outcomes. Developing a comprehensive approach will be a complex task and involve many groups and individuals.

At the same time we need to see what we can do in the short term to ease some of the pressure points. Without going into detail some of these things might involve changes to the way passenger transport is funded, improvements in safety management and some initiatives in the environmental area.

What I want to do today is to give you my views on some of the key areas that a transport strategy must address.

While many of you see the problems of transport from a manager’s viewpoint, I want to talk about some of these issues from the viewpoint of Aucklanders trying to use the transport system.

Public transport

Aucklanders want a better public transport system. About 46% of those polled in a new city council survey gave the thumbs up to improving existing roads and investing in public transport. Another 23% wanted investment in public transport alone. Interestingly only 10% said the answer to Auckland’s congestion is more roads and motorways.

The “build more roads” policy that Auckland has followed for the last 50 years has been at the cost of the public transport system.

We have continued to build roads while valuable passenger transport corridors, such as railways, are substantially underused.

Running down the public transport system has drastically reduced the range and quality of travel opportunities for those all Aucklanders, not just those who do not have cars.

All too often, public transport today in Auckland means standing in the rain to wait for a bus or standing on a graffiti covered railway platform.

In this environment, we should not be surprised that public transport users in Auckland are predominantly those who have little other choice.

Few car users are going to switch their travel to public transport until the alternative is as good or better.

We must raise the quality of public transport service and its marketing.

Taxis and shuttles

Ferries, buses and trains are not the only public transport systems.

For many Aucklanders the only available public transport is a taxi or a shuttle.

I believe that we have tended to overlook the importance of these services that provide door to door transport services that meet individual or family or business travel needs.

Taxis and shuttles provide a crucial level of service to many in our community who do not have access to cars, in a way that buses, trains and ferries will never be able to do.

I for one want to look very closely at the role that taxis and shuttle services could play in our transport future.

Pedestrians and cyclists

Many of the tourists who come to New Zealand come for adrenaline producing sports such as bungee jumping.

Walking and cycling on many roads in Auckland are now quite capable of being marketed in their own right, as adrenaline sports.

If you think that is an exaggeration, then do as I have done.

Talk to senior citizens who daily have to cross busy roads to get to the shops of the doctor.

Talk to parents who drive their children to and from school because they think our roads are not safe enough for them to walk or cycle.

Talk to cyclists for whom using our roads is an increasingly dangerous experience.

The medical profession and the Hilary Commission tell us of the health benefits of walking or cycling – yet too often we provide a transport environment that is hostile to anything other than motor vehicles.

We must manage our road corridors so that pedestrians and cyclists are safe.

Infrastructure management and development

We have to do better in managing our roading system.

We cannot afford to go on providing endless roads which become congested soon after they are built.

Los Angeles spent the twentieth century proving the truth that road traffic expands beyond capacity.

I do not want to see Auckland spend the twenty-first century proving the same thing.

We will certainly need some new roads as our economy grows and changes – freight access to industry, the port and airport is clearly a priority.

But we simply cannot afford to go on building more and more roads to create more and more congestion, pollution and noise.

The Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy advocates a more balanced approach to transport development in the future, with the emphasis being placed on a broader range of approaches, including better passenger transport and potential congestion pricing, as well as some new roads.

The government agrees.

We are beginning the complex task of looking at the way our roads are managed, and how we pay for those roads.

We will not proceed with Better Transport Better Roads. However we don’t wish to embark on another four years of debate; many useful points have come out of the discussion of the last five years.

What we would like to do is widen the consensus and operate pragmatically, making gains where we can.

This will not be another ideological exercise – it will be a pragmatic approach to solving very real problems, in association with the communities that face those problems and their councils.

Environment

Auckland prides itself on the beauty of its harbours and its attractive environment. Any one of the millions of people overseas who are watching the Americas Cup on tv will agree that we have much to be proud of in our environment.

Yet that environment is threatened by the impacts of our transport system. Air pollution is a significant problem on the main road corridors; water run-off into our rivers and harbours is a growing source of pollution and transport noise is a daily reality for far too many Aucklanders.

We have to demand of our transport system the same standards of environmental performance that we are increasingly seeking of every other economic activity.

Research work into emissions over the last few years has given us a clear idea of the scale of air problems in Auckland that are caused by transport, and we are now in a position to start tackling these issues later this year.

Compared to other countries, we are late in addressing these issues – but we are determined to make rapid progress by setting environmental standards for road vehicles when they are registered; by using the Resource Management Act to tackle overall emissions and by tightening up the laws on smoky vehicles.

Safety

Road safety is an important issue for this government.

Labour on Transport identifies a whole range of road safety initiatives that we intend to consider.

Later this year, we will be looking at the road safety strategy for the next decade to 2010.

Our road safety record, while it has improved very substantially in the last decade, is still well below the best results achieved by similar countries.

We have to make our roads safer, not just for pedestrians and cyclists, as I mentioned earlier, but to ensure that all road users do not face unreasonable risks.

Bringing it all together

Tackling all these problems is a tall order, but I believe that we cannot let things go on as they are.

The government wants to work with local communities and transport users to chart our path out of the present dead end.

There are no quick fixes.

What we must do as a starting point is look at using what we have more effectively. We must focus first on people. What do Aucklanders want and need? The Auckland City Council survey suggests that they don’t want the moon.

They just want a transport system that works for them. That’s not an unreasonable desire. People also tell me that they want a city and a country that offers their children and grandchildren the same opportunities and pleasures that they have enjoyed. .

But I am not suggesting that the existing capacity will deliver all we need. Some key parts of our land transport system – especially roads and passenger transport – have their present problems because of long periods of underinvestment.

Sometimes in the past when we did invest, we did not consider the wider impacts of what we were doing.

We are now paying the price of these past approaches – and we haven’t finished paying.

My colleague Mark Gosche, the Minister of Transport, has already made it clear that this government is going to have to take some tough decisions about transport investment. We need to do some careful planning and develop processes to put our ideas in place.

This will mean spending more money, and that will mean that someone has to pay for that investment.

But we are not going to unleash a transport lolly scramble.

We want to ensure value for the money that we do have to spend, and we want users to recognise that even though they may be paying more directly, they are getting a better quality transport system. There may even be savings in terms of the myriad of indirect and some very direct costs we are paying now.

Simply adding costs to the existing system for no extra benefits is not an option.

Conclusion

As I said at the beginning, Auckland does not have the monopoly on transport problems – but it certainly has the biggest and most obvious ones.

In the next three years, this government is going set a co-ordinated strategic course that will enable us to begin the highly complex task of tackling those problems.

We have to deal with transport problems in the wider context of social, environmental and economic problems.

We cannot do it alone, and we want to involve a wide range of people and community groups in developing those solutions.

Aucklanders expect nothing less.
