New Zealand is donating NZ$150,000 to provide relief supplies to Mozambique following the serious flooding which struck Southern Africa this month, Associate Foreign Minister Matt Robson announced today.

Matt Robson said the flooding was the worst to hit Southern Africa in nearly 50 years and Mozambique had been badly affected.

“Mozambique has been the worst hit country, with 100 000 people left homeless in the Maputo area and considerable damage to infrastructure in the southern provinces,” Matt Robson said.

The United Nations has mobilised a team to assist with damage assessment and to coordinate international relief in Mozambique.

Matt Robson said New Zealand’s donation, from the disaster relief fund of the Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme, would be made to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
