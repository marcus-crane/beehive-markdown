The Minister for Rural Affairs, Jim Sutton, is urging rural communities to nominate people for their local Hospital and Health Service Boards.

The Minister of Health, Annette King, announced today that nominations for additional directors are being taken now.

Mr Sutton said the present boards would be dissolved when the Public Health Services Bill was passed later this year. In the meantime they would continue to operate, but would also be expected to gear up for the transition to District Health  
Boards under the new legislation, hence the need for additional directors.

“This is an opportunity for local communities to gain a bigger voice in the running of their hospital services,” Mr Sutton said.

Elections for the full panel of directors for the new District Health Boards would be held along with the local body elections in October of next year.

The Coalition Government wanted communities to have a bigger voice in the management of their local hospital and health services, he said, “and this is an opportunity for rural communities in particular to make their voices heard.”
