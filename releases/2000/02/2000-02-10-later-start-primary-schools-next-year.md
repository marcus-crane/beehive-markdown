The primary school year for 2001 will start later and end closer to Christmas, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The primary school year for 2001 will begin on Tuesday 30 January and end on Tuesday 18 December. Secondary schools will open on Thursday 1 February and end their year on Tuesday 11 December.

In 2000, the primary school year began on 26 January and will finish on 13 December.

“The later start I have approved for next year will extend the school holidays during the summer when it is meant to be hotter! It is also clear that ending the school year closer to Christmas will reduce the amount of childcare that some families will need to arrange.”

Trevor Mallard said the pattern of four even-length terms had met with wide support, so that would continue in 2001. Primary and secondary schools would share the same dates for terms 2 and 3 in 2001. That pattern had also been supported by most parents.

While all state schools would follow the approved term dates, boards of trustees were permitted to close their school for up to five days in any year for teacher-only days, the local anniversary day, teacher training days or for show or gala days. Any school which did that still had to complete the required number of half-days in the school year.

In 2001, all schools will close for Waitangi Day on Tuesday 6 February. Easter will fall in the first set of school holidays as has been the case in recent years.
