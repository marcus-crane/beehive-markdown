The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, has welcomed the offer of a voluntary moratorium on genetically modified organisms by the New Zealand Life Sciences Network.

The offer would cover applications for the commercial release of GMOs while the proposed Royal Commission of Inquiry into Genetic Engineering completes its inquiry. The moratorium would not extend to applications to the Environmental Risk Management Authority for field trials.

"I do appreciate the spirit in which the Network has made its offer," Ms Hobbs said. "The Government is currently considering a range of options for managing a moratorium while the Royal Commission conducts its inquiry and this offer will be taken into account in our deliberations."
