The Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey, has today launched a discussion document on the Government's planned Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) at a specially called together meeting of sector representatives in Wellington

The TEAC is being established to advise the Government on the long-term strategic direction of the tertiary education and will be asked to provide advice on a number of key issues. The discussion document launched today calls for public comment on the Commission's proposed terms of reference, structure and composition and related matters. Comment is sought by 6 March 2000 after which time the Minister will recommend the membership and final form to Cabinet.

"The Tertiary Education Advisory Commission has the key role of building a more co-operative and collaborative tertiary sector. This Government does not believe the tertiary education marketplace built up under National is capable of producing the educational or research outcomes New Zealand needs going in to the 21st Century.

"The Commission will be asked to advise me on the strategic direction our tertiary sector should be moving in and how the various players can make this happen. We are also vitally interested in how tertiary education can serve to advance the position of Maori and the contribution it can make to New Zealand's social, economic and regional needs.

"The Government wants to work with the tertiary sector to develop post-school education so that it contributes to our goal of building lifelong learning in a knowledge society," Steve Maharey said.
