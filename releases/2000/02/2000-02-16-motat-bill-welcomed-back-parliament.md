Judith Tizard, MP for Auckland Central welcomed the return of the MOTAT (Museum of Transport and Technology) Bill to Parliament today. The Internal Affairs & Local Government select committee has considered the submissions on the Private Bill put up by the MOTAT Trust Board to require regional funding of this important Auckland museum.

Judith Tizard said that the Bill was returned to Parliament by the Internal Affairs & Local Government select committee just before the election last year and this is our first opportunity to look at it again.

“I am having discussions with the MOTAT Board and with Auckland local authorities to see if we can improve this Bill, but in the meantime the select committee has indicated to Parliament and to Auckland that MOTAT is too important to allow it to fall over because no one will take responsibility for funding it except the Auckland City Council.”

“MOTAT has enormous public support and attracts visitors from all over Auckland, New Zealand and also has wide international support with many international visitors. The proportion of visitors to MOTAT from each of Aucklands’ local authority areas reflects very closely the proportion of people living in those areas, she said. There is no free ride for major cultural and heritage institutions and it is time we faced up to the need to preserve our past so that we don’t make the mistakes of the past again in the future. Without the knowledge of where we come from New Zealanders are much poorer” she said.
