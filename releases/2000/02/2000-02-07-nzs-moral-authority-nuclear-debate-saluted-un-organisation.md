The Director General of the IAEA, an intergovermental organisation within the United Nations paid a visit to Minister of Disarmament, Matt Robson today and spoke highly of New Zealand’s ‘moral authority’ in the nuclear disarmament debate internationally.

Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei is the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency which is at the forefront of international efforts to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is the first official visit of a Director General of the IAEA to New Zealand.

“It was very useful to hear directly from the horse’s mouth exactly what is going on overseas in the attempt to progress disarmament,” said Matt Robson.

“There is no doubt that the disarmament debate has stalled and deteriorated over the last few years. The briefing papers to the government from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed as much.

“Even the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan warned this week that a new nuclear arms race ‘looms on the horizon.’

“But my meeting today with the Director General was very positive. Like us, he sees a key role for New Zealand in kick-starting the talks again.

“We may be a small country, but we have earned the right to be heard on the international stage on the subject of disarmament. Our moral authority on this issue is undisputed.

“The new government has made it very clear from day one that nuclear disarmament will be a priority.

“We agree with the Director General that the best way forward for New Zealand is to make our presence felt at every possible point in the debate.

“It’s better to be in the tent talking to those countries who are stalling, rather than outside the tent and having no influence at all.I hope to attend the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva next month where we will have a chance to let the world know that New Zealand is still here, and we’re still serious about disarmament,” said Matt Robson.
