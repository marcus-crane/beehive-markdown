Health Minister Annette King today thanked the Coalition for Public Health for its contribution over the years.

"The coalition was a strong lobby group that consistently highlighted and fought the previous Government's agenda to increasingly privatise health," Mrs King said.

"I would like to thank the members for their efforts over the years as they worked to protect the public health system. The coalition was an effective watchdog of public health on behalf of the community.

"This Government is putting the community back into healthcare through the creation of district health boards.

"The boards will have a majority of publicly elected members. The public will have more opportunity to participate in decisions about health care for their community. It also means decision makers will be more accountable to the people they serve.

"Boards will be also required to take account of the individual needs of their communities when making decisions about health services," Mrs King said.

Mrs King said the coalition had made an important contribution to Labour's health policy over the years.
