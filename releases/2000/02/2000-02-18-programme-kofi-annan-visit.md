Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the programme for United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who will visit New Zealand from 22-24 February.

Helen Clark said Mr Annan's visit offered an excellent opportunity to promote a greater understanding of the United Nation's work, and to highlight New Zealand’s long standing support for the organisation.

On Wednesday 23 February, Mr Annan will meet the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff, and the Governor General, Sir Michael Hardie Boys.

A state luncheon in honour of the Secretary General will be held on Wednesday at which he will speak. There will also be a dinner at Premier House.

On Thursday 24 February, the Secretary-General will meet with the Leader of the Opposition, Defence Minister Mark Burton, and Chiefs of Staff.

The programme on Thursday also includes a Maori welcome and visit to Waiwhetu Marae in Lower Hutt, and a ministerial working lunch hosted by Mr Goff. The lunch will give ministers whose portfolios touch on elements of the UN’s work the opportunity to work through a broad range of issues with the Secretary-General.

Mr Annan’s visit is part of a wider tour of the Asia/Pacific region, which also takes in Thailand, Indonesia, East Timor and Australia. Mr Annan will be accorded “Guest of Government” status for his two-day visit.

He will be accompanied by his wife and a delegation of 12.
