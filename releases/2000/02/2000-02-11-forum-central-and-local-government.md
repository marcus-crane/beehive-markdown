Prime Minister Helen Clark, Minister of Local Government Sandra Lee, and Local Government New Zealand president Louise Rosson today announced the first central-local government forum, as pledged in the Prime Minister's 'First 100 Days' speech, will be held on 7 March at Parliament.  
During The Forum - Central and Local Government Working Together - the Prime Minister, the Minister of Local Government and other key ministers will meet with council leaders from Local Government New Zealand. It will address high level strategic issues that affect all New Zealanders and identify ways for central and local government to work together more effectively.  
Sandra Lee said she welcomed the new opportunities for close co-operation to meet the development needs of New Zealand communities.  
The initial meeting will scope the longer-term objectives of The Forum and provide the groundwork for further meetings. The three leaders have welcomed moves to progress the commitment to work more closely together.
