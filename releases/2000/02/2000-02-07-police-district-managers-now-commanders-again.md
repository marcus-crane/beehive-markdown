Minister of Police, Hon. George Hawkins this afternoon announced that police managers will once again be referred to as commanders.

Mr Hawkins had discussed with acting Police Commissioner, Rob Robinson, that the change be made.

From today Police District Manager titles will be replaced with District Commander titles.

“This change abandons past trends of a few who sought a mirror-glass corporate image. We have seen this obsession too often in the public sector, particularly with services like WINZ and TVNZ,” George Hawkins said.

“That direction, with old National Party elitist ideals, is not acceptable when your purpose is solving crimes and preventing crimes from occurring.

“I am determined to focus policing in New Zealand on creating safer communities and catching criminals. This reverting back to District Commanders is symbolic and signals to police of all ranks that this Government is determined to assist them to deal with crime.

“Feedback from police on this change is also positive and encouraging. They are saying to me ‘excellent, now we can get on with the job’.

“I have yet to come across a police officer who has joined the police to be a manager. They join the police to work with communities, to make this country a safer place to live and to catch criminals,” George Hawkins said.
