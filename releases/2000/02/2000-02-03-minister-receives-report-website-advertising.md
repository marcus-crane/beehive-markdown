The Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton has received a preliminary report on the banner advertising found on the New Zealand Government Online Website.  
The New Zealand Government Online Website provides a portal for access to information about government agencies on the Internet. It is now receiving 1.4 million "hits" per month.  
NZGO is funded by voluntary contributions from Government Agencies, but these contributions do not meet the full cost of operating the site.  
The Website is overseen by the NZGO Board, which is chaired by Len Cook from Statistics NZ and includes public sector Chief Executives, and the Chief Executives of Local Government NZ and the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce.  
"While the advertising only appeared recently, the decision to seek advertising revenue was an operational decision taken by the Board during the final days of the previous Government," Mr Burton said.  
"That decision was seen by the Board as being consistent with National Government policy.  
"While it remains an operational manner, I have passed on my view that it would be desirable for the Board to revisit the decision made last year to allow advertising on the site. Clearly the longterm funding arrangements for this site need full and careful consideration.  
"It is rather ironic that Maurice Williamson is expressing outrage," Mr Burton said. "When he was a Minister he was a strong proponent of full cost recovery, and the Board believed it was acting in line with his Government's policy."
