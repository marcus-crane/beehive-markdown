State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today that the unacceptable high cost of consultants under the former National Government highlights the need to crack down on their use.

He says written questions compiled from Ministers will be useful in the Government’s objective to limit the use of consultants.

“The spending is generally for work authorised while National was the Government and highlights the culture that has grown up under that administration. It totals $4,939,876. Overall it is too high, although as Minister of State Services I will refrain from commenting on individual examples.

“The new Government has stated clearly that we believe there is an overuse of consultants in the public sector and we want that spending decreased.

“In particular, the use of consultants for core responsibilities is unacceptable and Ministers have made our feelings on that clear to officials.

“In certain circumstances, the use of consultants can be a sensible and viable option, especially for highly specialised projects or in times of extreme overload.

“However, it is important that we restore the depth and expertise in the public sector so as to limit the times when they need to go elsewhere to get a job completed competently and efficiently,” Trevor Mallard said.
