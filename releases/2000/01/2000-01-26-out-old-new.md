Corrections Minister Hon. Matt Robson will begin a tour of the North Island this week to close an old prison, visit an up-graded prison, visit a proposed prison site in the North, and finally facilitate the graduation of a new team of ‘crime-busting’ professionals whose mission is to reverse the rate of re-offending.

"This week is about sweeping out that which is old and failed, and bringing in some fresh ideas.

"There is a lot of determination and commitment out there to tackle crime, both in the community and in the prison system. I want to hear from prison and probation staff, and from locals in the communities affected by decisions to build new correctional facilities.

"I am particularly excited to present the graduation certificates to the first professional team of facilitators to specifically target re-offending with a new approach. This is an important first for Corrections.”
