The Minister of Social Services and Employment, Steve Maharey, announced today that Cabinet had resolved to disestablish the Super 2000 Taskforce, with effect from 29 February 2000. Abolition of the Taskforce fulfils a pre-election promise made by both Labour and the Alliance.

“This Government does not see a role for the Super 2000 Taskforce. It was set up by the National Government to cut the cost of New Zealand Superannuation. The new Government stands opposed to any cuts to super entitlement. We believe in a universal pension sufficient to support a decent standard of living.

“That is why we announced yesterday we are increasing superannuitants pay packets from April 1 and that we are reversing National’s cuts to the base level of the pension.

“The disestablishment of the Taskforce will save the taxpayer a little over $2 million. But the useful projects it started will not be lost.

“Two research studies - one on the living standards of older New Zealanders, the other on the impact of labour market trends on retirement income - will be transferred for completion to the Ministry of Social Policy.

“The schools competition, designed to interest secondary school pupils in retirement issues, will be continued by the Office of the Retirement Commissioner.

"I would like to thank the Taskforce for their work and in particular acknowledge the chairperson, Angela Foulkes, and the deputy chairperson, Murray Horn”, Steve Maharey said.
