Senior Citizens Minister Lianne Dalziel today welcomed the changes to the rates of New Zealand Superannuation.

"This Government believes that older New Zealanders have the right to live with dignity and security. Increasing the rates for New Zealand Superannuation is the first step that this Government will be taking to achieve that.

"Also on the agenda this year are changes in the areas of housing, health, and home security, so that all retired New Zealanders may continue to enjoy a reasonable level of participation in and belonging to the community.

"I was horrified by suggestions from researchers that National’s policy of lowering the floor of NZ Superannuation could result in between one-third and half of all superannuitants falling below the poverty line.

"Older New Zealanders were victimised by Jenny Shipley and her Government in an appalling manner. We have fulfilled our promise to reverse their cuts to New Zealand Superannuation.

‘As the chief advocate for older New Zealanders within the Cabinet, I welcome this move and look forward to further positive changes,” Lianne Dalziel said.
