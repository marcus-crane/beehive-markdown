The Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hon Mark Gosche is issuing a fresh warning to Pacific communities that signing up to a "Maori citizenship" scheme does not offer any protection from deportation.

Late last year there were concerns that some Pacific overstayers believed they had protection from immigration authorities through a “Maori citizenship” scheme being promoted by the Confederation of Chiefs of the United Tribes of Aotearoa.

However, last week the Confederation and the Manukau Legal Services, which claims to offer para-legal advice on immigration issues for the Confederation, was reported to be receiving more than 30 phone calls daily from people interested in the scheme.

"If this is true, then it is most alarming because there are obviously people who still believe that so-called ‘Maori citizenship’ offers them protection from immigration authorities. This scheme offers absolutely no protection from the law or deportation," he warned.

Mr Gosche said that if people were worried about their immigration status, they should talk to the Immigration Service or seek advice from a qualified lawyer certified to practice law.

"I am also concerned that if people are paying for legal advice, they should check that the people representing them are qualified and authorised to do so," he said. The Minister of Immigration has referred the Manukau Legal Services to the Auckland District Law Society for further investigation.

"The promoters of this 'Maori citizenship' scheme appear to be preying on the desperate and gullible so I am urging Pacific community leaders to warn their communities that this scheme offers no protection from the law or deportation," he said.
