Judith Tizard, Auckland Central MP and Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Auckland Issues, said today that she had reconsidered her decision to launch their "Water Conservation Advisory Service". This was planned to happen at the Auckland Zoo at 2.30pm this afternoon.

"I have informed Metrowater that I am not prepared to support a public owned company that is treating its customers in such a heavy handed way" said Judith Tizard.

Metrowater yesterday entered the properties of sixteen members of the Water Pressure Protest Group who have been boycotting wastewater fees since early last year to cut off their water supply.

"I am very disappointed at Metrowaters’ actions yesterday and I am surprised that they have chosen to confront the small group of protesters in this way. I believe there is a more constructive way in dealing with customers over an essential service like water supply." Judith Tizard said.

Judith Tizard said she will be taking up the issue with the Mayor Christine Fletcher and with Councillor Vern Walsh, the Chair of Auckland City’s Investments Committee. She will also discuss with Local Government Minister, Sandra Lee the possibility of a review of the legal provisions around LATEs (Local Authority Trading Enterprises) to ensure that they have a responsibility which is wider than just their commercial interests.
