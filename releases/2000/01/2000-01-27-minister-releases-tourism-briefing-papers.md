The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton says the need to encourage, monitor and manage the growth of tourism in New Zealand is clearly laid out in briefing papers released today.  
Tourism New Zealand and the Office of Tourism and Sport both provided briefings to the incoming Minister of Tourism.  
"There are strong underlying themes in the briefings," Mr Burton said.  
"The core proposals set comfortably alongside the new Government's priorities, as spelt out in my speech to a Tourism Industry Forum in Taupo (Jan 18), and the issues raised with me by industry representatives.  
"There is clear support across the tourism industry for developing a National Tourism Strategy. The sector is a widely based and disparate grouping of interests that are reliant on each other for their successes. It is essential that the sector has a vision to guide and shape its development.  
"That vision needs to be industry-driven. I am supportive of the work already done by the Tourism Industry Association and we can build on what has been started.  
"Another important priority is in the area of research. A lack of credible research, information and forecasting is a hindrance to the development of the tourism sector. I am currently discussing proposals with my officials, which involve streamlining existing programmes and implementing new research.  
"There are some projects funded currently out of the Public Good Science Fund. But it is my strong view that as New Zealand's largest foreign exchange earner, the tourism sector warrants a level of resourcing more in keeping with its contribution to the New Zealand economy.  
"The Government's largest investment in the tourism sector is in Tourism New Zealand to market New Zealand internationally. I am keen to ensure we employ this investment to achieve optimum value for the taxpayer's money. But there will not be change for change's sake. My approach to the Tourism portfolio will be more co-operative and consultative than the previous administration. I will be clear in my expectations, which in turn will allow Tourism New Zealand get on with its job.  
"Tourism can make a significant contribution across the full range of this Government's policy objectives. This includes fostering regional development, celebrating the uniqueness of our culture, and preserving our natural environment. Tourism as an industry needs to be environmentally considerate and sustainable. If it is, both the environment and the sector will be the better for it.  
"I look forward to working with the tourism sector in assisting it to realise its full potential," Mark Burton said.
