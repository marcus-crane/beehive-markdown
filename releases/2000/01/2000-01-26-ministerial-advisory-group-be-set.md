The establishment of a Ministerial Advisory Group was announced today by Immigration Minister, Lianne Dalziel.

"I am pleased to confirm that a Ministerial Advisory Group is to be set up to advise me on immigration policy and settlement issues. The group will provide a different point of view, to complement advice received from officials. The 1997 Population Conference recommended the establishment of a grouping such as this, and I look forward to working with the group. Settlement is a major priority for this Government, and I believe that the group will assist me in working through these issues", said the Minister.

Nominations from interested people with appropriate skills will be sought during the next few months. It is envisaged that the Ministerial Advisory Group could meet three or four times each year.

"In addition to the main Ministerial Advisory Group, which will focus on migrant-related settlement issues, I have asked my officials to consider the possibility of a sub-group specifically focussed on the resettlement needs of refugees, given that this requires special consideration", said the Minister.
