The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, has told TVNZ she supports a board decision to appeal an arbitration finding in its dispute with former newsreader, John Hawkesby.

The Minister was briefed on the circumstances surrounding the arbitration by the Chairperson of TVNZ, Roseanne Meo and Chief Executive, Rick Ellis, but was not advised of the amount of any financial settlement.

"This is an operational matter between the company and a former employee," Ms Hobbs says. "The arbitration finding is subject to a confidentiality clause and I have no right as shareholding minister to cut across that agreement and force TVNZ to breach it.

"Nevertheless I am pleased that TVNZ is seeking to have the confidentiality surrounding the arbitration lifted as I believe the public is entitled to know the full facts.

"Roseanne Meo expressed the company's determination to fight this case and I will await the outcome with great interest."
