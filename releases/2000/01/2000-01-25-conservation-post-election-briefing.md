Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee today released the Department of Conservation's post-election briefing to the new Government on conservation.  
"This briefing is a useful package of information about New Zealand's unique and diverse natural and historic heritage. Some amazing facts are contained. Weta are basically unchanged from their ancestors of 190 million years and we have about 800 species of native snails."  
The briefing also sets out DOC's role and functions. It has 1408 permanent staff and an annual budget of $157 million (excl. GST).  
The Conservation Task of maintaining and restoring natural and historic heritage, helping people enjoy their heritage, meeting other Government requirements, biosecurity and the duty towards and relationship with Maori are covered in the briefing. The Department's capability is also set out.  
"Conservation is a very exciting portfolio that I am looking forward to being involved with. And from the look of the calendar of upcoming events, there will be many opportunities for me to be active over the  
next year."  
"I'm really pleased with the presentation and quality of this briefing package, and I glad to say it was produced in house. It's filled with some top quality images of conservation icons, like the kakapo, tuatara  
and the Bridge to Nowhere on the Whanganui River."  
The briefing package is available on the DOC website at http://www.doc.govt.nz
