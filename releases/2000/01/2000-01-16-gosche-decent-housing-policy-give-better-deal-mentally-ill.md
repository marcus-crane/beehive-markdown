By restoring decency and affordability to housing policy the coalition government would help to give a better deal to people with mental illness, Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

Mark Gosche today released a briefing paper from the Mental Health Commission which highlights the relationship between housing and mental health.

"The report notes that ‘people with mental illness are more likely to experience transience, insecurity of tenure, and homelessness.’

"The Mental Health Commission concludes that the housing policies of the previous government, and in particular the charging of market rentals on state-owned housing, had adversely affected New Zealanders with mental illness.

"The Commission’s paper is further evidence of how vulnerable New Zealanders have been hurt by the previous government’s ideologically-driven housing policies:

Housing policy changes introduced in the early 1990s have impacted adversely on people with mental illness. Removal of subsidised rents and mortgages, the move to market rents and interest rates, and reliance on the accommodation supplement as the main instrument of accommodation assistance has reduced the range of assistance available to meet the diverse housing needs of particular vulnerable groups, including those with mental illness.

"This coalition government will bring decency and affordability back to housing policy, giving people with mental illnesses and other vulnerable groups a fairer deal,” Mr Gosche said.

"The sale of public housing has been halted. The government’s intention is that by the end of our first term in government, low income tenants will pay no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.

"Shortly I will be meeting with the chair of the Mental Health Commission, Barbara Disley, to discuss the issues raised in the Commission’s report. These important issues will not be ignored by this coalition government,” Mark Gosche said.

BRIEFING PAPER FOR THE MINISTER OF HOUSING

To: Hon Mark Gosche, Minister of Housing  
Copy: Hon Annette King, Minister of Health  
Date: 16 December 1999  
Subject: Housing and Mental Health  
File Ref: B NH02/Y MI03

The Mental Health Commission prepared a discussion paper on Housing and Mental Health in June of this year. This paper discusses the wide range of issues affecting accommodation for people with mental illness, in all types of tenures: boarding, rental and home ownership.

Preliminary results from a recent survey of 2521 users of HHS mental health services in Auckland and Northland indicated:

\* 701 had moved at least once during the previous six months (222 had moved three or more times)

\* 4 were homeless for the whole of the previous 13 weeks

\* 62 were homeless for some of the previous 13 weeks

\* 142 had spent some or all the previous 13 weeks in boarding houses

\* 660 had spent some or all the previous 13 weeks in supported housing

\* 631 had spent some or all the previous 13 weeks living with a family carer

\* 789 had spent some or all the previous 13 weeks in rental accommodation

\* 432 were living in their own homes for all of the previous 13 weeks

\* 112 had spent all of the previous 13 weeks in hospital acute units.

The Mental Health Commission’s paper reports that:

1\. Adequate and appropriate housing is essential to good mental health. If housing needs of people with mental illness are not met then their recovery is compromised. Some people with mental illness experience difficulty in accessing and maintaining tenure of housing appropriate to their needs.

2\. People affected by mental illness have two kinds of housing needs:  
a) affordability and access issues similar to those experienced by all people on low incomes  
b) needs created specifically by their illness and society’s response to it.

3\. People with mental illness are more likely to experience transience, insecurity of tenure, and homelessness. This is because they may find:

\* their income is reduced

\* their ability to make choices is impaired

\* their illness may impose specific needs to live alone, or with others

\* they are exposed to discriminatory practices

\* their need for inpatient or residential care (although short term) can make maintaining independent housing difficult.

4\. Health services are involved directly in housing only in relation to provision of supported housing for residential rehabilitation programmes. Ensuring that people with mental illness have access to affordable housing is a general social responsibility. All sectors need to work together to improve access to adequate, sustainable and affordable housing for people with mental illness.

5\. Present policies do not address the housing needs of people with mental illness and inter-agency responsibilities for meeting these housing needs are unclear.

6\. Housing policy changes introduced in the early 1990s have impacted adversely on people with mental illness. Removal of subsidised rents and mortgages, the move to market rents and interest rates, and reliance on the Accommodation Supplement as the main instrument of accommodation assistance has reduced the range of assistance available to meet the diverse housing needs of particular vulnerable groups, including those with mental illness.

7\. Access to and affordability of public sector housing has declined with the move to market rents and reductions in the public housing stock. Problems of serious housing need are increasing among those experiencing mental illness, particularly in Auckland.

8\. Supported housing, which includes rehabilitation services, funded by the HFA provides for around 6-7% of mental health services clients. There are some problems with lack of flexibility in use of these services and poor incentives in current contract arrangements. This is being reviewed by the HFA.

9\. The lack of a regulatory framework to address quality and safety issues in boarding houses puts those people with mental illness, who use boarding houses, at risk.

10\. Issues of discrimination in some district planning schemes and local regulation 90

11\. need to be addressed.

The Mental Health Commission consulted with the Ministry of Health, the Social Policy Agency, the Health Funding Authority, the Ministry of Housing, Housing New Zealand, and Community Housing Limited during the development of this paper.

The Mental Health Commission is keen to see housing opportunities for people with mental illness improved. Tomorrow (Friday 17 December), I will be visiting a number of boarding houses both registered and unregistered that provide housing for people with mental illness in South Auckland.

Commissioners would welcome the opportunity to discuss housing needs of people with mental illnesses with you once you have had a chance to review this report.
