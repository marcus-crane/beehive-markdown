Education Minister Trevor Mallard has dissolved the Board of Trustees of Kimi Ora Community School in Hastings and has asked for a commissioner to be appointed.

This follows advice from the Education Review Office and the Ministry of Education that students’ education at the school was seriously at risk, and consultation with the board.

"I am particularly concerned that six Education Review Office reports since 1992 have identified significant inadequacies at the school," Trevor Mallard said.

"Despite assistance from the Ministry of Education, the problems have not been satisfactorily resolved and I believe that to let the matter drag any further is to unnecessarily risk the education of the children at Kimi Ora.

"I am confident that there is a will in the community to help a commissioner move the school forward for the benefit of all their children," Trevor Mallard said.

The Minister has asked the Secretary for Education Howard Fancy to appoint a commissioner to carry out the board’s functions.
