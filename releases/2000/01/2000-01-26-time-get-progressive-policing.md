Police Minister Hon. George Hawkins this afternoon met with senior police and the police association president to ensure deputy police commissioner Rob Robinson’s “smooth transition” into the acting commissioner position.

“I have full confidence in the police and in the force’s ability to be responsive, progressive and effective in solving and preventing crime.

“Now that the Peter Doone issue has been concluded the police, public and the Government can again focus on how to improve policing in New Zealand.

“It is now time to get on with the war against burglaries and other crimes,” George Hawkins says.

“There are many pressing issues facing us all. Burglaries, violence and dishonesty crimes cause deep concern in communities throughout the country. Now is the time for us all to focus on how to solve crimes and to work at preventing crimes from occurring,” George Hawkins says.

“Over the next few months I intend to travel around the country visiting small police stations, from the Far North to the Chatham Islands.

“This week I will be visiting Dunedin and then to west Auckland and North Shore City police stations.

“It is important that as we rebuild policing in New Zealand, that I as Minister visit police stations and meet with local communities around the country. While there I will be listening and discussing each region’s grass roots policing and respective needs,” George Hawkins says.
