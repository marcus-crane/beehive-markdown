Health Minister Annette King today announced the four directors of an interim board to oversee the process of bringing the Health Funding Authority into the Ministry of Health.

The appointments, which take effect on February 1, include two members of the existing HFA board, Liz Coutts of Auckland and Bridget Allan of Hokianga, as well as two new members, Cynthia Kiro, Auckland, and Professor Gregor Coster, Auckland. The chairman, Syd Bradley, was announced last month. The board will meet for the first time on February 4.

Health Minister Annette King said the new appointments were a positive step toward achieving the Government's objectives of disestablishing the HFA and bringing it into the Ministry of Health.

"Our goal is to simplify health bureaucracies and reduce administration costs in favour of better services. Appointment of the directors is a start and now we must continue to move forward."

Mrs King said she was delighted with the broad range of experience and knowledge the new directors would be able to contribute as the change took place.

"The process of change will be evolutionary. Structures will be changing, but the challenge will be to use the experience of valuable staff. The Government is committed to restoring public faith in a comprehensive public health system.

"Overall our changes are intended to reduce central bureaucracy, increase public involvement in health and public accountability, and allow leadership to be more clearly demonstrated in the sector."
