New regulations which allow local bodies to impose infringement fees on people breaching the Resource Management Act come into force tomorrow, the Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs said today.

“The regulations cover a variety of offences under the RMA and allow local bodies the option of dealing with these offences without resorting to court action," Ms Hobbs said.

The decision about whether to use the new regulations or take action through the courts will be at the discretion of the enforcement officer.

Ms Hobbs said penalties under the new regulations range from $300 to $1000, depending on the seriousness of the offence.

“Offenders will have 28 days to pay the infringement fee," the Minister said. "They will also have the right to raise any matter relating to the circumstances with the enforcement authority or to deny liability and request that the matter be heard in the District Court.”

If a local body chose to take court action, penalties can be up to two years' imprisonment or a fine of $200,000.

Ms Hobbs said the new regulations broadened the range of methods local bodies had available for dealing with offences and complement their other options – such as abatement notices and enforcement orders.

"They will help local bodies in their efforts to administer the Act effectively," she said.
