Health Minister Annette King today announced the names of the two lawyers the Government will pay to represent women at the Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry.

They are Stuart Grieve QC and Bruce Corkill, who have already been acting for some of the women.

"They will be available to act for all affected women in the Gisborne area," Mrs King said.

"It is clear the issue of legal representation for women is important. In order to ensure the integrity of the inquiry, and to meet its timeframes, I have decided to appoint those lawyers already acting for some of the women to act for all those women wanting representation. This will ensure the collective interests of all affected women are properly represented in the inquiry."

Mrs King said Maori women could be assured the two lawyers had been instructed to pay particular attention to their needs. The contact details of the lawyers would be widely publicised in various media, including iwi radio.

Local women would also have an opportunity to discuss the subject and procedures of the inquiry at a hui the inquiry team will attend at the Pakirikiri Marae in Tokomaru Bay next Thursday (January 27), Mrs King said. All affected women were invited to the hui.

Mrs King also announced in December some formal inquiry hearings would be held in Gisborne to overcome problems the women would have travelling to Auckland. The formal hearings will start in Auckland on February 7.
