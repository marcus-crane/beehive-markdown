Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the National Party's new-found enthusiasm for openness in government was a joy to behold.

"National list MP Roger Sowry is today demanding full details of TVNZ's 'settlement' with Mr Hawkesby.

"The government, on behalf of the public, will disclose whatever it can about the settlement. The problem is, however, that under the state-owned enterprises culture fostered by the National Party in office, substantial golden handshakes and deals in secret were the order of the day.

"The Minister for Broadcasting will be seeking to divulge whatever she is legally able to. It is a pity that the National Party had not encouraged more open and forthcoming attitudes to such matters when it was in government and these kinds of deals were being done," Helen Clark said.
