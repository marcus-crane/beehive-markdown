The fate of several immigration policy changes mooted before the election was announced today by Immigration Minister, Lianne Dalziel.

"The changes due for 1 March 2000 have been confirmed. From that date, visitor’s visa waivers will be introduced for citizens of Andorra, Slovenia, Hungary, San Marino, the Vatican City and Zimbabwe. In addition, General Skills Category residence applicants will be eligible for a six month work permit, if a job offer is the only outstanding requirement”, the Minister said.

The work permit will allow applicants to search for a job in New Zealand and start work, pending the grant of residence. Employers will be reassured that their new employees will be granted residence. The New Zealand Immigration Service (NZIS) will check job offers.

The Minister also confirmed that work would continue on enhancing immigration health assessment policy.

"Current policy precludes granting residence to people who will be a burden on New Zealand’s health services. It has been clear for some time that better guidelines are needed on how much of a burden is placed on the health services by particular conditions. This is the fundamental issue, which was obscured last year by a concentration on HIV-AIDS."

"Work on TB screening is particularly important, because TB has a substantial impact on the health services. Work on TB will therefore take priority”, said the Minister.

The previous government announced changes to returning resident’s visa policy for June 2000. It was proposed that new migrants be granted an indefinite right of return from the time they are granted residence, without any requirement to actually spend time in New Zealand, or gain tax residence status here.

"I am concerned that we don’t know enough about the possible impact of this proposal, so I have asked that it be reviewed. I am particularly concerned about the so-called ‘astronaut’ family phenomenon. I believe there is insufficient research about the real extent of ‘astronaut’ families, so I have asked for more work on this aspect”, the Minster said.

The Minister noted that, as a result of the review, the proposed change might not go ahead in June 2000. “Current residents and prospective migrants should plan on the basis that the change might not proceed”, the Minister said.

The Minister also announced that the introduction of changes to the recognition of overseas qualifications for General Skills Category residence applications was being delayed. It had been planned to align the assessment of overseas qualifications with New Zealand’s National Qualifications Framework (NQF) in March 2000.

"I support this alignment of immigration policy with the NQF. Work on the practical details of this change is well advanced. However, more detailed work is required from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority on a number of aspects. I have, therefore, decided to set 4 September 2000 as the implementation date. This will ensure that the new system works well from the start, and that applicants are not subject to delays”, said the Minister.
