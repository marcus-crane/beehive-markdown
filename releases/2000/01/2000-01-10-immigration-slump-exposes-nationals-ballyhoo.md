An expected net migration loss of 6300 this year exposes again the failure of the former government’s economic policies, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

The projection, which follows a 11,365 net migration loss in 1998/99, is contained in a Department of Labour briefing paper to the new immigration minister, which Lianne Dalziel is releasing today.

The briefing paper points out that an increase in permanent long-term departures, combined with a fall in permanent long-term arrivals, have contributed to steadily decreasing net migration gains since the 1995/96 year.

The paper sets out a range of factors for the shortfall of 7402 in meeting the target of 38,000 residence approvals in 1998/99.

They include the "relatively poor performance of the New Zealand economy", increased competition from other migrant-receiving countries, settlement difficulties and a perception that New Zealand is unwelcoming.

"This paper demonstrates that the Shipley Government over-hyped its ability to manage the economy," Lianne Dalziel said.

"It is clear that prospective migrants have been turned off by an unevenly performing economy characterised by poor export growth, mediocre growth rates, wild swings in business confidence and the lack of consensus about our future direction.

"The briefing paper also comments that immigration outcomes could be improved with better settlement support.

"This is a longstanding element of Labour Party policy, which promises an active settlement programme in partnership with local and regional governments and key community groups.

"Another key point in the briefing paper is the need to improve English language skills among new migrants. Labour policy also calls for greater priority to be given to English language learning.

"The Department of Labour is aware of instances of exploitation by ‘less scrupulous’ operators. This reinforces the Government’s intention to consult with the sector on the setting up of a register of immigration consultants. Such an approach will help ensure that services to potential migrants meet acceptable standards.
