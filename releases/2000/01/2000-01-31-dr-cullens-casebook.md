DR CULLEN'S CASEBOOK

Here we are at the start of 2001, and the economic transformation of New Zealand is underway. This transition requires continuing growth, innovation, new business creation and investment as we move from a consumption-based economy to one that creates high skill, high value jobs through expanding our export earnings and creating a quality investment and savings regime.

We ended last year on a high note with the official unemployment rate at its lowest level in twelve years and the current account deficit reducing rapidly.

Bright start to New Year  
The latest NZIER survey showing a strong bounce-back in business confidence is in line with other surveys and points to good economic growth this year.

The turnaround is dramatic - from net 45 percent negative to net 31 percent positive in just three months. This is a huge improvement which, although obviously welcome from the Government's perspective, demonstrates just how volatile business sentiment is in New Zealand.

In fact, most of the factors which drive business confidence are outside the Government's control but we will do what we can to sustain and protect the current high levels of optimism.

Business-Government Forum  
We established a good dialogue with the business sector last year and we are building on that this year, beginning with a second Business-Government Forum in Christchurch next month, followed by a Waikato event in March.

At the first Business to Government Forum, some sections of the business community called for substantially increased government contributions to augment the efforts of the private sector. At the same time it was recognised that there is a very real need to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, and that dictates that a premium continue to be placed on prudent fiscal management.

The Government is responding to this basic tension by placing the emphasis on the quality of spending, the effectiveness of Government interventions and the relevance of the regulatory environment.

Inflation  
On the inflation front, it is important to recognise that there are strong factors at work that should see the annualised CPI movement well below the 3 percent target ceiling by the end of the year.

It is true that the December quarter showed price increases in a broader range of product categories than was the case earlier in the year - there was not the same level of contribution from "one off" impacts.

However, some of the one-off impacts are still influencing the annual inflation rate, and will fall out of the index during the course of the year. This is particularly true of the tobacco excise, which impacted in the June and September quarters.

Price increases in 2000 were heavily influenced by petrol price impacts. While we cannot be certain about there they may head this year - already we have seen an extreme amount of volatility in petrol prices in just one month - I note that the prices in December were some 14 percent higher than those applying in mid January. So there is a considerable margin for petrol prices to move in the early part of this year without impacting on inflation.

Also when the effects of income related state house rents are measured, they should see half a percentage point fall in the index in the March quarter.

The US landing - how hard is hard?  
The big issues about the US economy are just how hard any hard landing might be, and how New Zealand will be affected.

It is early days, but my first thoughts are that there are some buffers at work that would moderate any prolonged stagnation.

For a start, we are not seeing any asset price bubble bursting as the decline in share values has been a gradual process.

Secondly, the US has a strong fiscal position and has more fiscal flexibility to use to moderate any strong drop off in demand.

But to bring the issue back to New Zealand, the question is what effects will a slowing US economy have on our own. Without doubt, there will be indirect as well as direct effects. However, there are two important factors at work, which give me a degree of comfort:  
§ The latest business opinion survey shows domestic expansion kicking in to augment the export led growth. So our economy is moving in to a phase in the business cycle where we are somewhat less exposed to external factors.  
§ Any easing in global interest rates that accompanies a slowing US economy will ease the burden of high levels of household debt for New Zealand families.

So looking out to the rest of the year I see no reason to change the basic game plan:  
§ Sound money  
§ Prudent fiscal management  
§ An emphasis on skills, science and innovation  
§ A constructive interaction between the government and the business sector to facilitate self-sufficient growth  
§ Attention to the social dimensions of economic performance, particularly through education and employment.

The aim of all this is to simply earn in order to spend and to wean the economy off its unhealthy dependence on private foreign debt. I am surprised at just how much of a switch has taken place in the last year and I am pleased at the way dynamic change is unfolding.

Improving the investment environment  
The Government is implementing a range of policies to create a better environment to foster quality investment and boost economic growth:

§ $4.5 million has been set aside for Industry New Zealand to deliver two new services to business  
§ the new export credit guarantee scheme is expected to support around $100 million of exports a year  
§ changes are being made to allow skilled migrants easier access to New Zealand  
§ small shareholders better protected by the new take-overs code  
§ Insider trading rules under review  
§ Australia and NZ have committed to greater business law integration  
§ a Telecommunications Commissioner will be established in the Commerce Commission with the power to resolve disputes between industry players over regulated services  
§ a New Zealand Tourism Strategy has been developed  
§ increased state support for private sector research and development  
§ setting up a Business Compliance Cost Panel to report on unnecessary compliance costs arising out of existing regulations  
§ work is continuing to improve the skills of our school leavers by:  
ü making tertiary education more affordable  
ü expanded ICT (information communication technology) development clusters in the school sector and better coordination within the sector  
ü Helping young people take up and complete training through the Modern Apprenticeships Programme.
