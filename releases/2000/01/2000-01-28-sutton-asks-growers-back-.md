The Minister of Agriculture, Jim Sutton, today urged sections of the pipfruit industry to “back off” from their criticism of the independent committee set up to consider and approve applications for export permits for apples and pears.

The Apple and Pear Export Permits Committee had been subjected to a great deal of pressure from people promoting their own applications for export permits and from sections of the industry concerned about the possible impact on the major exporter ENZA, he said.

“This pressure is distracting the committee, making it difficult for them to give proper and timely consideration to all the applications,” Mr Sutton said.

The committee had a difficult task in that it had had to develop from scratch a process for considering applications.

“The decision to make independent exports subject to a permit system administered by an independent committee was made by Parliament last year with overwhelming support from the pipfruit industry.

“I regard any attempt to frustrate the committee from doing its job properly as frustrating not only the will of the industry, but also of Parliament,” Mr Sutton said.

Allowing independent exports of pipfruit was not new; all that was new was that the committee approving exports was independent.

Mr Sutton said he was determined the committee should be able to do the job it was set up to do by law.
