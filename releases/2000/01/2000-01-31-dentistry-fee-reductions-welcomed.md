Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson said today he was delighted the Government was reducing dental tuition fees.

"This has been an ugly anomaly in tertiary education for long enough," Mr Hodgson said.

"At last an injustice has been rectified. I am delighted that we have been able to progress a resolution a year earlier than we expected.

"Several people worked long and hard in the first few days of the New Year, in Dunedin and Wellington, to make this possible. I particularly thank the Prime Minister for her help and her determination to make progress."
