Education Minister Trevor Mallard has welcomed the release of a report from the literacy experts group – made up of ten of New Zealand’s leading academics and researchers in literacy at the school level.

The report is being released by the Ministry of Education today.

Trevor Mallard said the Literacy Experts Group Report documents advice given to the Literacy Taskforce set up by the previous Government and had provided direction for work currently underway to improve children’s levels of literacy.

"It’s important that the work we are doing in schools is informed by the knowledge and experience that the group of academics brings to the debate. They were able to complement the literacy taskforce whose membership was made up more of practitioners.

"I’m particularly pleased that the experts emphasised the importance of all teachers having a complete set of strategies for the teaching of reading and are able to use the right one at the right time. It’s not a case of phonics or whole language, but the balance that will work best for a particular child at a particular time.

"Clearly it is important that all teachers do have the skills and are able to make the right professional judgements. I’m keen to see that they get good advice and support. The Literacy Experts Group Report helps shape this advice."
