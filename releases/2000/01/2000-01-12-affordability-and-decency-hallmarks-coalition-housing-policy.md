Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today that the Coalition government was determined to make decency and affordability the hallmarks of its housing policy.

Mr Gosche today released departmental briefing papers from Housing New Zealand.

"Briefing papers from Housing New Zealand show the extent to which the previous government depleted the public housing stock and, through its market rental policy, made renting in the public sector unaffordable for thousands of New Zealand families.

"Housing New Zealand’s own research into need concluded that ‘there are two dimensions of need: accessibility (ease of finding a home) and sustainability (ability to stay in a home).’

"In flogging off so much of the public housing stock, and charging market rentals on what remained, the previous government exacerbated the problems of sustainability and affordability for low-income New Zealanders," Mr Gosche said.

"The consequences of this approach have been disastrous.

"Overcrowding, outbreaks of diseases more commonly associated with third world countries, poor physical and mental health and low levels of education achievement – these and other problems have all flowed from a basic failure to provide decent, affordable housing for low-income New Zealanders.

"This coalition government, acting on the strong mandate it received at the polls last November, will not allow this situation to continue.

"Sales of public housing have been halted, and administrative work has been started on introducing income-related rentals.

"The government’s intention is that by the end of our first term in government, low income tenants will pay no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.

"The return to a decent housing policy, combined with a social and economic programme to revitalise our economy and restore public services, will erase National’s legacy of neglect and meanness, and improve life for all New Zealanders,” Mark Gosche said.
