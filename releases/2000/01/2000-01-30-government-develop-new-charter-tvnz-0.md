Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister of Broadcasting and  
Minister in Charge of Television New Zealand Marian Hobbs,  
said today that the Government had decided not to approve  
the joint venture proposal for Television New Zealand to set  
up a digital television service.

Helen Clark and Marian Hobbs said that the Cabinet today  
spent a considerable time discussing the issues involved.

"The Cabinet's view was that it is necessary for the  
government to establish a wider public policy framework within  
which to consider the expansion of digital television services.  
It believes that there needs to be broader public policy  
debate about how these new services might be introduced.  
Agreeing to the Television New Zealand proposal now  
pre-empts that broader debate.

"Cabinet also noted that the new government favoured a  
different direction for Television New Zealand from that which  
it had followed in recent years.

"This government wants to establish a charter for Television  
New Zealand which brings public interest objectives for its  
development to the fore. Ministers wish to see Television New  
Zealand offering more programming reflecting New Zealand  
perspectives, culture and identity. The dominant commercial  
objective under which it has operated would be a barrier to  
this re-direction.

"Ministers have a concern that agreement to Television New  
Zealand's proposed digital television joint venture now would  
drive the attention of Television New Zealand further away  
from its responsibilities as a public interest broadcaster and  
even more towards what have been hitherto its predominant  
commercial objectives.

"The Cabinet has agreed to give priority now to developing  
public policy on the expansion of digital television services.

"In addition Marian Hobbs as Minister of Broadcasting and  
Minister in Charge of Television New Zealand will be returning  
to the Cabinet with proposals for redirecting Television New  
Zealand around the Government's intentions for public  
television.

"Cabinet is aware of the very considerable time which  
Television New Zealand has invested in developing its joint  
venture proposal. It did not, however, wish to be pre-empted  
at this time in its examination of broader public policy issues  
by a decision to proceed with this proposal", Helen Clark and  
Marian Hobbs said.
