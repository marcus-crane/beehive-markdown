Health Minister Annette King today confirmed some of the Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry's hearings will be held in Gisborne.

The formal hearings will still begin in Auckland on February 7, but they will be preceded by a hui at Tokomaru Bay on January 27.

Mrs King said today some of the hearings would be held in Gisborne to create an easier and friendlier environment for the women personally affected.

The Inquiry Team, Ailsa Duffy QC, Mrs Druis Barrett and Dr Gordon Wright, would announce the location and times of hearings later this month, she said.

Mrs King also announced today the Government will fund legal representation on behalf of the collective interests of women personally affected. Details of the legal counsel to be appointed would be announced in the week beginning January 17.

Mrs King has also approved minor changes to the terms of reference for the inquiry to clarify the team's brief, and "to ensure it is properly able to inquire into and report on the key issues".

The Inquiry Team requested the changes following two preliminary public meetings it held in Gisborne and Auckland last year.

The team's brief is now to conduct an inquiry into the reading of abnormalities in cervical smears in the Gisborne region prior to March 1996, taking into account the results of reviews of cervical cytology and histology samples carried out by the Health Funding Authority.

The original brief referred only to the review of histology samples.

Mrs King said the team was also required to determine if there had been an unacceptable level of under-reporting in consequence of misreading and/or misreporting of abnormalities in cervical smears in the Gisborne region.

If the team determined there had been an unacceptable level of under-reporting, it must identify the factors likely to have been responsible, and satisfy itself whether the Gisborne case was an isolated one, or evidence of a systemic issue for the National Cervical Screening Programme.

Mrs King said it was most important the inquiry be conducted and concluded as soon as possible.

"Early resolution for affected women is vital. The women of Gisborne and women generally must have confidence in the National Cervical Screening Programme."

NB: The revised terms of reference are:

To conduct an inquiry into the reading of abnormalities in cervical smears in the Gisborne region prior to March 1996, taking into account the results of the reviews of cervical cytology and histology samples carried out by the Health Funding Authority, on the following terms:

1\. To determine whether there has been an unacceptable level of under-reporting in consequence of mis-reading and/or mis-reporting of abnormalities in cervical smears in the Gisborne region.

2\. If you determine that there has been an unacceptable level of under-reporting, to identify the factors that are likely to have led to that under-reporting.

3\. If you determine that there has been an unacceptable level of under-reporting, to satisfy yourselves whether or not this was an isolated case rather than evidence of a systemic issue for the National Cervical Screening Programme.

All other terms of reference are unchanged.
