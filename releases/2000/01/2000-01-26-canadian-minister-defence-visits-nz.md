The Canadian Minister of Defence, the Hon Arthur Eggleton has arrived in Wellington this morning on a two-day visit to New Zealand.  
Mr Eggleton has come to New Zealand as part of a wider visit to Australia and East Timor.  
The purpose of the visit to Wellington is to meet New Zealand's new Defence Minister Mark Burton and to discuss defence issues of common interest.  
Mr Burton said the visit underscores the warm bilateral relationship between Canada and New Zealand.  
"This has recently been reinforced through cooperation in East Timor where a Canadian Company has been working closely with New Zealand troops.  
"I look forward to cementing this relationship at a Ministerial level," Mr Burton said.
