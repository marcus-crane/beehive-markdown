The Green Party’s unrelenting attacks on the development of new biotechnology could end in sufferers from cystic fibrosis and emphysema being denied an improved treatment for their illness, the Minister of Agriculture, Jim Sutton, said today.

Mr Sutton said Green MP Sue Kedgley’s claim that 10,000 genetically modified sheep were being raised in Waikato was “way out”. There were only about 200 GM sheep on the property owned by PPL Therapeutics.

“They are being kept there under very strict quarantine and containment conditions laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Environmental Risk Management Authority. They produce a human protein in their milk, which is the key ingredient of the new product,” Mr Sutton said..

Larger numbers had been approved by ERMA in March last year, but they might never be needed. What was required was enough of the product to allow clinical trials, he said.

“This research is being done here because our sheep are free of all known prion diseases, such as scrapie. This makes New Zealand a good place in which to develop animal-based therapeutic products for use in humans,” Mr Sutton said.

PPL’s research could have important health and employment benefits for New Zealanders over time, he said.

“If the Green Party succeed in their relentless campaign against new biotechnology and deny cystic fibrosis and emphysema sufferers an improved treatment for their condition, will they then move on to ban the existing production of human insulin by similar technology?" he asked.
