Concern at the inaccuracy of their inflation forecasts.

The Consumer Price Index for the December quarter showed an increase of just 0.2  
percent. This was well below the Treasury?s 0.8 percent forecast and the Reserve  
Bank's forecast of 0.9 percent.

"Clearly the Reserve Bank's higher inflation expectation influenced its decision  
today to raise the OCR by 25 points to 5.25," Dr Cullen said.

He would also be discussing with the bank the relationship between the timing of  
RB statements and Statistics New Zealand releases.

"On the face of it, it seems a little strange that the bank's statement should  
come out less than two hours before the official statistics on inflation were  
released.

"The December result puts the annual inflation rate at 1.3 percent which is  
below the mid-point of the Reserve Bank's price stability target," Dr Cullen  
said.

"I recognise that the bank needs to anticipate future inflation rather than just  
responding to past inflation and that there is obviously a judgement to be made  
about the strength of future inflationary pressures.

"And I accept absolutely that it is the bank which must make that judgement.

"However I would expect the Reserve Bank to monitor developments very carefully  
over the next few months and not necessarily assume inflationary pressures are  
there when the published figures are showing that they are not."

The international experience was that modern economies tended to deliver lower  
inflation problems.

Dr Cullen said a number of the Government's policies should also have the effect  
of reducing the inflation risk, particularly the repeal of the previous  
Government's planned tax cut and the introduction of a new 39c income tax step  
on incomes over $60,000.
