Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton has today announced an eight-member Industry New Zealand board with a strong private sector background.

The board members are:

„h Craig Boyce, Smiths City Group.  
„h Shane Jones, Poutama Trust and Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission.  
„h Don Riesterer, Mayor of Opotiki.  
„h Bridget Wickham, the Great New Zealand Business Venture.  
„h Maxine Simmons, Immuno-Chemical Products and FoRST.  
„h Gregory Fortuin, AXA Corporate Superannuation Services.  
„h David Maloney, Interlock Group and Manufacturers Federation.  
„h Rex Jones, former secretary of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union.

Craig Boyce has agreed to act as chair until a permanent chair takes up the position early next year.

Jim Anderton said members of the Board were chosen for having a long and practical commitment to business and economic development.

¡§These people are leaders in their fields. The new board has a very strong background in linking business and regional development.

"Industry New Zealand provides some balance in economic policy. Instead of the failed hands-off approach of the past, Industry New Zealand will contribute to rising incomes and more jobs. It will enter partnerships with local government and the private sector to build on our advantages and strengthen the economy."

Jim Anderton paid tribute to the work of the Industry New Zealand establishment board and the Ministry of Economic Development for their work while Industry New Zealand was being set up.

"The Government's commitment to industry and regional development through Industry New Zealand has been implemented as quickly as possible.

"The establishment team had the enormous task of building an organisation from scratch. It has developed and managed industry development and strategic investment projects, and small business assistance and regional development programmes."

Industry New Zealand comes into formal legal existence on 6 October. The Industry New Zealand Act 2000, was passed by Parliament in early September. The Act allows directors to be appointed for a term of up to three years. Industry New Zealand becomes a legal entity on 6 October 2000.
