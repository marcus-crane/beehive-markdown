Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming multi-party support for the Government's Modern Apprenticeship scheme.

Parliament began debating the Apprenticeship Training Bill this afternoon. The bill provides for the nationwide roll-out of Modern Apprenticeships in 2001. Modern Apprenticeships is a new work-based vocational education and training initiative that aims to encourage, and help, young people to take up and complete apprenticeship training. Nearly 100 young people have already signed modern apprenticeship training agreements in pilot programmes operating across eighteen industry sectors this year. Five hundred modern apprenticeships will be commenced this year and the Government wants to provide training for 3000 modern apprentices by 2002.

"The Government has been delighted with the positive response of employers and young people to Modern Apprenticeships. The legislation debated in Parliament this afternoon cements in the promise Labour and the Alliance made before the election to improve training opportunities for New Zealanders.

"We are determined to dramatically increase the number of young people entering apprenticeship training. Over the 1990s the average age of people in industry training rose so that by last year only 10 percent of trainees were in the 16 to 19 age bracket.

"I am pleased that all parties in Parliament have decided to support the progression of the Apprenticeship Training Bill to a select committee. The Government is confident that Modern Apprenticeships delivers a very practical response to an identified need in the community and a gap in our current education and training pathways.

"Employers and prospective apprentices wanting to participate in Modern Apprenticeships should call 0800 SKILLNZ," Steve Maharey said.

Facts Sheet

Modern Apprenticeships, a new work-based education initiative for young people, will be established over the next 18 months by Skill New Zealand.

These new training arrangements will combine the best aspects of traditional apprenticeships with additional features designed to assist more young people to get access to employment-based training towards national qualifications.

Although the number of people in industry training (organised through Industry Training Organisations) is at a high level, only 10% of the 56,000+ industry trainees in December 1999 were aged under 20 years.

The aim of Modern Apprenticeships is to expand the number of young people in systematic industry training leading to national qualifications by establishing a new, supported, career pathway. It will be highly regarded by young people, employers and the community at large. Some Modern Apprenticeships will be available to older people wishing to start a new career.

Some design features of Modern Apprenticeships are:

\* Apprentices will be employed and have a registered training agreement with an ITO. Normal ITO subsidy arrangements will apply to the training agreement.

\* Apprenticeships will be available across a wide range of industries, expanding over time to include new areas such as business administration.

\* Training will be competency-based and lead to a nationally recognised industry qualification at Levels 3 or 4 on the National Qualifications Framework.

\* Modern Apprenticeships will primarily target young people aged 16-21 years on entry. Others wishing to start a new career may also be eligible.

\* Apprenticeships will include on and off-job learning.

\* Apprentices will each have an individual training plan, including generic skills where necessary.

\* Mentoring support will be available to the apprentice through the services of a ‘broker’ or Apprenticeship Co-ordinator outside the firm. The Apprenticeship Co-ordinator’s goal is to ensure that the apprentice is able to successfully complete their qualification.

\* Apprenticeship Co-ordinators will also provide an apprentice recruitment service for employers and provide training administration support to make it easy for employers to participate in Modern Apprenticeships.
