Prime Minister Helen Clark today offered the Honourable Simon Upton very warm congratulations on his appointment as full time chairperson of the OECD's Round Table on Sustainable Development.

Helen Clark said that Simon Upton had been an extremely committed Environment Minister and worked hard at the international level on environmental issues.

"These issues require considerable intellectual ability, which Simon has in abundance.

"Significant international appointments like this bring much credit to New Zealand. I am delighted that Simon Upton will be able to make a major contribution at an international level," Helen Clark said.
