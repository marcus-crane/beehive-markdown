Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard today paid tribute to Hillary Commission chief executive Peter Dale, who will retire in July next year.

“Mr Dale has managed the Commission with distinction for nearly ten years, and has provided outstanding leadership to the sport sector in that time," Trevor Mallard said.

He said that under Mr Dale’s leadership the Hillary Commission had gained a reputation as a well-managed and effective government agency.

“I personally wish Mr Dale and his family all the very best for the future. I also wish to thank him for the support he has given me as Minister, and I am sure previous Ministers will reinforce this," Trevor Mallard said.
