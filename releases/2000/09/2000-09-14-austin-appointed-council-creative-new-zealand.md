Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of Christchurch City Councillor, Paddy Austin to the Council of Creative New Zealand.

“I am delighted that Paddy has agreed to join the Council” Judith Tizard said.

“She brings extensive experience and a broad range of relevant skills to Creative New Zealand including strategic planning, financial and property management, marketing and communications, and change management. I am confident she will be a strong contributor to the Council”

Judith Tizard particularly noted Dr Austin’s broad experience in local government. “Given the role of local government in funding and support for the arts and the importance of Creative New Zealand’s relationship with local authorities, it has been recognised for some time that the Council would benefit from members with relevant experience in this area. A Christchurch City Councillor, and former Council manager, Paddy Austin brings direct local government knowledge and experience to this position” she said.

Currently a Management Consultant in the areas of strategic planning, organisational development, and group facilitation, Paddy Austin has previously held positions as Director of the Arts Centre of Christchurch and Communications and Promotion Manager for the Christchurch City Council

Dr Austin has been appointed for a term of office expiring on 30 June 2003.
