Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Counties Manukau Police for achieving a decrease in recorded burglary.

Counties Manukau Police District has achieved a drop in recorded burglaries, with 885 fewer burglaries recorded between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 than for the previous 12 month period.

Counties Manukau has recorded a percentage increase in the number of burglaries resolved.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Counties Manukau Police District has achieved:  
· 4.6% drop in overall recorded crime  
· 36.4% resolution rate for all recorded crime  
· 885 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 8.4% reduction in recorded burglaries.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools. Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate Counties Manukau Police for their result and encourage them to further develop programmes that reduce the incidence of crime in Counties Manukau," George Hawkins said.
