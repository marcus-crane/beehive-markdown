Acting Finance Minister Trevor Mallard today poured cold water on Murray McCully's claims that the government plans to 'milk cash' from state owned enterprises for a social spend up.

Trevor Mallard said it is painfully obvious that Murray McCully is ignorant of both basic accounting principles and his own party's practice when they were in government. "McCully has shown himself up for not understanding the difference between capital investment and operational spending. However, I am happy to give him a special private briefing on basic government accounting.

"The Government made it very clear in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update that we will consider reviewing of the capital structure of SOEs to align with commercial best practice. We also made it clear that any resulting capital would mean the Government would have to borrow less to build new schools, hospitals and prisons.

"This is not a sudden decision in response to any particular circumstances. Nor is it a shift in policy from previous governments. Indeed, former Finance Minister Bill English at one point guessed up to $1 billion could be pulled from SOEs," said Trevor Mallard.

"McCully's claim that the Government is seeking $180 million from TVNZ is a figment of his imagination. We are looking at a wide variety of options for the future shape of TVNZ and BCL and no decisions have been made yet."

Trevor Mallard said McCully's recent comments are the real mystery given the hundreds of millions of dollars that previous governments received from SOE special dividends over the past ten years. (refer attached table)

"Dividends are a mechanism whereby the capital structure of SOEs can be aligned with commercial best practice. The Government would be at fault if it did not investigate the payment of special dividends from time to time. Just last year, the previous government required the payment of a special dividend by TVNZ," said Trevor Mallard.

Trevor Mallard said reviews of capital structures are part of the Government's objective to run an efficient SOE sector. Appropriate capital structures allow SOEs to achieve their business needs, while ensuring their balance sheets are in line with good commercial practices. "For Mr McCully to call this interference simply shows up his ignorance in the way that both public and private sector companies use debt. To suggest that the government could use any released capital to fund social spending shows a complete lack of accounting knowledge. A change in capital structure will only affect capital provisions.

"During a review, it's up to the Board of each SOE to assess its capital structure, given the capital requirements of the business and appropriate gearing akin to industry norms. This is happening at the moment in relation to a number of SOEs and no specific proposals have been presented to the Government, " said Trevor Mallard.
