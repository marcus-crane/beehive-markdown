The Fire Service Commission has ordered an independent review of allegations of inappropriate behaviour within the Fire Service, the Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton said today.

"I have received an initial report from the Commission in response to issues raised in parliamentary questions.

"Those issues include alleged financial mismanagement in the Hamilton Fire Service, alleged pressure on a 'whistle-blower' to resign, and alleged misuse of the Internet.

"The Chair of the Fire Service Commission Dame Margaret Bazley has advised me that, in order to ensure a thorough and transparent response to my call for a report, she has appointed Helen Cull QC to conduct an independent review.

"Helen Cull will examine how Fire Service policy and procedures are applied, review whether there was a breach of financial controls in Hamilton, and whether there have been breaches of Internet access privileges.

"She will also advise the Commission of any other matters which she determines require further investigation.

"I support the approach being taken by the Fire Service Commission. The findings of an independent review by a QC of Helen Cull's standing will be seen as credible and robust," Mark Burton said.

Helen Cull QC is expected to complete her investigation by the end of the month.
