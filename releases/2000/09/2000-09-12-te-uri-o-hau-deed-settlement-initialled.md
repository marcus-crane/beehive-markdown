The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Margaret Wilson, and representatives of Te Uri o Hau have today initialled a Deed of Settlement.

The deed provides redress for Te Uri o Hau for Crown breaches in the past of its Treaty obligations. These breaches led to significant loss of land and resources for Te Uri o Hau, and subsequent damage to its communities.

“All New Zealanders should welcome the progress made towards settling this grievance,” said Ms Wilson.

“The historical evidence has proven that the Crown has acted in breach of its obligations and that redress is justified”.

The initialling will allow the agreements in the Deed to be put before all members of Te Uri o Hau for their endorsement. This will be done by secret ballot.

Te Uri o Hau is a Northland hapu of Ngati Whatua whose traditional region is in Northern Kaipara. Te Uri o Hau has about 6,000 members.

Ms Wilson said the agreement was based on Heads of Agreement signed last November.

“Since then a number of outstanding issues have been resolved to the point at which a final decision can be made.

“This brings us within sight of settlement.

“I commend the negotiators for both Te Uri o Hau and the Crown and look forward to the decision of the people.”

This is the first initialling of a Deed of Settlement by the Labour Alliance Government and the first time a deed has been initialled for the Northland area.
