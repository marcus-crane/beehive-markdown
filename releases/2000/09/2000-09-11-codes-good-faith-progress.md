The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson, is pleased with the progress so far in forming codes of good faith to guide workplace relations under the Employment Contracts Act.

The codes are being developed by a committee representing unions and employers, chaired by the mediator, Walter Grills.

"Agreement has been reached in a large number of areas covering the basics of good faith negotiations and obligations", said Ms Wilson.

"But it was never expected to be an easy process. Both union and employer representatives are having to move past the approaches acceptable under the old law and work with in the new. This takes both time and effort"

"It had always been planned to consult before the committee decided its final position.

"It is not surprising that both employer and employee representatives have held firm on issues of importance to them before the consultation takes place. By doing so they alert people making submissions to these important issues.

"But these differences are being expressed in the context of a great deal of positive progress towards an agreement and I look forward to the resolution of outstanding issues after the consultation period is finished.

The document for consultation can be found on www.nzir.dol.govt.nz.

Submissions are due in by 18 September to allow the work to be completed before the Act comes into force on October 2.
