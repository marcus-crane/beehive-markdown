Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins is keen to see mayors seek innovative ways to support policing in their territorial areas.

George Hawkins said: "An example of such innovation is the community policing kiosk in Wellington's Cuba Street.

"This is a Wellington City Council and Police initiative that is responsible for cutting crime in Wellington's central city area," George Hawkins said.

On March 27, Wellington Central Police opened a Beat Section at the community policing kiosk.

There, 12 staff focus on inner-city policing. From this kiosk, five community constables walk the beat.

George Hawkins said: "The Beat Section shows an obvious police presence in and around Wellington's central area, and the initiative has done much to reduce crime in the Manners Mall, Cuba Street area.

"The police and the Wellington City Council made the initiative possible. Walking the beat, talking to shop owners and shoppers, and generally being a part of the community is an essential part of modern policing.

"It is taking the best of yesterday's policing and making it work for today.

"Clearly the sight of uniformed officers walking the beat ensures shoppers, particularly older people, feel safer when in the city.

"Yesterday I met with Auckland City Mayor Hon. Christine Fletcher, where we discussed ways Auckland City residents can feel more secure.

"Auckland City already has the highest number of police per head of population in the country. And Auckland City is to benefit from more Police officers as announced in this year's Budget.

"Auckland public affairs and advocacy manager, Stephen Rainbow, will visit Wellington City's community policing kiosk in Cuba Street to see what benefits can be expected from similar initiatives in Auckland. I welcome such decisions," George Hawkins said.
