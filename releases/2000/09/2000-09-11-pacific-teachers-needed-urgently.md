Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche urged Pacific peoples to consider a teaching career today.

"Teachers make a huge difference in the lives of our children, and the future of our communities," he said today.

"There are many Pacific role-models in our communities but we urgently need more Pacific role-models in our schools, teaching our students."

"Each year more than 74% of all Pacific students leave school with no qualification and little to prepare them for the future that lies ahead."

"There's never been more Government support for Pacific people wanting to become teachers and possibly never a more important time."

The deadline for this year's TeachNZ teacher trainee scholarships has been extended to Monday 2 October, 2000.

There are 75 $10,000 scholarships for Pacific teacher trainees. Fifty places are for graduates to train as primary or secondary teachers and 25 places are for Pacific trainees without a tertiary qualification.

The scholarships are part of this Government's commitment to close disparity gaps that exist between Pacific peoples and other New Zealanders said Mr Gosche.

"Teaching is a challenging job, an exciting career and a respected profession."

"I'd like to encourage all Pacific peoples, young and old, to consider a teaching career."
