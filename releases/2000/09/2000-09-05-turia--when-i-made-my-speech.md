I completely stand by my personal statement that I delivered in the House regarding my use of the word holocaust in regard to my speech last week to the New Zealand Psychological Society Conference, says Hon Tariana Turia.

"Prior to making my personal statement, I responded to a question regarding that same speech from Winston Peters.

"In his question Winston asked if I thought the use of this word in the Waitangi Tribunal report on Taranaki gave me licence to use it.

"At the time I gave my speech to the New Zealand Psychological Society Conference I believed it did, so it was in that context I responded to his question.

"Lest there be any misunderstanding, I accept the Prime Minister's edict that Ministers should not use this term.

"I accept the convention of collective ministerial responsibility and will desist from using that particular term in the future.

"I note that the National Government welcomed the Waitangi Tribunal’s Taranaki Report saying ‘the report very clearly sets out the historical factual situation in Taranaki’ and it ‘is of very high scholastic calibre’," Tariana Turia said this evening.
