Manurewa state house tenants have been posted application packs so they can apply for an income-related rent.

Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins said: "Manurewa state house tenants must apply to be charged income related rents. Application forms were posted out last week.

"Around 2057 Manurewa households will have received an income related rents application pack.

"Manurewa state house tenants should fill in their forms so they can benefit from the Government's decision to charge rents based on income," George Hawkins said.

"Labour campaigned hard against the previous government's market rent policies. Thousands of tenants in our region suffered under that rent-hiking regime. Labour has kept its promise to restore income-related rents to those people who need them the most," George Hawkins said.

"By December, we will have tossed National's miserable market rent housing policy out with the trash.

"This Government will replace it with a fair and socially restorative income related rents policy that charges based on how much a family earns.

"This means those who have a low incomes will pay less in rents than those who enjoy higher incomes," George Hawkins said.

Statistics New Zealand figures show the average rental for Housing New Zealand homes rose 106% since 1992. During the same period rentals from private landlords rose by 23%."

Market rents have been identified as the single, largest cause of financial hardship for thousands of low-income Auckland households.

George Hawkins said: "It was clear from the outset that market rents caused incredible hardship for thousands of state house tenants.

"This opinion was backed up by sisters at the Monte Cecelia Emergency shelter, Salvation Army workers and Food Banks citywide.

"Rising rents saw many low-income people living in unsatisfactory, overcrowded conditions. This was especially so in Manukau City. There, illness escalated and those suffering diseases such as TB increased. Manukau now has the highest rates of meningicoccal disease in the developed world," George Hawkins said.

The rise in meningicoccal disease began in 1991 - coincidentally around the same time the National government introduced market rents and the wholesale sell-off of state houses.

"Decent, affordable housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of our families and communities," George Hawkins said.

Despite this, the previous Government maintained market rents and continued to sell houses. They made nearly $400 million selling state houses in the greater Auckland region.

From December 1, 2000 state house rents will depend on a tenant's income.

Low-income tenants will pay no more than 25% of their income on rent. Other tenant's rents will depend on their income but no one's rent will go up as a result of the changeover.

Income-related rents will also have a spin-off for many low-income communities as research indicates that millions more will be spent on local goods and services.

Low-income people who rent privately will not lose out as they will continue to benefit from the Accommodation Supplement which costs more than $800 million per year.
