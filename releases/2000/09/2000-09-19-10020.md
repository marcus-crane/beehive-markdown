The government has approved for consultation with the public and with the broadcasting industry the draft text of a charter for Television New Zealand, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

The draft charter indicates in broad terms the form of broadcast content TVNZ is to provide. It will apply to all those parts of TVNZ's operations that contribute to its broadcast content and it will be fulfilled predominantly through free-to-air services, Marian Hobbs said.

The draft charter will be available on the Minister of Broadcasting's web site (www.executive.govt.nz/minister/hobbs). 'Hard' copies will be sent to groups and individuals who have written to the Minister with their concerns.

Interested parties are invited to write to the Minister of Broadcasting, Parliament Buildings, Wellington, with their comments by October 31.

"TVNZ is the state-owned broadcaster and we want people's input into the Charter," she said.

Marian Hobbs said she is discussing with the Chair of TVNZ, Dr Ross Armstrong, how the aspirations of the draft charter might be given effect.

"It is government policy to retain TVNZ in state ownership and for it to operate according to a charter which will indicate what's expected of it," she said. "In fulfilling its charter it's important that TVNZ be allowed to operate flexibly.

"I have no intention of programming TVNZ. So long as TVNZ meets the terms of its charter, it should be free to decide how it does so.

"This will also ensure that TVNZ's editorial and creative independence is protected from political interference.

"The draft charter is a statement of objectives. It sets out in broad terms the kind of broadcast content TVNZ is to feature and aspects of the way it is to go about providing such content, such as by being innovative and using the talents of the broadcasting industry."

The draft Charter is attached.
