Tourism continues to be a major contributor to growth in the New Zealand economy, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said today.

"There were more than 117,000 international visitor arrivals in August, an increase of 13 percent over August 1999.

"The additional visitors contributed an estimated additional $38 million to the New Zealand economy. They've come to New Zealand from around the globe – every market produced solid growth.

"Visitor arrival numbers have been at record levels every month this year. In the last 12 months, 1.73 million visitors have arrived in New Zealand – the highest number ever.

"These encouraging figures come in a week when the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group has met for the first time," Mark Burton said.

"The nine members have been asked to consult widely and develop a tourism strategy that will take New Zealand through to 2010 and beyond.

"This Government is committed to working jointly with the tourism industry to manage the continued growth in the sector.

"We must consider and balance the demands of tourists, the needs of the industry, the views of the general public and the role of the government.

"The overall aim is to encourage the sustainable development of the tourism industry – economically, environmentally, culturally and socially," Mark Burton said.
