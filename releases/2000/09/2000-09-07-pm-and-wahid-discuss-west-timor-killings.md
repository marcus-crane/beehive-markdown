The Prime Minister Helen Clark today met with the Indonesian President Mr Wahid and raised with him New Zealand’s serious concern about the latest murders by pro-integrationist militia in Indonesia.

Helen Clark said that she again expressed New Zealand’s concern that Indonesia should act to disband the militia, close the refuge camps, and to complete the investigation into the death of Private Manning.

"Mr Wahid responded by saying that Indonesia intended to send two extra battalions to East Timor to improve law enforcement.

"He said that Indonesia wanted the camps closed and was working on a programme for dispersal of the people living in them. He also indicated that he wanted to see the murderers of Private Manning brought to justice.

“Indonesia has been severely embarrassed by the latest murderous acts of the militia, especially when they have taken place while the President is at the Millennium Summit of United Nations in New York with most other world leaders.

"The Secretary General of the United Nations made a particular point of highlighting the seriousness of the issues when he addressed the General Assembly in New York today.

“It is vital that Indonesia act now to curb the violence on the West Timor border. Both the stability of Indonesia itself and the future of East Timor are dependent on Indonesia having control over law and order within its borders,” Helen Clark said.
