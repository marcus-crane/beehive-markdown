Horowhenua's successful One More Worker scheme exemplifies the type of grass-roots employment initiatives the Government wants to promote, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey re-launched the programme at an Otaki Beach ceremony this afternoon. The One More Worker programme, which was operated by Enterprise Horowhenua in partnership with the Department of Work and Income (DWI) during 1999, challenged employers in the Kapiti and Horowhenua districts to take on an additional employee. Mr Maharey an evaluation of the scheme, released today by DWI, showed that the scheme had created 126 new positions over its nine-month life and was now being replicated in other towns and cities across New Zealand.

"Growing the number of jobs in local communities is a central plank of the Government's strategy to revitalise regional economies.

"I am delighted that DWI's evaluation of the One More Worker scheme has proved what many have know for some time – that the programme has been an outstanding success.

"On the strength of the results achieved the Horowhenua Local Employment Co-ordination Group and DWI have decided to continue One More Worker into this financial year and it is spreading to other regions as well. Programmes will open in Taranaki and Wellington this year and Waitakere, Pukekohe and the Bay of Plenty regions are considering its potential in their communities.

"The simple message that One More Worker promotes is that local partnerships and community ownership of employment creation, with the active assistance of Government, creates real jobs," Steve Maharey said.
