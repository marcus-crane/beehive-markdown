Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Canterbury Police for achieving a drop in recorded crime.

The latest National Crime Statistics for the period of 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Canterbury Police District achieved a 3.5% drop in the number of recorded crimes.

"That equates to 2055 fewer crimes recorded than for the previous 12 month period," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

In summary, the National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Canterbury Police District has achieved:  
· 3.5% drop for all recorded crime  
· 2055 fewer crimes recorded in the Canterbury Police District.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to aid Police in their fight against crime.

Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate Canterbury Police for this drop in recorded crime," George Hawkins said.
