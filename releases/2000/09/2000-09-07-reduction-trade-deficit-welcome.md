The continued steady reduction in the trade deficit was welcomed today by acting  
Finance Minister Trevor Mallard.

Mr Mallard was commenting on the release of the overseas merchandise trade  
figures for July.

"The exports trend has been rising faster than the imports trend for eleven  
months now. This should take pressure off the current account deficit," Mr  
Mallard said.

"I particularly welcome the correction in today's data of the $180 million error  
in the exports early estimate published last month.

"The corrected figure, although it still shows a modest deficit, is a huge  
improvement on what commentators had been expecting," Mr Mallard said.
