A New Zealand scientist from the Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR) is overseeing the drug testing programme for the Sydney Olympics.

ESR scientist and drug testing specialist Sue Nolan will join a World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) independent observer group during the Olympics. WADA, whose vice-chairman is Wellington barrister David Howman, will oversee the entire drug testing process.

Mrs Nolan worked in the International Olympic Committee accredited laboratory at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988 and has provided advice to the New Zealand Sports Drug Agency for many years. In Sydney she will be observing work in the laboratory and at collection bases, and providing technical and scientific advice.

"Mrs Nolan's inclusion in the observer group recognises that New Zealand's scientists are world-class," said Minister for Crown Research Institutes Pete Hodgson. "Her involvement is a particular tribute to the quality of the science and scientists at ESR."

ESR is the leading provider of forensic science services to the NZ Police and undertakes drug testing to international standards for private clients and the Department of Corrections.

WADA is a new organisation independent of SOCOG (Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games), the IOC (International Olympic Committee) Medical Commission and IOC-accredited laboratories, including the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory. It will report to the IOC at the conclusion of the Olympics and will be represented at Medical Commission hearings involving athletes returning positive drugs tests.
