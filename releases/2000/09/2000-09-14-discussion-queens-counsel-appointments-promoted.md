The Attorney-General, Margaret Wilson has issued a discussion paper about the future of Queen's Counsel in New Zealand.

The paper also raises issues about the selection process for QCs, powers of appointment and eligibility criteria.

"I want to emphasise that the government has no preconceived ideas on any of these matters. The paper is intended to promote discussion and debate among the legal profession and the public. Because of this it begins with the most basic question: should the rank of QC be continued?" said Ms Wilson.

Queen's Counsel are senior and respected barristers and are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Attorney-General and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice. They do the same work, under the same rules as other barristers. But they cannot be members of a firm, and usually only barristers are appointed to "silk" – the common legal term for Queen's Counsel.

QCs have been appointed in New Zealand since 1907 and the system for their appointment has remained largely the same since 1915.

Because of the discussion being promoted by Ms Wilson, the appointment round for 2001 will be deferred. Submissions on the discussion paper close at the end of October.

"I'm especially interested in hearing the response of the business community. Business advocacy makes up a substantial part of the work of senior lawyers - both QCs and others - and it is important that the business voice is heard".
