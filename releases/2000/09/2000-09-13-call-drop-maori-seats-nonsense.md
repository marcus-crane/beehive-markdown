The Minister of Maori Affairs said Winston Peter's call for the removal of the Maori seats is sheer nonsense.

The Hon Parekura Horomia said the call is also extremely hypocritical.

"The Maori seats were okay for Winston, when his party was the junior coalition partner based on their hold on the five seats. But now that Winston's lost the seats, he's calling for their removal."

Mr Horomia said Maori representation in Parliament should reflect the Maori proportion of the total population.

The Minister said Labour has always had a special relationship with the Maori seats and is committed to increasing the number of Maori enrolled to vote.

"For me it is important for Maori to be on the electoral roll and that they are having a say about the government of this country."

"For some Maori, it is very important to be on the Maori roll. For others, its not. But it is most important for them to be there".
