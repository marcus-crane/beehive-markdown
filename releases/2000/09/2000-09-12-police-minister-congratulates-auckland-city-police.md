Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Auckland City Police for achieving an increase in the number of resolved burglary crimes.

Auckland City Police District has achieved a burglary resolution rate of 12.1% for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000. That compares to a 7.8% resolution rate for burglaries for the previous 12 month period.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Auckland City Police District has achieved:  
· 35.1% resolution rate for all recorded crimes, up from 31.7% for the previous 12 month period  
· 3.4% increase in the number of crimes resolved  
· 239 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 2.5% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 12.1% burglary resolution rate up from 7.8% for the previous 12 month period.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools. Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate Auckland City Police for this result and encourage them to further develop programmes that reduce the incidence of crime in Auckland City," George Hawkins said.
