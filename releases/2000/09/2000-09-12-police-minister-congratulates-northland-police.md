Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Northland Police for achieving a 12.7% reduction in recorded burglaries.

Northland Police District has also performed in resolving 19.2% of all burglaries recorded between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.

Northland Police have also resolved 51.5% of all recorded crimes, the highest of all districts nationwide.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. Northland Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Northland Police District has achieved:  
· 3.5% decrease in recorded crime  
· 592 fewer recorded crimes  
· 51.5% resolution rate  
· 3.9% increase in the number of crimes resolved  
· 832 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 12.7% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 19.2% burglary resolution rate up from 18.2 for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools.

Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But Northland has much to offer in displaying how to design crime-fighting-measures that meet a community's need.

"I congratulate Northland Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
