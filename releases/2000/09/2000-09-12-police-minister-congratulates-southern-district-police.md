Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Southern District Police for achieving a 8.8% reduction in recorded crime between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.

That means 3012 fewer crimes recorded in the Southern Police District than for the previous 12 month period.

Southern District Police have also achieved a 10.8% reduction in the number of recorded burglaries.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged," George Hawkins said.

Southern District Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Southern Police District has achieved:  
· 42.9% resolution rate for all recorded crime  
· 8.8% reduction in recorded crime  
· 3012 fewer recorded crimes for the 12 month period  
· 10.8% reduction in the number of recorded burglaries  
· 18.1% resolution rate for burglary crimes.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But Southern District Police have much to offer in displaying how to design crime-fighting and crime-solving measures that meet a community's need," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes. Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate Southern District Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
