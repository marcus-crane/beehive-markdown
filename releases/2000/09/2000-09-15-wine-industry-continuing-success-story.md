, and said it reflected the important contribution the wine industry was making to the export and tourism sectors and to regional development.

Helen Clark is in Marlborough today to officially open the Montana Brancott Winery Visitor Centre at its Riverlands winery, near Blenheim.

"The wine industry has expanded its exports from $18 million to $145.3 million in a decade. This growth is testament to the wine industry's innovation and vision.

"Marlborough's reputation as one of the world's most exciting young wine regions can only be enhanced by the new visitor facility at Montana Brancott Winery.

"It is an exciting venture for wine tourism, the potential of which is increasingly being recognised.

"The 100,000-plus visitors expected at the winery this year will get added value as a result of the multi-million dollar upgrade, which includes a restaurant, a new retail store, tasting rooms and a wine education facility.

"The facility will strengthen the company's image with both domestic and international visitors and is a further vote of confidence in New Zealand's burgeoning viticulture industry," Helen Clark said.
