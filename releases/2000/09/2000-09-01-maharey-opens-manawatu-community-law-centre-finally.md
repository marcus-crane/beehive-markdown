Local MP Steve Maharey offically opened Palmerston North's long-awaited Community Law Centre this afternoon.

The Manawatu Community Law Centre joins 25 similar centres across New Zealand offering free first step legal advice to low income people. Plans to establish a centre in Palmerston North have been discussed amongst local community workers for over a decade and led in to the formation of a working group in 1992.

The centre began operating last November and was formally opened with a ceremony at the Rangitane Pavilion this afternoon. Mr Maharey said he had assisted the working group over the past decade and he was delighted that the community law centre was finally up and running in Palmerston North.

"Access to legal advice is a basic right in our society. The need for a law centre in the Manawatu has been identified by those working in our community for many years.

"The support and efforts of local people was essential in getting the Law Centre up and running and today's official opening is a fitting time to acknowledge the energy many people in our community have put into this service. The volunteer caseworkers who will provide the free advice service deserve our recognition and thanks as well.

"I congratulate Trust chairperson Heather Allan and the other trustees today as the centre opens and I wish them well for the future of this service which I know many in our city will use," Steve Maharey said.
