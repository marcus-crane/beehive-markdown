Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins suggests Brian Neeson, National's police spokesperson, should resign.

"Today the sky fell in on Mr Neeson on realising Police Statistics show how this Labour/Alliance Government's policies are working.

"In true Brian Neeson style he became a sore loser," George Hawkins said.

"In six months this Government's policies have delivered results. The burglary resolution rate climbed from 11.1% on December 31 1999, to 14.3% for the year ending 30 June 2000. That fantastic result of 14.3% is the best resolution rate for burglary since like records began in 1988," George Hawkins said.

Recorded burglary also reduced by 8.5% on the previous year: "That means 6685 fewer burglaries recorded than for the previous 12 months.

"The Insurance Council chief executive today supported policies of early detection of burglary, of repeat offending and rehabilitation, while Mr Neeson whined away.

"Mr Neeson needs to wake up to sound opinion or walk," George Hawkins said.

"Imagine the dilemma for Mr Neeson on realising that in six months I have delivered on a key public pledge: that is to crack down on burglary crime.

"Faced with a panic, he resorted to his customary septic sarcasm and suggested my support for Police and Government policy is some sort of crime! That is unacceptable behaviour," George Hawkins said.

"It is a fact that this Government's policies are designed to aid Police to meet community expectation, to reduce crime, to resolve more crime, and crack down on criminals. It is also a fact that our policies are working.

"If Mr Neeson cannot stomach this, perhaps he should consider some form of acute therapy before he destroys the miserable shred of professionalism offered by his predecessors.

"Really, if Mr Neeson wont jump, Jenny Shipley should give him the sack," George Hawkins said.
