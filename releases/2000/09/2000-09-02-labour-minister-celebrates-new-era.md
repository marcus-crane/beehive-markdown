The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson will this morning take part in three Auckland events promoting productive relationships between employers, managers, employees and unions.

The new Employment Relations Act comes into effect today, ending "contracts" in employment and promoting good faith and agreement.

Ms Wilson will begin the day at a breakfast celebrating the partnership agreement between the Manukau City Council and its staff, represented by the PSA.

Then the Minister will be present at the signing of the first multi-employer collective agreement under the new law. The new MECA negotiated with the Emgineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union covers employers in the plastics industry and underpins an effective trade training programme.

Later in the Morning Ms Wilson will launch Worksafe week, in which employers and employees are uged to take responsibility for safety with the theme 'A Safe Workplace is no Accident'.

The new employment law

\* promotes collective bargaining

\* respects individual choice on collective agrements and unionis

\* requires good faith to underpin workplace relationships

\* reduces the need for legal intervention in disputes

\* establishes a new mediation service

\* does NOT allow compulsory arbitration of wage disputes, compulsory unionism or national awards

"I have been involved in employment relationship policy and advocacy all my working life," said Ms Wilson. "I have been a unionist, an employer and a legal advocate. My aim has always been a law which will work in practical ways to support productive relationships. I always expected a vigorous and determined campaign against this legislation by some employers. In return, a strong and disciplined campaign in support of the new law was waged by employees and their representatives.

"Now that the campaign is over we will see the benefits of the new laws. The successful agreement between employer and employee representatives on a code of good faith is a good sign for the future.

"And the sort of practical agreements represented by Manukau City's partnership with the PSA, the new plastics industry MECA and the on-going cooperation on safety are symbols of the improvements we can expect to benefit New Zealand in the years ahead," said Ms Wilson.
