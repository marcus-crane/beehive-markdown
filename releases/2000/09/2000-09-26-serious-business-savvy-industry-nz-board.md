The new board of Industry New Zealand brings serious business savvy to the oversight of the Government's Partnership for Growth programmes, says Associate Minister for Economic Development Pete Hodgson.

Mr Hodgson said the board, announced by Minister for Economic Development Jim Anderton today, would bring hands-on business development skills to the assessment of Industry New Zealand's business development initiatives.

"Rigorous monitoring and evaluation are crucial to the success of our business growth policies," Mr Hodgson said. "The board of Industry New Zealand is stacked with business expertise to help us identify what works and what doesn't."

"It is encouraging to see prominent and successful business people prepared to invest valuable time in Industry New Zealand. Like the Science and Innovation Advisory Council, the board is an example of the kind of partnership between Government and business that will help us create the growth and jobs New Zealand needs."

The board members are: Craig Boyce, Smiths City Group (interim chair), Shane Jones, Poutama Trust and Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission; Don Riesterer, Mayor of Opotiki; Bridget Wickham, the Great New Zealand Business Venture; Maxine Simmons, Immuno-Chemical Products and FoRST; Gregory Fortuin, AXA Corporate Superannuation Services; David Maloney, Interlock Group and Manufacturers Federation; Rex Jones, former secretary of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union.
