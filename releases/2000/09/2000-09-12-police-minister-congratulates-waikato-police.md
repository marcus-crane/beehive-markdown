Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Waikato Police for achieving a 12.1% reduction in recorded crime.

Waikato Police District has achieved the highest percentage reduction in the number of crimes committed from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 compared to any other district nationwide.

George Hawkins met with Waikato Police in Hamilton today to personally offer his congratulations.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. Waikato Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for this district. They are achieving results," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Waikato Police District has achieved:  
· 12.1% decrease in recorded crime  
· 4785 fewer recorded crimes  
· 40.4% resolution rate  
· 2.4% increase in the number of crimes resolved  
· 832 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 11.8% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 21.8% burglary resolution rate up from 13.2 for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But Waikato has much to offer in displaying how to design crime-fighting-measures that meet a community's need. I congratulate Waikato Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
