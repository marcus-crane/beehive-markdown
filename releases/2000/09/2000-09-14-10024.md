The Minister Responsible for the National Library, Marian Hobbs, has welcomed new plans for the reorganisation of the Library following an internal review of staffing requirements.

She asked for the review after legal action over proposed restructuring was withdrawn in March.

The Library will have four key business areas: its three main centres of collection and services – the Alexander Turnbull Library, Collection Services and School Services – and Te Puna, the Library’s online information access system.

"The reorganisation announced to staff today by the National Library's Chief Executive, Christopher Blake, will see the Alexander Turnbull Library positioned to fulfil its role as a world class research library and meeting the information needs of all New Zealanders," Marian Hobbs said.

The National Library Act will now be reviewed to ensure it meets the requirements of a modern library and the needs of two libraries in one – the National and the Turnbull, Marian Hobbs said.

"The review will consider the role and position of the Alexander Turnbull Library within the National Library, the provisions for legal deposit - publishers’ legal obligation to provide copies of new publications to the National Library - and the Library’s responsiveness to the Treaty of Waitangi," she added. "There will be public consultation."
