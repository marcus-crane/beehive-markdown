Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Bay of Plenty Police for achieving a 15.2% reduction in recorded burglaries between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.

That means 1095 fewer burglaries in the Bay of Plenty than for the previous 12 month period.

Bay of Plenty Police have also increased the percentage of resolved burglaries from 12.3% in 1998/1999 period to 15.8% for the year ending 30 June 2000.

Bay of Plenty Police have also had a 11.9% drop in recorded crime and resolved 40.5% of all recorded crimes.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. Bay of Plenty Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Bay of Plenty Police District has achieved:  
· 40.5% resolution rate for all recorded crime  
· 11.9% reduction in recorded crime  
· 1095 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 15.2% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 15.8% burglary resolution rate up from 12.3% for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But Bay of Plenty has much to offer in displaying how to design crime-fighting-measures that meet a community's need. One would expect that resolved burglaries will continue to increase," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools. Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate Bay of Plenty Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
