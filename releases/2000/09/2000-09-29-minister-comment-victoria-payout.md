State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today said he is pleased that Victoria University has disclosed a payment made to its former vice chancellor.

"I regret that the University put itself in the position to make such a payment," Trevor Mallard said.

"This disclosure should serve as a clear warning to all state funded employers that this Government will not support secrecy when it comes to this type of payment. Secret golden handshakes were common under employment contracts negotiated during the time of the National Party. This Government is determined to stamp out both the practice of golden handshakes and the secrecy surrounding those in old contracts.

"I am in favour of openness and therefore am pleased that the nature of this payment is now in the public arena.

"It is a reminder about the care organisations should take when making appointments.

"Thorough checking of credentials is important. So is use of mechanisms like probationary periods, so both employer and employee are comfortable with the employment relationship before it becomes set in stone," Trevor Mallard said.
