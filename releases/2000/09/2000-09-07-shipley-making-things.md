Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that Mrs Shipley’s claim that she had attacked Australia on its handling of indigenous people is simply bizarre.

“Once again, Jenny Shipley is making things up.

“I have made it very clear when questioned by news media from both New Zealand and Australia that the manner of Australia’s interaction with the UN is entirely for Australia to decide. Australia has made a tremendous contribution to the UN for many years and will undoubtedly do so in the future.

“Mrs Shipley’s utter failure as Leader of the Opposition seems to be leading her down the path followed by Richard Prebble of endeavouring to inflame race relations issues. She would be better directed to attend to her own party’s woeful lack of policy on almost any subject of public interest," Helen Clark said.
