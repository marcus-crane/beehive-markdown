Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated North Shore/Waitakere Police for achieving a 17.8% reduction in recorded burglaries between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.

North Shore/Waitakere Police have also resolved 42% of all recorded crimes, that's a six percentage point increase over that achieved for the previous 12 month period.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. North Shore/Waitakere Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show North Shore/Waitakere Police District has achieved:  
· 42% resolution rate for all recorded crime  
· 6% increase in the number of crimes resolved  
· 1521 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 17.8% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 11% burglary resolution rate up from 7.4% for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But North Shore/Waitakere has much to offer in displaying how to design crime-fighting-measures that meet a community's need. One would expect that resolved burglaries will continue to increase," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools. Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"I congratulate North Shore/Waitakere Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
