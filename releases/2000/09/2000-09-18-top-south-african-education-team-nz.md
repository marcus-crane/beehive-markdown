One of South Africa’s top educators is leading a three person team visiting New Zealand this week to study our school system.

Florah Lesele is an adviser to the Government on disadvantaged schools and the principal of Ikaneng Primary School in Soweto.

Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Matt Robson says Mrs Lesele is a highly regarded educator who is making a real difference to the lives of children at her school.

“She’s known as a dynamic and innovative principal who has turned a small school in a poor part of Soweto into a centre of excellence,” he says. “I’m delighted that she and her colleagues have been able to come here.”

Ikaneng Primary School receives funding from New Zealand Official Development Assistance – the Government’s aid programme - which is also backing the study tour.

The South African visitors are particularly interested in observing New Zealand schools with experience of issues comparable to those in the new South Africa. These include schools where pupils come from a variety of cultural backgrounds, or where significant numbers of pupils do not speak the main language of education well.

The other members of the South African team are Mrs Lucy Moyane, chief education specialist (African languages) at the national Department of Education and David Matsebatlela, a district acting director for the Department of Education.
