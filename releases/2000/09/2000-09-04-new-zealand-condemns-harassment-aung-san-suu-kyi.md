Foreign Minister Phil Goff today condemned the weekend action by the Myanmar authorities against opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

"Ms Suu Kyi’s forced return to Yangon following nine days of detention at a military roadblock is yet another blatant violation of her political rights," Mr Goff said.

On 24 August Ms Suu Kyi set out by car for a meeting of her National League for Democracy party when she was stopped by security forces of the ruling military regime and forbidden to go farther. Ms Suu Kyi refused to return home immediately and therefore remained at the roadblock till the weekend when she was forcibly returned to Yangon.

"We are deeply concerned that diplomats in Yangon have since been denied contact with her and other leaders of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD).

"The episode is the latest in a sustained campaign of harassment directed at Aung San Suu Kyi, members of the NLD, and other opposition groups by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).

"We call once again on the Myanmar authorities to respect the fundamental right of Opposition groups to freedom of movement and association, to cease political harassment of political opponents, and to enter into substantive dialogue with the NLD as a first step towards democratic rule,” Mr Goff concluded.
