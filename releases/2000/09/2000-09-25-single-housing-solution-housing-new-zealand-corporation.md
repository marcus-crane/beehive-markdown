The Minister of Housing Mark Gosche today announced the name of the new housing organisation that will bring together the various housing and housing policy agencies into a single integrated housing solution.

"Housing New Zealand Corporation will provide a single gateway for state housing access and assistance, housing policy advice and specialist housing solutions including community housing and home ownership," said Mr Gosche.

Housing New Zealand Ltd, the Housing Corporation of New Zealand and Community Housing Ltd will be brought together into one group to form the new integrated organisation. Additionally, the housing policy function currently carried out by the Ministry of Social Policy will become the responsibility of the new entity.

"The new agency, Housing New Zealand Corporation, will be required to give effect to the Crown's social objectives. In doing this it will be required to have regard for the interests of the communities in which it operates, exhibit a sense of environmental responsibility, operate with good financial oversight and stewardship and act as a good employer," he said

Housing New Zealand Corporation will commence operations as an integrated agency on 1 July 2001.

"A single organisation, with a single line of accountability to Ministers, will be better equipped to deliver effective and efficient housing services to low-income New Zealanders and community groups," he said.

Details of the new integrated organisation are being worked through. Steps will be taken to ensure that during this process the interests of staff and stakeholders in the various organisations, including Housing New Zealand Ltd's bond and note holders, are protected.
