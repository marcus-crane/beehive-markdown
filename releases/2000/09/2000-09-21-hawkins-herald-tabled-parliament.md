Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins had his electorate tabloid newspaper, the Hawkins Herald, tabled in the House.

"The Hawkins Herald has become a very popular newspaper indeed," George Hawkins said.

The Hawkins Herald has a circulation of 22,500 and is distributed to households in the Manurewa electorate and other select outlets.

"Today, Hunua National MP Warren Kyd referred to the Hawkins Herald as a resource for information when asking a Parliamentary question. He quoted from an article opposing a prison being built on Wiri Station Road Manukau City.

"I am thrilled that the Hawkins Herald is so widely read and respected that it has become the National Party's focus during Parliament's question time.

"My only regret is that my electorate newspaper's fame and acclaim was assisted by a Twilight Tory. Still, credit where it is due. The man knows a classy publication when he stumbles on one.

"Thank you Warren. Perhaps we can employ you as a publicist after the next election," George Hawkins said.
