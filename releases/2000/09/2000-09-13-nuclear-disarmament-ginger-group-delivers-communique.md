New Zealand and the other "New Agenda" countries will keep up the diplomatic pressure for real progress to be made on nuclear disarmament, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

The seven countries of the New Agenda initiative for nuclear disarmament (Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and New Zealand) have issued a fresh statement of their approach at the United Nations in New York today.

"The New Agenda countries enjoyed considerable diplomatic success at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review conference earlier this year," Mr Goff said. "The New Agenda group became the negotiating partner for the nuclear weapon states as the Conference drew up the 'practical steps' for nuclear disarmament that gained consensus support.

"The unequivocal political undertaking given by the five nuclear weapon States 'to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals' demonstrates a new determination to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.

"Recognition that nuclear weapons cannot be allowed to exist indefinitely was a singular step forward.

"New Agenda countries will be pressing for the implementation of the undertakings made at the conference, and are determined to keep minds focussed on achieving nuclear disarmament.

"This is an area where the movement towards disarmament can easily grind to a halt if the effort doesn't go in, year after year, conference after conference.

"New Zealand has a long history at the forefront of moves to rid the planet of nuclear weapons. On our own we have limited impact. In a group of like-minded and equally determined countries we can and will make a difference."

The Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, South Africa and Sweden met today to issue the communique. New Zealand's Ambassador to the United Nations represented Mr Goff whose travel arrangements did not allow for him to be there in person.
