France's Minister of Agriculture, Jean Glavany, is to visit New Zealand next week, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Glavany will be accompanied by his partner, Karine Hoarau, and officials during the three-day visit.

The French delegation arrive in Auckland on Friday, September 15, and leave Auckland on Sunday, September 17.

During his visit, Mr Glavany is to visit three farms and two vineyards to get an appreciation for New Zealand agriculture. He will also meet representatives of agricultural groups while in Auckland.

Mr Sutton said he was delighted Mr Glavany was to visit New Zealand.

When Mr Sutton visited Paris in May, the two ministers had a frank discussion about the viability of farming without subsidies. Mr Sutton said it would be eye-opening for his French counterpart to meet and talk with ordinary New Zealand farmers who were doing well without government handouts.

"New Zealand agriculture is a shining example to the world of what can be achieved. The contribution of farming to the New Zealand economy has significantly increased since subsidies, including supplementary minimum prices, were abolished in the mid-1980s."
