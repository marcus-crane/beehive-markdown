The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has welcomed the appointment of Mike Noon as the Director of the Office of Tourism and Sport (OTSp).

Mike Noon has been the Marketing and Events Manager with OTSp since August 1998. He replaces the previous Director, Scott Morrison, who resigned in May.

"Mike has a proven track record, a broad network of contacts and well recognised skills in event management," Mark Burton said.

The Office of Tourism and Sport is a specialist semi-autonomous policy advice unit, which on the 1st of July was moved from the Department of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Economic Development.

"The Government understands the crucial role that tourism plays in the New Zealand economy. This move was to ensure that tourism would indeed be one of the drivers of economic development.

"Mike Noon's appointment as Director of OTSp will ensure that there is continuity in the important work the office has been doing on behalf of the Government," Mark Burton said.
