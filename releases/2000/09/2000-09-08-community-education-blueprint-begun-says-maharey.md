The Government has begun developing a blueprint to guide the future development of adult education and community learning in New Zealand, Palmerston North MP Steve Maharey said today.

Steve Maharey was speaking to the Manawatu branch of the Adult and Community Education Association in Palmerston North this afternoon to mark Adult Learners' Week He Tangata Matauranga and United Nations International Literacy Day. A new 12-member working made up of experts from the adult education and community learning community has recently been appointed to advise the Government on formal recognition and resourcing of the sector.

"Adult learning and community education facilities in our country are vital and yet previous Governments have failed to provide adequate recognition and resources.

"We simply must ensure that we support community-based learning centres because they offer many New Zealanders the chance to improve their basic skill levels and to participate in society.

"The importance that the Government attaches to the sector is demonstrated by the appointment of an expert Working Group on Adult Education and Community Learning by Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel.

"The working group will help us to develop a new framework for the future of adult education and community learning in this country.

"The Government provided an additional $8 million over four years in the Budget for adult education and community learning initiatives. The challenge for us now is to harness the expertise of the working group to help us get the sector on to a sustainable long-term footing," Steve Maharey said.
