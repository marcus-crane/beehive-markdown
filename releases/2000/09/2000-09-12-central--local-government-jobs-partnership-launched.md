A groundbreaking agreement detailing how effective job creation partnerships between central and local government will be structured was launched at Parliament this evening by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

The formal memorandum of understanding reached with the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs fleshes out the Government's commitment to work in partnership with local communities to tackle unemployment. The Taskforce, which was established in April, brings together 21 Mayors from across New Zealand to provide a national focus of leadership on the jobs issue. The Ministers said the Government shared to Mayors' commitment to end the wastage of people caused by unemployment.

"The agreement we are launching today is historic because for the first time the Government is committing to an active partnership with local government which recognises the expertise both parties have in employment creation.

"We accept that growing jobs is something that central government cannot do on its own. Unlike our predecessor this Government is prepared to involve all the key partners – business, labour and central and local government – in employment creation.

"Employment is central to the development of strong and healthy local communities and to ensuring that New Zealanders are able to participate in their society.

"As part of this agreement we have agreed to meet quarterly with the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs to review our joint progress towards ending unemployment. We are pleased that the Memorandum of Understanding will now cement in what has become a close and constructive relationship with the Taskforce," the Ministers said.
