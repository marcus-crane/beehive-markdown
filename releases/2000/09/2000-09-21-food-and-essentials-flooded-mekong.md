New Zealand is donating NZ$100,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross appeal for the Mekong Basin, including Vietnam and Cambodia, following severe flooding in South East Asia, Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Matt Robson announced today.

"Millions of people in South East Asia are being affected by this year's unusually widespread monsoon floods. The New Zealand grant will assist the Red Cross in providing much needed humanitarian relief to those most affected in Vietnam and Cambodia" the Minister said.

The grant, from New Zealand’s official development assistance emergency and disaster relief allocation, will be used to purchase emergency food and household supplies.
