Mr Speaker, I move that the Apprenticeship Training Bill be now read a first time.

Following the first reading, I will move that the Bill be referred to the Education and Science Committee.

The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislation for the Modern Apprenticeships programme. Modern Apprenticeships is a new work-based vocational education and training initiative that aims to encourage, and help, young people take up and complete apprenticeship training.

As the name suggests, it combines the best aspects of the traditional apprenticeship system with additional features to assist more of our young people gain access to employment-based training. Modern apprenticeships is about extending this form of vocational education and training into a wide range of industries, including for new high technology areas of industry, and the service sector.

Why is this Bill needed? Why should this Government legislate to facilitate an increase in the number of young people receiving and completing apprenticeship training? The answer to this lies in the fact although New Zealand’s had a proud history of apprenticeships for young people, in recent times the system has fallen into a state of some disrepair.

There was and is much to like about the Industry Training Act of 1992, but the architects of that Act made a serious error of judgement in dispensing with the notion of apprenticeship. While some industries have attempted to retain apprenticeship style training, many employers, education and training providers, parent and young people have the perception that apprenticeships have disappeared altogether.

Currently, the number of trainees enrolled in what approximates apprenticeship style training is roughly the same as it was in the 1980s. However, in comparison with the 1980s, young people now are no longer the predominant group receiving this form of training. Right now only 10% of our trainees are under 20 years of age. Over half are 25 years of age or older, and nearly 20% are over 40 years of age.

Under our present arrangements employers tend to involve older, experienced people in work based vocational education and training.

However, Mr Speaker, in comparison with our older workers, it is our young people who will be required to live and work in an economy that is more complex, more changing, and more uncertain than most in this House will ever have experience of. Succeeding in such an environment depends on being as skilled and as adaptable as possible.

Modern Apprenticeships, by giving our young people better access to high quality workplace learning, increases their chance of having a secure and prosperous future. Modern apprenticeships reflects this Government’s determination not to sit back and allow a significant segment of our young people drift into long term unemployment or a low-skilled future.

Modern Apprenticeships are consistent with, and will be a key contributor towards key Government goals including growing an inclusive, innovative economy for the benefit of all; improving New Zealanders skills; and closing the gaps.

So how do Modern Apprenticeships differ from traditional apprenticeships?

The key feature of the new programme is that there will be ‘apprenticeship co-ordinators’ who will facilitate and support apprenticeship training. Young people will not only receive training but also encouragement and support for that training. Employers will have the administrative responsibilities associated with taking on an apprentice largely picked up by the apprenticeship co-ordinator.

The ‘co-ordinators’ will act as a link between employers and potential apprentices. They will assist employers in the recruitment of apprentices and will have the responsibility of seeing that apprentices successfully complete their training.

Each young person on the programme will have an individual training plan. This training plan will include acquiring a range of specific and generic skills. Generic skills in particular are the ones that will be increasingly needed for success in the rapidly changing, globalised work environment.

The ‘apprentice co-ordinators’ will be chosen from industry training organisations, polytechnics, private training establishments, Maori organisations and community groups.

It is through this mentoring, or ‘co-ordinator’ function, that the costs and risks to employers of training young apprentices will be reduced, and the number of young people gaining access to apprenticeships increased.

The mentoring function will also create opportunities for enhancements to current industry training arrangements, which will result in better support at the local level for employers and apprentices.

It is envisaged that some apprenticeship co-ordinators will assume the role of the employer through a group training arrangement, with apprentices placed with individual employers according to the needs of trainees, and the capacity of those employers.  
Modern Apprenticeships will be in new high technology areas as well as in the traditional trades.

Another difference is that instead of being time-served, training will be standards-based and linked to the National Qualifications Framework. That is, when apprentices reach the required competence they will receive industry-recognised, nationwide certification. In this way Modern Apprenticeships will be a high prestige training option which many young New Zealanders will aspire to.

Although there are key differences, I want to make it clear that Modern Apprenticeships will complement, not replace, existing industry and other tertiary education pathways.

In terms of legislative design this Bill has little in common with the Apprenticeship Act 1983. That Act was prescriptive, this Bill is enabling, and subject to its objectives being met, will allow for an array of approaches to the delivery of Modern Apprenticeships.

The Bill clearly set out the rights and obligations of employers, co-ordinators and apprentices. The Bill also clarifies that Skill New Zealand will administer Modern Apprenticeships.

The Bill provides that the Minister may issue a code of practice. The purpose of the code is to offer guidance about the responsibilities relating to apprenticeship training of coordinators, employers and apprentices. The code will operate as a guideline for all parties to help ensure modern apprenticeships operate in the interests of all concerned.

The Bill forms part of a wider package of measures designed to ensure that we have a good transition from school to post compulsory options, including tertiary education, vocational education and training, and/or employment. The Government has already announced Gateway pilots designed to build pathways from school to work based education and training.

Finally Mr Speaker I wish to draw attention to the fact that Modern Apprenticeships have received a great deal of support from employers, from unions, from Industry Training Organisations, from Polytechnics, from other providers, and from a range of community groups. This policy was canvassed with a range of stakeholders before the election, and it has been the subject of close consultation with those same stakeholders since the election. Let me mention in particular the important contributions of the Employers Federation, the NZ Council of Trade Unions, the Industry Training Federation, and the Association of Polytechnics in New Zealand.

As a matter of principle that is this Government's preferred method of policymaking. It also enables us to produce good public policy – policy that will have buy-in at the outset, and that will produce the kinds of outcomes the Government is looking for.

It is this level of support that confirms this Government’s belief that this initiative is long overdue. That it is essential if there is a well-structured, vocational pathway for young people wishing to learn on the job. It is essential if we are to fully realise the productive potential of our industry base, and the potential of those moving into the labour force.

The Government is aiming to have 3,000 modern apprentices in training after the programme goes nationwide next year. The piloting of the programme has already started and I am happy to assist the Committee in making arrangements for officials to report to them on progress with the pilots.

I am personally looking forward to the contribution Modern Apprenticeships will make in developing the skills of our young people and the knowledge base of our country.

Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House.
