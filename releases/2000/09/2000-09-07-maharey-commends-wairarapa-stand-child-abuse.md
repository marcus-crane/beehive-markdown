Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today commended the Wairarapa community for uniting against child abuse.

Mr Maharey made his comments during a meeting with Wairarapa community and voluntary sector organisations in Carterton this afternoon. Around 500 Wairarapa residents attended a rally in the town on Sunday to express their concern at the incidence of child abuse. Mr Maharey said that it was important that all New Zealanders are willing to speak out in support of the welfare children.

"All New Zealanders must take responsibility for addressing child abuse in our communities. We must not allow our children – tomorrow's leaders – to have their potential snuffed out by violence.

"The Government is committed to ensuring that the core agencies, like Child, Youth and Family, are rebuilt so that they provide an effective safety net for children at risk. Sadly, there will always probably be the need for Government to provide the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.

"The task we must all take on board is making it clear day-by-day that we will not tolerate violence and abuse by and towards those who we know in our own communities.

"I congratulate the people of the Wairarapa for their commitment to speak out on the issue of child abuse. You have shown leadership in your own community which I encourage other towns and cities across the country to follow.

"The Government in Wellington has heard your message loud and clear. In partnership together we can again make this country a great place to be a child," Steve Maharey said.
