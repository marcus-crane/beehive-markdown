Active involvement of local communities in employment creation is central to the Government's approach to job creation, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey addressed the national conference of staff from the Community Employment Group (CEG) in Auckland this evening. CEG, a service of the Department of Labour, works in nearly 30 local communities across New Zealand (see attachment) creating local opportunities for employment and economic self-sufficiency. The service was transferred from the Department of Work and Income to the Department of Labour earlier this year as part of the Government's strategy to strengthen community employment development capacity.

Mr Maharey paid tribute to the bottom-up approach CEG has adopted to local employment creation.

"Community-based job creation is a central feature of the Government's employment strategy. Significant additional investment was provided in the Budget for the type of grass roots projects which CEG has expertise in facilitating.

"The Government has one simple ambition for CEG – to provide leadership and practical on-the-ground assistance to communities wanting to build their economic and social base.

"CEG is being entrusted with our flagship Community Employment Organisations programme which will begin to roll-out from October.

"Employment is the key tool to close the growing social and economic gaps in our society. The Government has placed job creation squarely at the centre of our programme.

"Taken together with the work of the new Ministry of Economic Development and our partnership with the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs, the strengthening of CEG equips local communities to get seriously into job creation," Steve Maharey said.
