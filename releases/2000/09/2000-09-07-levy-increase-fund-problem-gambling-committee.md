The levy on non-casino gaming machines, which is used to fund problem gambling services, has been increased by 65 percent, the Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton announced today.

The levy per machine has been increased from $83 to $137 (GST inclusive).

The Problem Gambling Committee uses funding from the mandatory levy, together with voluntary contributions from other gaming industry members – the TAB, the casino sector and the Lottery Grants Board - to provide a number of services. These include counselling, a telephone helpline, education and treatment programmes.

The Committee is an independent body with representatives from the gaming industry and problem gambling service providers. It has decided to seek funding of $4 million this year, up from $3.26 million last year.

"The Committee has agreed to a new method of determining the relative funding shares to be provided by its gaming industry members," Mark Burton said.

"This follows research which indicates that more than half of the people seeking treatment for problem gambling cite non-casino gaming machines as their main mode of gambling.

"As a result, the committee members have agreed to increase the contribution of the non-casino gaming machine sector to $2 million for the current financial year.

"The Government has passed the necessary regulations to make the changes possible. The new levy was gazetted today and will apply from October the 1st, which is the date on which gaming machines licences are renewed," Mark Burton said.
