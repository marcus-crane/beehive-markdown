Giant steps are being taken by the new Government to make quality tertiary education more affordable, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey says.

Mr Maharey addressed the New Zealand University Students' Association conference at Otago University this morning, becoming the first education minister to do so in seven years. New Zealand's tertiary system is on the verge of fees freeze in 2001, with every public institution agreeing to freeze their fees and compulsory charges next year. This ends a decade of fee rises which have seen average fees rise 180% (from a standard fee of $1,250 in 1990, to an average of over $3,500 this year).

"The Government has begun the process of turning around the massive increases in fees that students have been hit with over the 1990s. Coupled with the abolition of interest on loans while students are studying, this Government has made real inroads into improving access to tertiary education as we promised before the election."

An additional $664 million is being invested in tertiary education over the next four years. Mr Maharey said the Government was now moving to address quality issues and to provide strategic leadership for the future development of the tertiary sector.

"In coming budgets we intend to keep costs down and to address quality issues and the shape of our tertiary system. It is critical that students get access to good quality, modern and relevant qualifications that equip them for life in this century.

"We promised students we would be the Government of constant improvement. Nine months into our first term in office students can see we are keeping our word," Steve Maharey said.
