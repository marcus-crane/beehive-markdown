Prime Minister Helen Clark said in response to allegations made by Peter Dunne:

"Peter Dunne's allegation is constructed on misinformation.

"I did not tell the Evening Post that I had not met Dr Lexchin. The Evening Post spoke to a press secretary in my office. Either the Evening Post misconstrued what my press secretary said, or the press secretary did not make himself clear.

"After seeing the report, I spoke to the Evening Post's political editor, Brent Edwards, to clarify the matter.

"Dr Lexchin is a professional colleague of my husband. Over the past 15 years or so, I have met him socially and briefly on some three occasions.

"I took no part whatsoever in the decision of the Health Funding Authority to appoint Dr Lexchin, as the Minister of Health would confirm."
