Credit Unions have played an important part in New Zealand's financial landscape. They developed from not for profit credit cooperatives in 19th Century England, to a people's bank in Germany to provide credit to impoverished farmers, to the organisations we have today.

New Zealand has 98 credit unions which together have over 180,000 members, total assets of over $400 million, and annual income of over $46 million. These are organisations that could have a major role to play in New Zealand owned banking alternatives.

Since coming into government nearly a year ago, we have been listening to your requests to raise the deposit limit for credit unions. It became apparent that for some time now you have been campaigning for that credit limit rise and it had been falling on deaf years.

Earlier this year we announced that we would raise the deposit limit for credit unions from $40,000 to $250,000. That move will allow you to increase your potential market share ¡V and it shows we were listening to what you were saying.

The larger unions have welcomed the change as this may help them develop a broader range of financial service products for their members. However, many of the smaller unions will wish to focus on traditional business areas such as offering assistance to low income earners.

For that reason credit unions are able to keep the current $40, 000 limit if that suits them by incorporating it in their rules, but the increase in the deposit limit will enable you to be more responsive to your members.

This move came into effect last month and will go some way to help communities keep their money within their community to work for the community¡¦s benefit.

The increase in the deposit limit will only affect individual credit unions when they adopt a trust deed and appoint an independent trustee under the Securities Act 1978. This must be done by 30 April 2001.

Tax status  
As a result of raising the limit we are also reviewing the tax status of credit unions ¡V I assume this is a move not welcomed by all of you but it is one which we feel is necessary.

Credit unions have been exempt from paying income tax since 1891. No body knows for sure why credit unions were granted that exemption ¡V the question now is whether this gives unions an unfair competitive advantage over other providers of financial services.

An issues paper surveying the background to the taxation of credit unions and seeking feedback on the options for change has been released and is currently available on the websites of the Ministry of Economic Development, Treasury, and Inland Revenue Department.

The key tax review issues we will be considering are:  
ƒá Whether credit unions should be treated in the same manner for tax purposes as other non-profit bodies who make distributions to members.  
ƒá Whether the unions' current exemption leads to a competitive advantage relative to other financial service providers.  
ƒá Whether a minimum threshold should be applied to smaller unions so that they are not subject to income tax. This would have the effect of recognising the unique nature of credit unions.

I encourage your members to take the opportunity to submit their views in this first stage of the review. Those making submissions have until 6 October. Report back on those submissions is due at the beginning of November.

Other issues  
There are a number of other issues facing credit unions at the moment.

Crown financial responsibility  
The NZACU is putting an extensive Trust Deed system in place. The credit union association has asked me if this would mean removing the Crown from the financial responsibility for the credit union industry.

Credit unions used to be exempt from the trust deed requirements of the Securities Act that is the favoured prudential regime for other financial institutions.

Last year the Securities Commission reviewed this position and decided that the credit unions should be subject to the Securities Act.

The exemption notice for credit unions was removed and replaced with a new exemption notice that gives credit unions until April 30th 2001 to sign a trust deed with an independent trustee.

Once credit unions have signed trust deeds, the need for the Crown supervision of credit unions in areas where the Securities Commission and trustees appointed under the trust deeds have a regulatory role will disappear.

A review of the role of Crown supervision once credit unions have signed trust deeds would therefore be appropriate.

The Friendly Societies and Credit Union Act

Credit unions have been waiting for a review of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act since 1982. This is one of the oldest pieces of legislation relating to any industry in the country.

The former Ministry of Commerce started a comprehensive review of credit unions. This review revealed a divergent set of views as to how the legislation governing the industry should be reformed.

The Ministry of Economic Development hopes to progress the review further this year in consultation with interested parties.

Once that review is completed, the Ministry will then seek a legislative priority to make any amendments necessary. Now that the work regarding the deposit limit has been completed the Ministry will be able to pursue this.

Of course one issue always of concern to small to medium sized businesses like credit unions is that of compliance. It's an issue the government takes seriously and we are looking at ways of improving the situation.

Interesting times lie ahead for credit unions in New Zealand. The environment has changed significantly since credit unions came into being some 100 years ago in this country and it is time we looked at the conditions under which they work.

I believe the approaches we are taking will bring credit unions into the new millennium in a form which will see them survive for at least another hundred years.

Thank you for your time ¡V I now look forward to hearing any comments you may have.
