Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Tasman Police for achieving an encouraging increase in the number of resolved burglaries.

The latest National Crime Statistics for the period of 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Tasman Police District resolved 23.4% of all recorded burglaries.

"That is a significant improvement of the 15.5% resolution rate for the previous 12 month period," George Hawkins said.

Tasman Police District also has achieved a 46.6% resolution rate for all recorded crime.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. Tasman Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results particularly in the resolution of burglary crime," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Tasman Police District has achieved:  
· 46.6% resolution rate for all recorded crime  
· 23.4% resolution rate for recorded burglary, up from 15.5% for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to aid Police in their fight against crime.

Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.

"Programmes that reduce crime may differ from district to district. But Tasman has much to offer in displaying how to design crime-resolving-measures.

"I congratulate Tasman Police for this excellent result," George Hawkins said.
