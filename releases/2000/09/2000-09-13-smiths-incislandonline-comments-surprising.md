Smith's INCIS/Landonline comments surprising

Land Information Minister Paul Swain says Nelson MP Nick Smith's comparisons of Landonline to National's disastrous INCIS project are astonishing given it was the National government who initiated both projects.

Nick Smith has said in the media that the Landonline project has the hallmarks of being 'INCIS mark two.'

"Given both systems were established by the former National government, and given the remarkable failure of INCIS under National I am surprised at Nick Smith's criticisms," Paul Swain said

"Landonline (in various early forms) has been mooted for years. Land Information NZ was set up by the National government in July 1996 in anticipation of the project.

"The first business case seeking approval to build the first part of Landonline went to the National Cabinet in November 1997.

"The National Cabinet reassessed the project and eventually approved its continuance on 14 June 1999.

"Unlike Nick Smith's colleagues, this government has actually listened to the concerns expressed about this project. We have continued a Ministerial committee set up under the last government and we are monitoring the project closely.

"That committee is receiving regular reports and has the final say on whether the last stage of Landonline goes ahead.

"I know that Nick Smith has been briefed on the progress of Landonline – and was reminded of his government's role in setting it up.

"While Nick Smith appears to be suffering from a bout of political amnesia – we are not so quick to forget," Paul Swain said.
