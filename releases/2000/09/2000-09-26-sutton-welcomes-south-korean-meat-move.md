Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today that South Korea's decision to abandon a proposal requiring its restaurants to label beef as either domestic or imported was a good one.

"I congratulate the Korean authorities for making this decision and am grateful to them for taking account of New Zealand's views in this way."

South Korea responded formally late last week to a submission made by New Zealand in June, advising that it no longer intended to follow through with new regulations which could have disadvantaged our beef in the Korean market.
