Minister of Corrections, Matt Robson met with South Auckland probation staff this morning.

"It's been invaluable to meet staff in the field. I've gained a clear understanding of the high work-load probation officers have to carry, and the pressure on resources to deal with that," says Matt Robson.

"The probation service is bearing a big burden. It's under-resourced for the job that society requires and I need to keep that fact in front of the government.

In the afternoon Matt Robson attended the graduation of twelve offenders on periodic detention from the He Tete Kura Mana Tangata violence prevention programme.

"I am particularly proud of this programme. It targets violence prevention for Maori offenders using techniques based on Maori cultural values and beliefs. It's our most effective way of reaching these offenders and reducing re-offending," says Matt Robson.

The programme targets offenders serving periodic detention sentences of at least three months.

He Tete Kura Mana Tangata was launched in June this year. The programme was developed over an 18-month period by the Department of Corrections with extensive consultation with iwi groups in Auckland. It's entirely marae-based and participants are involved in marae activities as much as possible. Offenders’ families/whanau also attend some parts of the programme.

The Department will run two more marae-based violence prevention programmes over the coming months – one in Whangarei and the other in Rotorua.
