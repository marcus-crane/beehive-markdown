"Roading papers recently released to local authorities nationwide are part of a series of discussion documents aimed to spark debate about the management of New Zealand's roading systems," Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

"They are clearly marked as such, and as not representing government policy."

Mr Gosche was responding to recent media enquiries.

"Government has made clear its intention to find systems to better manage the roading system, including improving safety and environmental management as well as the public transport system."

"I clearly set out at the Local Government New Zealand conference earlier this year the Government's intention to have a careful and deliberate process of talking to groups about roading problems and possible solutions. These papers are part of that process."

"We have had a series of meetings with local authorities and with other stakeholders up and down the country."

"Central and local government are currently working together on new land transport proposals - these discussions are progressing positively on a no surprises basis."

Mr Gosche rejected any suggestion that the papers indicated a return to road reforms proposals of the previous government.

"Anyone who reads these papers will know this is nonsense. The papers do not propose any of the structural reforms that were at the heart of the Better Transport Better Roads proposals. They do not propose a commercial model. There is not a road company in sight."

"The only similarity is that these papers do look to address the long term problems of how to fund New Zealand's roading network. But that's where any similarity with BTBR begins and ends. This government has made it quite clear BTBR is off the agenda."
