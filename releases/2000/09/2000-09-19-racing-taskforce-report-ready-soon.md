Racing Minister Annette King says the racing Industry taskforce report is nearing completion.

Mrs King established three taskforces, representing racing's northern, central and southern zones, in June to report to her on issues concerning funding, administration and development.

"The taskforces have had an enormous job to work their way through 69 submissions and compile a report that reflects the submissions and regional perspectives.

"It was originally hoped to have the final report ready by mid-September, but it is important to give them more time because of the significance of the report. I am told it will be ready soon."

Ms King added: "I understand and share the industry's enthusiasm to get in the starting gates, but it is vital to have the girth done up and the bridle fitting properly first."
