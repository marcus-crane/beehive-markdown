Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said comments made today by ACT Leader Richard Prebble reek of misinformation.

"Mr Prebble obviously has not read the National Crime Statistics.

"If he had he would know that more homicides, violence crimes, sexual offences, and drug crimes are being solved this year than for the previous 12 month period of when his National Party mates were in power," George Hawkins said.

Mr Prebble said in a media statement that serious crimes are not being solved.

"I think Mr Prebble is being fed jaundiced rubbish from his police spokesperson Ken Shirley.

"If this is how ACT interprets statistical fact then heaven forbid should they ever get their hands on a government portfolio," George Hawkins said.

The facts are shown in black and white for any reasonably minded person to see.

National Crime Statistics show resolutions for homicides are up from 70.2% for the 1998/1999 period to 77.9% resolution for homicides since this Labour/Alliance Government gained power.

"That is progress," George Hawkins said. "And progress has occurred because Police now have a government that insists that law and order be a priority of government spending.

"Contrast this to the National led government, that was propped up by ACT. It planned to cut the Police budget this year by $24 million. This Labour/Alliance Government boosted the Police coffers by $80 million.

"The result of supportive policy speaks for itself," George Hawkins said.
