Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated Wellington Police for achieving a 11.9% reduction in recorded burglaries.

The means 933 fewer burglaries recorded in the Wellington Police District.

Wellington Police District has also performed in resolving 16.2% of all burglaries recorded between 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000. That is up from 9.1% resolution rate for the previous 12 month period.

Wellington Police have also had a 4.5% reduction in the number of recorded crime. That equates to 1976 fewer crimes recorded in the Wellington Police District.

"This excellent achievement ought to be acknowledged. Wellington Police have crime fighting programmes that are designed specially for the district. They are achieving results," George Hawkins said.

Police have also achieved the best nationwide burglary resolution percentage ever, with 14.3% of all recorded burglaries resolved. This is the best result since such record keeping began in 1988.

Police achieved this result in the seven months since this Labour/Alliance Government came to power.

The National Crime Statistics for 1July 1999 to 30 June 2000 show Wellington Police District has achieved:  
· 4.5% decrease in recorded crime  
· 1976 fewer recorded crimes  
· 42.5% resolution rate  
· 933 fewer recorded burglaries  
· 11.9% reduction in recorded burglaries  
· 16.2% burglary resolution rate up from 9.1% for the previous 12 month period.

"This performance demonstrates a Police District that is in touch with its community and knows how to curb the incidence of crime," George Hawkins said.

This year's Budget was designed to aid Police to crack down on all crime, and totalled an extra $80 million compared to the previous financial year.

The Budget resourced Police to target criminal activity, via both reactive and proactive programmes.

Extra resources have been provided to expand the number of Law Enforcement Teams, Intelligence capabilities, and computer assisted crime fighting tools.

Youth At Risk and other crime reduction programmes have been resourced to curb the incidence of recorded crime.
