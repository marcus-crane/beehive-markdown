Health Minister Annette King has told ACT MP Muriel Newman that the medical profession practises medicine to make people healthier.

"I am surprised I have to tell Dr Newman this, but it appears from a written question she sent me she is unsure what the medical profession does."

Mrs King said Dr Newman's question read: "By what process are decisions to provide taxpayers (sic) funded health dollars, for interventions that provide outcomes that would not naturally occur, made?"

Mrs King said she had provided the following written response: "As the object of all health intervention is to provide outcomes that would not naturally occur, it is not reasonable to outline all the decision making processes involved."

The minister said she hoped that clarified the issue for Dr Newman. "Mind you, I am not at all clear what outcome Dr Newman was seeking, although if ACT's past history is anything to go by, it is far more likely to be an unnatural outcome rather than a natural one."
