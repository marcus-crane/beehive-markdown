Minister for Information Technology, Communications and Commerce Paul Swain today launched the programme and website for the government's E-commerce Summit.

"The Summit, to be held in Auckland on the 1st and 2nd November will feature addresses from world authorities on e-commerce including John Sifonis, Don Tapscott and Jim Sterne, all of whom are internationally renowned authors on e-Commerce strategies and sought after practitioners in the field," he said.

"Businesses will also get a look at, and will be asked to feedback on, the government's e-commerce blueprint for New Zealand.

“We want this event to give businesses a practical roadmap for planning their move or next move into e-commerce," Paul Swain said.

"Keynote addresses will focus on how businesses can become net ready, tips for keeping up with the e-commerce revolution and the best and worst of marketing on the Web.

"A variety of workshops will be offered over the two days including very practical ‘How To’ sessions, industry sector workshops, and forums focussing on branding and services and how boost consumer confidence and exploit internet opportunities.

"We expect demand for Summit places to be extremely high and we are encouraging businesses to get in early. With that in mind we have launched an E-commerce Summit website featuring the Summit's full programme and online registration.

"People can see this at www.ecommerce-summit.govt.nz. Those who aren't able to register online can do so by contacting The Conference Company, 09 360 1240," Paul Swain said.
