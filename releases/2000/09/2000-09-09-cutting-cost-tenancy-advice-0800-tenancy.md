All tenants and landlords will have toll-free access to advice on tenancy issues from Monday 12 September, the Minister of Housing Mark Gosche announced today.

‘"Tenants and landlords in rural areas who live far away from Tenancy Services offices will benefit most from being able to get free tenancy advice on the new 0800 TENANCY number," he said.

"The 0800 number can also be called toll free from public telephones."

Tenancy Services provides free information and advice on residential tenancies from 21 offices nationwide. It also offers disputes resolution service when problems arise between tenants and landlords.
