ACT MP Muriel Newman needs be up front about the statistics she uses to promote ACT's agenda, Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

He was responding to a recent release from Dr Newman.

"Dr Newman fails to add that her figures were sales from the previous Government's term that we were obliged to honour."

"Many were home buy purchases that were well down the pipeline."

"We have also acquired 417 new properties - leased and purchased - since being elected."

"Stopping the previous Government's plans to sell off 10,000 state houses is hardly what I would call a mockery of Labour's pledge to halt state house sales," said Mr Gosche.

"Dr Newman conveniently forgets to add in her recent release that the Labour Alliance Government ended the sell-off of state houses - subsequently saving 10,000 homes the previous Government were going to sell off over the next three years," Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

"Under those plans 3,200 state houses would have already been sold by June of this year."

"We have scrapped market rents for state house tenants so that by December all rents will depend on a tenant's income."

"This Government knows that housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of families and that's why we are making sure the people state houses were designed for will once again be able to afford to live in them."
