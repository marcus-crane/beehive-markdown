Government papers relating to the New Zealand case for a Motorola software development centre show the effort and commitment that went into the project, says Associate Minister for Economic Development Pete Hodgson.

The papers, released today under the Official Information Act, show how the New Zealand case was refined and strengthened over more than 18 months.

Motorola ultimately chose an Australian location for the new centre, but continues to investigate business opportunities in New Zealand.

Mr Hodgson said he was pleased with the high quality of the work done by Investment New Zealand, a division of Trade New Zealand, which led the development of the New Zealand case.

The documents show that Motorola commented in May this year that the New Zealand first round offer document was the most professionally prepared and helpful that it received.

The papers also show how the Government responded to Motorola's feedback on the New Zealand offer, and to competition from Australian states, by offering funding to offset the establishment costs of the software centre.

The funding, available over three years, would have been availalble for technology development, training purposes and to offset the costs of recruiting and relocating staff.

Financial details of the package have been deleted from the documents to avoid compromising New Zealand's position in future such negotiations.
