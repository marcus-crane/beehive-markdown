The annual random drug testing figures show the progress in dealing with the prison drug problem, the Minister of Corrections Matt Robson said today.

“In only two years of random inmate drug testing there has been a drop in positive results by 13 percent," said Matt Robson.

"Drugs disrupt prisons and it is heartening to see that the Department is reducing drugs in prisons. But the battle is not over.

"Corrections implemented a comprehensive drug-testing programme in 1998. Positive random drug tests were at 35 percent. In 1999 it fell to 26 percent and in 2000 a 22 percent average was achieved.

"The target for this year was 20 percent, and has only been narrowly missed. This highlights that the strategies to reduce drugs entering and being used in prison are working.”

3564 random tests were carried out from June 1999 to June 2000 and more inmates than ever are being tested.

“Staff commitment to the strategies is highlighted by the Department's introduction of several other initiatives aimed at reducing drug use," said Matt Robson.

Prison visiting

“The new prison visiting system aims to encourage a positive environment for inmates and their families/whanau as family involvement and support is vital in helping inmates address their offending. It also helps minimise the introduction of drugs and other illegal items that visitors bring into prisons.

0800 Jailsafe

"A 0800 Jail Safe number has been set up for inmates, inmate’s families, staff or members of the public so that they can anonymously phone in if they have information relating to the trafficking of drugs into prisons.

“The phone line increases prison safety as often pressure is placed on inmates, staff and their families from both within and outside the prison to bring drugs into prisons.

Alcohol and Drug Treatment

“I was pleased to open the Department's second drug and alcohol treatment unit at Rolleston Prison earlier in the year, and recently a third unit was opened at Ohura Prison. These units follow in the steps of the highly successful Arohata Women’s Prison drug and alcohol unit.

Vehicle checkpoints

“Visitor vehicle checkpoints cut down the amount of drugs brought into prisons by visitors. The Department's five narcotics detection dog teams and crime prevention officers are also working throughout our prisons to stop contraband entering prison premises.

"We are committed to doing everything we can to not only stamp out drugs in prison, but work with inmates to address their drug and alcohol dependency problems," said Matt Robson.
