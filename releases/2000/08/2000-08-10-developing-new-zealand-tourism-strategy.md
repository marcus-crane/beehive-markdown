A governance group has been set up to guide the next phase in the development of a New Zealand Tourism Strategy.

The announcement was made today at the start of the NZ Tourism 2000 Conference in Wellington by the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton and the new chair of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group, Evan Davies.

Mr Davies is also chairman of the Tourism Industry Association (TIA) and Managing Director of SkyCity Ltd.

Mark Burton said that the nine members of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group have been asked to consult widely and develop a Tourism Strategy that will take New Zealand through to 2010 and beyond.

"This Government came into office determined to implement a tourism strategy, building on the work already done on behalf of the industry by TIA.

"We are committed to working jointly with the industry and this governance group has been put together in the spirit of that partnership approach.

"While visitor numbers have grown year after year, and tourism is now New Zealand’s biggest single industry, we have never had a proper strategy to manage the continued growth of the sector, and the implications of that growth.

"The overall strategy will be focused on the sustainable development of the tourism industry – not just economically but environmentally, culturally and socially.

"The Strategy Group must consider and balance the demands of tourists, the needs of the industry, the views of the general public and role of the government.

"It is my hope that the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group will deliver a plan for collaborative, positive action," Mark Burton said.

New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group Chairman Evan Davies said the strategy would design a framework for better business and a basis for more effective partnerships.

"It will concentrate on articulating a vision for tourism and then defining some specific projects based on that. An ultimate aim of the strategy is to help lift and sustain tourism’s competitiveness, performance and contribution to New Zealand as a whole," Mr Davies said.

The Strategy Group members represent central and local government, Maori, and the industry.

The tourism industry is represented by Glenys Coughlan, the Chief Executive of the Tourism Industry Association, and Geoff Burns, Air New Zealand’s Manager of Market Development.

Maori are represented by Dr Ngatata Love, Chief Executive of Te Puni Kokiri and Wally Stone, Managing Director of Whale Watch Kaikoura.

Representing the government will be Neil Plimmer, Acting Director of the Office of Tourism and Sport (to be replaced by the permanent Director, when appointed) and the Chief Executive of Tourism New Zealand, George Hickton.

Representing local government is former President of Local Government New Zealand and former Nelson Mayor Kerry Marshall and the Chief Executive of the Northland regional tourism organisation, Destination Northland, Brian Roberts.

Joint government and industry funding will allow a project team to be formed to work under the guidance of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Group, which is expected to report by March 2001.
