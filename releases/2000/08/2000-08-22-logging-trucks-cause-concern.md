Many logging trucks are still taking too many risks on roads, particularly on corners, according to Auckland Central MP and Associate Minister of Transport Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard said the ongoing problem of logging truck crashes was an urgent issue that the government was adamant needed attention.

She said that the latest figures showed there had been 37 log truck crashes in the last twelve months, and 41 in the previous year.

“That is clearly far too many. We must tackle this problem”.

A Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA ) survey last month showed 94% of logging trucks exceeding their open road speed limit.

“The government is putting log truck drivers on notice: if they put themselves or other road users at risk they will be ticketed for careless or dangerous driving.”

Industry representatives the Road Transport Forum (RTF) and the Logging Truck Safety Council, had been very responsible and were co-operating with the police and the LTSA in their efforts to change driver behaviour.

“The industry representatives are clearly committed to improving safety. But when it comes to individual drivers they are still taking too many risks. The results are horrendous.”

A key issue for logging truck safety was stability. There was a strong relationship between stability and crash risk, Ms Tizard said.

A draft rule currently available for consultation sought to address this issue by setting new stability standards for all heavy vehicles.

Another key issue was the speed at which logging trucks were going around bends.

“A log truck speed survey done by the LTSA in May revealed that many drivers were still not following guidelines on safe cornering speeds. At two of the three survey sites, every log truck exceeded the recommended safe cornering speed by up to 20 km/h.”

Recently the LTSA, the RTF, the Logging Truck Safety Council and police have developed an enforcement plan to get more drivers complying with advisory speed limits on bends.

“This initiative includes a “three strikes and you’re out” policy, where drivers persistently ignoring advisory speeds have their truck stood down from operation for 24 hours. This has already resulted in one operator getting ‘three strikes’” Ms Tizard said.

“With such an initiative the industry has the chance to show it is responsible and serious about addressing the problem. If the self discipline does not improve the situation, then companies could face the possibility of more formalised sanctions.”
