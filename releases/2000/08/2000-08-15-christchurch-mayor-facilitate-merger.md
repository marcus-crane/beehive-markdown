HEALTH Minister Annette King today announced the boards of Healthlink South and Canterbury Health have appointed Christchurch Mayor Garry Moore to provide an independent oversight of their merger.

Canterbury Health and Healthlink South have held a number of meetings involving both directors and management over the past few months. The governance committee comprises a number of directors from both Canterbury Health and Healthlink South.

"I am delighted the boards have appointed Mr Moore to act as an independent facilitator on the governance committee overseeing the merger. The merger process is well under way and is running smoothly, and Mr Moore's involvement will ensure it continues as successfully," Mrs King said.

Both Canterbury Health and Healthlink South operate hospitals throughout Canterbury. Healthlink South has responsibility for mental health and older persons' health at hospitals and community sites throughout the region.

Mrs King said she understood the merger was expected to be completed in October, before the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill was passed into legislation.

"Having a united board means one organisation addressing all health issues in the Canterbury region. That makes sense."
