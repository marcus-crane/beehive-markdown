"The Government acknowledges the right of the Bay of Plenty regional council or any other territorial local authority to promote legislation it believes is in the best interests of its residents and ratepayers," said Local Government Minister Sandra Lee today.

"The Bay of Plenty regional council Maori Constituency Empowering Bill is a local bill and will be examined by an appropriate Parliamentary select committee, to which the public will be able to make submissions," she said.
