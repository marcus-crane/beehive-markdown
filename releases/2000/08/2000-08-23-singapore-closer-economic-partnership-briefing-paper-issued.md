The Singapore Closer Economic Partnership agreement would be good for New Zealand, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton issued a briefing paper which summarised the agreement.

He said he hoped the briefing paper would ease some people's concerns about the agreement.

"This Labour-Alliance coalition government aims to be as open as possible. The agreement has not been negotiated in secret. More people and stakeholder groups have been consulted about the agreement's contents than ever before."

The agreement is to go to Cabinet for consideration next month. After that, Mr Sutton hoped a full treaty text could be made public.
