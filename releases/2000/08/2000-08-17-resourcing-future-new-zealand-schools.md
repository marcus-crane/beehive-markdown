Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released details on how much extra money schools would get next year as a result of the extra funding allocated to schools in this year's Budget.

The information was mailed to all schools yesterday and is also available on a school by school basis on the Ministry of Education's website.

"The new formula that the Government has established includes an operational funding base component, a per pupil component, and a decile component.

"Schools will get a base amount of $1,000, a per pupil amount of $70, and a further per pupil amount ranging up to $329.88 depending on their socio economic status ranking. There will be a specific examination of the effect of this formula on special schools.

"Overall there is $107 million to distribute to all schools as a result of ending bulk funding including $45 million of new money set aside for schools expected to enter bulk funding, but never distributed. There has also been a 1.8% increase to operations grants, which makes an additional $15 million available.

"The Government has also agreed to new flexibilities around what schools can spend their operational funding on as part of our policy to incorporate some of the positive experiences from bulk funding into the wider school system.

"I am confident this balance between the dual systems that have been operating is a fairer way of meeting the Government's responsibility to fund schools and provide children with a real chance of using education to fulfil their potential.

"Some bulk funded schools will receive less money this year than they did last year. This is by no means a 'punishment' to those schools which have had a considerable financial advantage over like schools, but rather a weight they must bear, as all schools are put back on an even keel.

"It must be noted that bulk funded schools which did not save salary funding by employing staff with less experience and lower qualifications will be better off next year than they are this year.

"Bulk funded schools have established many education initiatives that meet the needs of their communities. The kind of innovation they have shown will be possible under this system.

"I look forward to other schools having access to more money and more flexibility to cater for the specific needs of their school community.

"I have asked schools to report back to the Ministry of Education by 30 November on the type of areas and initiatives on which they are spending their extra resources," Trevor Mallard said.

Resourcing for the Future – Facts @ a Glance

Who's affected?  
All state and integrated school – they'll know what funding they'll receive next year.

How much will they get?  
That depends on their roll and decile rating.

Is this final, or will it change?  
It is the final formula, but it is based on this year's roll numbers so the final amount depends on what each school's roll is next year. For bulk funded schools, the difference in this year's and next year's funding could vary if their staffing profile has changed within this year.

What percentage of schools gain and lose funding?  
About 78% of schools will get more funding next year including all centrally resourced schools and 31% of bulk funded schools

How much extra funding will be in schools?  
Significantly more - $60 million or a 7.4% increase overall.

Is that all from bulk funding?  
No – that includes an inflation adjusted increase of 1.8% increase to operational funding, a total of $15 million.

So how do you get to $60 million?  
Of the $107 million 'bulk funding' money only $62 million was given to schools this year. Next year, the entire $107 will be distributed among all schools. So the extra $45 million as well as the inflation increase on operation grants means an extra $60 million in schools next year.

What's the flexibility about?  
The Government will retain the responsibility for paying the salaries of entitlement staffing, but schools might like to add to that with their extra operational funding. For example, there will be:  
\* More flexibility in employing extra teaching staff from operations funds.

\* Ability to both anticipate the use of, and accrue staffing entitlement (banking staffing)

\* The use of operations fund to pay teaching staff further for recruitment, retention, and additional responsibilities.
