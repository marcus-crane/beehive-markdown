Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins has welcomed the new school funding package announced today.

The package means Manurewa schools will get an extra $2,170,128.00 for 2001.

George Hawkins said: "This is excellent news for Manurewa schools, students, parents and teachers. What this increase means is better resources paid to Manurewa schools to ensure that they get the very best education possible.

"We all know the past National government scrimped on its education budget. This was especially so for schools that elected not to be bulk funded.

"This Government has been determined to place all schools on a level playing field. This new school funding package is a positive change with 27 Manurewa schools receiving an increase in funds," George Hawkins said.

For example: Finlayson Park School gets an extra $112,222, Roscommon School gets an extra $134,422, Clendon Park School gets an extra $146,553, and Manukau View Contributing School gets an extra $197,021. Nationwide there is $107 million to distribute to all schools as a result of ending bulk funding. This includes $45 million of new money set aside for schools that were expected to enter into bulk funding but was never distributed.

"I must stress that the Government is not treating bulk funded schools any different from other schools, but putting all schools on an even keel.

"Schools will have new flexibility around what schools can spend their operational funding on. This allows some positive experiences from bulk funding to benefit the wider school system," George Hawkins said.

"Under the past government bulk funded schools got extra funding. Now all schools are treated the same with funding based on an operational component, a per pupil component, and a decile component.

"It all boils down to better education for Manurewa children. And that is an excellent investment indeed," George Hawkins said.
