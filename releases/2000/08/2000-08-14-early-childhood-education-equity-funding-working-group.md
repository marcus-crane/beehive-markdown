Equity funding for the early childhood sector moved a step closer today with the establishment of the Equity Funding Working Group.

The group met for the first time today to start the process of developing criteria and costings for an equity funding system for community-based early childhood education services.

Trevor Mallard said that equity funding for the early childhood sector was an important aspect of the Government's closing thr gaps objective.

"Participation in quality early childhood education is one of the most important factors in a child’s later educational achievement. Some early childhood education services face additional barriers to delivering quality early childhood education. Equity funding aims to lower some of those barriers."

Equity funding could be targeted at services:

\* in low income communities;

\* in rural communities and areas of low population density;

\* which provide immersion programmes without the support of an umbrella organisation;

\* with children for whom English is a second language; and

\* with children with low to moderate special education needs.

“Failing to recognise these barriers, and targeting funding accordingly, can result in disparities within and between communities in terms of access to, and quality of, early childhood education," Trevor Mallard said.

The working group will be led by Eddie Clark who has an extensive background in education.

Members of the group include: Jan Ballantyne (Central North Island Kindergarten Association), Dr Margaret Carr (University of Waikato), Rose Cole (New Zealand Childcare Association), Tiana Fauolo (Pacific ECE Service), Pat Lynch (NZ Catholic Education Office), Susan Michell (Nelson/Marlborough CCS), Arapera Royal Tangaere (Te Köhanga Reo National Trust), and Jenny Varney (NZEI)
