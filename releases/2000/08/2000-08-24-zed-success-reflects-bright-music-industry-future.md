Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard has today hailed the success of Christchurch band Zed as reflecting a bright future for the New Zealand popular music industry.

"I am thrilled that Zed's Silencer album has shot to number one in the charts and also achieved a platinum sales award", says Judith Tizard. "This is the kind of talent the government wanted to support when, in May this year, it funded the establishment of the Music Industry Commission and provided extra funding to NZ On Air."

"I am impressed by both the talent and professionalism of Zed and their management."

"I am told that this band is outselling top international artists such as Robbie Williams, Anastasia and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. This government has always believed that New Zealanders want to hear good New Zealand music and Zed's success confirms this."

"While this CD will mainly appeal to younger New Zealanders, I too have listened to it and think it's fantastic. I hope that won't cause a slump in sales!" says Judith Tizard.

The government contributed $2 million over five years to the Music Industry Commission, an independent body. The Commission's objectives include the fostering of New Zealand popular music composition, performance, recording and marketing. Its role includes promotion of New Zealand popular music nationally and internationally. It also creates a forum for the popular music industry, acts as an industry advocate, and plays an educational role.

Of the $7 million extra operating funding provided to NZ On Air, $2 million was directed to towards its music-related work.
