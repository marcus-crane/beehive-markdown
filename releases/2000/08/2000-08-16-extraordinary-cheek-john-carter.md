Health Minister Annette King says National MPs John Carter is shedding crocodile tears about the possibility small and rural Northland communities will "be outmuscled" by their urban neighbours when the District Health Boards are established.

"Quite frankly, I can hardly credit his hypocrisy. I notice his Whangarei colleague, Phil Heatley, shares his concerns. The only reason I am not accusing Mr Heatley of such hypocrisy and extraordinary cheek too is that he wasn't an MP during the sad era of the National Party's market model health reforms."

Mrs King said it was time to get some facts straight about representation on the current Hospital and Health services boards, the organisations set up by National.

"Mr Carter talks about small Northland towns not getting a fair go. Well, the current Northland Health Ltd board, appointed by the National Party, has five members, one from Whangarei, one from Kerikeri, and three from the Auckland region. Where is the small town Northland representation in that board? Sixty percent of the members are not even from Northland.

"I can assure you that the new appointments I will be announcing in the next few days to the HHS boards, to begin the transition to DHBs, will be remarkably more representative of the Northland community than anything National managed."

Mrs King said the proposed STV voting system, plus her capacity to appoint up to four members to sit alongside the seven elected members, would ensure Northland had a balanced mix of skills, knowledge and regional experience when DHBs came fully into effect in 2001.

"The new boards will be charged with providing health services on a population basis. That means they must know the needs of their communities, and be responsive to them. That has not happened for years."
