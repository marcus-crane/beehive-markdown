The Minister for Information Technology Paul Swain has unveiled the programme outline for the government's e-commerce summit in November.  
"This is the first time a New Zealand government has staged such an event and interest in it from business has been phenomenal," Paul Swain said.  
"The format will be a two-day summit at Auckland’s Aotea Centre on 1 & 2 November, it will be chaired by Sir Gil Simpson of Aoraki Corporation.  
"We have lined up some fantastic speakers including keynote addresses from some of the world’s leading authorities on the successful use of e-commerce. (List attached)

"The highlight of the event for the government will be the release of our e-commerce strategy - our blueprint for how New Zealand can move forward in e-commerce.  
"We will be seeking feedback on that plan from businesses at the summit.  
"In addition, the 2-day event will include a range of practical and focused workshops, designed to give New Zealand businesses a clear ‘how to’ guide on embracing the opportunities offered by e-commerce.

"We will also have presentations by businesses on why they have adopted e-commerce. This will give summit attendees the chance to hear first-hand from businesses who got involved in e-commerce early on,” Paul Swain said.  
"As I said, interest in the event has been huge and we have been fortunate enough to attract six key partners who will help us create this dynamic event.  
"These major sponsors are committed to encouraging all New Zealand businesses to strengthen their use of e-Commerce. The major sponsors are Cisco Systems NZ Ltd, Telstra Saturn, IBM New Zealand, Baycorp Holdings, Oracle New Zealand and SolNet.

“We also have several smaller sponsors who are helping with the event – these include the University of Waikato Management School, Tradenz, Advantage Group Limited and Wilson & Horton's online arm, W&H Interactive.  
"E-commerce is vital for New Zealand’s economic future. It’s no longer a question of if e-commerce will be the way we do business, but when. The goal of this summit is to raise the profile of the importance of e-commerce and to encourage New Zealand businesses to adapt successfully to the new environment," Paul Swain said.

The e-commerce summit will be open to up to 500 delegates from businesses of all types and sizes throughout New Zealand.
