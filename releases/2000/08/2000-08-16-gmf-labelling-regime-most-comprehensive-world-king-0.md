Health Minister, Annette King, says the mandatory genetically modified food regime adopted today by New Zealand and Australia is the most comprehensive in the world.

The regime was adopted almost unanimously by health ministers attending today's meeting of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council in Wellington.

Mrs King said the "gut feeling of the meeting throughout was that there not only had to be a mandatory labelling regime, but that it had to be strong and effective.

"Ministers rejected a one percent threshold in favour of greater accuracy in labelling. Our consumers would settle for nothing less. We have listened to them. The regime sits closely alongside EU regulations, and it is at the leading edge internationally.

"The ministers also agreed to keep international developments in genetically modified food labelling under review, and to develop the regime further in future if needed."

Mrs King said the regime required all food and food ingredients to be labelled where DNA and protein was present in the final food or the food had altered characteristics.

There were some exemptions in cases of highly refined food, processing aids and flavours and additives, but these were tightly defined, she said.

"The demands of consumers were constantly to the fore in the debate. The bottom line is that consumers have a right to know what they are eating. New Zealand is delighted there was so much support from Australian states for its stance.

"There has been so much hysteria on this issue in the past few days. Now that alarm can be seen for what it is …unwarranted and ill-founded. Consumers will support what we have done today."
