China’s entry to the World Trade Organisation - which could take place as soon as the end of this year - would deliver tangible benefits to New Zealand exporters, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton told members of the New Zealand-China Trade Association at lunchtime that the results of a study into the benefits to New Zealand from China’s commitment to reduce tariffs once it enters the WTO showed big potential gains.

“To measure the impact of China’s accession on New Zealand, we’ve started by looking at New Zealand’s current trade profile. Chinese tariff cuts on these products, once fully phased in over five years, will save New Zealand exporters of non-wool products $ 33 million per year.”

The biggest gains to New Zealand, based on current trade, would be in dairy ($21.8 million), timber (paper, wood products $2.5 million), fish ($2.1 million) and methanol ($2.1 million).

The range of tariff commitments negotiated by China’s trading partners, from which New Zealand will benefit, mean that exporters stand to gain in sectors as diverse as aluminium products, rock lobster, plastics, antibiotics, medicaments and perfumes.

This assessment does not include benefits for the wool industry, which depend in part on ongoing market access negotiations. Nor does it include the effect of tariff reductions which allow new trade to commence.

“China’s entry to the WTO will mean more than just tariff cuts”, Mr Sutton said.

“It will lock in China’s transition to a rules-based economy, give New Zealand the ability to negotiate market access on the basis of rules rather than influence, and strengthen the World Trade Organisation itself.

And as a small trading nation, that is in all our interests."
