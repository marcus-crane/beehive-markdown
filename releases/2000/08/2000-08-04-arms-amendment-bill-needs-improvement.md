Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said if an Arms Amendment Bill is to improve gun laws it must have a defined focus.

"The Arms Amendment Bill (number 2), in its current form, fails to address front on the expressed wish of nine out of ten New Zealanders that gun laws in this country be improved.

"At last National MPs have finally conceded to their own incompetence. They have admitted that their Bill is not able to meet the expectation of the Parliament nor the public.

"It was clear from the outset that the Bill in its present form would not address the ideals of gun ownership nor the control of guns in New Zealand to a satisfactory degree. The Bill may be able to be amended by the Select Committee to make it a better law.

"National dithered on this Bill when it was government. Its internal factions, from the opposition benches, continue to dither on this issue," George Hawkins said.

"What is required now is leadership. The Labour/Alliance Government will explore measures that will determine sensible gun laws.

"The Arms Amendment Bill's intent was sound. What it lacks is a defined focus that is essential to ensure improved gun control legislation," George Hawkins said.
