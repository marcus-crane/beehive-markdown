Research and teaching at our tertiary institutions needs to equip New Zealanders to build our own type of knowledge society, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey was addressing a Lincoln University Staff Council forum this afternoon on the new Government's agenda in tertiary education.

"Building a modern economy in New Zealand is fundamentally about the application of new technologies, new information, and new competencies to what it is that we know and do well, and have being doing well for some time.

"This comes down to applying the best of the new to the best of the old: the geographical endowments that have always given us an edge.

"Moving our traditional products from undifferentiated commodities to distinctive 'New Zealand brand' products is the way of the future. It is also the only way we will go from being price-takers to price-makers.

"Our wine industry is a good example of the successful application of knowledge to traditional products.

"We also need to look at innovative ways to leverage off the advantages of our location and low population density. Entrerpeneurs like Peter Jackson have taken advantage of our natural environment and then used that to create high-skills support industries.

"Initial advice from the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission that the Government should adopt an inclusive definition of the disciplines which underpin a knowledge society complement this view of how the knowledge society should evolve in New Zealand.

"The clear message to tertiary institutions is that their teaching and research programmes need to encompass the sciences and technology-based disciplines. However young people today also need the ability to think critically and to innovatively apply the broader world of knowledge," Steve Maharey.
