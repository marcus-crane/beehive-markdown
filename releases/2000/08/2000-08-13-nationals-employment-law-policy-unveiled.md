The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson has released an analysis of the National Party's apparent policy for employment relations. The analysis is based on the many National amendments put forward during debate on The Employment Relations Bill.

National has promised to fight the next election on the basis of this issue but has refused to outline what its policy will be.

"If the National Party knows it wants to fight the 2002 election on employment relations it must know what its policy is. This policy must be driving the proposals being put forward to amend the Bill before the House," said Ms Wilson.

"All employees and employers should be aware of the bizarre and inconsistent vision for future workplace relations behind the deluge of amendments put forward.

"The weirdest policies relate to government intervention. National obviously has plans to return to the darkest days of Muldoonism, with Ministers of Labour poking their noses into every difficulty, and the coercive power of the state being used to determine the outcomes of disputes.

"National also plans to remove even the minimal protections for workers available under the Employment Contracts Act. National's newly-developed policy would allow workers to be forced to lose their status as employees and become dependant contractors with few or no rights. There would be a ban on raising virtually any grievance after 30 days. The Employment Contracts Act allows 90 days, as will the new law. No matter how much employees had suffered, or what had been unlawfully denied them, there would be caps of $25,000 on compensation for humiliation and $50,000 for the loss of any benefit. This would reduce the levels of all such redress.

"Compensation is not high at the moment. Last year compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee was set at less than $10,000 in 90% of cases and at less than $6,000 in 75% of cases.

"Possibly the worst elements in National's policy are moves to make it easier to operate sweatshops in New Zealand. National wants to remove the directors' liability clause in the Employment Relations Bill. This clause is needed to make sure minimum wages have to be paid, and sweatshop operators can't simply close down and set up again, leaving workers without wages. It plans to eliminate reference to certain types of homeworker. This will allow exploitative piecework. Combined with the changes National wants for contracting, the policy is a sweatshop charter.

"During the debate in the House National members consistently criticised even the minimum actions on behalf of workers with justified grievances available under their own Employment Contracts Act.

"National intends to introduce a law which will combine the worst of the 1970s with the worst of the 1870s.

"The only thing more bizarre than the content of the policy is National's incredible belief that it will be possible to gain the support of New Zealanders on the basis of the policy," said Ms Wilson.
