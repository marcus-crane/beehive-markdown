"Mr McCully has confirmed his lack of knowledge on local government issues today," Local Government Minister Sandra Lee said, commenting on claims made today by the opposition MP."

”It appears he doesn't realise that I have no ministerial responsibility for Local Government New Zealand in the same way that I have no ministerial responsibility for the Employers Federation or the Returned Services Association," Ms Lee said.

"Local Government New Zealand is not a government department but an independent body."

"I reiterate my earlier praise for the positive role that Local Government New Zealand played in helping to find an appropriate solution to the Rodney District Council affair earlier this year."

"I will continue to work constructively with them to advance a raft of important legislative changes that were left in the too hard basket by the last government," Ms Lee said.
