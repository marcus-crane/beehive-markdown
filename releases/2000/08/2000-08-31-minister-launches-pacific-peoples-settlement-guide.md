The Minister of Immigration, Lianne Dalziel, today launched a new settlement guide for Pacific Island people granted residence in New Zealand.

“One of the Government’s top priorities in the immigration area is to make it easier for new migrants to settle in New Zealand,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The “Settlement Guide for Pacific Peoples” is printed in English, Tongan, and Samoan, and was developed in consultation with Pacific community groups in Auckland and Christchurch and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.

The Guide covers a wide range of issues of interest to all Pacific people living in New Zealand, as well as the new migrants. Lianne Dalziel said New Zealand’s historical and cultural ties with the peoples of the Pacific made the launching of this particular settlement guide extremely gratifying.

"This is an important day for the NZIS and the partnership that has developed with the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs in developing this resource material," she said.

"Successful settlement is achieved through a variety of measures, but one of them is access to the Government and community networks that citizens and long term residents tend to take for granted.

"Many people who come to live in New Zealand have to learn a whole new way of life, an entire new system in which to operate. I know it isn't always easy. Language is often the first barrier, and then people have to fill out forms, pass tests for driving, gain qualifications, learn about the health and education system … the list goes on.

"This is made much easier when there is strong family support already in New Zealand, but that is not always the case. Hence, the Settlement Guides," Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel congratulated Pacific MP Luamanuvao Winnie Laban on an initiative improving the relationship between Pacific communities and the Immigration Service. "That has been an important in breaking down some of the barriers that have been built up over the years in terms of communication and understanding between Pacific communities and the Government," she said.
