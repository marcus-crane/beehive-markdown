The Minister for Senior Citizens, Hon Lianne Dalziel, says Cabinet has approved the process and timeframe for the development of a Positive Ageing Strategy for New Zealanders.

"The Positive Ageing Strategy is to improve opportunities for older people to participate in the community in the ways that they choose. Society needs to recognise the value of older New Zealanders and older New Zealanders need to value their own ability to contribute to the next generation," Lianne Dalziel said.

The first aspect of the strategy will be to finalise a set of draft objectives aimed at empowering older people to make choices that enable them to live a satisfying life and lead a healthy lifestyle.

Lianne Dalziel said that Government departments would then undertake a review of existing policies, programmes and services relevant to older people to ensure they aligned to the final objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy.

"I would expect them to develop an action plan to address issues or gaps identified when reviewing existing policies," she said. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms will be established to ensure Government departments, Ministries or other agencies continued to align policies with the strategy.

"I am a strong supporter of the Positive Ageing Strategy and the feedback I have had at Grey Power, Age Concern and other senior citizen organisations around the country have confirmed this is exactly the sort of approach older New Zealanders are looking for."

"I am pleased Cabinet has approved Stage 1 and I'm looking forward to the strategy moving into the next phase, which will involve consultation with all of those groups," she said.
