Smart use of e-learning technology and the development of a coordinated New Zealand strategy are the keys to unlocking a potential billion dollar export education industry taking New Zealand education to the world, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Mr Maharey addressed the Education New Zealand Trust International Education Conference this evening. The development of e-learning technology offers new opportunities to make New Zealand education services available in other countries. A coordinated strategy to build New Zealand's export education industry is being jointly developed by the Ministry of Education and Trade New Zealand.

"Modern information and communications technology (ICT) offers New Zealand education providers the chance to overcome our comparative geographic isolation.

"Information technology is shrinking the world. Unless we develop the ability to use ICT successfully to deliver quality education services in New Zealand and overseas our own tertiary education system risks being swamped by overseas providers.

"The Government is actively working with schools and tertiary education providers to capitalise on the benefits which accrue from a well-organised home-grown export education industry. E-learning capacity will be an essential element of the strategy.

"We are also working through the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission to develop a distinctive high-quality tertiary education system which meets the needs of modern New Zealand society. The spinoffs in terms of attracting foreign students to study here – both virtually and in person – should not be underestimated.

"By getting the technology and the strategy right the Government can provide a platform for New Zealand education providers to succeed in the competitive global education industry," said Steve Maharey.
