Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has been briefed on the Police inquiry into the death of Steven Wallace.

The Police investigation into the shooting in Waitara of Steven Wallace on Sunday 30 April 2000 has found the police officer involved acted lawfully.

"The report presents detail of the circumstances of events that led to Mr Wallace's death. The report also offers an insight into what happened in the early hours of 30th April," George Hawkins said.

"I am mindful that today the family of Steven Wallace will be grieving. Many in the Waitara community and further afar will share in their grief.

"I respect such feelings. It is tragic that a family has lost a loved one. I wish to extend my sympathy to the whanau and everyone involved in the tragedy.

"The homicide investigation has been subjected to the considered legal opinion of the Deputy Solicitor General and a legal review process conducted by the Crown Law Office.

"Based on the findings of the investigation and in the opinion of the Deputy Solicitor General (criminal), the constable at the centre of the investigation acted lawfully.

"I have confidence in the Police investigation and in the analysis of the Deputy Solicitor General.

"It is evident that the homicide inquiry into the death of Steven Wallace has been thorough.

"I am mindful that a Police Complaints Authority investigation, and a Coroner's Inquest are ongoing. I reserve my comments on that until the conclusion of those inquiries.

"Today, it is right, that we look to the future, learn from this tragedy, and move to heal the strains that have been exposed," George Hawkins said.
