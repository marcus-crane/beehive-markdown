Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the membership of the Government's Ministerial Review of the Education Review Office.

The Review will be chaired by former Minister of Labour, State Services, SOEs and Immigration, Stan Rodger, who has extensive experience in state sector functions and structure, and will report back to the Government by the end of the year.

Other members will be Royal NZ Foundation for the Blind CEO, Jane Holden, educational consultant and former director of the New Zealand Council for Educational Research, Anne Meade, industrial and employment specialist, Alan Millar, and Academic Dean and Director of the School of Maori Performing Arts, Barry Smith.

The review team will begin their investigation next week into the role, functions and placement of the Education Review Office. The purpose of the review is to:

„h Ensure there is an effective audit and support system for schools and early childhood centres;  
„h Investigate best practice benchmarking systems for school and centre evaluations;  
„h Investigate how best to ensure close liaison between ERO and the Ministry of Education so that appropriate follow up is provided to schools;  
„h Investigate whether there would be efficiency or effectiveness gains in amalgamating ERO and the Ministry of Education.

"The review committee faces a challenge, but I am confident that the team has the appropriate mix of skills to manage the task," Trevor Mallard said.

"The review committee will first consider its draft terms of reference, before moving to consider the ERO's review processes, the support processes within the Ministry of Education and within the schools themselves. Above all, we wish the review team to find out how the results of external evaluations are best used to help improve the education outcomes for New Zealand students," Trevor Mallard said.
