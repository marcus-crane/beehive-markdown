Courts Minister Matt Robson, today launched a new site that allows people to pay court fines by credit card over the Internet.

Fines On-Line has been developed by the Department for Courts to give people easy access to information about fines, request a check for any court fines they might have, and to pay fines by credit card on-line.

It is one of the first e-government sites in New Zealand to provide on-line payment facilities, and one of the few sites world-wide to take fines payments on-line.

The Minister welcomed the site as one of several Internet initiatives the Department for Courts is developing. Others planned are information about Family Law and Family Court services, better access to Maori Land Court information, and a revamped Waitangi Tribunal internet site.

He said that Fines On-Line was a helpful, friendly and practical site, designed from the user’s point of view, and was developed at a cost of just over $20,000.

It fitted well with the Government’s objectives of making government services more accessible to the public, including people in rural areas as well as those in the cities.

“It’s difficult to predict how many will pay on-line, but Department research shows a significant number of people with fines were white collar workers, professionals or on average or above incomes. Their fines were often a result of unpaid infringement tickets for speeding, parking and other vehicle offences. These people are likely to be Internet users, and they are used to convenient, electronic ways of paying bills,” Matt Robson said.

“Fines On-line gives them another payment option, and one less excuse for not dealing with their fines.”
