Health Minister Annette King says a wide range of improvements to health services will be maintained this year throughout the period of structural changes to the health sector.

Announcing the new funding agreement with the Health Funding Authority, Mrs King said: "The first reading of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill last week marked the formal start of the creation of a genuine public health service. But this Government's aim is not to change for change's sake, but to deliver better health for New Zealanders. That aim will not be put on hold.

"The exciting projects in the new funding agreement will establish a momentum that will be maintained when the structural changes are completed."

Mrs King said the agreement, specifying targets the HFA will meet in funding health services, covers the period until the end of this year when the HFA is fully integrated into the Ministry of Health. "The agreement sets an excellent platform for the Ministry by establishing clear goals and programmes. That work will be well under way by the time the Ministry takes over."

Mrs King said the agreement reflected Government health priorities. "Some of the programmes are far-reaching, but I must emphasise there is no big bang approach. We have to recognise achievable goals to solve a host of difficult problems, and set out to achieve them realistically and sensibly."

Highlights of the agreement included:  
· A mental health child and youth work plan.  
· By the end of November 100 percent of first specialist assessments for elective surgery to be completed within six months of receipt of referral.  
· Implementation of HFA's Child Health Plan.  
· Improved services for people with autism.  
· Expanded health initiatives in South Auckland, Porirua and Kapiti Coast.  
· Funding for eight Maori health gain priority areas and for Pacific providers.  
· Stocktake of rural health services.

Patient Travel and Accommodation

Emergency Services  
The HFA will establish five regional emergency care co-ordination teams. These teams will provide leadership, oversight and monitoring of each of five regional networks of emergency services.

The networks will be collaborative and involve all emergency care providers in each region. This will be in accordance with the concept outlined in the joint-agency publication: Roadside to Bedside - Developing a 24-hour Clinically Integrated Acute Management System for New Zealand.

Improve Services in Porirua and on the Kapiti Coast

??a local provider led child health information system to improve immunisation coverage  
??additional Pacific peoples primary services to reduce key health disparities  
??improved outpatient services  
??improved maternity services.

The HFA will take part in a Capital Coast Health Ltd led review of accident and emergency services available in Porirua and the Kapiti region. This review will identify options for providing emergency services on a 24 hour basis by 2001/02 for people in the Porirua and Kapiti region.

Improve Services in South Auckland  
The HFA will expand the range of health integration projects it funds in South Auckland, and identify more effective ways of delivering childhood immunisations.

The Authority will allocate a $4 million integration budget to initiatives that improve Maori health, Pacific health, child and youth health in South Auckland. The initiatives will be determined through consultation with an intersectoral steering group that includes Ministry of Health, health providers, other sectors and the community

The HFA has approved eight Maori Health Gain Priority Areas: Smoking, Immunisation, Diabetes, Oral Health, Hearing, Asthma, Injury Prevention and Mental Health. The HFA will purchase and contract for services that align with these priority areas. This measure builds upon the earlier work already undertaken by the HFA.
