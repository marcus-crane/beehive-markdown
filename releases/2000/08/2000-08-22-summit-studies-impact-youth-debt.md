Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré, in conjunction with national student unions, is hosting a summit on the impact of the student loans scheme on young people.

The summit is being held at the National Library, Wellington, on Friday 25 August.

Laila Harré says it is a chance for young people, and groups that work with young people, to express their views on the student loans scheme.

"The scheme has been in place for nine years, and it's well past time for the community to have a say on the effect it has had.

"Young people in particular haven't previously been consulted on the student loans scheme, yet we know that it is something that many young New Zealanders are very worried about.

"Young people are among those most affected by student loans. Debt affects their ability to access education, it erodes their financial stability, and there are even suggestions that in some cases it affects their mental health. The government should be listening to what they have to say."

Laila Harré says the idea of the summit linked in well with her plans to bolster young people's involvement in decision-making. She also hopes the outcomes of the summit will be carefully considered by the select committee reviewing the scheme, and in the development of any further student loans policy.

The full-day summit starts at 9.30am, Friday August 25 in the National Library Auditorium, Aitken Street, Wellington. A wide range of people will be attending the summit, including high school students, current tertiary students and young people paying off their loans.
