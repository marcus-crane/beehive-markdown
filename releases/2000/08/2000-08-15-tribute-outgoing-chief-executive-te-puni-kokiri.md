The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Parekura Horomia paid tribute today to the retiring Chief Executive Officer of Te Puni Kokiri (TPK), stating future Maori developments in government will be a direct reflection of the important lead up work conducted by Dr Love.

The Minister made the announcement in response to today's announcement by the State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham that Dr Love would not be seeking reappointment when his term ends on 18 December.

Mr Horomia said that Dr Ngatata Love had made a significant impact on the Ministry during his five years in the top job.

"Dr Love was successful in establishing good relations with Maori following the difficulties of the fiscal envelope. When he took over the role of Chief Executive there was very real tensions within the community. These have abated and we are now seeing a constructive approach between the Ministry and Maori.

The Minister said a particular achievement was the clinical analysis of the ‘gaps’ between Maori and non Maori, with the production of the ‘Progress towards closing the social and economic gaps between Maori and non Maori’ report in July 1998.

“Of course we had all known these gaps existed but we relied on anecdotal evidence. The report, produced under Dr Love, provided clear evidence of these gaps – in education, health, housing and other key social areas.”

Mr Horomia extended every best wish to Dr Love in either his retirement or new endeavour.
