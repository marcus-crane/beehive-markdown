The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said today that a news report that claimed he had rejected various road safety proposals was wrong.

This year the Ministry of Transport commissioned an independent review of the existing road safety funding programme.

The review concluded that New Zealand's road safety programme is effective and efficient.

"Most recommendations were included in the Government's short-term road safety package announced in May. The review also recommended further road safety measures for improving road safety."

"Some of these initiatives were referred to in today's Dominion. These measures can only be dealt with in the longer term and with public consultation."

"They have not been rejected."

"They will be considered in the context of the longer term road safety strategy which will be released for public consultation later this year."

"The reviewers found that we are leading the world in terms of our community road safety programme."

"Our road toll is the lowest since the mid-1960s."

"But we wont be resting on our laurels and this Government is committed to reducing the road toll further."
