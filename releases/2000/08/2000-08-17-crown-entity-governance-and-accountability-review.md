Crown entities are to have clearer governance and accountability arrangements.

Crown entities are organisations listed on the Fourth Schedule of the Public Finance Act 1989. They are not Public Service departments or State-owned enterprises.

The package is designed to support the Government's goal of improving trust in government organisations.

"The new arrangements will make the Government's expectations very clear and reinforce them, where necessary, with appropriate legislation," the Associate Minister of State Services Margaret Wilson, said today.

"Some steps have already been taken to clarify roles and responsibilities. Comprehensive guidelines for Ministers, Crown entities and Public Service departments have been distributed. However, Crown entity legislation remains patchy, fragmented and sometimes contradictory.

"The Government will amend the current, incomplete legislation with provisions that strike the right balance between accountability and autonomy. To achieve this, the Government will introduce a Crown Entities Bill into Parliament by the end of the year.

More than 100 Crown entities have been allocated to one of four classes: Crown Agents; Autonomous Crown Entities; Independent Crown Entities, and Crown Companies. Each class has its own governance and accountability arrangements.

"This approach recognises that one size does not fit all. This package balances the requirements of the Government for accountability with the need to provide each Crown entity with the flexibility it needs to function effectively.

"All chairs of Crown entities will receive a letter from me in the next few days, detailing the class in which their organisation has been placed and the consultation process that will take place over the new governance and accountability arrangements.

"We will then go through a period of consultation before confirming those allocations. We expect legislation to be introduced into the House by the end of this year," Ms Wilson said.

Ms Wilson said that it was important that the public and the staff of Crown entities understood that this was not another restructuring exercise.

"Constant structural change in the state sector over the past decade or so is responsible for some of the confusion existing today. These changes are not about restructuring or job losses.

"This is about the Government clarifying its expectations of organisations," she said.

She said that work was still underway to determine the best arrangements for school boards of trustees, tertiary education institutions, fish and game councils and reserves boards.

Public Service departments and State-owned enterprises are not part of this reform package. "Unlike Crown entities, those organisations already have their own common legislative frameworks," Ms Wilson said.

Attachment: typical governance and accountability arrangements for each class of Crown entity

Different classes of Crown entity and what they mean

Crown Agent  
Crown agents have functions that pose a high level of strategic, policy, contractual or fiscal risk, therefore they will be subject to a significant degree of Ministerial control.

To reflect that closeness, the main governance and accountability arrangements are:  
· Crown agents must give effect to the policy of the government of the day;  
· The Responsible Minister appoints the board members for a renewable term of up to three years;  
· Board members serve at the pleasure of the Responsible Minister; and  
· The Responsible Minister will set the board members' fees.

Autonomous Crown Entity  
These organisations fall in the "middle ground" between Crown agents and Independent Crown Entities. They will be subject to a lesser degree of Ministerial control than Crown agents. They must have regard to the policy of the government of the day.

Selected governance and accountability arrangements:  
· Autonomous Crown entities must have regard to the policy of the government of the day;  
· The Responsible Minister appoints the board members for a renewable term of up to three years;  
· Board members may be dismissed by the Responsible Minister for reason; and  
· The Responsible Minister will set the board members' fees

Independent Crown Entity  
These organisations typically have investigatory or quasi-judicial functions, where a high level of decision-making independence from Ministers is necessary. For this reason they are not subject to influence or easy dismissal by Ministers, and they are not required to have regard or give effect to government policy.

Selected governance and accountability arrangements:  
· The appointment of board members or the office-holder is by the Governor-General on the advice of the Responsible Minister;  
· The board or office-holder may be dismissed by the Governor-General for just cause, on the advice of the Responsible Minister in consultation with the Attorney-General;  
· The appointment is for a five-year renewable term; and  
· The Higher Salaries Commission sets the board members' or office-holder's fees.

Crown-owned Company  
These organisations are not the same as State-Owned Enterprises, even though they are companies. While Crown-owned companies have commercial functions, they may also have mixed objectives and/or the environment they operate in may not be fully commercial. Crown-owned companies operate under the Companies Act, as well as Crown entities legislation.

Selected governance and accountability arrangements:  
· The Shareholding Ministers (the Responsible Minister and the Minister of Finance) appoint the board members for a renewable term of up to three years;  
· Board members serve at the prerogative of the Shareholding Ministers;  
· The Shareholding Ministers set the board members' fees.
