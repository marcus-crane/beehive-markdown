While growth in tertiary student numbers are predicted to remain relatively modest overall this academic year, the Government wants to see higher levels of participation in post-school education and training, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey was releasing Ministry of Education figures giving the forecasts made by tertiary education providers of equivalent fulltime student (EFTS) numbers for 2000 and the finalised number of EFTS places achieved in 1999. 160,282 EFTS were enrolled at tertiary institutions in 1999. The Ministry of Education reports that tertiary education institutions predict a 1.8% increase in EFTS enrolments in 2000, estimating 163,200 EFTS will enrol in tertiary study this year.

"While growth in student numbers this academic year will be modest overall, enrolment trends within the tertiary sector are predicted to vary this academic year. Wananga, polytechnic and college of education EFTS are predicted to increase by 61%, 3% and 4% respectively in 2000. University EFTS are predicted to be static, increasing by 0.1% this year.

“The Government wants to encourage greater levels of participation in tertiary education. The new measures we have already implemented such as freezing tertiary fees next year and stopping the accumulation of interest on loans while students are studying are making tertiary education more affordable to the many New Zealanders for whom cost had become a barrier to access," Steve Maharey said.
