Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the announcement that the Queen has approved the appointment of Dame Silvia Cartwright to succeed Sir Michael Hardie Boys as Governor-General of New Zealand.

"Dame Silvia Cartwright has made an impressive contribution to New Zealand at home and abroad as a lawyer and jurist, and as an advocate for women and women's rights," Helen Clark said.

"She was the first woman to be appointed to the bench of the High Court in New Zealand, and the first woman appointed as Chief Judge of the District Court.

"Dame Silvia came into national prominence in the late 1980s when she headed the inquiry into the treatment of cervical cancer and other related matters at Auckland's National Women's Hospital, in what became known as the Cartwright inquiry.

"Since 1993 she has been a member of the United Nations committee monitoring compliance with the United Nations Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

"New Zealand is extremely fortunate to have a person of Dame Silvia's calibre and background who is willing to assume the position of Governor General.

"The government conveys its best wishes to Dame Silvia and her husband, Peter Cartwright," Helen Clark said.

Sir Michael Hardie Boys will compete his term in March and Dame Silvia will be sworn in as Governor-General in April.
