Kiwi Can – a programme aimed at boosting children's self esteem and encouraging them to achieve is to receive a boost from the Government.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard told a Kiwi Can fundraising dinner that the programme would receive specific targeting from the Innovations Pool.

The Tu Tangata programme and the Cool Kids programme would also receive specific funding.

"The Innovations Pool is one way in which the Government assists schools, and  
organisations working with schools, to develop programmes that meet the  
needs of at-risk students.

"This year we (the Government) increased the funding of the Innovations Pool by $4 million over the next four years. Of that increase, about $900,000 is to be specifically earmarked for Tu Tangata, Cool Kids, and Kiwi Can over the next 12 months."

Trevor Mallard said New Zealanders were great achievers.

"However, not all New Zealanders have the opportunities necessary to achieve at the highest levels. The reasons for this are not limited to natural deficiencies in sporting or academic ability or in the lack of business nous to succeed - rather, these New Zealanders have not had the necessary educational foundations in life from which to go forward and succeed.

"Achievers need a stable foundation in childhood and in their teenage years from which to build their success. They need self-esteem, to perceive that they are making progress at school, opportunities to participate in sports and recreation activities, a supportive community, and most of all a stable and loving family.

"There are, sadly, large numbers of our young people who do not have the necessary foundations from which they can reach up to achieve at the highest level. Programmes like those funded from the Innovations Pool can help make up the difference," Trevor Mallard said.
