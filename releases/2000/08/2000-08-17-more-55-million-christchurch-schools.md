Schools in the Christchurch region will receive a boost of more than $5.5 million as a result of new funding arrangements announced by the Government today.

The Associate Minister of Education and MP for Christchurch East, Lianne Dalziel, said today that from her visits to schools all over the city, she knows the extra funding will be well received and put to good use.

All the electorates in the Christchurch region receive increases in school funding. Banks Peninsula receives an overall increase of $699,278; Christchurch Central $1,297,597; Christchurch East $998,520; Ilam $746,470; Waimakariri $967,241 and Wigram $872, 448. This comes to a total of $5,581,554.

Lianne Dalziel said that one bulk-funded school in her electorate will receive less money this year than it did last year. However, she said this was not a punishment to those schools that chose bulk-funding and have had a considerable financial advantage over other schools. "Some of those schools will find they receive less, but this is to be expected as all schools are put back on an even keel," she said.

The other three bulk-funded schools in her electorate will gain as a result of today's announcement. "The biggest winner in dollar terms is Aranui, where the money will be most welcome, and the biggest winner in percentage terms is Bromley, with a 28.8 percent increase in funding."

"I will be visiting all schools in my electorate over the next few months and will be very keen to receive feedback on what the increase funding will mean for them in practical terms. I know there are many exciting initiatives taking place in schools in Christchurch East and the additional funding will enable many of those to be expanded," she said.

Hon Ruth Dyson, MP for Banks Peninsula, also said today that schools were being put on a more equal footing, and that most will receive more money as a result.

"Some schools will receive very significant increases as a result of a new, fairer funding formula which takes into account socio-economic factors, as well as ironing out funding inequities arising from the previous Government's policies," she said.

"Part of this government package includes new arrangements to give schools more flexibility about how they use their operational funding," Ruth Dyson said.

Tim Barnett, MP for Christchurch Central, said: "Some of the schools in my electorate are gaining the most under this announcement."

Phillipstown School will receive a 27.8 percent boost in its funding for next year, amounting to an extra $67,647. "There can be few more effective ways of closing the gaps in our society," Tim Barnett said.
