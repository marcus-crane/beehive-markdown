Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Sandra Lee congratulated her colleague, Hon Parekura Horomia, today for achieving what three other Ministers of Maori Affairs had unsuccessfully attempted to do.

"The representation on the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission (Te Ohu Kai Moana) has been a volatile issue since the commission's inception, " Ms Lee said.

"The debate surrounding the allocation model is now well-recorded in the annals of all the courts of this land. It has been divisive for Maori and confusing to the general public," she said.

"It is my earnest hope that the new broom will sweep away the old baggage and herald a new cooperative approach on the part of the Fisheries Commission," Ms Lee said.

"The new Minister of Maori Affairs has done well to fulfil the High Court's instructions to the Crown to abide by its own laws and get on with appointing the Fisheries Commission."
