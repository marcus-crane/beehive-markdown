The Government is no longer considering two Christchurch sites for the location of the proposed Youth Justice Residential Centre – South, the Minister of Social Services and Employment Steve Maharey, has announced.

Both sites are located in Templeton; the Dawsons Road site is next to the Templeton Centre and the Paparua site is located on the Christchurch Prison farm.

Mr Maharey says both sites were identified by the previous government as possible options for building a new South Island Residential Centre for young people who have offended and come under the provisions of the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act.

“This government believes that neither site is suitable. Feedback from the local community indicated that if the Residential Centre was to be built in Templeton, they would prefer it to be on the Paparua site. However after considering a range of issues, the Government has decided that this is also not the best choice.

“The aim of the youth justice system is to divert young offenders from a career in crime and to halt their offending behaviour at an early stage.

“The Paparua site is located on prison land and is right next door to the area where the Government plans to build a new youth prison.

“Locating a youth justice centre within the confines of a prison does not send the right message to young people who we are trying to rehabilitate within a residential setting

“I am committed to finding a site for this facility as quickly as possible and have asked Child, Youth and Family to re-commence the search for a suitable location,” says Mr Maharey.
