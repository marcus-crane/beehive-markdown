**HON ANNETTE KING, MINISTER OF HEALTH**

Memorandum to Cabinet Social Policy and Health Committee

**Legislative Provisions for Treaty of Waitangi**

**PROPOSAL**

1. This paper proposes two options for a draft generic reference to the Treaty  
   of Waitangi (the Treaty) for inclusion in the New Zealand Public Health and  
   Disability Bill (the Bill). The generic reference will be an interim measure  
   pending completion of work on a more specified reference. The first option is  
   cautious with the aim of reducing the legal risks. The second option is a more  
   active provision and is more open ended with regard to the limits of the Treaty  
   obligations it imposes.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

1. This paper proposes an overall 'architecture' for a reference to the Treaty  
   of Waitangi, which will allow greater detail to be added when the further work  
   is complete. This architecture comprises:
   
   1. an overarching statement in the Bill's purpose statement, which links to:
   2. a generic reference to the Treaty, which links to:
   3. reference to specific provisions relating to the Treaty in the health and  
      disability sector.
2. The specific provisions would include, but not necessarily be confined to, a  
   range of provisions already in the draft Bill that have Treaty aspects. As well  
   as some more indirect provisions which empower DHBs to meet their objectives  
   with regard to Maori health, provisions with direct Treaty implications include:
   
   1. a requirement that DHBs establish partnership agreements with the iwi of  
      their regions
   2. Maori representation on DHB boards and committees
   3. objectives for DHBs which include reducing Maori health disparities, and DHB  
      functions which include working with Maori to increase Maori capacity to meet  
      their own health and disability needs
   4. requirements on DHBs to consult with Maori.
3. Two options are proposed for giving effect to the Government's intentions  
   for a Treaty reference in the Bill using the proposed architecture:
   
   1. The first option is based on the Te Puni Kokiri Bill provision, which  
      requires the Act to "be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the  
      principles of the Treaty of Waitangi". Officials recommend this option as it  
      establishes some boundaries on the application of the Treaty, so is the least  
      risk of the two options with regard to potential litigation.
   2. The second option is based on the Conservation Act 1987 provision, and  
      requires the Act to be "interpreted and administered in a manner that gives  
      effect to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi". The option creates more  
      positive and substantive obligations with regard to the Treaty and establishes  
      fewer boundaries. It would therefore be associated with a litigation risk and a  
      greater likelihood that the Courts would attempt to define the Treaty's  
      application in the sector. It is likely, however, to be viewed with greater  
      favour by many Maori as it places fewer limits on the application of the Treaty  
      to the sector.
4. The further work to develop the specificity of the provision will be carried  
   out by an interdepartmental working group, drawing on advice from expert Maori,  
   and reporting to Ministers by 31 August 2000. The Bill is scheduled for  
   introduction on 31 July 2000. It is possible that the results of the further  
   work could be included in the Bill at the Select Committee stage, or, failing  
   that, by Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the Whole House stage of  
   the Bill.

**BACKGROUND**

1. On 20 June 2000, the Cabinet Social Policy and Health Committee:
   
   1. directed officials from the Ministries of Justice and Health and the Crown  
      Law Office, in consultation with other agencies as required, to undertake  
      further work on inclusion in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill  
      of a general reference to the Treaty of Waitangi with more detailed  
      specification of how the principles of the Treaty would be implemented; and to  
      report back to the Social Policy and Health Committee as soon as possible
   2. agreed that, pending completion of the work referred to in paragraph i)  
      above, at a minimum a generic clause would be included in the Bill
   3. agreed that this clause will give effect to the Government's commitment to:
      
      1. ensure an effective partnership between Maori and the Crown in the health  
         and disability sector
      2. accelerate progress towards parity between Maori and non-Maori health
   4. invited the Minister of Health to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office  
      to draft a generic Treaty clause for interim inclusion in the Bill
   5. directed officials to include in the report referred to in paragraph i)  
      above, comment on the alignment between the Treaty clause and other provisions  
      in the Bill, compliance with relevant international and human rights  
      instruments, and any legal risks \[CAB (00) M 21/17 refers].

**Existing provisions in the draft Bill with relevance to the Treaty**

1. The draft Bill already provides for a number of government policies with  
   direct or indirect Treaty aspects These provisions reflect the Treaty principles  
   of partnership, participation and protection, and create a foundation on which  
   to build an explicit Treaty reference. Beyond a set of core obligations, the  
   provisions, in general, are intended to be flexible and enabling rather than  
   prescriptive. The Treaty related provisions are summarised below, and set out in  
   greater detail in Appendix One.
2. Provisions with **direct** relevance to the Treaty include the following:
   
   1. requirements that DHBs to establish Treaty-based partnership agreements with  
      the iwi of their regions
   2. provisions for Maori representation on DHB boards and their committees, and  
      training of DHB board members on Maori health and Treaty issues
   3. giving DHB explicit objectives and functions for Maori health, such as  
      reducing Maori health disparities and working with Maori to build their own  
      health capacity
   4. requirements for DHBs to consult with the Maori communities in their area
   5. requirements that DHBs be good employers of Maori, including recognising the  
      aims and aspirations of Maori
   6. requirements that DHBs report on their performance with regard to their  
      Maori health objectives and functions, including spending on Maori health.
3. Other more general and **indirect** provisions are designed to empower  
   DHBs to achieve their Maori health objectives, for example through collaboration  
   with other DHBs and agencies in other sectors that impact on health outcomes.
   
   Others provide the Minister of Health with a range of levers to use in ensure  
   the achievement of Maori health and Treaty-related objectives, including an  
   ability to issue New Zealand Health and Disability Strategies, to make funding  
   agreements with DHBs, to issue directions to, and require information from,  
   DHBs, and to appoint Crown Monitors if there are concerns with their  
   performance, as well as a range of other sanctions and rewards.
   
   Working through the exact relationship between these policies and the interim  
   generic reference will be one task in the more detailed work.
