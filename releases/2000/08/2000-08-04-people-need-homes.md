Income related rents will enhance the quality of life of thousands of low-income state house tenants, families and households the Minister of Housing Mark Gosche said today.

"State house tenants have huge difficulties paying market rents," said Mr Gosche.

"Market rents have failed and we are left with the same problems that faced the 1937 Labour Government. Their answer was to make sure affordable, suitable housing was available for those in need and the answer hasn't changed."

"Last year 79% of Housing New Zealand applications to the Tenancy Tribunal were for rent arrears - this was higher than that for private landlords,"

"Furthermore this year's Poverty Measurement Report found that more than 70% of all Housing New Zealand tenants experienced poverty compared to around 35% of those living in private accommodation."

The Government moved closer to restoring income related rents for low income state tenants today with the final reading of the Housing Restructuring (Income Related Rents) Amendment Bill in Parliament today.

"Low income people living in private dwellings will still benefit from an accommodation supplement that costs the Government around $800 million a year", said Mr Gosche.

"Decent, affordable housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of all people."

Mr Gosche quoted 1937 Labour Finance Minister Walter Nash at the opening of New Zealand's first state house.

"People could not have homes without houses," he said.

"And it would just not do to have two homes in one house."
