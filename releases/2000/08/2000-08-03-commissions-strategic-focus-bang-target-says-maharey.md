Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey says the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission has correctly identified the central importance of government becoming an active partner with insitutions reshaping our tertiary education system for the 21st century.

The Commission released its initial report, Shaping A Shared Vision, this morning. The need to refocus our tertiary education system is urgent if New Zealand is to to meet the challenges of a globalised economy and a knowledge-based society and secure a properous future. The vital role that tertiary education makes to our society and culture needs to be recognised and strengthened.

Mr Maharey said he was pleased with the work programme the Commission has mapped out to concretely address the structural and strategic issues which are blocking the development of the tertiary sector.

"The Commission is to be commended on their initial report. The Government agrees that it is essential that the sector be given clear strategic leadership.

"The future for New Zealand is in the knowledge industries. We must ensure that New Zealanders can apply their knowledge in innovative ways to the natural resources we have a deservedly high reputation for. The pressure on the tertiary sector is to properly equip our young people to be the innovators.

"The Commission has set out a solid programme of work to concretely address the blocks in the system. Better harnessing the resources we currently have at our disposal, and sharing expertise across the system are the key ingredients of future success.

"The Government made a commitment to New Zealanders to foster diversity and excellence in tertiary education. I am pleased that the Commission has embraced its role in this mission and I look forward to working with it and stakeholders as we cement in a positive agenda for change for tertiary education," Steve Maharey said.
