The commercial fishing season for rock lobster in the Gisborne area is being extended by a month to the end of September 2000, Minister of Fisheries Pete Hodgson said today.

"The extension to the fishing season is in response to bad weather in the Gisborne area that has prevented fishing for significant periods in winter," Mr Hodgson said. "Fishers are very concerned that their catches have been much lower than in previous years, putting them under significant economic pressure."

"Opening the season for an extra month in September will give commercial fishers a greater opportunity to catch rock lobster from the CRA 3 area when prices for lobster are high, without jeopardising the sustainability of the stock."

Mr Hodgson said fishing would continue to be restrained by the Total Allowable Commercial Catch for the year of 327 tonnes.

The CRA 3 fishing area extends from Wairoa to East Cape. The regular open season for the fishery is from 1 February to 30 April and 1 June to 31 August.
