Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins is concerned about reports that a few Police officers have been moonlighting.

“Police officers are highly paid. And the majority of officers utilise their skills investigating crime, catching criminals, and advancing their careers in the Police,” George Hawkins said.

“There is no reason why some Police officers should be preoccupied with money-making ventures on the side.

“While moonlighters may have well developed entrepreneurial skills, these would be best applied to their choice of career and used to develop innovation and initiative in catching crooks.

“The Government has invested tens of millions of extra dollars to ensure the Police are resourced to enforce the laws of New Zealand and to deliver proactive programmes designed to reduce crime.

“Every officer must be focussed on delivering law and order services to our communities.

“There is no room for moonlighters who have one eye on Police matters and another on what business opportunities they can prosper on.

“I will be discussing this moonlighting issue with the Commissioner of Police at our regular weekly meeting on Monday,” George Hawkins said.
