It would be disappointing if the Singapore Closer Economic Partnership agreement was not debated in Parliament, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The procedure for trade agreements currently is that the final text goes to a select committee – generally, the Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade Select Committee – for consideration. At that stage, the public can comment on the treaty text.

The select committee then reports to the House.

Mr Sutton said he believed that the House should then debate the select committee's report.

However, that was a decision for Cabinet and would be considered by the Leader of the House.

"I would be disappointed if Parliament didn't have a full scale debate in response when it receives the report of the select committee. The importance of this treaty certainly warrants that."
