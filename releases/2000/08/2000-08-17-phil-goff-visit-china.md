Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff leaves Sunday 20 August for his first visit to China as Foreign Minister.

"The Chinese relationship is a critical one for New Zealand, both in diplomatic and economic terms," Mr Goff said.

"China is now New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner and an increasingly important market and investment destination for New Zealand firms. Education and tourism links are expanding rapidly.

"Promoting New Zealand as an attractive and internationally competitive educational destination for Chinese students is one of the key objectives for this visit.

"At the diplomatic level, meetings with Premier Zhu Rongji, as well as Foreign Minister Mr Tang Jiaxuan and Justice Minister, Mr Gao Chengli will cover such issues as regional security, developments on the Korean Peninsula, the South Pacific, and East Timor.

"Our views on human rights and Taiwan will also be on the agenda, as will the importance that New Zealand attaches to China’s participation in the WTO, and to the resolution of the outstanding difficulties New Zealand faces over the wool quota.

In addition to his official talks Mr Goff will meet with New Zealand business representatives in China, both in Beijing and in Hangzhou, where he will visit New Zealand companies, and speak at an education seminar. He will also meet with provincial leaders in Xi’an.

Mr Goff will return to New Zealand on 25 August.
