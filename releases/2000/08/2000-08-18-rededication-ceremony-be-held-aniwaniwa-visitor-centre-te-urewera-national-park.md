The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the rededication of the Aniwaniwa Visitor Centre, which has been refurbished along with the remounting of a Colin McCahon painting, has been scheduled for 22 September.

Ms Lee said she had engaged in discussions with a wide range of interested parties and was confident that the rededication of the Centre would be welcomed by all.

"I am hopeful that the entire community will join in the occasion, from the Chairman of the Tuhoe Trust Board to the younger Maori who had voiced concern about crown responsibilities," Ms Lee said.

She said issues that arose from the Ministerial inquiry conducted under the previous Minister of Conservation Nick Smith, including unsafe structures on one of the roads, the illegal logging of our precious native forests within the DOC estate, concerns about the sewerage system at the Visitor Centre itself, and the relationship between the tangata whenua and their Lake were all being addressed by her and her colleague, Treaty Settlements Minister Hon Margaret Wilson.

"I look forward to the initiative the Government is now taking achieving a win-win outcome for this significant National Park, in order to ensure the debacle involving the theft of the McCahon painting and the ensuing occupation is not repeated," Ms Lee said.
