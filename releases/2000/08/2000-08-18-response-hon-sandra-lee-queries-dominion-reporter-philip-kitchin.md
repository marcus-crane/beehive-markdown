"I have raised concerns about the safety of the three bridges along the Maungapohatu road.

"The Department of Conservation erected signs advising of the danger of these three bridges, warning the public not to go over them.

"I am advised by my Department that they have an engineering report that confirmed that not only are the bridges unsafe for the public but that the road is unsafe as well.

"Given Cave Creek, it is only responsible to ensure that the public can traverse this road in safety.

"Given also my now vicarious responsibility as Minister, in the wake of Cave Creek, I am ultimately responsible for the safety of the public on the DOC estate.

"A number of people have raised concerns regarding the unsafe bridges, including some Tuhoe Trust Board members, some of the local rangatahi (young people) and other users.

"On the issue of where the money is to come from, queries are best directed to the Director-General of DOC.  
"I am aware that my local Conservation Board is desirous that they do not have to make a full contribution.

"I am sure that the Director General will have regard to their views, and it is my desire that it fall under DOC’s national asset management plan.

"The matter of Nohoanga is borne out of Nick Smith’s Ministerial inquiry, post-theft and occupation, and is contained within the recommendations.

"That issue is being worked through cognisant of the fact that cooperation and consultation is vital, given the fact that Tuhoe own the Lake bed which we lease from them (note: the 1971 Lake Waikaremoana Act vested the lake in them), and that the so-called “lake bed” includes a lot of dry land around the edge of the Lake.

"There are a huge number of stakeholders involved with the Te Urewera National Park.

"In my time as Minister, that has required me to listen to all concerns, and I have done so.

"Ultimately, all stakeholders and the Crown must keep foremost in their minds that this National Park and the taonga contained in it must be preserved in the interest of all who love it, regardless of the particular organisation they belong to, or the views they have on best management practice."
