Better representation of Pacific people in health sector

The Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Mark Gosche said today that he was pleased to see a strong representation of Pacific peoples on New Zealand's District Health Boards.

"Eight of the 79 new health directors are Pacific peoples - this is a good thing for the sector and our communities," he said.

"Statistics tell us that Pacific communities are high health care users and it is important that this is reflected in our health boards."

Prior to the new appointments there had been one Pacific Health and Hospital Services Board member but he had recently resigned.

"The health boards focus is to help restore community involvement and ownership of health at local levels."

"That's why District Health Boards must reflect the communities they represent and that's why Pacific peoples must be involved."

Mr Gosche said the board members would also serve the needs of all New Zealanders.

"All board members will serve the interests of the whole community. The primary accountability of all members is to my colleague the Minister of Health, Annette King."

"I am convinced that a health system that reflects its communities is a health system that will address the needs of its communities."

"Encouraging community participation in our health system will be an important way we can close health disparity gaps between Pacific peoples and other New Zealanders."

The eight appointees are:
