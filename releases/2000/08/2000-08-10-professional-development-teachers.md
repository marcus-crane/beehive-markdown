Secondary school teachers will have two days of professional development based around the new qualifications system until at least 2003.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that he was extending professional development provision for teachers working on the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA).

One day of each year would be a teacher only day and the second would be utilising one of the 'call back' days provided for in the teacher contracts. This year, two teacher only days have been made available for secondary school teachers to learn about the new system.

Trevor Mallard told the NCEA forum meeting in Wellington today that the feedback from the first of the professional development days has been encouraging.

"The days have been successful in bringing teachers together and opening up dialogue. The Government wants to see the professional exchanges between teachers continued. Such interchange will help to improve standards of teaching and assessment and help to keep expectations of achievement high.

"In each of 2002 and 2003 there will be two further full days of interschool teacher meetings focussed on the NCEA standards.

"I’m now so convinced of the value of the professional development; I’m persuaded that we should put in a teacher-only day each year. I will ask Boards to ensure that one of the “call-back” days next year is dedicated to matching this commitment so that there can be two days professional meetings each year for at least the next three years," Trevor Mallard said.
