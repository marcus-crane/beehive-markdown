Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today paid tribute to retiring Chief Executive of the Ministry of Economic Development Paul Carpinter.

Mr Carpinter will step down from his position from next February.

"The concept of public service has been devalued over recent years. But dedicated and professional public servants like Paul Carpinter prove that public service remains an honourable profession," Jim Anderton said.

"I first met Paul Carpinter when he was a young economist working in the office of then Labour Party leader Bill Rowling. We have not always agreed on policy issues but I have always respected and admired his dedication, ability and integrity.

"Since this government was elected Paul has worked tirelessly to create Industry NZ and the Ministry of Economic Development. He has taken to this government's partnership approach with business with gusto.

"I am hopeful that he can be persuaded to continue to contribute to the public sector in some way in the future," Jim Anderton said.
