The New Zealand subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company, Merck Sharp and Dohme will get a 12.5 percent boost to their research budget under proposed tax law changes.

The changes are part of a package of GST reforms contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.

"They zero rate services provided to non-residents in relation to exported goods and also information services provided to non-residents that involve goods in New Zealand," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.
