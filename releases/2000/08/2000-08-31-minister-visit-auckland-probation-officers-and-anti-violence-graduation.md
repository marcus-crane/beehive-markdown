Minister of Corrections Matt Robson will meet with South Auckland probation officers tomorrow.

"I'm keen to meet with staff on the ground. These are the people who deal every day with offenders. The job they do is vital and I don't want that work compromised. I need to know where they are struggling and how together we can try to fix the problems," says Matt Robson.

TIME:11.00am-11.30am

The Minister will also attend the graduation of twelve offenders from the Department of Corrections' marae-based violence prevention programme – He Tete Kura Mana Tangata.

"I am particularly proud of this programme. It targets violence prevention for Maori offenders on periodic detention using techniques based on Maori cultural values and beliefs. It's our most effective way of reaching these offenders and reducing re-offending," says Matt Robson.
