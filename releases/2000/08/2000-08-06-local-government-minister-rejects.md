"Murray McCully's outburst regarding Carol Stigley and the Government's relations with Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ), while predictable, is factually incorrect," Local Government Minister Sandra Lee responded tonight. "LGNZ is an independent organisation for which I have no ministerial responsibility. "Both the Prime Minister and I have enjoyed a constructive and compatible working relationship with this organisation not only while in government but for many years beforehand when we were in opposition. "Only last Thursday evening, I had a long and amicable conversation with Carol at a Conservation Week function in Wellington, during which I wished her well for her future. "The Government is firm in its commitment for a meaningful partnership with local government, and I as Minister am working closely with LGNZ and all its executives in order to address many of the difficulties the local government sector has been confronted with as a direct result of indifference from Murray McCully's government. "Mr McCully would do well to remember that opportunistic attacks such as this on the Government also potentially impact on the careers of others who are not part of the Government nor responsible to it," she said.
