Foreign Minister Phil Goff leaves this afternoon for Apia to attend a weekend meeting of the South Pacific Forum.

"This is the first ever meeting of South Pacific Forum Foreign Ministers and the first time the Forum has met in response to specific events in the region.

"It has been called to examine the implications of the events in Fiji and the Solomon Islands for the Pacific.

"Discussion will focus on what efforts can be made to help resolve the situation in each country.

"New Zealand and Australia are currently active in promoting peace talks in the Solomon Islands, and the Forum meeting is likely to endorse those efforts.

"New Zealand will also be endeavouring to find ways by which the region can encourage the interim government in Fiji to restore democratic processes and put in place a non-racist constitution.

"The meeting will also discuss how the Forum can better collectively respond to any future crisis affecting any country in the region," Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff will arrive back in New Zealand on Sunday.
