New Zealand has pledged a further $200,000 towards reconstruction in Mozambique following the serious flooding which struck Southern Africa earlier this year, Associate Foreign Minister Matt Robson announced today.

The grant was pledged at the International Reconstruction Conference for Mozambique convened in Rome by the government of Mozambique and UNDP.

Matt Robson said the level of support for the reconstruction programme reflects the high standing Mozambique holds in the international community as a role model for Africa. Over the last four years Mozambique has maintained a growth rate of 10% per annum and can claim a strong record in supporting poverty alleviation and good governance.

“Mozambique has been a success story for international development but the flooding has had a disastrous impact. New Zealand’s grant to the reconstruction programme will help to ensure that the economic and social gains made by Mozambique over the past decade will not be lost,” says Matt Robson.

The grant will be made from New Zealand’s Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme.
