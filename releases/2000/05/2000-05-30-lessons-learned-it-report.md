State Services Minister Trevor Mallard says an independent report into information technology reports in the public sector contains some valuable lessons for Government.

Trevor Mallard released the report, Information Technology projects: performance of the New Zealand public sector in perspective today.

¡§In particular, the report contains some clear lessons on the ingredients to seek or avoid in designing and executing IT projects," Trevor Mallard said.

The lessons were:

„h project risk increases with project size and duration, so special attention needs to be paid to large projects;

„h project management skills are essential to the conduct of complex IT projects;

„h risk of failure increases with the extent of development activity; and

„h in almost all cases, it is sensible to avoid using leading edge but untried technology.

¡§This is good advice that I would expect public sector managers to take very seriously in order to avoid the mistakes of the past,¡¨ Trevor Mallard said.

Overall the report concludes that the New Zealand public sector appears to be meeting international and local standards in terms of managing IT projects.

Commissioned by the previous government, the review was a joint undertaking by the Simpl Group ¡V an organisation involved in project management, management consulting and IT systems development and implementation ¡V and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.

The report followed government concerns over the management of two significant public sector IT projects, the NZ Police¡¦s INCIS project and INSLAW, the Department of Court¡¦s case management project. Both projects have been cancelled. As they were the subject of other reviews, they were not included in this study.

The reviewers compared IT management in the public sector against New Zealand¡¦s private sector and IT projects in the US.

Trevor Mallard said that it was reassuring to learn that most public sector IT projects were being properly managed.

"But the Government will use this report to look at how we can ensure that public funds are not wasted on information technology projects," he said.
