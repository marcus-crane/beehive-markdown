Mr Saeidi Kia, Iranian Minister of Construction Jihad, is visiting New Zealand this week for high level trade and economic consultations, Hon Jim Sutton, Minister for Trade Negotiations said today.

Mr Kia, who has responsibility for rural development, forests, rangelands and fisheries, will visit Rotorua, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch and meet with New Zealand private sector with interests in Iran.

He will also make a range of ministerial calls.

The focal point of the visit will be the seventh Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) jointly chaired by Mr Kia and Mr Sutton. This will review trade in traditional exports - dairy, meat, and wool - and cover new areas such as communications, energy and consultancies in postal services, and education.

Various private sector companies will be involved in making presentations to the JMC.

Mr Kia is accompanied by eight officials and four delegates from import companies which buy New Zealand products. A representative of the Iranian National Oil Company is also part of the delegation.

The Joint Ministerial Commission is the only formal ministerial and senior officials dialogue between the two countries. The last JMC was held in Tehran in 1996.

Mr Sutton said the JMC provided a useful opportunity for dialogue with Iran at a high level and for exploring ways of consolidating and diversifying the trade relationship.

"The private sectors from both sides will be directly participating in the Commission, providing the opportunity to explore new areas of cooperation."

New Zealand’s export trade with Iran was $58 million in the year ending December comprising mainly dairy, wool and fish. In the same period New Zealand imported $34 million of Iranian goods - comprising mainly oil, fruit and nuts.
