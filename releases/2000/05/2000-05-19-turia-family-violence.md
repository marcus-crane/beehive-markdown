I believe the strengthening of our whanau is the most critical development issue we are facing today, says Hon Tariana Turia.

"Violence within our whanau has a significant impact on all areas of life – education, income, employment, health, and on the basic well being of families and communities.

This week the Government announced an extra $1.9 million in this years budget for specialist family violence programmes.

"This resource must reach those that need it. As government, we must provide support to families that will ensure our children can grow up in a healthy and safe home environment.

"Family violence is closely related to other forms of violence in society today. Instead of reprimanding or dictating to families, we need to assist them with the causes of their problems. This will better equip them to deal with problems they will face in the future.

"Individual problems cannot be addressed in isolation, there must be a whole family and whole community approach if we are to resolve violence issues within families.

"The current statement, New Zealand Government Statement of Policy on Family Violence was first published in 1996. We need to establish whether the statement of policy on family violence is still is able to pro-actively support a reduction in the amount of family violence in New Zealand.

"I will be discussing my concerns with other Ministers and expecting increased collaboration between all Government agencies in order to assist families find long-term solutions to the causes of family violence that will work for them.

"Family violence is unacceptable, just as the lack of a coordinated government approach to support families to overcome the causes of family violence in the past is unacceptable to this government," said Hon Tariana Turia today.
