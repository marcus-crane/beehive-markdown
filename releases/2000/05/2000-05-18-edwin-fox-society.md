Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced that the government would contribute $300,000 this year towards the restoration of the Picton-based historic sailing ship, the Edwin Fox.

Helen Clark said that the Edwin Fox is of huge historic significance and when restored and presented has the potential to greatly enhance the attraction of Picton as a tourism destination.

"The sailing ship Edwin Fox has been given a Category 1 Registration by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in recognition of the ship’s heritage significance.

"It was built in India in 1853. It is the only surviving wooden troopship that served in the Crimean War in 1854, the only surviving wooden convict ship to Australia,1858, and the only surviving wooden immigrant ship to New Zealand, 1873.

"The Edwin Fox Society was formed to conserve the remains of the ship on the Picton foreshore. A graving dock has been constructed to meet short-term conservation needs. Now a roof needs to be built over the dock to prevent the damaging effects of rain and sun on the timbers of the ship.

"The Government’s grant helps meet the cost of this project and ensure the long-term conservation of the Edwin Fox," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark will be visiting the Edwin Fox on Saturday to meet the restoration team and discuss the project.
