The Government is inviting interest from potential partners to sponsor parts of a two day e-commerce summit later this year.

Acting Minister of Information Technology Trevor Mallard said the IT policy team in the Ministry of Economic Development has been approached by many businesses and organisations wanting to be involved in the summit.

The Government plans to host a two-day E-Commerce Summit in early October at the Aotea Centre in Auckland.  
"The level of unsolicited interest in sponsoring the summit has been high," he said.

"Given there may be interest from other players, who have not been pro-active or  
don't know that sponsorship and partnership is being considered, we believe it is important to publicise the fact that there are a number of such opportunities .

"A letter and briefing note is being sent to those who have approached us to sponsor  
the summit and to other potentially interested partners.

"The Summit Steering Group will then assess responses and select those which  
would enable a positive contribution and support Government’s focus for the event,"  
Trevor Mallard said.

The e-commerce summit will have a number of objectives including gathering feedback on the government's draft e-commerce strategy, a forum where businesses can learn more about e-commerce and to increase overall public awareness of e-commerce and its importance to New Zealand.
