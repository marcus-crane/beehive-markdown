Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today that Creative New Zealand would receive an extra $20 million this financial year to allow it to enter into longer term funding arrangements with major arts organisations over the next three years.

Helen Clark said that Creative NZ's $20 million injection is equivalent to increasing its annual Vote by $6.33 million in each of the next three years.

"By receiving the amount in a single lump sum now, Creative NZ will be able to make longer term, multi-year commitments to key performing arts organisations, giving them unprecedented security of funding.

"Over the past few years, Creative NZ has faced increasing difficulty in attempting to meet its mandate to encourage, promote and support the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Funding has remained static for many years, with the growing pressure on its funds meaning Creative NZ has only been able to provide approximately $1 for every $5 requested.

"New Zealand is fortunate to have many excellent performing arts organisations. They deserve the opportunity to plan with certainty. Also, the injection of funds will free up more of Creative NZ's ongoing funding for other arts projects."

Creative NZ is a Crown entity operating under the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 1994, with the purpose of encouraging, promoting and supporting the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The Act establishes an Arts Council and two arts boards.

The Council is responsible for overall policy development and determines the division of funding between the arts boards. The Arts Board supports the arts of all New Zealanders - including Pacific Island arts, for which a special subcommittee is established under the legislation - through the allocation of funding to specific arts projects, organisations and artists. Te Waka Toi is responsible for Maori arts.
