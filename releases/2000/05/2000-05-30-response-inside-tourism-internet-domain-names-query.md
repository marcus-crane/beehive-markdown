The Department of Conservation is aware that businessman Clint Tauri has registered several internet domain names, including fiordlandnationalpark.co.nz, as well as fiordlandnationalpark.com. He appears to be following a practice DOC identified as long ago as 1997, when a Milford Track guided walks operator registered the internet domain "milfordtrack.co.nz". This practice is legal, and in common use.

It is regarded as quite different from so-called "cyber squatting". Cyber squatting occurs where someone registers an internet domain name to which they have no "real" commercial links, in the hope of later selling or renting it to someone with a "real" commercial or other interest in the name. The courts have indicated they will provide some protection against cyber squatting, for example where such an action can be shown to mislead people.

It is standard practice for web site owners to protect themselves by registering other names that might be useful to them. The Department of Conservation has registered several internet domain names, for example "conservation.co.nz" and "nationalparks.co.nz". However DOC advises it has no interest in the internet domain names registered by Clint Tauri.
