Ponsonby's 103-year-old community centre, gutted by fire last year, was reopened by Auckland Central MPJudith Tizard today.

"It's both a relief and a pleasure to have this marvellous facility open again to the public", said the Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage.  
"You don't realise how valuable something is until it's gone and I would like to congratulate the Auckland City Council and Ponsonby Community Centre Incorporated for the work they have done rebuilding the centre", she said.  
"What we see today is a facility that is even better than it was before the fire last August".

Rooms in the newly-refurbished centre are named after colourful local personalities and the architecture retains the building's historical features.  
Improvements include acoustic insulation, new floors and fittings, improved lighting and security alarms, showers and disabled facilities.

The centre, originally built in 1897, was extensively damaged by fire after a suspected arson attack. Most of the upper floor was destroyed and the lower floor suffered major smoke and water damage.

Users of the centre, including the Citizens Advice Bureau, Ponsonby Kids Care and Ponsonby Yoga School, were forced to relocate to the former Bayfield School site in Herne Bay.

While the Ponsonby Community Centre was not a listed heritage building, the Auckland City Council was keen to preserve its heritage features and gave a $40,000 grant towards improvements, over and above the insurance payout.  
Heritage architects and builders began rebuilding the centre last November.
