Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today that Te Papa's funding was increasing by $11 million a year - $2 million per annum for its operations and $9 million per annum as a capital contribution.

Helen Clark said the government recognised that Te Papa's previous level of funding had left the organisation on a knife edge in terms of its financial viability.

"The post-election briefing papers released in January highlighted the extent of Te Papa's financial woes. Today's announcement shows that the government views Te Papa's funding problems very seriously, and we have now moved to address the issues.

"The $2 million for operations is required to maintain the current level of Te Papa's services.

"The $9 million for new capital funding will be used for exhibitions development and renewal, and includes an annual $3 million acquisitions budget.

"The government wants Te Papa to be viable in every sense. That is why extra funding is being injected now," Helen Clark said.
