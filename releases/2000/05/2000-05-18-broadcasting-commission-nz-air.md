The government today announced that it is providing NZ On Air with an immediate cash injection of up to $27.9 million to make-up for a cash shortfall stemming from the previous government's sudden decision to abolish the Broadcasting Fee.

In addition, NZ On Air will receive an extra $7 million annually in operating funding over and above its previous budget baseline.

"This will enable more local content on radio and television, and honours another election pledge," Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said

Helen Clark said today that NZ On Air had been left in a parlous fiscal position as a result of the National's government abrupt abolition of the Broadcasting Fee and its failure to provide adequate replacement funding.

"Unfortunately many New Zealanders had stopped paying the Fee prior to its final phase out, leaving New Zealand ON Air well short of its normal revenue collection.

"NZ On Air has advised the government that it is unable to collect a significant proportion of the outstanding and remaining payments of the Broadcasting Fee.

"Loss of this income has had a significant effect on NZ On Air's ability to meet its funding commitments entered into prior to the decision to abolish the Fee. The cash injection will ensure that NZ On Air is not disadvantaged by that decision of the previous government.

"The government has also decided to increase the operating budget by $7 million a year over and above the past full income of NZ On Air. Two million dollars of this will be directed towards NZ On Air's music-related work, and $5 million each year for New Zealand TV programmes, especially children's TV.

"Our new government has consistently said that it will support both New Zealand music and New Zealand children's television programmes. Today's funding announcement honours those commitments," Helen Clark said.
