State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today that he had agreed to a short time extension for the completion of the Ministerial Review into the Department of Work and Income New Zealand.

The report had been due at the end of April but the Minister had received a request for an extension from inquiry head Don Hunn.

"While I have not set a new deadline, I am confident that work on the review is very near completion and I look forward to receiving Mr Hunn's report."
