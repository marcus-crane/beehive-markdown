Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton strongly supports the Attorney General's inquiry into Trans Rail after the death of a rail worker in Christchurch yesterday.

"Trans Rail has had a long history of accidents, many of which have resulted in death. Five workers have been killed in the past seven months," Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said.

"This kind of history is unacceptable in today's modern work environment.

"If you add to this the uncaring attitude they took in relation to the injury of six year old Morgan Jones then an inquiry into their attitude to safety is needed.

"Trans Rail opposed the findings of two Transport Accident Investigation Commission reports in Morgan's case and the National government at the time allowed them to get away with it.

"Morgan Jones' family had to fight for years for the some realistic compensation for their son.

"Trans Rail's attitude to that case was appalling. It took a case to the High Court and a two year wait until Trans Rail finally paid compensation in an out of court deal.

"Given Trans Rail's history of dealing with accidents it is time a full independent inquiry was held," Jim Anderton said.
