Mr Anderton said his views on monetary policy are well known.

"The review of monetary policy will examine the question of whether the use of interest rates as the sole mechanism to target inflation is an appropriate way to operate monetary policy," Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said.

"Mr Brash is accountable for his decision today if it leads to an unnecessary decline in employment and growth," Jim Anderton said.
