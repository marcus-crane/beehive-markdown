Castle Hill is a very special spiritual place with deep and longstanding traditions says Conservation Minister, the Hon Sandra Lee.

"The spiritual importance of Kura Tawhiti is recognised by Tangata Whenua and the Crown by the topuni over the area," she said.

"The place is alive with tradition. It is a personally significant area."

The Department of Conservation was working with Tangata Whenua to ensure protection for that area of Castle Hill managed by the department, Ms Lee said.

Ms Lee confirmed that should they become available the department would be interested in acquiring freehold areas of importance.
