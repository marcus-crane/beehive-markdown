Education Minister Trevor Mallard said he had received interim reports from both the Education Review Office and the Ministry of Education on the current situation at St Stephen's School in Bombay.

He said the reports did not relieve his concern about the level of violence at the school.

"There has been a lot of extra resources put into St Stephen's School but there is doubt about whether these are proving successful. It is quite likely that more significant change is needed.

"I am expecting more reports on the school by early next week.

"I will consider these carefully before starting discussions with the school," Trevor Mallard.
