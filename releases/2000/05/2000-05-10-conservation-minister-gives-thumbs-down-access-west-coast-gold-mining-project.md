The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has declined access to West Coast conservation land subject to a gold mining proposal from Christchurch businessman William Gardner

She says Mr Gardner originally applied for access to mine for gold in a 20-hectare beech area on the west bank of the Maruia River north of Springs Junction, near the Lewis Park, but later changed his proposal to cover only 8-hectares.

"After meeting with Mr Gardner to consider his personal representations and also weighing carefully a Department of Conservation evaluation of Mr Gardner's modified proposal, I have concluded that the conservation assets of the area could not be adequately protected from damage by allowing access to the proposed mining."

"The area's assets include red beech forest and native bird habitats," she said. "While parasite activity has affected about 20 percent of trees in the area, DOC has concluded it is a part of the natural life cycle of the forest and not a factor in favour of allowing mining access."

"I am aware of a high level of public interest during the past couple of months in applications for mining on the West Coast," Ms Lee added.

"While the Government has been concerned to minimise delays in decision-making, at the same time appropriate weight must be given to the complex considerations raised by each individual application," she said.
