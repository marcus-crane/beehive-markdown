The Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey, met with members of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission today as the group got down to work.

The Commission, which was meeting for the first time today in Wellington, will advise the Government on how it can ensure tertiary education provision meets New Zealanders' needs in the knowledge society. Mr Maharey said he was pleased the Government has been able to bring together such a strong Commission able to draw on considerable expertise and knowledge of the tertiary education environment.

"This Government has made a strong commitment to ensuring all New Zealanders have the skills needed to succeed in tomorrow's knowledge society. We moved quickly to lower the cost of tertiary study with our changes to the loans scheme because we know that we must invest in people if our economy and society are to prosper.

"The formation of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission shows we are equally serious about getting the tertiary education system right. National created a tertiary education marketplace, putting at risk educational standards and threatening regional provision for the sake of ideological purity.

"Enough is now enough. I have asked the Commission to help me build a cooperative, collaborative and specialised tertiary sector that can respond to New Zealanders needs and properly equip us for the future.

"Today's first Commission meeting signals the start of a new focus on a quality, accessible tertiary education system. Last year we said we would commit this Government to reinvesting in excellence and focusing on our ability to build the skills of New Zealanders.

"I am pleased that TEAC has begun working on this project and I look forward to working with them over the coming years to get our tertiary system back on track," Steve Maharey said.

Tertiary Education Advisory Commission  
Summarised terms of reference

Education provided by tertiary education providers is vitally important to New Zealand building a true knowledge society and achieving economic benefits. The quality of our knowledge and skills base will determine our future success in the global economy and as a cohesive society.

Government's vision for the Tertiary Education Sector  
In order to become a world-leading knowledge society that provides all New Zealanders with opportunities for lifelong learning, New Zealand needs:  
 a more co-operative and collaborative tertiary education sector;  
 a commitment to excellence in teaching, scholarship and research;  
 a greater sense of partnership between the key contributors to the sector;  
 a commitment to the nation's future direction by all those involved in the sector,  
 an environment where participation by all is encouraged  
 an environment where the needs of Mäori are supported, and which gives recognition to the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles;  
 a sector that fully supports regional and local communities; and  
 well-managed institutions and providers that work together to meet the education and research needs of the nation.

The Commission's Role  
The Commission is a Ministerial advisory body that will provide advice to the Minister on the strategic direction, and will carry out further specific reviews as agreed with the Minister. The work of the Commission will focus on the sector as a whole rather than on individual institutions.

The Commission's Work  
The Commission will initially develop a strategic direction for tertiary education in New Zealand. The initial work will involve the fleshing out of Government’s vision for tertiary education that will best serve New Zealand’s human capability development into the future. The aim shall be to produce a high–level strategic direction which has wide acceptance that will endure over the medium to longer term.

Over the term of this Government the Commission will be asked to provide advice on:  
 the future 'shape' of the sector;  
 opportunities for increased collaboration and co-operation;  
 how tertiary providers and students can be best positioned to provide and participate in courses of study that complement New Zealand’s social, economic and regional needs;  
 the basic principles to guide funding for research in tertiary education; and  
 the basic principles to guide Government’s approach to financial support for tertiary education that recognise the differing cost of different education content.

Commission Membership  
The Commission will comprise up to eight strategic thinkers selected for their vision, expertise and credibility. They will have the ability to reflect upon the outcomes sought from tertiary education, evaluate approaches, and find innovative solutions to complex problems. There will be an appropriate balance of gender and ethnicity, public/private sector, education/research/business/community, Maori, and international/New Zealand expertise on the Commission.
