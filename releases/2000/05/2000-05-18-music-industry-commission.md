The government is to contribute $2 million over five years to a newly established Music Industry Commission. This non-government body will support the development of contemporary New Zealand popular music.

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said the funding was an investment in the future of contemporary New Zealand music and would help to foster employment opportunities in the music industry.

"New Zealand's music industry has huge commercial potential. Our investment in the new Music Industry Commission will give the industry the backing it needs to increase the contribution of New Zealand music to the economy and to our foreign exchange earnings," Helen Clark said.

"The Commission is an initiative of the music industry. The previous National government made a belated promise to establish an industry forum just prior to last year's election. This government has worked closely with key music industry figures to create a new body to take the industry forward.

"The Commission's objectives include the fostering of New Zealand popular music composition, performance, recording and marketing. It will promote New Zealand popular music nationally and internationally. It will also create a forum for the popular music industry, act as an advocate for the industry, and play an educational role.

"Furthermore, the Commission will complement the activities of Creative New Zealand and NZ On Air in advancing the cause of NZ popular music.

"As a non-governmental body, the Commission will be accountable to government for the public money it receives. Its agreement with the government will emphasise the importance of the Commission also raising money from industry sources."

The Music Industry Commission will be governed by a Board of Trustees representing the broad range of interests in the popular music industry: broadcasting, record companies, artists, publishing, and educational interests. The Board will also represent Maori, Pacific Island and youth interests. The Trustees are to prepare a statement of intent and programme of activities to Government by 1 September 2000.
