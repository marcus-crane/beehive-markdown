Eight New Zealand Police officers will be deployed for six months to East Timor as part of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor \[UNTAET], Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said.

The officers will take part in community policing and the investigation of murders and kidnappings, including the mass killings of last year.

"These eight officers will leave this Friday \[May 19] to replace the current contingent. Its tour of duty ends this month after having been deployed to East Timor on November 12 1999.

"The New Zealand Police's commitment to peace and stability in East Timor is part of an essential element of the United Nations operation in East Timor," George Hawkins said.

"Each of these officers put their name forward to take part in this deployment on a voluntary basis. I commend them for that and wish each officer well on their commitment to maintaining peace and the investigation of atrocities that fell on the East Timorese people last year," George Hawkins said.
