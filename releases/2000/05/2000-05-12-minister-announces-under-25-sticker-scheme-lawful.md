Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has announced legal advice sought on the Christchurch based Under-25 car sticker scheme has deemed it lawful.

George Hawkins sought Crown Law advice as to whether the scheme was lawful, or whether it was discriminatory against people under the age of 25.

"Crown Law has advised me that this Under-25 car sticker scheme is currently lawful. There is nothing in the Human Rights Act relating to age discrimination that affects anything done by or on behalf of the Government of New Zealand, including the Police.

"The scheme is controversial. One can understand why law-abiding young people feel frustrated. However, only those who steal vehicles should feel shame. This scheme is designed to identify criminals not alienate youths in general.

"Decisions as to the future of the Under-25 car sticker scheme are now with the Police. Its future will be considered against how effective it has been at reducing crime, and within the context of resource priorities," George Hawkins said.
