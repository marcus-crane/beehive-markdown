The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has declined access to West Coast conservation land subject to a mining proposal from businessman Rhett Robinson.

She says Mr Robinson applied for access effectively to mine 97.5 hectares over 10 years within the Card Creek ecological area which was set aside to preserve an example of dense regenerating podocarp forest on wide valley floors not found elsewhere in the Grey ecological district.

"After weighing carefully an updated Department of Conservation evaluation of Mr Robinson's proposal, I have concluded that the land at the centre of the access application has significant conservation assets which require protection."

"Under the Crown Minerals Act 1991, I am obliged to take into account only DOC's interests relating to the administration of the land, and not the potential profitability of the mining venture or its likely economic significance."

"Despite an offer of compensation equating to about $100,000 for the life of the mining, the loss of conservation assets would be of substantial significance and there would not be a net conservation gain," said Ms Lee. "Consequently, Mr Robinson has been denied access to undertake his proposed mining activities."

The Conservation Minister said she was aware of a high level of public interest during the past couple of months in applications for mining on the West Coast.

She said while the Government had been concerned to minimise delays in decision-making, at the same time appropriate weight had to be given to the complex considerations raised by each individual application.
