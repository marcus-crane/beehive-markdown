Prime Minister Helen Clark today offered New Zealand's condolences to Japan following the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.

"New Zealand can sympathise greatly with the Japanese people, having ourselves lost a number of serving Prime Ministers, including Norman Kirk, Michael Joseph Savage, William Massey and Richard Seddon."

"Mr Obuchi visited New Zealand twice during his political career, most recently as Prime Minister during the APEC leaders meeting in Auckland last year."

"He was on the Executive of the Japan/New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship League and in this capacity met many New Zealand politicians who visited Tokyo."

"It is a great pity that Mr Obuchi was unable to chair the G8 summit to be held in Japan in July."

"I am writing to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to convey New Zealand’s condolences to the government and people of Japan at this sad time," Helen Clark said.
