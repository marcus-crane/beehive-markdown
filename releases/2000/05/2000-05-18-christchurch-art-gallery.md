Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today that the government would contribute $6.474 million towards the new Christchurch Art Gallery.

She said that the new gallery would be a major arts and economic asset for Canterbury and would contribute directly to tourism earnings in the region.

Helen Clark said the $6.474 million had been allocated in accordance with the existing Policy for Government Assistance towards Capital Projects at Regional Museums.

"Christchurch Art Gallery meets all of the criteria for consideration under the policy, including national significance of collections, accessibility, attendance numbers, and scale of the institution.

"In my view, the gallery's collection and standard of display is simply outstanding and a national treasure.

"The new gallery also meets the criteria in terms of operational performance, professional support, ongoing viability, architectural significance, and local support.

"The government's contribution represents 13 per cent of the overall cost of the project. This is warranted on the basis of the importance of Christchurch Art Gallery's permanent collections, the benefit to the public from the improved access to the collections, and the improved storage conditions.

"The new purpose-built art gallery is being constructed in Christchurch to house the city’s art collection currently held in the Robert McDougall Art Gallery.

"The existing premises for the Robert McDougall Gallery have long been recognised as inadequate. The new Gallery building will provide a state of the art facility to accommodate, care for and present the city’s collections as well as exhibitions from around New Zealand and overseas."

The bulk of the project’s $53.432 million (GST inclusive) cost is being covered by the Christchurch City Council with additional funds coming from community fundraising. The Gallery is scheduled to open in March 2003.
