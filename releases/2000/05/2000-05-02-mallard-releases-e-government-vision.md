State Services Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the detail of New Zealand's e-government vision. Cabinet signed off the vision this week.

"Our e-government vision is to use information and communications technologies to provide better government services and information electronically, and to build a closer relationship between government and citizens," he said.

"It is an important part of the future of democracy. We need a service that’s at least as good at service and information delivery as the private sector – if not better.

"Our first step is to establish an e-government unit in the State Services Commission. This unit's primary task will be to develop the overarching e-government strategy. That strategy will include common system and data management policies, standards and guidelines.

"What we want is a living strategy – one which we can adjust to meet the changing environment.

"The new unit will also perform the important role of facilitating the uptake by government agencies of the e-government vision and strategy. We expect to see a new culture where agencies will be required to work together to achieve their e-government goals. Nobody will be exempt from this.

"To help this succeed, an advisory board will be set up working to the State Services Commissioner. It will represent the views of government agencies, local government, communities and the private sector.

"E-government offers some fantastic opportunities. In the end we hope it will give us a more transparent system where people can watch and participate in democracy - that can only be good for New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.
