Minister of Corrections clarified today that conjugal visits in prisons is not formal government policy. It is however worth looking at any programme that claims to reduce re-offending, he said.

"I am keen to evaluate any programme nationally or internationally for its effect on re-offending.

"I see it as my duty as Minister to examine all evidence that claims to strengthen the family unit. Research shows that if we can get it right with the family we're likely to reduce further, criminal offending.

"Close to home the Australian State of Victoria, for example, runs family visits. I've been invited to look at those by Victorian justice officials.

"At this stage I am simply looking at the evidence and the considerable literature available. Following my trip to Australia I will be discussing this further with my Department and others with expertise in this area," said Matt Robson.
