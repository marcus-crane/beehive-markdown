Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins will launch the upgraded Automatic Fingerprint Information System \[AFIS] on Tuesday, 9 May 2000. 9am, at Wellington Central Police Station.

Media should report to the ground floor reception on Victoria Street by 8:50am.

A demonstration of AFIS will take place and George Hawkins will be fingerprinted.

One of the key benefits of the new AFIS system is that it moves from a mainframe-based system to a flexible Windows environment. The upgraded AFIS system will enable Police to search more stored fingerprints and clear more offences.

In future, when increased storage is needed this will be achieved using off the shelf solutions which will help keep costs to a minimum.
