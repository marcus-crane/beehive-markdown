The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is to take over responsibility for a range of heritage functions, including the Dictionary of New Zealand biography and the management of national memorials, from the Department of Internal Affairs.

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said that the Ministry would receive a combination of new and transferred funding to cover its new areas of responsibility. Its annual budget would increase from around $1.74 million to approximately $5 million.

"The largest component of the funding is the annual $2.4 million that the Ministry will receive to manage history and heritage activities, which were previously part of the Department of Internal Affairs. The funding is being transferred from Internal Affairs to the Ministry.

"Other areas that will receive funding include the Ministry's work on broadcasting policy and new policy development The collection of cultural statistics is also being transferred to the Ministry from the Science Envelope Departmental Contestable Research Pool.

"This year the Ministry receives an extra $80,000 for advice on broadcasting policy and another $400,000 next year. The Ministry also receives an extra $600,000 to enhance its ability to advise on cultural policy.

"Altogether the changes at the Ministry will ensure that it receives a fair level of resources in relation to the work it is required to do. Furthermore, it will also provide for the establishment of both a strategic policy capacity and an adequate Maori responsiveness strategy within the Ministry.

"With this structural change, the Ministry will take on the shape initially envisaged for it when the previous Labour Government committed itself to creating it in 1990," said Helen Clark.
