Health Minister Annette King today announced Pharmac and the New Zealand Blood Service will be run as statutory corporations in the future.

Pharmac is currently a limited liability company, a subsidiary of the Health Funding Authority which is being merged with the Ministry of Health later this year.

"Cabinet has decided that the most appropriate way of allowing Pharmac to continue its existing functions is to set it up as a statutory corporation. Provision for this will be made in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill which will be before Parliament late this year," Mrs King said.

"We believe this set up will enable Pharmac to build on the strengths it has at present, including its relationships with other agencies. It will minimise the legal and financial risks to taxpayers."

Mrs King said the future structure of Health Benefits Ltd, also a subsidiary company of the HFA, was still being considered as officials developed policy on DHB payment and information requirements and systems.

"We have however, decided that it is essential to maintain the New Zealand Blood Service as a stand-alone entity.

"A national blood service was set up in 1998 as the sole provider of safe and adequate supplies of blood services at least cost. We are part way through a three-year plan to ensure those objectives are met. We are satisfied that the best way of doing so is to continue the present approach, but within the form of a statutory corporation."

Mrs King said Cabinet had also agreed to recommendations that the Residual Health Management Unit, which manages residual assets and debts from area health boards, would continue in its present form for the time being.

The Cabinet paper is available from the Minister's website (www.executive.govt.nz/minister/king) and in hard copy from the Minister's office. A summary of the key decisions follows.

Other Agencies: Appropriate Corporate Form and Functions of; New Zealand Blood Service, Pharmac, Health Benefits Ltd, National Health Committee, Residual Health Mangement Unit  
„h The role and functions of the New Zealand Blood Service remain unchanged and it will become a Statutory Corporation. Currently it is a Crown Company. The main purpose for the service's establishment in 1998 was to have a sole national provider of safe and adequate supplies of blood services at least cost.  
„h Health Benefits Ltd stays a Crown Entity and a limited liability company until a review is carried out by the Ministry of Health, Health Funding Authority and Treasury. Review to be completed by September 30, 2000. Health Benefits Ltd was established in 1993 by the four Regional Health Authorities to process subsidy payments to primary health care providers.  
„h Pharmac's current role and functions remain unchanged and it will become a Statutory Corporation. It is currently a subsidiary company of the Health Funding Authority. Pharmac's aim is to maximise the health gain of the population that results from Government expenditure on pharmaceuticals.  
„h The Residual Health Management Unit was established as a Crown Entity (Statutory Corporation) in 1993 to manage assets and liabilities of former Area Health Boards that for various reasons were not assigned to Crown Health Enterprises. It's functions have expanded to include disposing surplus Hospital and Health Services property. It will stay in the same form and with the same roles. The Ministry of Health, Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit and Treasury will review its role and responsibilities, reporting back to Health and Finance ministers by 30 April 2001.  
„h The National Health Committee will continue to be an independent advisory committee to the Minister of Health, its role and functions unchanged. It evolved from the Core Services Committee, established as part of the 1993 health reforms. The Government believes the committee remains necessary as;  
1\. There will be continued debate about the appropriate mix and coverage of health and disability services.  
2\. Government remains concerned to ensure the greatest benefit within available resources to the health and independence of the population, particularly to groups at risk or disadvantage.
