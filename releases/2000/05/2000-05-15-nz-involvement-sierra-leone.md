Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Minister of Defence Mark Burton announced today that Cabinet has approved the involvement of two New Zealand army personnel, who are currently attached to a British unit which has been diverted to Sierra Leone, in a deployment in Sierra Leone with that unit.

Mark Burton said the New Zealand Defence Force and the British Armed Forces have a long-standing exchange programme called "Long Look."  
"The purpose of Long Look is to promote co-operation and understanding between our two defence forces and to broaden the experience and knowledge of those personnel selected for the exchange.  
"Under this arrangement, exchange personnel are encouraged to take part in the activities of the host unit as far as possible. Certain restrictions do apply, such as not visiting any combat zone unless the permission of the parent government is obtained.

"Two New Zealand army personnel are currently aboard the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean under this exchange programme. This ship has been diverted from an exercise in Portugal to Sierra Leone.  
"The UK has asked our soldiers to deploy ashore with their host unit to participate in the protected evacuation of British and Commonwealth citizens, and to maintain security at the airport for the arrival of United Nation forces," Mark Burton said.

Helen Clark said that in response to the British request, Cabinet has approved the participation of the two New Zealand army personnel in the evacuation and airport protection role allocated to their unit.  
"The unit will not undertake a combat role and Cabinet has been advised that the risk is not considered high.

"Any change in the nature of this deployment would require further approval from the government," Helen Clark said.  
Two other NZDF personnel are attached to the UN mission UNAMSIL and are currently working in and around the Freetown area.
