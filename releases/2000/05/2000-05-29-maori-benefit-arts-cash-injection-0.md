Maori art will receive a financial boost as part of the Government's cultural recovery package announced last week, said the Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard.

"The Government's $146 million injection into the arts, culture and heritage sector will benefit all New Zealanders, including Maori, by reviving creative industries and creating jobs," she said.

"Creative New Zealand received an additional one-off injection of $20 million in the package. As a result of the extra funding, around $5 million will be freed up to support Maori art and culture over the next three years. This is in addition to the current funding to Maori art through Te Waka Toi.

"A significant amount of Creative New Zealand funding will go towards a Seriously Maori strategy that will strengthen and develop the infrastructure for Maori art. The strategy will assist Maori artists, iwi and Maori authorities to protect and develop their art, deliver community projects and increase employment opportunities. Further details about that strategy will be announced in three weeks' time."

Support for Maori arts and culture would also be provided through other Creative New Zealand programmes.

Judith Tizard said that Maori artists and film-makers could also be expected to benefit from the Government's $22 million establishment grant for a new Film Production Fund.

"The Film Production Fund is focussed on New Zealand stories, the expectation is that it will lead to the funding of films that have a uniquely Kiwi flavour," she said.

"The Government is also encouraging the development of contemporary Maori music through the $2 million cash injection to establish a Music Industry Commission and through New Zealand On Air.

"The New Zealand Historic Places Trust will receive $3million this financial year for the establishment of a Historic Places Preservation Fund. Some $1.25 million of it will be set aside to set up a Maori heritage development fund," she said.

Judith Tizard said that the Government's investment in the arts, culture and heritage sector was clearly directed at supporting Maori cultural endeavour.

The Aotearoa Traditional Maori Performing Arts Society received a significant increase in funding two years ago and there was no evidence to suggest that was insufficient, she said.
