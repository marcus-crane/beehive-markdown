Cabinet Minister Hon Sandra Lee says the election of Auckland Regional Council chairman Phil Warren today as chair of the new Hauraki Gulf Forum, even though he was absent, was "a tribute by his peers to his long service to local government in Auckland."

Ms Lee, who attended the inaugural Forum meeting today in her roles as Conservation and Local Government Minister and Associate Maori Affairs Minister, congratulated Mr Warren and the new Deputy Chairperson, Laly Haddon from the Ngati Wai Trust Board.

"I regret Mr Warren could not be present today as he was overseas, but I understand that someone has been quick to convey to him the details of his new responsibilities!" the Minister said.

"Mr Haddon also has a distinguished record of community service, and I am confident the pair will work well together," she said. "Their election signals to me that the Forum is off to a good start."

The Forum has been set up under the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park Act which was passed in February to coordinate statutory functions and integrate the management of all land which drains into the Hauraki Gulf, to protect the surrounding waters.

It is also specifically required by law when carrying out its functions to have particular regard to the historic, traditional, cultural and spiritual relationship of tangata whenua with the natural, historic and physical resources of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands and catchments.
