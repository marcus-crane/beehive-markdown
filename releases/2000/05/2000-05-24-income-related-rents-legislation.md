The law change needed to restore income related rents for state house tenants will be introduced into Parliament tomorrow the Minister of Housing Mark Gosche said today.

He said the Housing Restructuring (Income-related Rents) Amendment would target those most in need. Independent studies have found that high housing costs are the largest single cause of poverty in New Zealand.

"Independent research has also found that more than 70% of Housing New Zealand tenants lived in poverty as a result of the previous government's housing policy," said Mr Gosche.

"Our income related rents policy has drawn strong support from the community sector who also see affordable housing as a crucial step towards addressing poverty amongst some of New Zealand's most needy households."
