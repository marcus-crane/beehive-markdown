Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré is seeking input from the non-government sector into a draft report on New Zealand's implementation of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCROC).

The Ministry of Youth Affairs has compiled a draft report on New Zealand's performance in relation to the convention since 1995.

Laila Harré says the UNCROC report will take an honest look at how government policies impact on the welfare of New Zealand children.

"In order to complete this draft the government needs feedback from groups and individuals around the country that are working to improve the rights and wellbeing of children," she says.

"As this report is about the rights of the child, input will also be sought from children and young people around the country."

This is New Zealand's second report, and covers the period from November 1995 to August 2000.

As well as providing a snapshot of the status of New Zealanders under 18 years, the draft includes comment on what has been done to address issues brought to light by the 1995 UNCROC report.

"We are keen to hear from those who operate within the framework of government policy on a day-to-day basis, such as youth workers, children's advocates, educators, unions, training organisations and child protection agencies," Laila Harré says.

New Zealand will report its findings to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child by November 30 this year.

Feedback and comments must reach the Ministry by July 15, and a full copy of the draft report is available on the Ministry of Youth Affairs website, www.youthaffairs.govt.nz.
