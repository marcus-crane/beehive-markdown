The Government has announced a package of $455,000 to assist the voluntary sector with plans to celebrate IYOV - the United Nations’ International Year of Volunteers 2001.

The package is intended to compliment a $500,000 Lottery Grants Board fund that is currently being advertised.

IYOV will be officially launched on International Volunteers Day, 5 December 2000.

The Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton has responsibility for the Government’s contribution to IYOV and will be working closely with the Minister responsible for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Steve Maharey.

The Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS), serviced by the Department of Internal Affairs, will distribute funding of $290,000 to volunteers for projects which celebrate the Year.

The chair of the COGS national advisory committee Liz Rakuraku-Warn said “COGS is pleased to be involved in plans for IYOV. COGS is a community driven process which already makes a significant contribution to voluntary organisations.”

The remaining $165,000 will go towards co-ordination and promotion of the Year by a national steering group made up of voluntary sector representatives.

Mark Burton said he would shortly be calling a meeting of voluntary sector representatives to discuss the establishment of the steering group.

“IYOV will be an excellent opportunity to work with the voluntary sector to raise the profile of volunteering throughout New Zealand.

"It will also enable us to acknowledge and record our appreciation for the huge contribution volunteers make to the life and wellbeing of our communities," Mark Burton said.
