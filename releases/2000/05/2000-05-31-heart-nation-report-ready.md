The Heart of the Nation report on the future of New Zealand's cultural sector will be presented to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, on her return from Germany next week, the Associate Minister for Arts,Culture and Heritage said today.

Helen Clark, who is also Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, set a May 31 deadline for the report.

It has been produced by a team of prominent New Zealand artists, authors, actors and arts administrators headed by former Arts Council chairman Hamish Keith.

They have had extensive consultation with the cultural sector over the past two months.

"The report has been completed and will be given to the Prime Minister as soon as she returns from Germany next week," Judith Tizard said.

"The Heart of the Nation project was initiated and funded by the Government to enable the development of a strategic plan for and by the creative sector.

"The Report sets our objectives for the sector to achieve over the next 10 years which will contribute to the New Zealand economy and society. It also sets out strategies to achieve this.

"I look forward to seeing the report as I have had many positive comments from all around the country from people who have participated in the Heart of the Nation process.

"After Helen Clark and I have seen it we will decide what needs to be done to make progress on the issues" said Judith Tizard.
