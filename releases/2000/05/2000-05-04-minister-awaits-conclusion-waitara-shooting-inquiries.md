Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins will not be making any comment regarding the Waitara fatal shooting while a Police homicide inquiry and Police Complaints Authority inquiry are underway.

"While I acknowledge the tragic circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of Steven Wallace, I believe it is inappropriate for politicians to interfere, whether by comment of known facts or opinion, while the investigations are underway. And equally, the media must also not lose sight of its responsibilities," George Hawkins said.

"As Minister of Police I am being briefed regularly by Police on the Waitara shooting.

"I am confident that the comprehensive investigations into the shooting will arrive at discovering the true facts.

"I await the conclusion of both the Police homicide investigation and the findings of the Police Complaints Authority investigation into the fatal shooting of Steven Wallace," George Hawkins said.
