The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has today announced the establishment of a key research programme to greatly enhance the provision of tourism research, information and forecasting in New Zealand.  
Mr Burton was speaking at Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand (TRENZ) in Christchurch.

“The programme, to be called the Tourism Research and Forecasting Clearinghouse, will ensure that the tourism industry is equipped with the full suite of authoritative and credible information that it needs to ensure the sector’s ongoing prosperity.  
“The stakes are very high, Mr Burton said. “Tourism is New Zealand’s largest single export earner and it is essential that decision-making affecting tourism is undertaken in an informed manner.

“Tourism is a powerful driver of economic activity nationally and it is growing rapidly. We need to understand the sector better so we can realise its immense potential while ensuring that it enhances, rather than degrades, those social, cultural and environmental resources upon which it is based.  
“The Tourism Research and Forecasting Clearinghouse is a programme that is overseen by a user-driven Council with secretariat support provided by the Office of Tourism and Sport. It will operate by capitalising on the existing resources and talents to drive the sector-wide programme.”

The Clearinghouse Council, which Mr Burton is in the process of establishing, will have both public and private sector membership, which reflects the Government’s commitment to undertaking key initiatives in partnership with the tourism industry.
