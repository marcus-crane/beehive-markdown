"This video is an enormous contribution to anti-violence in New Zealand society. I have no doubt that it will be effective and it has my full support," Minister Matt Robson said today as he launched a new domestic violence video.

'Your Call' is aimed at men who have been violent. The video shows how some men who have been served with Protection Orders have chosen to take this as a wake up call and make changes in their lives.

"Men who have been violent can be responsible, accountable and they can change their behaviour. The call is theirs," said Matt Robson.

"Domestic violence is not limited by economic, cultural or social boundaries, and is just as likely to occur in Kelburn as in Porirua East, in Remuera as in Mangere. What is impressive about this video is that it avoids stereotyping."

Protection Orders can be served under the Domestic Violence Act which is coming up to its forth birthday.

"It is worth remembering that the Domestic Violence Act was and still is groundbreaking legislation on an international level. It increased the range of people who could apply for protection orders by recognising the changing nature of the 'family'. Perhaps the greatest innovation in the Act is the provision of mandatory programmes for respondents and voluntary support programmes for protected persons and their children.

"The priority is the safety of those at risk from violence – mostly women and children. Part of that is educating violent offenders that they do have choices, they can change their behaviour," said Matt Robson.

Figures show that in the first three years after the Act was introduced, the Family Court received 22,174 applications for protection orders – an average of over 600 per month. Over that period over 33,000 children have been protected from violence and abuse. The overwhelming majority of respondents are male (92%) and the majority are either husbands or partners of those they abuse (83%).
