Maori need to look at locally owned and driven initiatives to ensure the economic success of this region, Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia told a hui at Te Poho o Rawiri Marae, Gisborne last night.

The hui was held so that Ministers in town for the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce inaugural meeting could listen to the concerns, ideas and solutions from Maori groups in the region.

"This government is serious about going forward and working together but we don’t have all the answers, and solutions need to be found in partnership with the community," Mr Horomia said.

"I’ve listened to Governments come into this area and make promises before. This time its about true partnership and this coalition government is committed to making sure that happens."

TAIRAWHITI DEVELOPMENT TASKFORCE ESTABLISHED  
The Tairawhiti region will light the way forward for the country’s regional economic development with the establishment of the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce today, said the Hon Parekura Horomia.  
"I am heartened by the diverse range of skills present on this taskforce. I see my role here as ensuring that Maori participation is taken seriously," Mr Horomia said.  
"It is critical that we listen to the cries of the people, that they have assets but that these need freeing up. The clear message from Te Poho o Rawiri was that we need to maximise the assets that we have now." "Maori development is crucial to the overall development of this region. I see my participation in the Task Force in part as recognising that regional economic development strategies will fail here and throughout the country unless Maori people are able to participate fully in their communities."  
"I personally would like to see a focus on employment and education. Education initiatives can be as basic as ensuring that our young people are able to read and write."  
"This community has vibrant and youthful exuberance and they want to participate in a modern society," Mr Horomia said
