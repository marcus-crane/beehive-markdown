Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released details of a major review of school staffing.

The Minister will chair the Review Group. Former Hutt Valley High School principal Graeme Marshall will be the project manager and deputy chairperson.

Members of the review team announced today and their nominators are:

\* Bruce Adin, principal of Fairburn School (NZEI Te Riu Roa);

\* Owen Edgerton, Board Chairperson of Central Southland College (NZ School Trustees Association president);

\* Arthur Graves, principal of Greymouth High School (joint nomination of Secondary Principals' Association of New Zealand and Principals’ Council)

\* Geoff Lovegrove, (NZ Principals’ Federation – president)

\* Bev Manahi, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Hoani Waititi Marae (Runanga o Nga Kura Kaupapa Maori);

\* Roger Tobin, deputy principal, Logan Park High School (NZPPTA)

“The group will report by the end of February 2001, with recommendations on a long term staffing formula for schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

“These will take into account the circumstances of low decile schools, small rural schools, and schools with teaching principals.

“My aim is to identify the most effective ways to align teacher resourcing and student needs across the various parts of the school sector so we can ensure the best possible learning outcomes.”

"The first task of the Review Group will be to make recommendations for staffing assistance to small rural schools, for implementation next year. The wider review will propose a phased implementation plan, taking into account of issues such as affordability and teacher supply.

"Changes to the curriculum, the needs of Maori and Pacific students, expected changes in the numbers of primary and secondary school age students, the workloads of teachers and principals, and the implications of developments in information and communications technologies will be significant factors."

Trevor Mallard said that while the membership of the group was small, wider consultation throughout the year would give all interested parties the opportunity to contribute to the final recommendations.
