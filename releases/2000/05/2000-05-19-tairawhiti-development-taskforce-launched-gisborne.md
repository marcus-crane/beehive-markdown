The 'jobs machine' approach of the new coalition Government swung into action in  
Gisborne today with the first meeting of the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce.

The Taskforce issued a communiqué stating that the new Taskforce has been established to provide leadership and direction to support the people of Tairawhiti. It will put in place a development strategy, create sustainable jobs and deliver a better life for all Tairawhiti people, now and in the future.

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is chairing the Taskforce.

Two weeks ago the Mayors of Wairoa and Gisborne District Councils invited Mr Anderton, Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia and East Coast MP Janet Mackey to join the Taskforce.

Jim Anderton said the Taskforce is a partnership between central and local government and local runanga and industry.

"Tairawhiti is demonstrating leadership just as it did at the dawn of the millenium. Tairawhiti was the first to see the sun and is now the first place for the Government to enter into a regional development partnership,” he said.

Tairawhiti includes the areas of the Wairoa District Council and the Gisborne District Council.

“The Taskforce represents a new partnership between Government and local authorities, Maori and non-Maori and community and industry,” Jim Anderton said.

“Parekura Horomia, Janet Mackey are with me on the Taskforce to ensure that all government agencies work together and develop local solutions for local problems. This 'whole-of-government' approach is a new way of dealing with the issues of social, environmental and economic development in Tairawhiti."

The Taskforce will provide the leadership and direction to oversee the preparation of a regional development strategy. It will engage with Government to ensure that its social and economic programmes work in Tairawhiti. It will also have a short term action focus to build development momentum.

Action teams are being be established to focus on creating job opportunities; building life skills; addressing acute housing conditions; seizing opportunities in land and resource base industries; and developing an electronic communications plan.

Mr Anderton has agreed to chair the Taskforce for six months. The Taskforce will have an executive and offices in Tairawhiti.

“It is my aim to chair this Taskforce so that it begins to deliver a better life for the people of Tairawhiti within two years. I am also resolved to assist the leadership of Tairawhiti to build something that outlives us all,” Mr Anderton said.
