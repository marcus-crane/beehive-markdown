The New Zealand Film Archive is to receive $943,000 this financial year for the establishment of a Film Archive Development Fund to allow it to extend its existing archiving services.

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said the new funding would enable the Film Archive to meets its objectives of collecting, preserving and providing access to New Zealand's moving image heritage.

"It is proposed that the collection services will include an active acquisition programme to secure videotape material at risk of deterioration and loss. The Film Archive also needs to be able to house and preserve its growing collection safely.

"It also needs to be able to improve its national public access programmes, including its Auckland branch, video access at regional museums, exhibition programmes and off-site screening.

"Without the additional funding, it is likely that essential heritage material would be lost or be unavailable to the public," Helen Clark said.

The New Zealand Film Archive is an independent charitable trust established in 1981 to preserve New Zealand's film history.

The Archive is housed in the 'Film Centre', purchased by the Archive in 1993 and opened to the public in August 1995. The Archive leases building space to a number of tenants including the New Zealand Film Commission and Rialto Cinemas.

The opening of the Film Centre was a significant achievement for the Archive, creating a single premises for the Archive and its collections, which were previously scattered amongst a number of different sites (although some material is still stored at other sites for safety reasons). It also allowed the public and researchers to have, for the first time, direct and ongoing access to the Archive's collections.
