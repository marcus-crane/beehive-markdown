Jenny Shipley's outburst in the house yesterday demonstrated her intolerant and prejudiced attitude towards Maori and Pacific people the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Mark Gosche said today.

"Her claim that Pacific Island people are like Maori because they cause trouble and climb through the windows of New Zealanders at night shows a side to the former Prime Minister that is deeply disturbing and offensive," he said.

"Jenny Shipley has finally shown her true colours, her outburst is inexcusable and she should apologise to all Maori and Pacific New Zealanders if she is to retain any shred of credibility," he said.

"At a time when we as a nation need to work together we have the leader of the opposition inflaming racial tension. She should be ashamed of herself."

Mrs Shipley made the comments during a snap debate over the radio spectrum.

"When the former Prime Minister reveals her own deeply held prejudices and attitudes against Maori and Pacific people it is no wonder that the disparity gaps between them and other New Zealanders are so wide," said Mr Gosche.

He called on Mrs Shipley to withdraw her comments and apologise.
