The video is called Your Call. It aims to get across to those men who have been violent, that they can be responsible, accountable and change their behaviour.

The video outlines the rights and responsibilities of people who have been served with a Protection Order under the Domestic Violence Act. It uses a dramatised example interspersed with interviews with men who have had protection orders.

Often people – usually men – served with a protection order are confused, upset and angry. This video shows how some men have taken this as a wake up call and made real changes in their lives.

"The priority is the safety of the women and children affected by domestic violence. But the video shows that the men who make the decision to change and are supported to do that, also benefit," said Matt Robson.
