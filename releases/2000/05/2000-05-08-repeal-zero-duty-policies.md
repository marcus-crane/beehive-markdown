The Acting Minister of Commerce Trevor Mallard has introduced a Bill to repeal National’s zero duty policies.

The move follows the government's announcement last month that it would be repealing National's Tariff (Zero Duty) Amendment Act 1998.

The 1998 Act was implemented to phase out all tariffs by 1 July 2006. The coalition government is freezing tariffs at current levels until at least 1 July 2005.

"We are ending the former government's policy of removing tariffs on a unilateral basis," Trevor Mallard said.

"The coalition government will consider tariff changes where there are clear benefits to New Zealand.

"We will continue the programme of tariff removal for beer and paper, paper products and printed material which was agreed as part of the GATT Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.

"The repeal of the zero duty policy and the freeze on tariffs is in line with our manifesto promises and is an important part of our intention to assist industry development and employment in New Zealand," he said.
