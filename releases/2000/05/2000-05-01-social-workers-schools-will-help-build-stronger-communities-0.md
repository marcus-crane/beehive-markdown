Eight schools in the Taupo electorate are included in the newly expanded Social Workers in Schools programme said the MP for Taupo Mark Burton.  
Nationwide about 35,000 primary and intermediate schoolchildren will now be covered by the scheme.  
As the new school term gets underway, an extra 55 social workers will join the 12 already working in schools as part of a pilot programme. The 67 social workers will cover 185 schools located in 29 priority regions across the country. Each social worker will work with a cluster of schools.  
In the Taupo electorate the schools and providers involved in the programme are:

South Waikato District:(Tokoroa Council of Social Services)  
Tainui Full Primary School  
Bishop Edward Gaines Catholic School  
Tokoroa East School  
Tokoroa Central School

Taupo District:(James Family – Presbyterian Support Services, Joint Venture)  
Hirangi School  
Kuratau School  
Tauranga Taupo School  
Turangi School

"The Social Workers in Schools programme fits with the Government’s desire to build strong communities in which all children are physically, emotionally and intellectually supported," Mr Burton said.  
"Our society demands a great deal from parents but we can’t just expect them to bring up children on their own. Children are the responsibility of the whole community. "

"Schools are the ideal place in which to base social workers who can be on hand to help nip family and social problems in the bud before they have a major impact on a child’s growth and development. Their work will be mainly preventative."  
"One of the key elements of the initiative is the emphasis on a partnership approach in which the social workers work closely with family/whanau, teachers, health workers and others to resolve problems," Mr Burton said.  
The social workers are not from Child, Youth and Family and they will not be undertaking statutory social work. They are employed by non-government organisations that are approved under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act to deliver social services. The providers were selected through a formal tender process.
