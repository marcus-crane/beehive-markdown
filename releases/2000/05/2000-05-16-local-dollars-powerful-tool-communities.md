"The Chatham Islands dollar initiative, launched this week, points the way  
for local communities to have control of their money," said John Wright MP,  
leader of the Democratic Party (previously Social Credit) a partner party of  
the Alliance.

"On the Chatham Islands, people can now chose to offer a local currency as  
payment for goods and services. That is a powerful tool that enables local  
people to exert control over their money.

"And it is non-inflationary. We have that on the word of Dr Don Brash who has  
repeatedly testified that the amount of money in circulation does not affect  
the CPI.

"It is essential that currency is accepted by the community in which it used.  
It is the community having confidence in it which gives it value.

"In practical terms a person selling goods or services is not obliged to  
accept either New Zealand dollars nor Chatham Islands dollars. But they can  
chose to accept either.
