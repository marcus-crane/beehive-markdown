Acting Communications Minister Trevor Mallard today accused National Leader Jenny Shipley of rank hypocrisy over her opposition to the Government's spectrum plans.

"This was the woman who survived in office by pandering to Tau Henare and Alamein Kopu. She flattered them with things like special access to her, offices in the Beehive, weekly tea parties and other such nonsense," Trevor Mallard said.

"Her dysfunctional method of dealing with Maori issues was to throw one-off payments at renegade MPs with no thought given to goals and objectives. She was prepared to buy their vote with taxpayer funds but now that she is in Opposition she is scratching every racist scab she can find.

"The Government wants to ensure that at least one of the four blocks of third generation (3G) spectrum is developed to assist the Government's policy to close the social and economic gaps between Maori and other New Zealanders," Trevor Mallard said.

"While we agree with National that access to spectrum is not a Treaty of Waitangi right, we are aware that partnership in developing the spectrum has the potential to contribute to a strong economic base for Maori.

"There is exciting potential for jobs, training, and for creating a skill base in new technology areas.

"For a decade, Mrs Shipley and her Government stood by and watched the social and economic gaps between Maori and other New Zealanders widen.

"Mrs Shipley is showing that she has no interest in policy that might close the gaps between different societies within New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.
