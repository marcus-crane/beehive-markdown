Education Minister Trevor Mallard has directed the Ministry of Education and the Education Review Office to look into the latest incidence of violence at St Stephen's School in Bombay.

The alleged incident occurred last Friday and resulted in a 14-year-old boy being hospitalised after being hit over the head with an iron bar.

"This is a deeply distressing occurrence as I know there are a lot of people trying to help St Stephen's overcome problems it has with violence and bullying.

"The Ministry of Education and ERO are looking into this incident. If it is as bad as it appears, then I will be calling for a further report looking more widely at the school's future.

"Coming on top of a string of unacceptable incidents, this assault puts the school's future at risk.

"This is a school with a magnificent and proud history.

"But that does not override the essential need to provide a safe environment at the school.  
Student safety is paramount – there is no question of that," Trevor Mallard said.
