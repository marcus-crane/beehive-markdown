The need for 150 more mental health workers at Waitemata Health emphases the need for revenue to pay for essential social services, Alliance Leader and Deputy Prime Minister said today.

"New Zealanders can't go on being told they need more mental health staff, nurses and hospital beds unless they are prepared to bite the bullet and pay for it, " Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealanders are horrified by the inadequacy of mental health care. Staff shortages are not only at Waitemata Health. There are serious gaps in mental health care all over the country. The real issue is whether New Zealanders are prepared to pay to fix it.

"Its too easy to say there are not enough mental health workers. We have to pay for that too.

"Many New Zealanders complain about they quality of mental health care. They also complain about taxes. The reality is that no government can have both very low taxes and quality public services.

"This government is committed to making improvements in the mental health system. But if New Zealanders are serious about doing something about our inadequate mental health workforce, they need to bite the bullet and pay for it," Jim Anderton said.
