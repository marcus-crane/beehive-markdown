Welcome and thank you for joining me here at Tiritiri Matangi island.

I thought this venue was appropriate for today's occasion because the work to restore this island is one of New Zealand's most successful conservation projects.

I'm looking for some of that success to rub off on to another initiative that I will announce in a few minutes.

Tiritiri Matangi means ¡§looking to the wind¡¨.

It takes its name from the Pa built here by the local Kawerau-a-maki iwi .

Once the island was covered in forest. However years of farming destroyed all but a few hectares of the original tree cover.

Today the native forest is returning because of the vision and hard work of all those involved in restoration work, since a decision in 1971 allowed the island to revert to a more natural landscape.

I recall coming here myself a decade ago with other whanau members and friends to plant cuttings that we can now see have grown into fully fledged native shrubs and trees.

The great thing is that Tiritiri Matangi is open to the public, so that people can see at first hand what¡¦s possible and what has been achieved.

It's been an exciting experiment, bringing together people and rare species¡Xan experiment that the Department of Conservation is now looking to repeat at selected sites on the mainland.

Today I am pleased to announce the launch of a new Recovery Programme for one of those rare species¡Xthe North Island Kokako.

The main aim of the Programme, outlined in the Kokako Recovery Plan document, is to get these rare birds off the endangered species list by boosting numbers from the present 400 pairs to more than 1000 pairs, by 2020.

The Kokako has served as a public symbol for the past three decades of what may be lost by logging native forests.

It is appropriate that I should launch this new initiative at the same time as the Government seeks to bring a rapid end to unsustainable logging on crown-managed land.

The Recovery Programme's 20-year vision may seem ambitious on paper.

But here at Tiritiri Matangi, we can see how a vision pursued with resolve and dedication can reap tangible conservation benefits.

I would like to think that in 20 years time, someone might be standing in one of our unique native forests, perhaps on the West Coast, making similar comments.

The new Kokako Recovery Programme, launched today, has set as a prime goal the establishment of 50 breeding pairs in each of 23 sites spread around the North Island, by 2020.

These sites include:  
„h Puketi and Mataraua, in Northland  
„h Great Barrier Island and Hunua, in Auckland  
„h Moehau and Pureora, in Waikato  
„h Whitecliffs, in Taranaki; and  
„h Kapiti Island and Mount Bruce, in the Wellington region.

Research during the past decade has found that the immediate cause of the Kokako's decline was due to predator attacks on nests, mainly by ship rats and possums.

Infra-red video cameras placed high in the trees where Kokako would nest showed that ship rats were attacking and killing the female Kokako and their young.

Possums, not previously known to be predators, were found to be eating eggs and chicks, as well as competing for vital food such as tawa berries.

Stoats and wild cats also occasionally kill the Kokako, but they're not nearly as numerous as ship rats and possums.

In recent years, pest control measures targeting the worst predators have begun to slow the rate of decline.

The new Kokako Recovery Programme, launched today, includes a stepped-up action programme of intensive and sustained pest control.

Other key measures include a comprehensive programme of relocation of birds to safe havens for captive breeding.

Up till now, breeding pairs have been returned to the areas they originated from, after locals had given assurances that suitable intensive pest control would take place in the forests before the birds were replaced.

The returned kokako may not have been "pure original stock", but rather their direct descendants.

In future, under today's Recovery Programme, kokako pairs will also be put into other areas they disappeared from long ago, including Wellington, Hawkes Bay and Tongariro/Taupo.

Stepped-up pest control programmes will be implemented in these areas, at the same time.

Working together to restore and care for our unique biodiversity is the way ahead.

None of the work carried out so far, or planned for the future to save the kokako would be possible without the support and involvement of the wider community.

I¡¦d like to end this presentation by thanking the many people and organisations involved:  
„h The Auckland Regional Council, for their outstanding work as a management partner with the Department of Conservation in recovering kokako in the Hunua Ranges.

„h Mel Galbraith and the Supporters of Tiritiri Matangi group for their outstanding efforts to restore this island sanctuary.

„h The Kaharoa and Manawahe community trusts in the Bay of Plenty for helping to care for their small but precious local kokako populations.

„h Iwi involved with kokako management, and with transfers of birds to or from their areas. The recovery group has given commitments to Ngati Wai of Great Barrier Island, and to Ngati Tama of north Taranaki, that kokako will be returned to these areas when their numbers are higher, and when pest control can be done to ensure that the birds¡¦ return is a safe one. Ngati Maniopoto have blessed and farewelled several kokako taken from Mapara (King Country) to Tiritiri Matangi Island, here, and other places.

„h Corporate sponsors - and my thanks in particular to the two previous sponsors of the Kokako Recovery Programme, Tasman Forestry and State Insurance and the Norwich Union Group. Your contributions have been of enormous importance and you have set a fine example to the wider business community.

„h The Department of Conservation¡¦s research partners - Landcare Research Ltd; Waikato, Auckland and the Australian National Universities, whose students have undertaken important work with kokako, including on Tiritiri Matangi; and also the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, which has funded some of this research.

Looking ahead, I¡¦d like to invite you all to take up the challenge of helping to restore the unique natural heritage we have here in New Zealand.

The kokako is part of that heritage¡Xin many ways it¡¦s a flagship species, and whatever work is done to restore our mainland forests for the kokako will benefit everything else as well.

I have one final announcement to make.

The kokako, famed for its beautiful song, has been joined by another famous New Zealander with a wonderful voice¡XDame Malvina Major has kindly agreed to take on the role of patron for this Kokako Recovery Programme.

It¡¦s exciting to see the arts and scientific and conservation communities coming together in this way.

I trust that Dame Malvina¡¦s association with the Kokako Recovery Programme will act as a catalyst for the business community to lend their support and their voice to one of the biggest challenges facing all New Zealanders ¡V the conservation of our unique natural heritage.
