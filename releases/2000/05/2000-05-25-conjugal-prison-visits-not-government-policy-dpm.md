Prime Minister Helen Clark and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton confirmed that it was not government policy to have conjugal visits in prisons.

"The Minister of Corrections was expressing his desire to evaluate options being used overseas to reduce re-offending.

"No such proposals have even been brought to Cabinet for consideration," Helen Clark and Jim Anderton said.
