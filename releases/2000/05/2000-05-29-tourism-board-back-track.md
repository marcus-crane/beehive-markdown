The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has welcomed the positive report of the Government Administration Committee into the performance of the New Zealand Tourism Board.

"This report recognises the Board's efforts in terms of its own organisation and focus.

"In the time since the election, I have been pleased by the Board's commitment to working with me, with the Office of Tourism and Sport and with key industry organisations to rebuild positive and constructive working relationships.

"This is essential to maximising the potentially huge economic benefits Tourism can bring to New Zealand.

"I recently announced a new initiative, the Tourism Research and Forecasting Clearinghouse. Quite simply this important initiative would not be possible without the cooperation that has been built between Tourism New Zealand, The Office of Tourism and Sport, the Tourism Industry Association and my office.

"Of even more importance, the progress being made on the National Tourism Strategy depends on these constructive working relationships.

"Tourism New Zealand has moved on from the problems encountered under the last government. The challenge now for the new government, Tourism New Zealand and the industry as a whole is to capitalise on the immense opportunities tourism offers," Mark Burton said.
