Health Minister Annette King and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche today announced the Government has reinstated the Pacific Island Provider Development fund with an injection of $1.51 million this year, and a guarantee of funding in the future.

The two Ministers described the move as a significant Closing the Gaps initiative to address the health disparities suffered by Pacific people.

Mrs King said the "need to encourage more Pacific people to participate in the health sector is critically important. Their needs can clearly be met more effectively when providers reflect their linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Through these providers we want to improve access to primary health care and other community based services."

Mr Gosche said the initiative was one of the most important supported by the Gaps committee of cabinet ministers. "Provider development ultimately is about capacity building in communities. Communities need the capacity to identify their own problems, and to manage their solutions. The Government's role is to provide communities with the resources to do just that. That is what this initiative is all about."

Mrs King and Mr Gosche said the Pacific Provider Development Scheme had been established by the previous Government with a one-off allocation of $1 million.

"A one-off allocation doesn't work because there is no guarantee of continuity of health services. The extra $1.51 million we have now allocated for the rest of this year will encourage the Pacific health providers who have already been established to develop further capacity," the ministers said.

"In future years funding will be guaranteed through Vote Health baselines. This money represents a committed start to turning the health status of Pacific people around."
