The Government is contributing up to $2.5 million towards a capital fund for the three-stage Project K programme which includes wilderness adventure, community challenge and mentoring.

The fund will be administered by the Project K Foundation. Project K - the programme developed by mountaineer Graeme Dingle - is seeking to establish a $10 million fund. The Government will match fundraising dollar for dollar up to $2.5 million from this year's supplementary estimates.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the work Project K was already doing met the Government's 'closing the gaps' objectives. The capital fund will give Project K a secure base to expand its programmes.

"It is about giving young people opportunity through arming them with some valuable skills at a critical stage in their lives. Project K gives them challenges that help them make sound decisions later in their lives. I am incredibly impressed with the results of Project K's work. I'm surprised that it received so little support from the previous government.

"Project K's slogan is 'maximising youth potential'. It recognises young people's strengths and aims to build on them. Participation in the project starts off in the young person's community, includes a stint in the wilderness and then is completed back in the community where the young person is mentored while they put the skills they have learnt in the wilderness to work towards their life goals.

"The Government believes Project K is an initiative that the wider community should also support. That's why we have entered into this dollar for dollar agreement. I hope businesses will also meet the challenge and contribute to Project K," Trevor Mallard said.

The fund will be used to raise income to support the operation of Project K.
