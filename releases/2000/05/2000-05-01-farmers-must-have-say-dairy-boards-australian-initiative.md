"New Zealand dairy farmers must be consulted on the Dairy Board's proposed  
partial merger with Australian dairy company Bonlac, " said Alliance agriculture  
spokesperson John Wright MP today.

While Bonlac's Australian dairy farmer shareholders will have a direct voice in  
giving approval to the plans, their New Zealand counterparts will have to rely  
on a decision of the Dairy Board's small board of directors, dominated by  
representatives of the large Kiwi and Dairy Group co-operatives.

"Kiwi and Dairy Group are the two companies that have been unable to  
successfully conclude the mega-merger proposal. Farmers have a healthy  
scepticism over the companies' ability to put the interests of the industry  
ahead of inter-company politics

"New Zealand has over recent years seen many hard working people burnt by new  
business directions that failed.

"While the proposed move appears to be in line with the future directions  
signalled by the mega-merger proposal, industry leaders should be now be aware  
of the need to take the farmers who are the real owners of the industry with  
them," said John Wright MP.
