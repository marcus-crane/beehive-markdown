Associate Minister for Transport, Judith Tizard, said tonight she was disappointed that the deadline for the Auckland region's negotiations with Tranz Rail had passed without any agreement being reached.

"My frustration is nothing compared to what the people of Auckland must feel – they rightly expect the parties to find a solution," she said.

The Auckland Regional Council and Tranz Rail agreed to a one-week extension today on the advice of the region's negotiating team.

The move came after there was an indication that Tranz Rail had shifted its position on the use of rail corridors for improved passenger transport.

"What we want is for all the parties to find a way of using the rail corridors to relieve Auckland's congestion problems as quickly as possible, at a price that Auckland can afford," said Judith Tizard.
