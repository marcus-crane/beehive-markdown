The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Phil Goff, leaves for Europe on 6 - 15 May to visit Lisbon, Brussels, Berlin and London.

A major reason for trip is to attend Zealand’s twice-yearly Ministerial Consultations with the European Union Presidency which are held at Foreign Minister level (Portugal is current EU President). The consultations with each Presidency are key elements in New Zealand’s Political Declaration with the EU. While in Portugal Mr Goff will meet Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, as well as Foreign Minister Dr Jaime Gama. The current situation and future prospects for East Timor are likely to feature largely in the discussions.

In Brussels Mr Goff will meet key EU players including former NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana (now leading the EU on foreign and security policy), Chris Patten (External Relations Commissioner – further discussions on the Political Declaration) and David Byrne (food safety). In Germany the Minister has a meeting with Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and with members of the Bundestag Australia-New Zealand Committee. The Minister is expected to discuss current regional security issues with Solana and Fischer, including the situation in Chechnya and the Balkans. Mr Goff will brief them on developments in the South Pacific and East Timor.

In both Berlin and Brussels the Minister will open new New Zealand Chanceries participating on each occasion in hiki tapu ceremonies with invited guests.

Mr Goff’s London programme includes a meeting and lunch with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook (Zimbabwe/Iraq sanctions/EU developments) and meetings with John Battle (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Minister for Asia-Pacific – recent developments in our region) and Home Secretary Jack Straw (eg crime prevention/restorative justice/victims issues). Zimbabwe and the Solomon Islands are expected to be among the issues discussed when the Minister calls on the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon.
