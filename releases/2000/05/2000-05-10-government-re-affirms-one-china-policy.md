The passage of an opposition backbencher's notice of motion in Parliament today does not signal any change in the Government's One China policy.

Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said New Zealand recognised the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. This was part of the agreement whereby New Zealand established formal diplomatic relations with China in 1972.

The Labour-Alliance coalition government has reinforced this view with Chinese officials since the election.

Today's notice of motion caught the Government by surprise, but did not alter New Zealand's foreign policy, Mr Sutton said.

Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff is overseas and Mr Sutton was out of the House on previously-scheduled business when the notice was passed.

The terms of the 1972 agreement between New Zealand and China accept that New Zealand will continue to develop economic and cultural links with Taiwan. New Zealand values those links and it is certainly the Government's intention to pursue them vigorously.
