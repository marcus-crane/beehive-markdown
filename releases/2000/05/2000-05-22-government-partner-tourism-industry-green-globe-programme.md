The New Zealand Government has committed $150,000 to support the establishment of the Green Globe 21 environmental standard programme for tourism in New Zealand, Tourism Minister Mark Burton and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.  
The Ministry of the Environment's Sustainable Management Fund and the Office of Tourism and Sport will join with the Tourism Industry Association to fund the programme.  
Green Globe 21 is a global programme for the travel and tourism industry. New Zealand tourism operators will be encouraged to write and adhere to environmental policy statements, which should result in improved environmental performance.  
The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said it was encouraging to see the tourism industry prepared to get involved proactively in management of tourism's greatest asset - the environment.  
"We know that we must manage the environment responsibly. The Green Globe 21 programme and the environmental policy statements will provide valuable tools to assist the tourism industry enhance, manage and monitor its performance as one of the caretakers of New Zealand's unique ecosystems," Mr Burton said.  
Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said it was pleasing to see a world-recognised and proven environmental management programme being introduced into New Zealand.  
"I am really encouraged that the tourism industry is taking a proactive stance to protect our environment with Green Globe 21, which is linked to Agenda 21 - the comprehensive programme of sustainable development signed by New Zealand and 182 other countries at the United Nations Earth Summit in Brazil.  
"The implementation of this programme by the New Zealand tourism industry will have specific and measurable outcomes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions," Ms Hobbs said.

Tourism Industry Association Chief Executive Glenys Coughlan has welcomed the partnership with Government.  
"Industries such as tourism are recognising the need to be responsible for the environments they depend on.  
"New Zealand's environment is one of our key marketing advantages and this programme will encourage tourism operators to see environmental quality as a source of competitive advantage rather than as a cost to the bottom line of their business."  
Ms Coughlan said that for change to occur, it was important that all sectors of the tourism industry - from major tourism companies to emerging grass roots operators – were encouraged to be involved in this initiative.
