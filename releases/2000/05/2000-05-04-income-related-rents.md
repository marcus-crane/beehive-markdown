The government aims to introduce income related state house rents for low earners from December 1, the Minister of Housing Mark Gosche confirmed today.

"Our commitment to low income state house tenants stands and we are aiming to introduce income related rents before the end of the year," he said.

"The target is now set for the end of the year – this is well ahead of earlier plans to introduce income related rents by the end of the parliamentary term."

"Making state housing affordable to those in serious need is a priority for this government."

The policy work on this has been underway since this government took office and will continue.

"The introduction of income related rents will require legislation and we plan to introduce this later this month."
