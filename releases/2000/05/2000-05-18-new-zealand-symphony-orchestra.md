Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said today that the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra would receive an immediate capital injection to stabilise its finances, and an increase in annual operational funding to place the Orchestra on a sustainable footing.

Helen Clark said the NZSO would receive a one-off $3 million capital injection this year and an extra $1.4 million annually.

"The $3 million capital injection is a recovery measure, and will stabilise the NZSO's financial position following its move to new premises.

"Additional annual funding was also sought to ensure that the NZSO could continue performing at the quality and with the frequency that it has up until now.

"The Orchestra is at a point where, without additional funding, it would be forced to cut back its activities. Areas facing cuts included the New Zealand Chamber Orchestra and the NZSO's subscription concerts, which would have had to fall from 50 to 36.

"The NZSO has an international reputation for excellence. Providing the NZSO with the funding it requires will ensure that it can continue to perform throughout New Zealand at an international standard."

The NZSO is established as a limited liability Crown company and also as a Crown entity under the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Act 1988 and the Public Finance Act 1989.

The NZSO Statement of Intent records that it aims to enrich the musical life of New Zealanders by presenting artistically excellent concerts, performed throughout the country and abroad by a full-time professional orchestra of international standing.
