Education Minister Trevor Mallard will attend a hui at Mokai, near Taupo, this weekend to discuss the recently released Waitangi Tribunal report on the Mokai School closure. Trevor Mallard will be accompanied by Asssociate Education Minister Parekura Horomia, Taupo MP Mark Burton and Waiariki MP Mita Ririnui.

The small school was closed last October by the previous Minister of Education because of its low roll, Education Review Office reports that the quality of education was substandard, and because suitable education was available at nearby schools.

In a report released last month, the Waitangi Tribunal recommended the school be re-opened. It wanted the Ministry of Education to give the school enhanced resourcing and support for two years, on condition that the Mokai community ensures that a board of trustees is established, that a Maori teaching principal who has the confidence of the community is appointed, and that the school has a stable roll.

Trevor Mallard said the Government wanted to meet with the Mokai community before any response was made to the Tribunal's recommendations.

"Tomorrow we will start looking at how we will respond to the needs outlined in the Waitangi Tribunal report."

The hui is being convened by Ngati Tuwharetoa Paramount Chief Tumu Te Heuheu.

Detail of hui are attached.
