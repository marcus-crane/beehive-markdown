State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said the report of the Ministerial Review into the Department of Work and Income was a polished and thoughtful overview of the organisation and performance of the department.

"The Government will be issuing a formal response to the report in a few weeks. However, our early view is that there appears to be a lot within the report that we will take up," Trevor Mallard said.

"I would like to publicly thank the review head Don Hunn for a thorough and professional job.

"During the course of the review, Mr Hunn and his team have considered submissions from nearly one thousand individuals and organisations.

"It is clear from the report that the department has a major credibility problem. The problems identified are not tangible problems like financial mismanagement. They are intangible issues like a lack of experience; poor judgement; the perception of the department as adopting a culture of waste and extravagance.

"There are also issues regarding the wider state sector and my role as Minister of State Services in ensuring that the public service is made well aware of Government expectations.

"Issuing a detailed response to this report will be a priority for the Government over the next few weeks," Trevor Mallard said.
