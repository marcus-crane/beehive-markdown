The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, said the new chief executive of Te Puni Kokiri Mr Leith Comer has his full support and endorsement.

"I look forward to working with Leith to advance the social and economic outcomes of Maori people. This will mean working with Maori communities to provide the best advice possible to Ministers and government agencies."

Mr Horomia said all applicants for the chief executive's position were of an extremely high calibre and we have to rise above any nonsense of ill-feeling over the final appointment.

The Minister said Mr Comer's track record speaks for itself and he has the utmost confidence in Mr Comer's ability to do the job well.

"I see the chief executive's role as critical in bringing on board government agencies who are struggling with their responsibilities towards Maori people. I believe that Mr Comer is more than capable to handle the task and look forward to working with him, when he takes over the position in February."

Mr Horomia also went on to congratulate Anne Carter, who has just been appointed as the chief executive of the Ministry of Youth Affairs.

He said like Mr Comer, Ms Carter is well qualified for the role and he looked forward to the positive leadership that she will give in the provision of initiatives for young people of New Zealand.

Mr Horomia said Mr Comer has affiliations to Ngati Rangitihi, Te Arawa; Ngati Mamoe, Ngai Tahu; and Ngati Pahauwera, while Ms Carter has affiliations to Ngati Raukawa and Ngati Kahungunu.

"Next year, I want to build on strategies that the coalition government has been consolidating this year for Maori people and leaders like Mr Comer and Ms Carter will play significant roles in that work."
