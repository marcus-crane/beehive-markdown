The Government will provide an additional $5.483 million to Child, Youth and Family this financial year to help it provide care for at-risk children, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The additional funding for 2000/01 was approved by the Cabinet yesterday following heavier than expected demand for care services. New funding will be distributed around the country based on population and socio-economic factors. In addition, the Department is also identifying what else it can reprioritise to care costs from within its existing budget.

“The extra money will help care for children who have been abused and neglected. It will also help ease the pressure on busy frontline social workers by putting more resources at their disposal.

"Costs of care for abused and neglected children is a significant pressure on the Department's budget and without additional funding Child, Youth and Family would struggle even harder to recruit and retain social workers.

“All regions will benefit from the extra funding, although those places identified as having greatest need will get proportionately more. The Government will be further reviewing Child, Youth and Family funding in the lead up to the 2001 Budget," Steve Maharey said.

The table below shows how most of this money will be allocated regionally. Following further analysis of need, another $795,050 will be divided up amongst those areas with the greatest care cost pressures.
