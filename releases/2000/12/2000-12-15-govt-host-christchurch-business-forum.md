South Island business leaders have been invited to a forum with government ministers to identify initiatives to improve New Zealand's economic performance.

The forum, to be held in Christchurch on February 9, follows on from the Auckland business-to-government forum held in October.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said the forums demonstrated the importance that the government attaches to developing and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with business to improve New Zealand's economic performance.

"The Christchurch forum continues our serious and pragmatic efforts to work with business to identify and implement policy initiatives which will create wealth and improve further both the economic and social climate in New Zealand.

"While the New Zealand economy is enjoying a period of export-led growth, we all want to be part of building a sustainably growing economy for the long term, which produces ever more sophisticated goods and services and guarantees New Zealanders high standards of living.

"This government acknowledges that there are limitations on what governments can achieve on their own. That is why we actively seek partnerships across the economic sectors and society as a whole.

"The challenges facing us can only be met effectively by working partnerships between stake holders and government. This forum is a further step in building partnerships between government and business," Helen Clark said.

The forum will be held in Christchurch on Friday 9 February 2001 at the Christchurch Convention Centre. On 8 February, there will be an evening function for the forum participants.

Ministers who will be attending include Helen Clark; Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Development and Industry and Regional Development; Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance and Revenue; Steve Maharey, Minister of Social Services and Employment; Jim Sutton, Minister of Agriculture and Trade Negotiations; Trevor Mallard, Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Finance; Pete Hodgson, Minister of Research, Science and Technology; Margaret Wilson, Minister of Labour; Lianne Dalziel, Minister of Immigration; Mark Burton, Minister of SOEs and Tourism; Paul Swain, Minister of Commerce, Communications and Information Technology; and Matt Robson, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Business leaders invited are from a range of sectors. Around one hundred participants are expected to attend.

Like the earlier Auckland forum, it will be a private function at which Chatham House rules will apply. There will be a media briefing after the forum
