Te Uri o Hau and the Crown today signed an agreement that will settle all of Te Uri o Hau's historical treaty claims.

It's the first signing of a Deed of Settlement by the Labour Alliance Government and the first time a deed has been signed for the Northland area

The Deed - signed by the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Margaret Wilson, and representatives of Te Uri o Hau - is the formal and final commitment of both the government and Te Uri o Hau to the details of the settlement.

Te Uri o Hau is a Northland hapu of Ngati Whatua whose traditional region is in Northern Kaipara. Te Uri o Hau has about 6,000 members.

The deed provides redress for Te Uri o Hau for Crown breaches in the past of its Treaty obligations. These breaches led to significant loss of land and resources for Te Uri o Hau, and subsequent damage to its communities.

“The decision of Te Uri O Hau to accept the settlement package and end this historical grievance will be welcomed by all New Zealanders," said Ms Wilson.

“The historical evidence proved that the Crown has acted in breach of its obligations and that redress is justified.

"All members of Te Uri o Hau have had the opportunity to vote on whether to support the settlement.

Their endorsement allows the Crown and Te Uri a Hau to put the past behind us and move onto a new stage of the relationship. To implement the settlement, legislation will be drawn up and introduced to the House as soon as possible."
