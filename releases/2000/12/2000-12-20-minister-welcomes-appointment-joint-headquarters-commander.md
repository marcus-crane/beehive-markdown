The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has welcomed the appointment of Brigadier Martyn Dunne as the new Commander, Joint Forces, New Zealand.

"Among the initiatives announced in June's Defence Policy Framework was the intention to combine the existing Navy, Army and Air Force operational headquarters into a joint operational headquarters (JHQ).

"The three armed services work most effectively when they work together, and this approach will ensure a fully coordinated and structured approach to joint operations.

"Trentham has been chosen as the location for the JHQ and the appointment of Brigadier Dunne as Commander is another important step as we look towards the full implementation of JHQ by July 2001.

"Brigadier Dunne brings a special combination of operational and administrative experience to the job and he has been overseeing the successful organisation of the JHQ. I am confident he will fulfil the demands of this key new position," Mark Burton said.

The new joint headquarters will be responsible for all Defence Force operational deployments (the NZDF is currently involved in 14 missions worldwide) as well as all joint and international combined exercises.
