Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has launched the highly visible Highway Patrol.

The Highway Patrol will specialise on policing New Zealand highways and roads. It is designed to reduce road deaths and injury from road accidents," George Hawkins said.

"This Labour Alliance Government committed itself to having a highly visible police patrol presence on New Zealand roads before this Christmas.

"I applaud the Police for being able to achieve this," George Hawkins said.

New livery for Police Highway Patrol vehicles is designed to be highly visible in all road conditions, whether it be day or night.

"A clearly marked, clearly seen, patrol vehicle is an obvious deterrent to speeding drivers and those who flaunt road laws. It is also a clear assurance to the public that the Police are out there doing their job in making our roads safer," George Hawkins said.

A recent LTSA survey of 1645 New Zealand adults showed New Zealanders believe enforcement is one of the main things to make travelling on our roads safer.

"Evidence shows that road traffic policing is most effective when Police are clearly visible and display an obvious presence," George Hawkins said.

"It is the Government's expectation, that the Highway Patrol will have a positive impact on New Zealand's road toll.

"I am pleased that this excellent initiative has been launched in time for the Christmas holiday period," George Hawkins said.
