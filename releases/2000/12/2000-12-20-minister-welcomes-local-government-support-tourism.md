The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has welcomed acknowledgment from local government leaders of the importance of tourism in New Zealand.

Mr Burton today met with Wellington Mayor Mark Blumsky, who presented a letter signed by a number of Mayors and Regional Council chairpersons, supporting efforts to market New Zealand as a tourist destination.

"I have been looking forward to receiving this letter since it was publicised six weeks ago," Mark Burton said.

"Now that I have received it, I want to thank regional leaders for recognising that tourism is an important driver of economic activity.

"To ensure the sustainable development of Tourism throughout New Zealand, the private sector, central and local government, and interested organisations need to work together. As Minister, I am encouraging this partnership approach.

"This is at the heart of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy, which the Government has actively promoted and is working to develop cooperatively with all interested groups," Mark Burton said.
