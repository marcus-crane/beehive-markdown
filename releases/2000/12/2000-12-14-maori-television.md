The Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Parekura Horomia says he wants to talk with the parties involved before he makes any announcement about Maori television.

Mr Horomia said he was notified of this morning's annual general meeting of the Awhiorangi trust but as the trust was reporting to its parent organisation, it is not appropriate for the Minister to comment on the trust's operation.

The Minister of Maori Affairs says he has discussed broadcasting with his colleagues and that some progress has been made but he wants to talk with the parties involved before making any announcement.

In terms of time, Mr Horomia said he is still hopeful that work to set up the Maori channel will begin early next year.
