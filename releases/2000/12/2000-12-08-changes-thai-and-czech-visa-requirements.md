Thai and Czech Republic visitors to New Zealand will require visitor visas from 1 January 2001, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

Lianne Dalziel said the Government is suspending its visa waiver agreements with the Czech Republic and Thailand as a result of the number of visitors claiming refugee status when in New Zealand, being refused entry at the border, or working illegally in New Zealand.

Currently, people from Thailand and the Czech Republic can travel to New Zealand visa-free, and genuine visitors are granted three-month visitor permits on arrival at the border.

"The changes will mean that Thai and Czech Republic nationals will need to obtain Visitor Visas before they depart their countries for New Zealand.

"New Zealand and the Czech Republic have had a reciprocal visa waiver arrangement since October 1996 to facilitate travel, trade, tourism and education links. The same visa waiver status with Thailand was introduced in November 1987.

"The visa waiver programme was designed to facilitate travel for genuine visitors to New Zealand, but the scheme is being abused by some Thai and Czech nationals seeking to either work illegally in New Zealand or to lodge unfounded refugee claims.

"Our immigration policy encourages migrants with skills to be part of New Zealand life, and also protects refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. But we must move to put a stop to people seeking to prop up illegal work practices and those who are diverting valuable time and resource from genuine refugee claims.

"The recent rise in the number of refugee claims by Thai and Czech nationals is perhaps explained by the ability of refugee claimants to obtain work permits and access to the benefit system.

"At the same time we want to assure bona fide visitors that they are welcome and still encouraged to visit New Zealand.

"We have opened a NZ Immigration Service office in Bangkok to facilitate Visitor Visa applications. Czech visa applications will initially be processed by the NZIS in London while options for an office closer to the Czech Republic are urgently considered," Lianne Dalziel said.

The Thai and Czech Republic Governments have been consulted about the suspension of the visa waivers. Thai and Central European travel agencies and airlines have been advised of the changes and they have been asked to advise intending travellers of New Zealand's visa requirements.

People who have already purchased tickets for travel to New Zealand prior to today's announcement should immediately contact their nearest NZIS office, NZ High Commission, Embassy or Consulate.
