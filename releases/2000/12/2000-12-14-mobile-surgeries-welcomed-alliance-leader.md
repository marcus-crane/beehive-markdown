"More people in heartland New Zealand will have access to surgery thanks to the implementation of the Alliance policy of the introduction of mobile surgical theatres," says Alliance Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

The surgeries are being announced today by the Minister of Health Annette King.

"During the election campaign the Alliance proposed mobile surgical theatres as a way to assist in reducing waiting lists and provide access to surgery for rural people. This Labour Alliance Coalition government has looked at the issues and as part of the commitment to the health needs of rural people these mobile surgery buses are being supported.

"Coalition Government is about taking some ideas from both parties and this is one example of something that has been added by the Alliance," said Jim Anderton.

The mobile theatres are the brainchild of Christchurch surgeon Stuart Gowland and a prototype was toured during the election campaign.
