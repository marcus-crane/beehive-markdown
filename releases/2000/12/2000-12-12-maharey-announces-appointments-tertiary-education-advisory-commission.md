New appointments to the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission were announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Victoria University of Wellington Chancellor and Education New Zealand Chair Russell Marshall will Chair the Commission and businessman Hugh Fletcher has been appointed as an additional member. Established in April, the Commission is charged with advising the Government on how to refocus New Zealand's tertiary education system to meet the challenges of a globalised economy and a knowledge-based society. Mr Maharey said that Russell Marshall and Hugh Fletcher bring excellent skills to the Commission.

"Better linking the tertiary education system to our economy and society is a key task the Government has set for the remainder of this term. The Government is fortunate to have been able to secure the expertise of Russell Marshall and Hugh Fletcher.

"Russell Marshall was a former Minister of Education and is currently Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington and chair of Education New Zealand. He has broad experience in the tertiary education sector, particularly of the issues faced by universities and polytechnics. He also brings an extensive international perspective to the Commission through his work as the former chair of the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO.

"Hugh Fletcher brings his considerable business and industry experience to the Commission. He has a detailed knowledge of the commerical world through his directorships of many boards and has taken an active interest in tertiary education issues through his membership of the University of Auckland Council.

"Both Commissioners join the TEAC at an opportune time. Starting next year plans for significant change to the tertiary education system will be discussed and it is essential that the Commission has the right mix of skills on board for the job ahead," Steve Maharey said.
