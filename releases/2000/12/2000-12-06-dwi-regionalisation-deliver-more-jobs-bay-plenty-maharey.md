Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the Bay of Plenty and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for the Bay of Plenty at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Bay of Plenty Regional Commissioner Carl Crafar.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Bay of Plenty DWI region covers the Rotorua, Tauranga, Western Bay, Whakatane, Kawerau, Opotiki, Taupo and South Waikato districts. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the forestry, horticulture, elderly care and tourism industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to introduce specialist case management for youth, Maori and the long term unemployed and working more closely with sectors, such as forestry, to develop strategic plans and identify real employment opportunities.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* seasonal work opportunities in the Eastern Bay of Plenty; and,

\* forestry training in partnership with industry and the ITO.

"The Bay of Plenty region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
