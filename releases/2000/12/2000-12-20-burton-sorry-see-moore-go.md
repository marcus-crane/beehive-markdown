The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has expressed his regret at the resignation of his Australian counterpart John Moore.

"I have written to John Moore wishing him well in his future endeavours.

"I was sorry to hear of his decision to resign after a long and distinguished parliamentary career. Over the past year we have developed a positive and candid relationship.

"I believe our open and frank discussions have contributed to an effective trans-Tasman dialogue.

"I look forward to having a similar working relationship with John Moore's successor," Mark Burton said.
