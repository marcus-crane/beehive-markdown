Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson says he is pleased the electricity industry is getting on with the job of setting up the new governance structure required by the Government's Power Package.

Mr Hodgson released today the first report he has received from the Electricity Governance Establishment Committee, set up by the industry in response to the Power Package and chaired by David Caygill.

"The industry has set itself an ambitious work programme," Mr Hodgson said. "I am satisfied it is aiming to take no longer than necessary to make the arrangements the Government requires."

The new Electricity Governance Board required by the Power Package is expected to be operating by the beginning of July 2001. The industry aims to submit a proposal for Commerce Commission approval by April, allowing three months for it to be processed.

The Board is to have a majority of independent members and an independent chair.

The industry and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs are also moving rapidly to set up an Electricity Ombudsman scheme. Mr Hodgson said he hoped to see the scheme open early next year.
