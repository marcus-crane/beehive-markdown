Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the Waikato and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Waikato at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Waikato Regional Commissioner Katrina Ings.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Waikato DWI region covers Hamilton, Huntly and Ngaruawahia, and the Hauraki and rural Waikato regions. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to building stronger relationships with key community agencies. Intensive case management will continue with a specific focus in Hauraki were there is a real need to support the long term unemployed into employment.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* an alliance with the University of Waikato – Unitrack – to place graduates into jobs; and,

\* a three-year plan to improve the marketing and management skills available to the vegetable growing industry.

"The Waikato region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
