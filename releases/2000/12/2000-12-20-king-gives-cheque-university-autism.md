Health Minister Annette King today handed over the first payment of $10,000 to Massey University to set up the Post Graduate Diploma for people working in the area of autism.

"I am delighted the Government is able to support such an important area of disability support services," Mrs King said. "This course will fill a training gap for people working in the area of autism. People with autism and their families often have complex needs, and we need to ensure we have well-trained and qualified people to ensure we are delivering services in the best way."

Mrs King said improvements would not happen overnight, "but we need to take a long term view to developing and training the workforce. Setting up a postgraduate diploma in Autism is definitely a step in the right direction."

The two-year contract, worth $316,000 (plus GST), will cover a range of material to equip people for an advanced level of specialisation in the area of autism. This initiative has resulted from joint planning by the Clinical Training Agency (CTA) and the Disability Support Services operating group of the Health Funding Authority, with assistance from the CTA Disability Support Services Advisory Group. Massey was selected following a tender process.

Mrs King said the diploma would be completed part-time over two years, leading to a nationally recognised qualification, with at least 30% of the course clinically focussed. The courses would be delivered by a combination of visiting lecturers and staff employed by Massey University, she said.

The need to increase training for people working in the area of autism was identified in a 1998 report that reviewed the services available to people with autism and their families. "The long-term objective of the diploma training is to promote and develop New Zealand based expertise in the care and support of people with autism."

Background Material

The Autism Services in New Zealand Report released in October 1998, identified concerns around support services for people with ASD and their carers. In response to the issues raised in this report the Autism Services Interdepartmental Working Group, consisting of representatives from the Ministries of Health and Education, the HFA, Department of Child Youth & Family, and Specialist Education Services (SES), was established and has been working to address these concerns.

The central theme of the group's work has been the need for leadership in health and education, workforce development, clinical diagnosis and service delivery, with the aim of developing and strengthening interagency protocols in order to better meet the needs of people with autism and their families.

They have been working interdepartmentally to focus on professional development, in tandem with service development initiatives by the various agencies. The Government agencies involved with the working group have been undertaking both joint projects and their own work to address the issues. Much of this work has also been undertaken in partnership with the Autistic Association of New Zealand.

Postgraduate Diploma in Arts (Autism)

Massey University Post will offer New Zealand's first post-graduate diploma course in autism and related disability studies starting next year. The new, two-year, extramural programme has been funded by the Ministry of Health. The four-paper programme is a blend of theory and best practice. The two core papers will be taught by Maureen Arathoon (programme co-ordinator and Dr Martin Sullivan (programme developer).

Maureen Arathoon will teach a paper called People with Autism whose Behaviour Challenges. She works half time in the disability sector for central New Zealand service Tautoko Services, which provides support for people with an intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviour, their families and support systems. She says this dual approach will assist the integration of theory and practice in the programme.

Programme developer Dr Martin Sullivan, who is a paraplegic, will teach disability studies - investigating the way society creates disability and disabled people by stigmatising and generally excluding impaired people from  
participating in their community.

As well as completing the two core papers, students will be able to choose from a range of other papers related to the field. An Australian autism expert Dr Tony Attwood will also be teaching autism from a medical/clinical viewpoint.

Enrolments are being accepted now with places for up to 20 students for 2001. Massey School of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work head, Professor Robyn Munford says they will run a complete, two-year programme before accepting further enrolments.

Other Initiatives and their progress

The one-off injection of $200,000 that was made available in November 1998 as part of the Child Health Strategy has been used very successfully. The development and distribution of 3000 information packs for families by the Autistic Association has received very positive feedback. The need for the development of these packs reflects the difficulty parents and families face around the time of diagnosis, and the positive feedback that we have received about the information packs indicates that families have been finding them very useful.

Part of this money was used to fund a series of training seminars by overseas experts such as Dr Gillberg from Sweden, Professor Francesca Happe from the United Kingdom, and senior staff from the National Autistic Society of the United Kingdom and was aimed at up-skilling health professionals and carers. This has also been very well received.

This financial year government provided an additional $10 million in this year's budget for the HFA to increase the provision of residential care, respite care and home support services. Some of these additional services will be used by people with ASD.

The Early Bird intervention model, a parent training programme, designed in Britain, is being piloted under contract to the Autistic Association in the Wellington region, by a group of six families. This work is jointly funded by the HFA and the Ministry of Education, and if it is deemed effective these agencies are very interested in extending the model to other parts of New Zealand.

The report on Autism Services also identified a lack of understanding of autism over the whole disability sector. This in turn highlighted shortfalls in the responses of needs assessment and service co-ordination services and support service providers. In response to this the HFA, in partnership with the Autistic Association and other interested groups, has produced a set of guidelines that aim to ensure that needs assessment facilitators and service co-ordinators are competent in working with people with ASD and their families. An associated training programme for service co-ordinators has also been developed.

The Ministry of Education and SES are also collaborating to strengthen support for children with ASD within the education sector. This work includes onvening an ASD Reference Group to monitor implementation of the SE2000 policy and consider issues of best practice with regards to ASD. SES has also almost finished developing a comprehensive training and resource package for all staff working with children and young people with ASD.

In addition to this the Ministry of Education has published an introductory booklet for all schools on supporting students with ASD. This was written by parents, teachers and specialised providers, many of whom are members of the Ministry of Education's ASD Reference Group. The Ministry is also working with the Autistic Association in exploring the possibility of carrying out an education service gap analysis, and as one of number of responses to the Autism Services Report, it now requires all accredited special education providers to assign a case coordinator or key worker for every child or young person with ASD.

The HFA and Child Youth & Family are undertaking a joint project to address the needs of children with severe mental health problems who are also under Child Youth & Family care. Child Youth & Family is also developing therapeutic foster care programmes for the hardest to manage children, including 30-40 children with ASD. Once again an important aspect of this work is up-skilling para-professionals such as foster care and respite  
care providers.
