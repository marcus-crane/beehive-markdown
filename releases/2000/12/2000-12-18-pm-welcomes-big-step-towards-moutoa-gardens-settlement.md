Prime Minister Helen Clark today hailed an agreement reached between Crown, Whanganui iwi and the Wanganui District Council on the shared management of Moutoa gardens in Wanganui as a big step towards a lasting settlement of the issue.

Under an agreement outlined today, ownership of the gardens would be transferred from the Wanganui District Council to the Crown. A board comprised of representatives from the council, local iwi and the Crown would manage the gardens. The gardens will retain their status as a historic reserve and public access is guaranteed.

The agreement will now be released for public comment. The new management board could take over in February 2001, following further meetings of the parties involved.

"Moutoa gardens is a culturally and historically significant site for both pakeha New Zealanders and Maori," Helen Clark said.

"The strength of this bond was reflected in the tensions which arose out of the occupation of the gardens by members of the Whanganui iwi nearly six years ago.

"Today's agreement is a tribute to the willingness of Wanganui people to overcome these tensions in a spirit of genuine partnership.

"I congratulate outgoing Te Puni Kokiri chief executive Ngatata Love for the outstanding job he has done in chairing talks between Crown, iwi and council representatives on Moutoa Gardens since February of this year.

"The government convened these discussions and I am delighted at today's announcement and the progress it represents.

"A joint management approach reflects the history of Moutoa Gardens.

"Wanganui Iwi and settlers met at the gardens in the nineteenth century and it has traditionally been a joint meeting place. The joint management system is an opportunity to move Wanganui's community closer together," Helen Clark said.

As a physical symbol of a lasting agreement, Wanganui artist Joan Morrell will create a new sculpture to be installed at Moutoa Gardens.
