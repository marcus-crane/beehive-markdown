The Service Chiefs of the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force have been reappointed for a further year.

Chief of General Staff, Major General Maurice Dodson, has had his three-year appointment extended for one year, until February 2002.

Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Don Hamilton, has had his two-year appointment extended for one year, also until February 2002.

The current three-year term of Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Peter McHaffie, expires in April 2003.

"The reappointments will ensure a period of stability and experience in the senior management team of the New Zealand Defence Force," the Minister of Defence Mark Burton said.

"I look forward to continuing to work constructively with the Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Carey Adamson and his three Service Chiefs."
