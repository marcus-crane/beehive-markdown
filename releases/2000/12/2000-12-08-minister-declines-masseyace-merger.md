Education Minister Trevor Mallard has declined the proposed merger between Massey University and Auckland College of Education.  
“Having considered the educational benefits, I am not convinced that they are persuasive enough to justify a merger,” Trevor Mallard said.

The announcement follows the Minister's preliminary view made public in September to decline the proposed merger. Massey University and Auckland College of Education were then given the opportunity to submit reasons why that should not be confirmed.

“The evidence presented in the response to my preliminary view did not alter the evidence that supported that announcement.

“I am therefore confirming that the proposed merger of Massey University and Auckland College of Education should be declined."

"Key considerations in reaching the decision have been that:

\* "While the two institutions identified several educational benefits, given the insufficient evidence supporting how, I did not gain confidence that they would all be achieved.

\* “The proposed educational benefits do not, on their own, justify a merger

\* “Nor does the proposal seem to enhance the development of a collaborative, rather than competitive, approach between teacher education providers and therefore does not readily accord with government policy.

“Despite the claims of the two institutions, the Auckland College of Education’s financial statements and enrolment levels show that it should be viable in the medium term," Trevor Mallard said.

Under the Education Act 1989, the Councils of two institutions can agree to merge and then apply for the Minister for approval of the merger. The Act gives the Minister the discretion to determine what amounts to good reasons for approving a merger.
