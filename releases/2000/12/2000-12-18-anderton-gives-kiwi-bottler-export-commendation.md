"It is great to see jobs created in New Zealand through exporting, particularly in the regions," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton was speaking today at the factory of Paeroa softdrink manufacturer Kiwi Bottlers 96 Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Jianlibao New Zealand).

"This company has been given a Trade New Zealand Export Commendation for turning a derelict dairy factory into a thriving multi-million dollar export business, creating wealth and jobs for the North Island town," said Jim Anderton. The Trade New Zealand Export commendations are provided to companies who earn a minimum of $500,000 foreign exchange and around 30 are issued a year.

The company exports thirteen different flavoured soft drinks to Australia and is looking at Macau and other countries. Bottled water and other products are being investigated. The plant employs 20 staff.
