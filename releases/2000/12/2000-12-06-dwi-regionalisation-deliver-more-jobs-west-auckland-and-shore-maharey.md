Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs to Waitakere and the North Shore and better tailor its services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Auckland North at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Auckland North Regional Commissioner Barry Fisk.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Auckland North DWI region includes Waitakere City, the North Shore and the Rodney district. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the construction, manufacturing, retailing and agricultural industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to expanding existing partnerships with local bodies and enterprise agencies.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:

\* resourcing of a specialist youth team based in Waitakere, including support for employment programmes run by the Prince's Trust;

\* development of specialist case management teams at DWI offices able to respond to the particular needs of their local client base, and

\* intensive work with migrant engineers to place them into jobs.

"The Auckland North region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
