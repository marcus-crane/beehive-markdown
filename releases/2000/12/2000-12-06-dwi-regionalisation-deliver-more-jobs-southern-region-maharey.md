Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the Southern region and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for the Southern region at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Southern Regional Commissioner John Allen.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Southern DWI region covers the South Canterbury, Otago and Southland regions. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the tourism and hospitality, agriculture, forestry, fishing, viticulture and horticulture industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to ensure uniform service delivery excellence.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* establishing Moving South Taskforces;

\* investigating the provision of additional accomodation in Lumsden to complement the successful Lumsden-Queenstown worker bus; and,

\* establishing a new bus service, the Fruitloop, to bring workers into the Alexandra region.

"The Southern region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
