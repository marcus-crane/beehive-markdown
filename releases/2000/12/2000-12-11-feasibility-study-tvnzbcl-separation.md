The Government and TVNZ will jointly appoint commercial advisors to undertake a feasibility and viability study on establishing Broadcast Communications Limited (BCL) as a State Owned Enterprise separate from TVNZ, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

The study will also consider whether other distribution activities might be transferred to any new SOE.

“I have clearly stated for some time that the Government would be considering the viability or otherwise of the separation of BCL from TVNZ, as part of the Government’s review of broadcasting policy," Marian Hobbs said. "This feasibility and viability study will help the Government to make decisions on whether or not to proceed with this proposal."

The advisor will be selected by competitive tender, with an appointment expected in late-January.

A decision on whether to separate any of the distribution activities will be made in the second quarter of next year.
