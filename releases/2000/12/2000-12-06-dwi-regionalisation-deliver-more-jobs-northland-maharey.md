Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs for Northland and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Northland at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Northland Regional Commissioner Sharon Brownie.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Northland DWI region stretches from Towai to Cape Reinga. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the traditional Maori craft, hospitality and tourism, construction and foresty industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"Making extensive use of the seasonal work opportunities available within the region and strengthening alliances with community partners will assist with this challenge. In addition, DWI will introduce specialised case management for youth, Maori and the long term unemployed.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* development a Residential Motivational Programme run by the Ngati Hine utilising the resources of the Waitangi National Trust;

\* creating a specialist one-stop shop for unemployed youth in Whangarei; and,

\* running a pre-recruitment programme in conjunction with the New Zealand Police aimed at encouraging more Maori and women to join the force.

"The Northland region plan is an excellent example of the new locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
