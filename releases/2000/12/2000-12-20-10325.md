Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today released Cabinet papers on energy efficiency programmes designed to save taxpayers money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The papers relate to proposed minimum energy performance standards and labelling, and to an energy-saving programme for public sector organisations. The Cabinet decisions on both matters were announced in November.

Mr Hodgson has released the papers because of their contribution to the Government's climate change policy. Climate change papers are being released routinely in the interests of well-informed public debate.
