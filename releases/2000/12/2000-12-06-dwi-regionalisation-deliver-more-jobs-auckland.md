Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs for Auckland and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Auckland Central at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Auckland Central Regional Commissioner Isabel Evans.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Auckland Central DWI region covers the Auckland isthmus and the Gulf islands. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centred in the construction, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism and hospitality industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"The beneficiary population within the region is ethnically very diverse which presents a particular challenge for DWI work brokers. In the coming year priority will be given to building their employment and income support needs.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
„h support for new business initiatives through the Enterprise Allowance scheme, which is particularly popular with new migrants; and,  
„h a strong focus on assistance for disadvantaged groups such as migrants, refugees and people with disabilities.

"The Auckland Central region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
