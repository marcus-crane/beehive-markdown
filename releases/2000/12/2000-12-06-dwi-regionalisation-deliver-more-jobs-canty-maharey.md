Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in Canterbury and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Canterbury at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Canterbury Regional Commissioner Bruce Ash.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"Modest employment growth is expected within the Canterbury region over the next twelve months, particularly centered in the hospitality, retail, business and financial services, IT, manufacturing and home support industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to furthering relationships with community groups, social and advocacy groups as well as local businesses. Joint initiatives such as the recently-launched ActionWorks programme provide good existing examples.

"The Canterbury region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
