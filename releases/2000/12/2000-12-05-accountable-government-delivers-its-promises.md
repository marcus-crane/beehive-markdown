Prime Minister Helen Clark and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today released a solid list of achievements in a review of the Labour-Alliance government's first 12 months in office.

Prime Minister Helen Clark and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said the report shows that the government is delivering on its promise to restore a sense of balance by making New Zealand a fairer, more equitable society, while also bringing back accountability to the political process.

"When we came into government 12 months ago, the new government had big challenges ahead of it. But we could not have been clearer about our intentions, and we have kept our word," Helen Clark and Jim Anderton said.

"The government has introduced policies which are beginning to transform the New Zealand economy, reduce inequality and improve opportunity. The building blocks are going in place to fulfil the vision of a more prosperous and decent New Zealand, a country capable of producing the sophisticated goods and services which will guarantee us higher standards of living and a fairer society.

"We are focused on shaping a stronger economic performance and creating the jobs New Zealanders need. We are putting a new emphasis on growth, innovation, business creation and investment. It was important that the country moved on from the hands-off era. The need now is for smart, active and committed government, and we are delivering it.

"The stark difference between this government and its predecessors is a strong and conscious commitment to promoting economic growth and opportunity throughout New Zealand, and reducing inequality, which was growing at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the western world.

"That is why we have cut the cost to students of tertiary education, raised the minimum wage, poured more money into low-income neighbourhoods' schools, lifted superannuation payments, re-introduced income-related rents for state tenants, and put more money into public health and hospital programmes.

"This government has a vision of where New Zealand should be in 10 years from now. In short it is to speed up our transformation to becoming a knowledge-driven economy, which delivers social and economic benefits to all New Zealanders. We are focused on creating the conditions for our talented people and enterprises to prosper, and to ensure that there is greater equality of opportunity.

"As coalition partners we are proud of the progress we have made. There is much to celebrate one year down the track. That is why the Labour-Alliance coalition is publishing this report. It shows how far we have come – in the interests of all New Zealanders," Helen Clark and Jim Anderton said.
