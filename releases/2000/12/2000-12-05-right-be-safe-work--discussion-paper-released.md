A discussion paper released by the Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson discusses new ways to recognise the right to be safe at work.

The proposals in the paper affect all employers and employees and are part of the review of the Health and Safety in Employment Act.

"This government is determined to find solutions to the tragic toll of misery, injury and death in New Zealand workplaces and we are want to provide every opportunity for employers, managers, employees and unions to have input into the reforms we are considering," said Ms Wilson.

"With more than 160 people dying every year in preventable injury deaths in workplaces there is a need for urgent action. But we need a law that encourages a culture in which Health and Safety is a priority in every workplace. That means employers, managers employees and unions must work together to achieve the same goal.

" The government wants to work together with employers and employees to reduce all the costs associated with unsafe workplaces: the human cost of misery, injury and death and the enormous economic costs faced by individuals, business and the state.

" A conservative estimate of the financial cost in the 1998/99 - year is 3.18 billion dollars.

"The government is looking for wide support for the improvements Health and Safety law. Employers, managers, unions and employees have a very strong common interest in making workplaces safe".
