A Labour-Alliance Coalition focused beyond profit is opening up high-tech business opportunities in geographic information, says Minister for Land Information Matt Robson

A new low fee will apply to the bulk survey data becoming available as Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) rolls out the Landonline system across the country.

The data is priced to recover only the costs of dissemination and will carry no copyright fees. This fits with policy aimed at making Government-held information more available to New Zealanders.

"The new fee will open up great opportunities for the development of geographic information systems. These systems are increasingly being used to support planning, development and monitoring in socio-economic and environmental arenas," says Mr Robson.

The new pricing policy will also enable the data to be shared on the internet and across communities, such as the entire educational sector.

"Up until now the most comparable data was that supplied from LINZ’s Digital Cadastral Database. But this DCDB data (which is being phased out with the commissioning of Landonline) is priced at a much higher level and with a requirement to pay copyright fees when it was on-sold," Mr Robson says.

LINZ will only supply raw data. Private sector data resellers and major users will need to reprocess this into formats required by the various geographic information systems. They will also cut it up into the myriad of smaller subsets required by typical end-user customers.

This bulk data provides the land parcel framework for property-related information systems, such as those operated by local authorities and utility companies.

"The new bulk survey product will progressively become available, beginning in Otago, Southland and Canterbury. By late 2002, the Landonline bulk survey data will be available for the entire country.

"By then, the fee of $270 (including GST) will purchase some 30Gb of data, the majority of which will be of survey accuracy.
