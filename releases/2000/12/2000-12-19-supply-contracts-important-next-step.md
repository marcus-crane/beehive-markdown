Reaching agreement on supply contracts between ENZA and apple growers is the important next step, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The High Court in Wellington lifted the injunction against independent apple exports today, and ENZA has announced it would not appeal that decision.

Mr Sutton said he thought it was a "wise decision" for ENZA not to appeal the ruling.

"This gives the new chief executive the maximum chance to start rebuilding trust and confidence between ENZA and growers, which is important for growers and important for the long-term future of ENZA."

Mr Sutton said dropping the legal action enabled everyone to concentrate now on the issue of supply contracts between ENZA and apple growers.

"That's the second leg of the double."
