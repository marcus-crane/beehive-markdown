Get your MP to demand a kiwi bank

Communities needing better banking facilities should be leaning on their local MP to get in behind the kiwi bank, Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said.

He said opposition to the kiwi bank from some National Party MPs would make it harder to get new kiwi bank branches open in those electorates.

National MPs including chief whip John Carter and leadership aspirant Bill English are going around the country campaigning against a publicly-owned New Zealand bank. There has also been high-profile opposition from Act and the Green Party.

Jim Anderton said MPs could help to lobby for the bank and for improved services in local communities.

"Local communities that need better banking services should be asking their local MP: 'What are you doing to help?' MPs from opposition parties should be putting the needs of their electorates ahead of their petty political opposition to the Labour-Alliance Coalition.

"Over time the number of kiwi bank outlets will obviously grow. That is one reason why a kiwi bank is better than the existing banks, which only seem to be interested in closing branches.

"Those areas that show the greatest support for the kiwi bank are obviously going to be the most desirable place to situate new outlets.

"Less desirable areas will be those where the local MP is campaigning against better banking services, lower fees and more local service.

"Opposition MPs can't stop kiwi bank from opening branches, but they can probably slow them down," Jim Anderton said.
