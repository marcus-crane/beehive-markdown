Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the Wellington region and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Wellington at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Wellington Regional Commissioner Stephen Cunningham.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Wellington DWI region covers the cities of Porirua, Upper Hutt, Lower Hutt and Wellington. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the tourism, communications and information technology, retail, business and financial, caregiving, and construction and manufacturing industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to specialised case management of work tested and non work tested beneficiaries.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* establishment of a One More Worker scheme in Porirua with the Porirua Business Development Society; and,  
\* a partnership between DWI, employer and manufacturers organisation and Skill New Zealand to identify skill shortages and relevant work-based training.

"The Wellington region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
