Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the central region and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for the Central region at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Central Regional Commissioner Te Rehia Komene.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Central DWI region covers the Manawatu, Horowhenua, Kapiti, Central Hawkes Bay and Wairarapa regions. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the tourism and hospitality, construction, primary sector, call centre, textile and garment and care for the elderly industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to specialist case management for youth, Maori and work tested beneficiaries. The region has set itself the goal of ensuring that all clients aged 19 and under will be in work, training or education.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* continued support for the successful One More Worker scheme;

\* developing the partnership between the Department and Palmerston North foodbanks; and,

\* developing skills based training within the meat works industry.

"The Central region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
