Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard will ride over the new Koru Track in the Makara Mountain Bike Park when he officially opens the track this Sunday.

The Minister, who is a keen (but unfit and unskilled) mountain biker, will also pay tribute to the many volunteers who have helped build the track and contribute to the park's success.

"Even though the final section of the 2km long track has only just been completed, it is already the park's most popular track.

"It has taken a huge volunteer effort to complete. Because it is a beginners' track, it is wider and the slope has to be kept within the capabilities of novice riders. That's made building the track very demanding.

"Supporters of the Makara Mountain Bike Park have other tracks on the drawing board and I would encourage enthusiasts to get involved in these projects," Trevor Mallard said.

Details are as follows:

Event:Opening of Koru Track, Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park
