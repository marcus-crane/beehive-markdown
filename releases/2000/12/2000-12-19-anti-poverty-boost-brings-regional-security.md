New Zealand is stepping up its contribution to the fight against poverty in Asia and the Pacific

Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs Matt Robson has increased our contribution to the Asian Development Fund by more than ten percent.

The boost of $4m takes New Zealand's assistance to $40m over the next seven years.

The Asian Development Fund provides concessional loans and development assistance to some of the poorest countries in the region, including our neighbours in the Pacific and East Timor.

"Because the fund's focus is on poverty in our region, we have increased our contribution," says Mr Robson.

"Not only does this work improve lives in our back yard, it also buys New Zealand increased security at a bargain price.

"Our most pressing security challenge is instability in our immediate neighbourhood. Very often this upheaval is fuelled by grinding poverty.

"We need tackle the root causes of instability in a cost-effective manner. Otherwise we are limited to high-cost military intervention once a threat to the region has become entrenched."

The increased contribution to the fund underpins cooperation between New Zealand and the Asian Development Bank, which administers the fund in the Pacific region. New Zealand was one of the bank's founding members in 1966.

The bank has confirmed its continued commitment to East Timor reconstruction, and announced a Solomon Islands' economic reconstruction package worth US$10m, following the visit here of its president Tado Chino earlier in the year.

It has also released a specific strategy for its work in the Pacific.

The bank also provides valuable international business for New Zealand consultants. In the past year, the New Zealand business community earned $27m in consultancy and procurement work.

New Zealand is one of 25 donors to the fund, who contributed a total of US$2.91b. The largest donations were from Japan, USA, Australia and European nations.
