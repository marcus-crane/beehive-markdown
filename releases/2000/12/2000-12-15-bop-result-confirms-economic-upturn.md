BOP result confirms economy on the upturn

"The September balance of payments result was stronger than expected and the trend is toward a further steady improvement," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The $6.9 billion annual deficit is better than market expectations and will improve sharply again next quarter when the frigate Te Mana drops out of the mix," he said.
