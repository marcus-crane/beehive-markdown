Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton met ENZA chairman Tony Gibbs and ENZA chief executive David Geor this morning.

Mr Sutton said the meeting was interesting.

"I am seeking legal advice on what steps the Government can take if legal action against the Apple and Pear Export Permit Committee continues to the point where it frustrates the purpose of the regulations."

Mr Sutton said he was unhappy with the added uncertainty the court action had created, given that there was already uncertainty among growers because supply contracts had not been finalised yet.

ENZA has assured Mr Sutton growers should have those contracts next week.

As well, Mr Gibbs and Mr Geor briefed Mr Sutton on their review's findings, which are to be made public on the company's website today. Roadshows would be held in Nelson and Hawkes Bay about the review report.

Mr Sutton urged growers to read the review report carefully and to debate the recommendations properly before any decisions were made.

Any decisions would have significant impact on the industry's future direction. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is also reviewing the industry's regulatory framework. Industry submissions on that are due by the end of next month.
