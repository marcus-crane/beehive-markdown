Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton today paid tribute to the service carried out by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry chief executive Professor Bruce Ross.

State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham announced today that Professor Ross will retire from public service on April 30. By that time, Professor Ross will have been head of MAF, and before that the Ministry of Agriculture, for nearly five years. He was previously vice-chancellor of Lincoln University for 11 years.

Mr Sutton said Professor Ross had made an outstanding contribution to agriculture and rural communities.

"He has always had a good rapport with farmers.

"In fact, he has told people that if the family had had enough money, he would have gone farming. His continued love for farming and for the land has given him a special rapport, firstly with the Lincoln University community that he led for so long, and more recently, with MAF and the rural industries."

Mr Sutton said he had enjoyed working with Professor Ross.

"He has made an outstanding contribution. He has bridged the gap between the ivory towers of Wellington and the grass roots of rural New Zealand."
