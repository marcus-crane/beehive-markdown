Cullen on IRD Commissioner appointment

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the State Services Commission appointment of David Butler as the new Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

"Mr Butler is now a First Assistant Commissioner of Taxation in Australia. He is an extremely experienced public servant and tax practitioner who I am confident will serve New Zealand well," Dr Cullen said.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank John Perham. He has led the department ably through this year as acting chief executive and has brought new momentum to the IRD's programme to improve its culture.

"The commitment developed out of the 1999 Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry into the powers and operations of the IRD. The work of picking up the inquiry's recommendations was initiated under Graham Holland and continued by Mr Perham.

"Mr Butler will now take it through to the next stage.

"The Government is determined to improve the quality of service offered to the New Zealand public by the IRD, and will expect a continuing high level of priority to be assigned to this area," Dr Cullen said.
