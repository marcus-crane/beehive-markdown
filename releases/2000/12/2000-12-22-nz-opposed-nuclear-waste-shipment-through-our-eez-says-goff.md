News that a shipment of processed high-level waste has departed France for Japan this week has again drawn a strong response from New Zealand.Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff said "New Zealand opposes all shipments of nuclear material through its exclusive economic zone.

The shipment must not come within New Zealand's waters."So far there have been six shipments of nuclear materials between Europe and Japan."To date we have always received prior warning of pending shipments and they have avoided New Zealand's exclusive economic zone.

We constantly reiterate to Britain, France and Japan that these shipments are unwelcome."This high level nuclear waste shipment headed for Japan will again steer clear of New Zealand. However we need to keep up our efforts, with our friends in the South Pacific and beyond, to develop a more robust international safety and liability regime for shipments of nuclear materials.

"During the past year, we have taken an active approach to the issue of nuclear transport, including at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) General Conference and recent talks in Auckland, between Pacific Countries and transport states.
