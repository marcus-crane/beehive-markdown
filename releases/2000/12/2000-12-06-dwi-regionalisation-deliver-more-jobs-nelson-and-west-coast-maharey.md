Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in Nelson and on the West Coast and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Nelson at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Nelson Regional Commissioner Mike Smith.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Nelson DWI region covers the Marlborough, Nelson and the West Coast. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centered in the tourism, viticulture, and seasonal industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to extending case management in Golden Bay as well as across the region as a whole and to offer further industry specific training to clients. A greater focus will be placed on increasing sustainable employment for clients and supporting them through the transition into work.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include:  
\* introducing a youth focus in all DWI service centre; and

\* industry-specific training in the tourism, horticulture, hospitality, viticulture, pipfruit and seafood sectors.

"The Nelson region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
