Housing Minister Mark Gosche confirmed today that the state housing stock will be boosted and rejected claims that the Government is to embark on a widespread sale of state houses.

"Our overall plan is to boost the state housing stock by at least 1500 properties in the next three years – but I hope this figure can be improved," said Mr Gosche.

"We have no plans to undertake a widespread sale of state houses."

"There will be a few properties that are no longer appropriate for state housing purposes because of fire damage and prolonged vacancies."

"However our manifesto clearly states that any revenue from the sale of houses will be reinvested in further housing stock – this is what we are doing."

"New Zealanders can rest assured that any properties sold – will be replaced by decent, affordable housing."

"The previous Government planned to sell more than 10,000 state houses over the next three years – by ending the wholesale sell-off we saved more than 1000 homes that would have been sold by December this year."

Mr Gosche said statements made by the chief executive of Housing New Zealand had been inflated by the opposition.

"State housing is this Government's largest asset and we are committed to making sure it is maintained and added to."

The previous Government sold more than 11,000 state houses nationwide in a concerted effort to exit the state housing market. More than two thirds of all sales were to private developers.

Mr Gosche released nationwide breakdowns of state house sales made by the previous Government as well as a copy of the Labour Party manifesto that states that revenue from any sales of houses will be reinvested in further housing stock.
