"Millions of people worldwide will see New Zealand through the Eco-Challenge race via USA Network, Discovery Channel Canada and Columbia TriStar International Television thanks to this Government and its economic development policies," says Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton. USA Network alone is seen in more than 80 million US homes.

Jim Anderton was announcing today that the organisers of the international Eco-Challenge Expedition Race have chosen the South Island to host next year's race.

"Industry New Zealand, the Government's jobs machine, has worked hard to convince Eco-Challenge to come here and this is an excellent result. Tourism New Zealand have also been involved."

"Eco-Challenge could have gone elsewhere and we would have missed out on the international exposure and the spin-offs from this huge event. This is an exciting additional event for New Zealand," said Jim Anderton.

Eco-Challenge 2001 will be a 400 - 450 km race over some of the most challenging terrain in New Zealand. Seventy-five teams of four people will ride horses, run, climb, mountain bike, pack raft and kayak the course. The winning team will take approximately six days to finish. New Zealand teams have won three of the seven Eco-Challenge races held.

"There will be 800 - 1,000 international competitors, VIPs, journalists and supporters who will come to New Zealand to watch Eco-Challenge. It is estimated they will contribute $6 - 8 million to the economy. In addition, the race offers many opportunities to attract overseas investment to New Zealand and boost local industries such as the film industry.

"We welcome the organisers and competitors and hope to make this the best ever Eco-Challenge," says Jim Anderton. "We are hopeful that racing in their own backyard the New Zealand teams will do well again next year".

Kiwis have dominated multi-sport competitions worldwide and many make outdoor adventuring part of their everyday lifestyle.

Eco-Challenge is the world's premier Expedition Race™, attracting the best expedition athletes from around the world. Each year it is held in a different remote region of the world. Previous Eco-Challenge races have taken place in Utah, New England, British Columbia, Australia, Morocco, Argentina, and Malaysian Borneo. New Zealand will mark the 8th annual global competition.

"We've been looking at New Zealand as a potential site since 1998. This October, an Eco-Challenge survey team scouted the area and were extremely impressed by the diversity of the terrain and the support of government, the tourism industry and private sector," Mark Burnett, Founder and Executive Producer of Eco-Challenge, stated. "We are excited that New Zealand will be our host for the 2001 event as it is truly a mecca of adventure."

The Eco-Challenge is being supported by Industry New Zealand with assistance from Tourism New Zealand. Tourism New Zealand Chief Executive George Hickton said the organization welcomed the opportunity to profile New Zealand in the US, which is one of New Zealand's key tourism markets.
