"Terms of Reference for the Review of Local Government Funding Powers are due to be circulated to local authorities within a few days.

"I am unable to provide details to the New Zealand Herald ahead of what the local authorities will receive.

"However I can indicate that the review will be based on the assumption that taxation of property will remain the principal revenue base for local authorities.

"The Government wants the outcome to provide a comprehensive, coherent and flexible framework of funding powers that will meet the revenue needs of local authorities and be consistent with the strategic direction for local government adopted for the Review of the Local Government Act (the Department of Internal Affairs website has more details at http://www.dia.govt.nz ).

"I undertake to provide the New Zealand Herald with the Terms of Reference for the Review of Local Government Funding Powers, once these have been circulated to the local authorities."
