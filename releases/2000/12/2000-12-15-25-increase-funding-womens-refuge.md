Women's Refuge is to get a 25% increase in funding this financial year, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said this evening.

Child, Youth and Family have been working closely with Women’s Refuge to increase the amount of funding it receives from Government and will provide an additional $492,000 for the financial year ending on 30 June 2001. Other funders have also increased their support to Women’s Refuge. Community Housing has recently agreed to provide rent relief for the 51 refuges throughout New Zealand worth $360,000 annually and ACC has announced a funding package of $1 million over three years for the service. This amounts to a 25% increase in the funding Women's Refuge received last year.

“Women’s Refuge does a fantastic job of providing services to women and children and the Government has agreed to sign a contract with them which gives the movement more resources to do their job.

"Last financial year, Women’s Refuge’s audited costs were $4.5 million (GST exclusive). Child, Youth and Family met $3.7 million of those costs and other Government agencies contributed further funds leaving a shortfall of $700,000 which it was able to raise itself. The accounts show that it more than made up the shortfall last year and recorded a $100,000 net operating surplus.

"This year, Child, Youth and Family has offered a total of $3.789 million to cover the cost of services already provided by Women’s Refuge. In addition the Department is also offering $403,000 for new services.

"While Women’s Refuge says the cost of providing existing and new services this year is $8.5 million, this involves giving a monetary cost to the amount of volunteer time provided by refuge workers and funding new services. The Government does not have accurate information on what the shortfall between the $3.78 million offered and actual expected costs will be this year.

“Child, Youth and Family is actively examining providing Women’s Refuge with funding from some further sources and final decisions on this are expected next week," Steve Maharey said.
