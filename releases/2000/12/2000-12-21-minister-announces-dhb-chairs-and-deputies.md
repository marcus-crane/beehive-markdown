Confirmation of District Health Board chairs and deputy chairs were announced today by Health Minister Annette King.

"This is the first formal step towards creating a more open and accountable health system for our communities since the passing of the Government's health and disability legislation earlier this month," said Mrs King.

"The boards will come into effect officially from January 1 next year, though some responsibilities will be devolved more gradually than that."

It is expected that the boards' first public meetings will be held in February.

Mrs King says she is pleased most chairpersons of the Hospital and Health Service (HHS) boards have made themselves available to stay on to lead the new District Health Boards (DHBs).

"I think it is important we have as much continuity as possible heading into the first board elections in October 2001," said Mrs King.

Most of the new board appointments have now been confirmed, though the Minister will make further appointments to some boards early in the new year.
