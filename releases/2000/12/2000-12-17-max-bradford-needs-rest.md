"Max Bradford's latest outburst about trusts is misleading and shows he has missed the facts on the auditing of trusts," says Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

"The Finance and Expenditure Select Committee decided at Max Bradford's request to discuss whether community and energy trusts should come under the public audit bill. Now the Select Committee, which Mr Bradford is on, has concluded that Trusts should fall under the Auditor-General's legislation because the Minister of Finance appoints trust board members.

"Comments now that there has been a U-turn prove that Mr Bradford needs a Christmas break more than most of us.

"There never was a Government plan to take over trust assets and nothing has been abandoned. The Government has specifically and repeatedly ruled out any suggestion of taking over the assets of community trusts.

"Neither is the status of community trusts being reviewed. Some trusts have asked the Minister for Economic Development to help by advising on their trustee powers to assist their own communities economic development. At their request, the Ministry of Economic Development commissioned two discussion papers on the power of trusts to support regional development if that is their wish. The Ministry is also planning a forum for trusts next year to share ideas," said Jim Anderton.
