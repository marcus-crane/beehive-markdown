The Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson says there's been an excellent response to the discussion paper on the Review of Health and Safety in Employment.

"1538 copies were downloaded from the OSH website in the first week. This is in addition to the 1000 copies we are distributing in a paper format. This shows both the wide interest in the issues raised and the way democracy can be enhanced through the use of the internet," said Ms Wilson.

Ms Wilson said that wide media coverage - including editorials which recognised the need for action on health and safety - had probably helped boost the interest in the paper.

"I hope many of those who have read the paper will be considering making submissions. The government has said that action is needed to end the tragedies toll resulting from unsafe workplaces. But we also say we don't have all the answers. I'm hoping for practical submissions to help us work together towards our goal of eliminating avoidable injury and death".

And Ms Wilson says although the paper was released only last week, and the closing date for submissions is not until the end for February, one enthusiast has already got a submission in.
