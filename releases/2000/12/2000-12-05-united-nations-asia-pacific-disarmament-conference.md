New Zealand is to host the 2001 United Nations Asia-Pacific Regional Disarmament Conference. Traditionally, these annual conferences are held in Kathmandu. New Zealand has offered to host this one to promote Pacific Island country participation, and discussion of issues relevant to the Pacific region.

Conference

The conference will be held at Te Papa from 26-28 March 2001, followed by two day workshop for Pacific participants on treaty adherence and implementation matters. Te Papa Tongarewa will be the venue, chosen for its strong expression of New Zealand cultural identity. We plan to open with a powhiri at Te Papa Marae to welcome participants and as an introduction to the museum.

Some thirty-five individuals in addition to those from New Zealand will be invited by the UN to participate in their personal capacities. The invitation list is currently under discussion. While the UN decides the invitees, New Zealand has submitted a list of suggestions drawn up to emphasise the Pacific/southern hemisphere angle to the event. Normally the chair comes from a high level within the UN, either Under-Secretary General for Disarmament, Jayantha Dhanapala, or Ambassador Tsutomu Ishiguri, who heads the UN Asia Pacific Disarmament Centre.

We have suggested to the UN the theme: "Ka hao te rangatahi: a Pacific way to disarmament". The Maori phrase forms part of the longer saying, "Ka pu te ruha, ka hao te rangatahi", the old net lies in a heap while the new net goes fishing. Sub-themes being considered include:

· post-NPT Review Conference  
· consolidating the status of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones  
· engaging the Asia/Pacific region in preparations for the UN Conference on small arms

Workshop

The workshop from 29-30 March will focus on the practicalities of ratification and compliance procedures for disarmament and arms control treaties that have not yet attracted Pacific Island membership. These include the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Ottawa Convention, and IAEA safeguards.

NGO Involvement

We are already in touch with New Zealand NGOs about the Conference itself and associated activity. The involvement of young people has a high priority at Ministerial level. There are many suggestions for an NGO Forum or seminars, public and cultural events linked to the conference. We expect to work closely with NGOs and are supporting IPPNW/Abolition 2000 in Wellington to coordinate this activity.
