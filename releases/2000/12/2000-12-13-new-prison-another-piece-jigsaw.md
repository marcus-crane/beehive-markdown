Minister of Corrections Matt Robson says the new prison to be built just south of Auckland will be another step towards a secure, modern, regional corrections system.

“The Labour Alliance Coalition Government does not want to pour precious resources into building prisons. But prisons are a necessity to keep our neighbourhoods as safe as possible."

Announcing the shortlist of possible sites this evening, Mr Robson says the new 650-bed men’s prison is a crucial part of the Regional Prisons Programme.

The Regional Prisons Programme aims to locate inmates close to home because family involvement assists rehabilitation and reintegration.

"Families have a vital role to play in turning offenders away from a life of crime, so we need prisons which are close to families," says Mr Robson.

Community support and involvement are also crucial: "Only by building links with communities can we turn more inmates around so they don't re-offend.

"There are also economic advantages associated with building this new facility, with the prison providing 250 direct jobs. The facility will bring $20.9 million into the economy per annum."

The prison proposal will move through a full consultation process. Submissions are open until February 2 (for details, see the fact sheet).

"I urge people to make their views known through the consultation process," says Mr Robson. "We need to hear all community points of view.

"I will decide on the site in February 2001. By then there will have been extensive community consultation, as well as further technical analysis of the sites."

Mr Robson hopes that, in time, the new prison will help pave the way for the closure of Mt Eden.

"I've been pleased to see the future of Mt Eden raised again in the public domain. My stance on the prison is clear and on the record: I want to close the place down."

The proposed new south Auckland Regional Men's Prison won't have enough beds to take Mt Eden's 421 inmates. Instead it will absorb the current projected growth in the prison muster.

"But early next year my Taskforce on Prison Numbers will report back on ways to reduce prison numbers.

"We need to be smart. We need to contain those inmates who represent a risk to the community. But it is senseless to imprison those for whom the most effective treatment is community-based rehabilitative programmes."
