National's support welcomed

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the National Party's decision to vote for the New Zealand Superannuation Bill at first reading.

"National's support will give us a strong majority for referring the legislation to select committee and will ensure Parliament has an appropriate platform to explore the issues surrounding this important policy issue," he said.

The Bill is set down for first reading tomorrow.
