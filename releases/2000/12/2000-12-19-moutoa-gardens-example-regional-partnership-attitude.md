"I am pleased to hear that there has been an agreement on Moutoa Gardens that has local authority, iwi and government agreement," says Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

"This attitude of working together is exactly why Wanganui is in the first proposals being assessed to receive a Regional Partnership grant in the first round of this new programme. I was deeply impressed by the co-operation and work of local councils and iwi in their desire to create employment and jobs in the region.

"The first regions to receive the Regional Partnerships Programme from the Government's job machine Industry New Zealand will be announced tomorrow.

"The Regional Partnerships Progamme will support regions to work together with Government and create sustainable real jobs and business," said Jim Anderton.

There will be a number of partnerships announced next year, judging by the 137 expressions of interest which went to Industry New Zealand, the Government's jobs machine tool kit.
