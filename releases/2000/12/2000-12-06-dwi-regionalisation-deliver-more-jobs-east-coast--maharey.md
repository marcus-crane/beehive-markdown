Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs for the East Coast and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for the East Coast at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by East Coast Regional Commissioner Lindsay Scott.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The East Coast DWI region covers the Gisborne, Wairoa and Hastings districts and Napier City. Over the next twelve months the region expects modest employment growth, particularly in the forestry, primary production, food processing and tourism industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to meeting employer’s needs and exploiting job growth opportunities for clients, particularly within the forestry, seasonal horticulture, tourism and service sectors. Seasonal work is a key focus for this region and preparing clients for these types of opportunities through training and upskilling will continue to be heavily invested in.

"The East Coast region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
