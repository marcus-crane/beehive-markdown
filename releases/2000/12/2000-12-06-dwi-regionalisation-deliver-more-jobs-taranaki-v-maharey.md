Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in Taranaki and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Taranaki at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Taranaki Regional Commissioner Gloria Campbell.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Taranaki DWI region covers the Taranaki and Wanganui provinces. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth particularly in the primary sector, tourism, small business and manufacturing industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

"In the coming year priority will be given to further building stronger relationships with community partners in the region.

Examples of these initiatives include:  
„h the training and employment packages negotiated with the Tongariro Sawmills which enabled 28 long term unemployed people from the Taumaranui area to return to work; and,  
„h the major recruitment campaigns undertaken with the meat processing and fast food industries at Hawera, New Plymouth and Wanganui.

"The Taranaki region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
