Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed an assurance from the electricity industry that Auckland electricity supply security risks for the coming summer can probably be managed without significant disruption for consumers.

Mr Hodgson today released the latest report of an industry working group set up in September to address the risks.

"This latest report indicates that the situation is finely balanced but manageable," Mr Hodgson said. "At some stage it may be necessary to mount a publicity campaign urging consumers to conserve power. However the situation may well be managed without consumers noticing any impact at all. Either way, the industry advises that it is looking forward to the summer with confidence."

The report notes two main changes in the situation in recent weeks.

First, Genesis was granted a resource consent that will allow its Huntly power station to generate under warmer Waikato River water conditions. Second, TransAlta has announced that its Stratford power station in Taranaki will be shut down for maintenance in 2001.

Mr Hodgson has been advised that even without Stratford and with restricted output from Huntly over the critical summer period - in addition to the current unavailability of Contact's Otahuhu B station - the Auckland region's power supplies will be secure. This assumes no additional failures and average summer weather conditions.

The critical period for managing the risk to supply is expected to be limited to a few weeks in February and March. The Working Group will continue to monitor the situation and review contingency plans throughout the summer.
