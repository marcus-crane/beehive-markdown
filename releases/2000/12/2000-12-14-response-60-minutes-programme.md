Prime Minister Helen Clark has responded to publicity by TVNZ about an upcoming 60 Minutes documentary, by releasing the statement she has made to that programme.

"At the beginning of this year I was made aware by Chris Carter MP of certain criminal allegations being made by Mrs Beverley Rako against Dover Samuels MP.

"These allegations surfaced again in June when Hon Richard Prebble MP raised them with me. The allegations were then referred by Mr Samuels to the police.

"At that time I faced considerable criticism for not having forwarded the allegations to the police for a criminal investigation in January.

"I made it plain that, in future, criminal allegations made to me about any Member of Parliament would be formally forwarded to the police.

"I did formally refer such allegations about Mr Samuels to the police as I believe was my duty.

"I will have no hesitation in referring criminal allegations to the police in future.

"Not to do so invites the criticism that one is suppressing information which may be material to the maintenance of law and order."

Having taken legal advice Helen Clark said she did not consider it appropriate to make any further public comment relating to this matter.
