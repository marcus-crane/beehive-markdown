Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs for South Auckland and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for Auckland South at a Beehive press briefing this morning, accompanied by Auckland South Regional Commissioner Denise Fink.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government earlier this year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

"The Auckland South DWI region covers the Otahuhu, Manukau City and the Papakura and Franklin districts. Over the next twelve months it expects modest employment growth, particularly centred in the construction, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism and hospitality industries. The Department will be looking to make the most of these opportunities to move people off benefits and into real jobs and independence.

" In the coming year priority will be given to building stronger relationships with key agencies, local bodies and communities to address issues relating to health, housing, education, and employment.

"Particular regional employment initiatives include partnerships with local employers to identify new job opportunities.

"The Auckland South region plan is an excellent example of the locally-focused direction the Government has set for Work and Income," Steve Maharey said.
