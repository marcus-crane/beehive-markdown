Community organisations dealing with family violence prevention have received a $2.25 million funding boost, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The Government has set aside an additional $1.125 million a year in extra funding for Child, Youth and Family to distribute to not-for-profit organisations providing family violence services. 16 organisations will receive a total of $2.25 million this financial year and in 2001/02 for this work.

¡§Community organisations have a key role in helping deal with domestic violence and child abuse in New Zealand. They are often much closer to their communities than Government agencies can be and they are able to target abusers and potential abusers more directly.

¡§It¡¦s particularly satisfying to announce the funding before the Christmas/New Year period when demand for family violence services usually increases."

Funding highlights of the package include:  
„h more than $900,000 to the National Collective of Independent Women¡¦s Refuges for crisis intervention for rural families and increasing services for migrant and refugee women;  
„h $250,000 for Relationship Services for a range of services; and,  
„h $142,500 to Auckland¡¦s Tu Wahine for counselling and education programmes.

Mr Maharey also says a broader review of family violence prevention is currently underway and he is expecting a report by the middle of next year. The review, being carried out by the Ministry of Social Policy, is looking to identify priorities, including resource implications, for current and future family violence prevention initiatives.

The review involves representatives from the Family Violence Focus Group, comprising both government and non-government representatives, and the Family Violence Advisory Committee, an independent advisory committee to the Minister. Information is being sought from a variety of sources, including four community workshops planned for next February.

¡§The intention is to bring together those working in family violence prevention within the communities to discuss what is happening, what works well and doesn¡¦t, and to get information on specific issues diverse communities face in addressing family violence.

¡§A number of government and non-government agencies are working on family violence prevention initiatives. The Government wants to be able to make sound decisions about where we should prioritise our efforts,¡¨ Steve Maharey said.
