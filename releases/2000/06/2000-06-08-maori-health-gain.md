This Government will not jeopardise the health gains made in the last six years by the Maori health providers says Associate Minister of Health Hon Tariana Turia.

In response to the serious concerns raised by Maori health service providers around the country, the Minister confirmed the intent of the Government was to use the developments of the last six years as the foundation for further development.

"I have listened to the Maori health service providers around the country who have all been voicing similar concerns.

"The Government is adamant that these health gains made through the dedicated Maori health funding must not be jeopardised by the health sector changes. This Government will not undermine this process.

"We must continue to improve the development of Maori health providers, so they in turn can improve their services, that will in the end result in improved health status for our whanau, hapu and iwi," Hon Tariana Turia said.
