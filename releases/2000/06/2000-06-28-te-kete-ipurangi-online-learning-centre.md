Two days ago, in my role as Minister of Education I sat at a computer screen at E-vision and took part in a preview of Te Kete Ipurangi Online Learning Centre. It's a major aspect of the Government's ICT for schools strategy and we're putting a significant amount of money into developing and adjusting material for the site.

There were plenty of oohs and aahs around the room as people who are mainstays in education got a first hand glance at what it will offer when it becomes fully functional in a few weeks time.

It is impressive.

It is impressive because it is not a site for computer wizards, it is a service using information technology for the people who deliver the Government's core responsibility of providing education to young New Zealanders.

Teachers will be able to use the site to enhance their class planning and lessons and to ensure that their students have access to up to date and relevant resource material.

The topic I was asked to speak on today is: Dawn of E-Government ¡V Citizens as Customers.

In the case of education, we have a major e-resource which is set to become a feature of classrooms around the country. The next six months - as more and more resources are placed in the kete ¡V has the potential to be one of those defining periods in education and in learning.

And as provision of education is one of our core responsibilities, I think this project complements some of the core objectives we have with our wider e-government vision.

In fact the words "citizens as customer¡¨ picks up a major theme of the e-government initiative.

The Government¡¦s e-government vision statement is:

¡§New Zealanders will be able use telephones, personal computers and the Internet to gain access to government information and services and participate in our democracy¡¨ .

In other words, it provides a focus on people and on service. It's about utilising technological advances so that citizens get a better and easier service. It is about improving the lives of all New Zealanders through good government supported by effective and efficient organisations and staffed by people devoted to serving the public.

We have to constantly make sure that whatever we are doing in the e-government area does not make it harder for our citizens. In recent times there have been some small steps in e-government provision which overall are contributing to our giant leap forward.

For example, birth, death and marriage certificates will be accessible through the Internet. That means that a citizen wanting a copy of such a certificate will be able to use the internet, the freephone service, the post, or visit one of the regional service. It is about providing service in a range of different ways so citizens can access it through the means that is easiest and most convenient for them.

It is only since 1998 that all new registrations have been recorded electronically. But by this time next year, all birth and death registrations since 1935 and marriage registrations since 1951 will have been converted to scanned images which can be accessed by a data index. It's a mammoth conversion job but one which I think we will reap the benefits from in years to come. Funding was announced in this year's Budget to extend this conversion project to include the country's four million oldest records, dating back to 1848. The project will result in the creation of seamless computerised birth, death and marriage register for New Zealand. I don't think many countries in the world could boast of that.

Another 'positive' e-government example that makes life easier for the public is the ability to end annual tax return filing. That was in part possible because of electronic system advances.

So with all these 'positives' occurring ¡V why do we need an e-government strategy?

As Minister of State Services, I still see a need for better systems that allow us to increase efficiency and cost effectiveness at the same time as we improve services.

There has never been leadership and vision for e-government yet it is crucial that all government agencies work together.

The advances in modern technology provide us with the opportunity to look carefully at our systems and improve those links so that we are taking a whole of government approach. We must move away from silos to a more ¡§joined up¡¨ collaborative approach.

If you liken e-government to a jigsaw puzzle, here's the analogy.

We have some pieces to the puzzle, but we don't know what the final picture and we don't know what pieces are missing.

Once we've worked out what the picture is, we will be expecting government agencies to work together and share resources so that the plans they have, fit into the jigsaw puzzle. Except, of course, it will be a puzzle that never finishes.

So at the top level, the vision is: New Zealanders will be able to gain access to government information and services and participate in our democracy using the Internet, telephones and other technologies as they emerge.

At the next level down, the Government sees the following potential in e-government:

„h making it easier for people to have their say in government;

„h improving the services people receive from government organisations;

„h improving the integration of services from government organisations as a result of different government organisations being able to communicate more effectively with each other; and

„h people being better informed as a result of being able to access up-to-date and comprehensive information about government laws, regulations, policies and services.

Some more detailed goals for the next four years are laid out in the vision statement. More detail will be added as an overarching e-government strategy is developed

The establishment of an e-government unit within the State Services Commission is the start of realising that vision.

The unit¡¦s major roles will be:

\* developing the overarching e-government strategy, and common system and data management policies, standards and guidelines;

\* facilitating the uptake by government agencies of the e-government vision and IS and data management policies, standards and guidelines;

\* identifying opportunities for beneficial collaboration across government agencies, leverage better returns from existing information management and technology (IM & T) investment, and provide coordination for multi-agency e-government projects;

\* providing advice in relation to e-government; and

\* monitoring progress toward achieving the e-government vision and in relation to IM & T investment which is a continuation of the existing SSC role.

All this is intended to achieve something very significant ¡V major change to the way government as a whole invests in and uses ICT¡¦s.

Funding ¡V around $16 million has been allocated to fund a 4 year programme.

All other government agencies will have a role to play. A key e-government theme is interagency collaboration. We mean to make this a reality of public management in the future. There will also be an advisory board.

The nuts and bolts of developing the e-government strategy begins next month.

It will be a fairly open process involving many stakeholders This reflects the fact that so many New Zealanders, from differing walks of life, have an interest and something of value to contribute.

We're hoping to have a fairly comprehensive consultation paper available by the end of the year.

But I can say now that the e-government strategy will need to be kept under constant review and development.

It will be evolutionary in its implementation. You cannot treat e-government as a ¡§big-bang¡¨ change. Change will be managed in a step-wise fashion. This will allow us to manage risks better, to learn as we go, to cope with a rapidly changing environment more effectively, and to generate change while working within the lifecycles of current ICT investments as much as possible.
