New Zealand is donating $100,000 to the International Federation for Red Cross (IFRC) to help strengthen the institutional capacity of Pacific Islands Red Cross societies, Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Matt Robson announced today.

“New Zealand is pleased to be able to offer its support to help the Red Cross build strong national societies in the Pacific that can run effective programmes,” says Matt Robson.

“Red Cross societies in the South Pacific play a key role in disaster and emergency preparedness and relief activities. They also provide blood donor activities, and coordinate community health and first aid programmes. It is crucial that the Pacific Red Cross societies receive the financial support they need for these activities.”

The New Zealand contribution will provide core funding support for the Pacific societies as well as providing institutional support and assistance for specific projects. There are 12 Red Cross societies in the Pacific - Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

The New Zealand contribution is in response to a meeting of the Pacific Red Cross Societies held in 1999 in which the societies determined that their greatest need was in strengthening their organisation capacity. This included improving systems and structures, but also the skills and capacity to raise funds.

In recognition of the work undertaken by local Red Cross Societies in difficult circumstances New Zealand is also making additional grants to the Fiji and Solomon Islands Red Cross National Societies to assist them with the work they are currently undertaking.
