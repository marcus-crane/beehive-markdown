The Coalition Government's first budget is driven by a new paradigm offering opportunities for New Zealanders to escape disadvantage and succeed in today's society, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey addressed social workers in Auckland this afternoon and said that the Budget was driven by investment in New Zealand's future. The Government wanted to be defined by a commitment to increasing opportunity, security and participation.

"Security, opportunity and participation used to be things we took for granted in this country; no special investment required. New Zealand used to be one of the best places on earth to be a child. We were a prosperous nation, where unemployment was virtually unknown.

"Sadly the same cannot be said today. The gap between the haves and have-nots in this nation have grown and become entrenched.

"The real drive in our first budget - the bold strategy for the new millennium - wasn't about simply building better ambulances at the bottom of the cliff, but to fence the cliff off and limit the flow of casualties.

"We have taken a life cycle approach to one on the greatest social problems facing this nation. We must offer more than a sticking plaster solution; we must instead offer people an opportunity to achieve their full potential and determine their own destiny.

"These are the tools that this Government will use to build stronger families, more cohesive communities, and provide the right environment for our children to thrive," Steve Maharey said.
