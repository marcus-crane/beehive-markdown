ACC is primed and ready to take over work place accident cover from July 1st says Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen.

As at 1 July the Accident Compensation Corporation will cover all workplace accidents for employers, employees and the self-employed. Private insurers will no longer be able to offer workplace accident insurance.

Dr Cullen says ACC is ready for the change and is offering cheaper average premiums than private insurers and new products for both employers and the self-employed.

"ACC is offering a range of new products and services including the updated accredited employer programme and premium discounts in return for safer work environments.

"As well, the self-employed can now opt for a new service called CoverPlus Extra which provides more flexibility for people who have fluctuating liable earnings such as farmers. It allows the self-employed to choose, with the agreement of ACC, the level of weekly compensation they would receive if they had an accident."

Dr Cullen says he is expecting the transition from private insurers to a single state provider to go smoothly. "The cover will be implemented automatically by ACC. People don’t need to do anything to initiate cover for workplace accidents which occur after 1 July 2000."

Dr Cullen says he is committed to keeping the cost of premiums cheaper than the private sector offered and to making sure ACC provides a first class service for everyone.

"We are not going back to the creaking, often frustrating machine of the past. ACC knows exactly what this Government expects of it and we will be monitoring its performance very closely. New Zealanders deserve the best in meaningful injury prevention on the job, effective and timely rehabilitation after an injury and fair compensation. ACC must deliver value for money," said Dr Cullen.
