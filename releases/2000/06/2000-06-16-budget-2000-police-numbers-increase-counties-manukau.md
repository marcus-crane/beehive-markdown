The Labour/Alliance Government has delivered Counties Manukau Police District an increase in police staff.

This year's Budget has provided for 30.5 full time positions.

Counties Manukau Police District will get an extra:  
· nine Highway Patrol police  
· 0.5 Traffic Intel staff position  
· 12 Law Enforcement Team staff, including two NCOs, eight constables, and two non-sworn staff  
· nine staff to reduce youth offending.

These positions are on top of existing police numbers. The Highway Patrol positions will be fully established by November 2001.

This Budget also provides for an additional 12 Intel staff, to be shared amongst the Auckland regional Police districts, to provide IT and intelligence capabilities to the District's frontline police and Law Enforcement Teams.

Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said: "This Budget delivers on the Pledge Card promise to crack down on burglary and youth crime. It provides extra dedicated Highway Patrol police to ensure that our highways and state roads are safer.

"It also links to the Key Government Goal of Restoring Trust in Government and Providing Strong Social Services, by contributing towards building safe communities," George Hawkins said.
