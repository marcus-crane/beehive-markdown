New Zealand’s next Permanent Representative to the United Nations will be diplomat and international lawyer, Don MacKay, Foreign Minister Phil Goff, announced today.

Mr Goff said he was delighted by Mr MacKay's appointment.

"New Zealand attaches great importance to its membership of the United Nations and we are fortunate to have such an able and experienced person ready to take over this pivotal role."

"The UN is the paramount organisation for forging the international rules and norms necessary in the modern global community. For a small country we have a proud record there. As Permanent Representative Mr MacKay will bring the wealth of expertise and experience necessary to help keep up that tradition."

Mr MacKay is currently Deputy Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade responsible for multilateral and international legal work. He served in the New Zealand Mission to the United Nations from 1977 to 1981, and was Permanent Representative to the Food and Agriculture Organisation while at the New Zealand Embassy in Rome from 1986-88.

He was Counsel to the New Zealand Rainbow Warrior Arbitration team in 1989 and was Co-agent and Counsel during New Zealand’s Nuclear Tests Case at the International Court of Justice in 1996. From 1991-1995 he was New Zealand Ambassador in Fiji.

Mr MacKay will take up his post at the end of this year, replacing Mr Michael Powles, who is returning to Wellington.
