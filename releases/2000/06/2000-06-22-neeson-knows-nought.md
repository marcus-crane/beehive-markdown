National MP Brian Neeson has demonstrated how little he knows about road safety laws in New Zealand the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said today.

"His claims that speeding laws were standardised two years ago are wrong," said Mr Gosche.

"Last week's move to standardise speeding laws has never been Government policy in the past and has never been adhered to by Police. This is a new policy,"

"We have standardised speeding laws. For example in the past, people driving 70kmh in 50kmh residential areas were subject to the discretion of individual officers," said Mr Gosche.

"Similarly cameras targeted only the top 15 per cent of drivers who were driving the fastest, breaking the law."

"From July all drivers breaking speed limits by 10kph or more will be targeted."

"So far this year 218 New Zealanders have died on our roads and highways. The past five years have seen 2857 deaths that we believe could have been prevented. Thousands more have ended up with serious injuries. In fiscal terms this cost the country more than $3 billion only last year."

Mr Gosche said road safety needed to be taken seriously and he hoped Mr Neeson would get his facts right in future.
