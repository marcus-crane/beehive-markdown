Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said 27 New Zealand Police officers will assist with security at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

The officers will be on secondment for 36 days, from 28 August to 2 October 2000.

"The deployment will be an excellent opportunity for this group of New Zealand Police to be involved in a very large security operation.

"This experience will no doubt provide significant professional benefits for the officers," George Hawkins said.

The New Zealand Police officers will be sworn in as New South Wales Police officers for the period of their secondment.

New Zealand Police will pay the salaries of the 27 officers and New South Wales Police will meet all other costs relating to the secondment.

"The decision to send 27 officers to the Sydney Olympics will reinforce contingency relations between Australia and New Zealand Police. It creates the goodwill necessary where, should it be required in the future, New Zealand can benefit from the expertise of Australian police and their security training," George Hawkins said.
