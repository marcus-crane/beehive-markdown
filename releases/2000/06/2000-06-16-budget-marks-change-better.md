The Labour Alliance Government's first budget will make a positive difference because it comes from the heart and the head, Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard said today.

"We need a strong economy to create jobs and to raise incomes. We also need a Government which is ready to stand by business rather than just stand on the sidelines if we are to make the most of our growth opportunities.

"That is why this Budget provides almost $332 million over four years for industry and regional development. But we don't only have to expand our export base if we are to raise New Zealand living standards, we also have to add knowledge to what we produce.

"The Budget makes a very big commitment to research, science and development. It gives a $43.5 million boost to R&D, including a record $20 million package to encourage R&D in the private sector.

"That money will be disbursed as grants rather than through the tax system as tax breaks. Some commentators have criticised the Government for not going the tax break route.

"However our very strong advice from officials was that grants were the safer and fairer option. They also suit better the needs of young companies which have bright ideas they wish to develop but are not yet making a profit so cannot be reached through tax rebates.

"A vibrant economy needs a highly skilled and adaptive workforce. The Government moved quickly after taking office to establish a modern apprenticeships programme and to lower student loan costs.

"The Budget builds on this work with large boosts in funding to education at all levels - pre-school, primary school, secondary, tertiary and industry training.

"But we have a heart too. The Budget puts strong emphasis on closing the gaps and on lifting people out of the trap created by inherited disadvantage. It also provides for an additional $257.4 million over four years for mental health. Mental health services in New Zealand have been dangerously under-funded for years, at the cost of considerable pain both to those suffering mental illness and to the general community.

"The Budget does much more than I have identified here. There is simply not the space to go into everything in detail. I believe the measures the Budget contains are what the country needs now and that it will mark a change for the better," Judith Tizard said.
