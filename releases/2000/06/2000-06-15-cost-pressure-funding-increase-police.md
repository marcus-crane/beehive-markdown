Police will be receiving additional funding of $52 million in 2000/01 and out-years to meet cost pressures and to compensate Police for reductions in other revenue. This substantial injection of funding ($156 million over three years alone) is on top of an additional $27 million provided by this Government to Police in 1999/00.

The additional funding enables Police to maintain operational capability.

Police Minister George Hawkins said: "This cost pressure funding displays the Government's commitment to funding both the prevention of crime and the Police's response to crime.

"It is clear the effectiveness of local policing will be judged by the absence of crime, not just by a visible effort after a crime is committed," George Hawkins said.

"This commitment is a shift away from simply paying the costs of crime response," he said.
