The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson has welcomed the decision of the Chairperson of the Employment and Accident Insurance Select Committee, Graham Kelly to table the Employment Relations Bill on August 1 as scheduled.

"This is a most important piece of legislation," said Ms Wilson. "It should be made available with appropriate explanatory material at a sensible time.

"To rush major bills introduces confusion, such as that in the material given by the ACT party to audiences today. So far I have been able to count seven significant errors, and have noted other misleading information in the material distributed.

"I advise businesses not to take action on the basis of this muddled grandstanding.

"I will publicly identify ACT's mistakes, if that is what they are, after the Bill is released officially."
