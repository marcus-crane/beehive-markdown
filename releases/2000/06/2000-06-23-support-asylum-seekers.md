The Government has signalled its support for groups that work with refugee status claimants, the Minister of Immigration, Lianne Dalziel, said today.

The Government will put $180,000 (2000/01) and $200,000 (2001/02) into grants to community groups that work with refugee status claimants or people in refugee-like situations, such as Auckland Refugee Council and the Shakti Migrant Trust.

"There are a number of groups out there that provide services to asylum seekers, but run on the smell of an oily rag. Apart from a Government grant of $45,000 allocated by the coalition Government to save the Grove Road Hostel from closing in May this year, this is the first ever Budget line item for these groups," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The small number of groups that provide support to people who have claimed refugee status subsist year to year on money from uncertain sources, and although this fund will not meet their entire budget, it will certainly take the pressure off."

"This is a small, pilot discretionary fund, and decisions on grants will be made in accordance with criteria that are currently being developed," the Minister said.
