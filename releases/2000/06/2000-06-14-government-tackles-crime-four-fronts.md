The Budget provides funding for the Government’s four key packages to improve victims’ rights, crack down on burglary, promote restorative justice, and tackle youth offending.

"These initiatives will make a major contribution towards the Government’s goal of building safer communities," says Justice Minister Phil Goff.

Youth Justice Package  
This provides $3.234 million in funding each year to Police for youth justice initiatives. Key features are announced in the Budget today.

"The Youth Justice Package demonstrates this Government’s recognition that to bring crime down there is a critical need to stop young offenders from growing up to be hard core adult offenders," Minister of Justice Phil Goff said.

Burglary Package  
The Burglary Package, announced on 6 June, is supported by $14.180 million of additional expenditure over three years.

"This Government is committed to making life tough for burglars. The Budget supports the legislative and policy changes we already have under way to treat burglary as a serious crime," Mr Goff said.

Victims’ Rights Package  
Budget support for the Victims’ Rights Package totals $5.701 million over three years. The Victims’ Rights Package was announced on 12 June.

"Victims’ rights were a key commitment for both governing parties and the Victims’ Rights Package delivers on that commitment," Phil Goff said.

Restorative Justice Package  
The Restorative Justice Package, announced on 11 June, invests $4.955 million over three years in promising programmes involving victims confronting offenders with the impact of their crimes.

"Successful pilot programmes show restorative justice has real potential to reduce re-offending. This Government believes it will become an important feature in our justice system," Mr Goff said.
