The Minister of Immigration, Lianne Dalziel, has announced the establishment of pilot settlement services for recent migrants to New Zealand.

"I have consistently said that the true measure of New Zealand's immigration policies is how well our migrants settle into New Zealand life.

"The previous Government focussed on the numbers coming across our borders and not on quality settlement outcomes. It's as if they only cared about getting them here, not what happened after they got here," she said.

"These pilots will go a long way towards evaluating what is missing from the services that are currently provided and what services the Government will need to ensure are provided in the future," Lianne Dalziel said.

The initiative will start in the 2000/01 financial year and cost $500,000. It will be funded from the Migrant Levy and be administered by the New Zealand Immigration Service in consultation with the Office of Ethnic Affairs and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.

Lianne Dalziel said the pilot will trial different approaches towards meeting the needs of recent migrants. It will also be open to innovative approaches from the community that build on existing services with the emphasis being on co-operation and co-ordination.

The Minister said she was aware that there are particular gaps in the business and professional migrant communities.

"I want to ensure that when business migrants come to New Zealand, they are put in touch with local business networks; when professional people come here, they are put in touch with local professional bodies.

"We need to do more to ensure that migrants receive the support they need to settle into their chosen country. This benefits the economic and social development of New Zealand as much as our recent migrant communities," Lianne Dalziel said.
