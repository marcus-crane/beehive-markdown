Funding for Masterton Intermediate School, to provide learning experiences outside the classroom (LEOTC) programmes to other schools in Wairarapa, has been extended until the end of the year, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The service agreement for the programme, run through the school’s Environmental Science Centre since 1998, was due to end on June 30.

However, Trevor Mallard said that at the time they were planning their student programmes for 2000, other Wairarapa schools said they had been unaware that the contract was coming to an end. Continuation of the funding until the end of the year, therefore, was necessary to ensure that their students’ curriculum needs were met.

Trevor Mallard said he had sought assurance that the provision of quality hands-on and interactive learning experiences to schools and students in Wairarapa would continue to be a priority for the Ministry of Education.

“Learning Experiences Outside the Classroom services to Wairarapa schools will continue to be provided by the Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre and by LEOTC providers based outside the region,” he said.

“In addition, the Ministry also purchases a number of national LEOTC programmes in which students in Wairarapa will continue to participate."

Trevor Mallard thanked Wairarapa MP Georgina Beyer and list MP Wyatt Creech for their representations on behalf of the Intermediate School.
