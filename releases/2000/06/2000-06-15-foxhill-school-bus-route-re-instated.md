Minister for Rural Affairs Jim Sutton said he was delighted to announce that the Foxhill School bus route had been re-instated.

Mr Sutton said he and nearby MP Damien O'Connor had made strong representations to responsible minister Parekura Horomia and had succeeded in overturning a decision to stop the bus service.

Foxhill School is a rural primary school south of Wakefield, Nelson. Without a bus service, the children are expected to walk to school. There are no footpaths and the road they have to walk along is a state highway with an open speed limit. There is an increasing volume of heavy truck traffic past the school, including fully laden logging and general freight trucks.

Mr Sutton said the decision was an important one.

He said his ministry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, had done a substantial investigation into the issue as part of its responsibility for carrying out the rural affairs portfolio. That investigation had highlighted the risk to the pupils.

After this was explained to Mr Horomia, he has reinstated the bus service till the end of this school year because of the specific problems the pupils have with a dangerous road.

Mr Sutton said Mr Horomia had undertaken to get his officials to do more work on school transport policy issues, especially in rural areas where special difficulties are experienced.

He said he expected MAF officials would be involved in that work.

"This is an example of the rural affairs portfolio in action."

The rural affairs portfolio is a new one, brought into existence by the Labour-Alliance Government.

One of the aims of the Rural Affairs minister is to provide a voice in Cabinet to raise issues and concerns of rural communities and also to ask the questions – have rural people been consulted, how will this impact on them, why is that impact justified?
