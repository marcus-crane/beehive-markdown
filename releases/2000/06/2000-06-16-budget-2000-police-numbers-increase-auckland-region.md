The Labour/Alliance Government has delivered the greater Auckland region an increase in police staff.

This year's Budget has provided for 82.5 full time positions over the North Shore/Waitakere, Auckland City, and Counties Manukau Police districts.

The three Police districts combined will get an extra:  
· 26 Highway Patrol police  
· 1.5 Traffic Intel staff position  
· 36 Law Enforcement Team staff, including six NCOs, 24 constables, and six non-sworn staff  
· 19 staff to reduce youth offending.

These positions are on top of existing police numbers.

This Budget also provides for an additional 12 Intel staff, to be shared amongst the Auckland regional Police districts, to provide IT and intelligence capabilities to the District's frontline police and Law Enforcement Teams.

Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said: "This Budget delivers on the Pledge Card promise to crack down on burglary and youth crime. It provides extra dedicated Highway Patrol police to ensure that our highways and state roads are safer.

"It also links to the Key Government Goal of Restoring Trust in Government and Providing Strong Social Services, by contributing towards building safe communities," George Hawkins said.
