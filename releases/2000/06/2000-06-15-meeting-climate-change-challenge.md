The Budget provides an extra $2.3 million a year for the development of policy measures to meet New Zealand's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, Energy Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

The Government is committed to passing legislation enabling New Zealand to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by mid-2002. Mr Hodgson is convenor of a ministerial group overseeing the development of a climate change action programme.

"Funding this work is essential if New Zealand is to meet its international obligations," Mr Hodgson said. "This country also has a direct interest in meeting the climate change challenge. We have a relatively small economy defending a very long coastline and much of our economy is based on a moderate and reliable climate."

Of the extra funding, $1.5 million a year will go to the Ministry for the Environment to support the climate change science programme, monitoring, reporting and review programmes, public education and policy advice on measures to address greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sinks.

The Ministry of Economic Development is allocated $405,000 a year for work on the trading of carbon permits and $350,000 will go to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for policy advice relating to primary sector greenhouse gas emissions.

"This $2.3 million adds to a wide range of Government investments that will improve our understanding of climate change and help address New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions," Mr Hodgson said. "These include increased funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority for sustainable land management and for research, science and technology."
