Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson said today he was delighted with the calibre of the people who had agreed to serve on the new Science and Innovation Advisory Council (SIAC).

"We had over 300 nominations for SIAC and they presented an embarrassment of riches," Mr Hodgson said. "The depth of talent in this area is outstanding and I am certain the council will prove an invaluable source of advice and knowledge."

Mr Hodgson said SIAC had been set up to deliver original and creative ideas on the transformation of New Zealand's economy into one based more on innovation and its products.

"We have not set out to choose a group representative of particular sectors or interests. The chief criteria were creativity and independence. The people on SIAC also share a wealth of experience and understanding of how New Zealand's innovation system functions and how it can be improved."

The newly appointed chairman of SIAC, Rick Christie, said he believes New Zealanders are "some of the most innovative and flexible people in the world".

"The challenge is to organize this innovation so that New Zealand as a whole benefits," Mr Christie said. "The Council members have excellent networks around New Zealand, and we will draw on those to offer positive but also realistic advice to Government on a range of issues."

Mr Christie joined the investment company Rangatira Ltd as chief executive after nearly nine years in the export sector, including Trade New Zealand, where he was chief executive for six years. Mr Christie has a MSc (Hons) in Chemistry from Victoria University.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE SCIENCE AND INNOVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL  
Purpose  
The purpose of the Science and Innovation Advisory Council is to:  
\* increase the public status and recognition of scientists, science and innovation;

\* promote a long-term, strategic direction for research, science and technology;

\* build private-sector commitment to new science and technology policy directions; and

\* enable co-ordination of Government science and innovation policies and community activities at the highest level.  
The Council will be the Prime Minister's Advisory Council. The Prime Minister has delegated responsibility for the day-to-day operations of SIAC to the Minister of Research, Science and Technology.  
Mode of operation  
Effective research and innovation requires partnership between the Government and the community. This should be a two-way process in which ideas from the community inform Government policies and Government leadership challenges community thinking about its commitment to science and innovation.  
The Council will act as an intermediary in this dialogue between the Government and the community. It will have:

\* a consultation role in which it discusses science and innovation issues of concern to the Government with interested groups in the community; and

\* an advice role in which it synthesises feedback from the community and its own analysis of issues to provide advice on policies and actions for Government.  
The Prime Minister, or the Minister of Research, Science and Technology acting on her behalf, will set broad directions for the Council's work, in consultation with the Council.

The Council will not routinely publish the advice it gives to Government. However, the Government and the Council may, from time to time, agree to publish papers produced by the Council.  
The Council will develop methods for consulting with the community through regular meetings with individuals and groups; hui with Maori organisations, internet forums, surveys, conferences, or other suitable means.  
The Council will be supported by a secretariat provided through the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology. The Council will direct the work of the secretariat through its chairperson or a member deputised to carry out this task.  
The Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993, and the Ombudsmen Act 1975 will apply to the operations of the Council. SIAC is established by the Prime Minister to assist and advise her. Information held by SIAC will therefore be deemed to be information held by the Prime Minister for the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982.  
Membership

The Council will consist of nine members, including a chairperson selected by the Prime Minister. The Council may chose to elect a deputy chairperson from within its membership.

Members will be appointed by the Prime Minister for a term of two years. This term may be extended by mutual agreement.  
Members will receive fees and allowances in accordance with Government guidelines.

Meetings  
The Council will meet quarterly with the Prime Minister. It will provide summaries of its findings and proposals for further work at these meetings.  
The Council will also hold working meetings as and when it determines. The Minister of Research, Science and Technology may attend these meetings to brief the Council and discuss work plans.
