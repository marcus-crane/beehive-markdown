The Budget makes a significant investment in Mäori and Pacific people’s communities and organisations in order to better determine their needs and build their capacity, said Social Services and Employment Ministers Steve Maharey, Tariana Turia and Parekura Horomia.

"The aim is to establish a firm partnership to improve social and employment results for the future."

"This approach recognises that Wellington does not have all the answers. Strong whanau, hapu, iwi and Mäori and Pacific peoples community organisations are often more effective because they understand local needs."

The Ministers said the Social Services and Employment budget package:

\* makes a significant investment in Mäori and Pacific people’s communities and organisations to better determine their needs and build capacity to deliver social and employment services and programmes;

\* demonstrates a willingness on the part of Government to fund new and innovative approaches; and,

\* shows that the Government will continue to fund what it knows is working well in improving social and employment results for Mäori and Pacific people.

"This year’s Budget is a step in the right direction towards the new social and employment programmes to be delivered by whanau, hapu, iwi and Mäori and Pacific communities."

The Budget delivers $16.89 million in 2000/01 and in excess of $72 million over four years in new funding for programmes that will have a direct impact for Mäori and Pacific people. These programmes are:

\* Mäori Economic and Organisational Development: $5.37 million in 2000/01 ($20.80 million over four years) to improve the capacity and capability of Mäori organisations, assist with Mäori land development and develop local partnerships that will create local employment opportunities.

\* Mäori Women’s Development: $3.62 million in 2000/01 ($14.1 million over four years) to assist Mäori women to enter into, remain in or expand their businesses. The fund will also promote the development of Mäori women leaders in their community and provide enterprise and leadership training.

\* Pacific People’s Organisational Development: $1.89 million in 2000/01 ($7.12 million over four years) to provide assistance with administrative skills, leadership training, IT and infrastructure development for Pacific community organisations.

\* Investing in Mäori Communities: $1 million in 2000/01 ($3 million over three years) to assist whanau, hapu, iwi and Mäori communities to identify their needs and support their development.

\* Pacific People’s Provider Development Fund: $500,000 in 2000/01 ($3.11 million over four years) to develop social services that are more responsive to the needs of Pacific families.

\* Iwi/Mäori Provider and Workforce Development (including Iwi Social Services): $3.51 million in 2000/01 ($14.05 million over four years) to further develop the capability of Iwi social service providers, so increasing the numbers of Mäori children and young people cared for by their iwi, hapu or whanau.

\* Mäori Youth Contestable Fund: $1 million in 2000/01 ($10 million over four years) to fund initiatives developed by Mäori communities which aim to reduce Mäori youth offending.

In addition there is further reprioritised expenditure within the social services and employment portfolios that will make a real contribution towards the Government’s efforts at Closing the Gaps.

This includes $16.12 million in 2000/01 ($58 million over four years) in the employment area, particularly for the introduction of a voluntary approach to the current community work scheme, the Work Track programme to target those at risk of long-term unemployment and the piloting of Community Employment Organisations.

"With about 40 % of Child Youth and Family Service clients who are Mäori and 9% who are Pacific people, all the work it does to help at risk youth and children will indirectly assist Mäori and Pacific people," the Ministers said.
