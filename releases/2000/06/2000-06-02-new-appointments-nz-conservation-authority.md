The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced three new appointments to the New Zealand Conservation Authority.

The new appointees are Nganeko Minhinnick, Ngati Te Ata, of Waiuku, Laura Dawson of Taupo and Dr Wendy Nelson of Wellington.

"These new members will strengthen the Conservation Authority by contributing a wide range of knowledge and experience," Ms Lee said. "We are fortunate to have them on board and I look forward to working with them."

Nganeko Minhinnick is a long-time advocate for conservation encompassing Maori cultural and spiritual values. She is a former member of the Auckland Conservation Board.

Ms Minhinnick received a Biodiversity Accolade award at the launch of the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy in March, in recognition of her work to protect the natural and cultural assets of the Manukau Harbour.

Laura Dawson, appointed on the recommendation of the Royal Forest and Bird Society of New Zealand, has been a long term and most recent past chairperson of the Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Board.

Dr Nelson works at Te Papa Tongarewa, the Museum of New Zealand. Her expertise in marine conservation strongly supports this strategic priority for the Authority.
