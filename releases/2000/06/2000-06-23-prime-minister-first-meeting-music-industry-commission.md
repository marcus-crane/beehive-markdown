The establishment of the MIC was announced as part of the government's Building Cultural Identity package, unveiled last month.

The Commission's objectives include the fostering of New Zealand's contemporary music composition, performance, recording and marketing. It will also create a forum for the music industry, act as an advocate for it, and play an educational role about the industry.

"The $2 million with which the government is funding the MIC is an investment in the future of contemporary New Zealand music. It will give the industry the backing it needs to increase the contribution of New Zealand music to our society, economy, and foreign exchange earnings," Helen Clark said.

"The concept of the Commission is a music industry initiative. The previous National government made a belated promise to establish a music industry forum just prior to last year's election. That promise came after nine years of indifference to the industry and was too late to be acted on.

"Since the election, our new government has worked closely with key music industry figures to create this commission, which will take the industry forward and capitalise on its enormous musical and commercial potential.

"In doing so, it will complement the activities of Creative New Zealand and NZ On Air in advancing the cause of NZ contemporary music.

"The Commission will be accountable to the government for the use of the public money it receives. Its agreement with the government will also emphasise the importance of the Commission raising money from other sources," Helen Clark said.

The Music Industry Commission will be governed by a Board of Trustees, who will prepare a statement of intent and programme of activities to Government by 1 September 2000.

Mahinarangi Tocker, artist
