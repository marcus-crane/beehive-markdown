Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced staffing improvements for small rural schools which would come into effect at the start of next year.

Trevor Mallard told the New Zealand Principals Federation conference in Christchurch this afternoon that the changes resulted from the first recommendations from the Staffing Review Team established last month.

"While its work is still in its infancy, we do want to see improvements quite quickly. I don't want to have to wait until 2002 before even starting to introduce better staffing ratios in areas where I think there is a crucial need.

"So we set aside $8.6 million for some extra staff next year. It is my privilege to announce to you today how that funding will be distributed. The Government accepted without change the recommendations from the review team."

Additional staffing for schools next year is:

\* a staffing allowance of between 0.2 and 0.4 Full Time Teacher Equivalents (FTTEs) to primary schools with a roll under 160 and in reciept of Targeted Rural Funding;

\* a reduction of the Maximun Average Class Size from 28-27 for primary and area schools in recipt of TRF;

\* a rural staffing allowance of between 0.5 and 0.8 FTTEs for area schools in receipt of TRF;

\* a small staffing allowance of either 0.5 and 0.6 FTTEs for area schools with  
a roll of up to 200, which are not in receipt of TRF;

\* a rural staffing allowance of between 0.3 and 0.8 FTTEs for secondary schools in receipt of TRF; and

\* a small staffing allowance of between 0.3 and 0.5 FTTEs for secondary schools with a roll up to 200, which are not in receipt of TRF.

Trevor Mallard said the changes would provide about 160 full time teacher equivalents across about 460 rural and small schools.

"The review team is now working on a report for longer term plannning. I have asked for a phased plan which can be introduced over a number of years. As Minister, I will then take into account issues like affordability and teacher supply.

"Our priorities are in the area of small rural schools and low decile schools," Trevor Mallard said.
