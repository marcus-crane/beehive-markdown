The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche welcomed news of a breakthrough in Auckland rail negotiations.

"This is a step forward in resolving major traffic congestion problems in Auckland," said Mr Gosche.

"The Government will be studying the details of the agreement. The rail corridoor needs to play a significant role in Auckland's passenger transport infrastructure."

"Central Government has already signalled to Auckland people that we are committed to developing public transport as an alternative to the city's badly clogged roads. Further moves will be announced in this years budget."
