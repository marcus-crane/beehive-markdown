New funding provided in the Budget for Technology New Zealand will help build stronger partnerships between business and researchers in the tertiary sector, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey addressed senior executives of university research offices and university companies at Massey University in Palmerston North this morning. Technology New Zealand, who work with businesses to adopt and apply new technology, received an additional $8.5 million in the Budget for the 2000/01 year taking its total budget to $24.7 million. Mr Maharey said getting the right framework in place for effective technology transfer would be critical if New Zealand was to fully exploit research undertaken in our tertiary insitutions.

"Tertiary institutions are home for some of New Zealand's most important researchers. Better integrating the tertiary research community with business provides both parties with many benefits.

"These include better recognition of research effort in our tertiary insitutions, the development of high-value, high technology industries and export products and new revenue streams for tertiary institutions.

"The Government is increasing funding to Technology New Zealand as part of our drive to develop an innovative economy which creates jobs and provides opportunities for all New Zealanders.

"We are also working to create a climate within our universities of positive engagement with one another, with business and with other research organisations, including the Crown Research Institutions.

"In my view collaboration is so important that in the future some Government funding is likely to be made only if partnerships are in place.

"Reinforcing excellence and a ensuring more strategic approach for research within our tertiary institutions is essential if New Zealand is to better harness the talent of our researchers," Steve Maharey said.
