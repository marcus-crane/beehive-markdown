The Government is investing an additional $6.2 million over four years to improve and make more accessible quality careers advice, Associate Education Minister (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey made the announcement at Mana College in Porirua this morning where he was viewing The Real Game, an interactive reality-based careers learning tool. Effective careers planning is essential if students are to make a successful transition from school to the world of work. Mr Maharey said the new funding, to be provided in the Budget, would enable the Careers Service to expand the careers education it provides to schools and parents and to secure the future of its 0800 CareerPoint information line.

“Young people need good information about their career options while they are still at school so that they can make good study choices. Research shows that career decision-making foundations are being formed during Years 7 and 8.

“New funding for the Careers Service, worth $1.9 million over four years, will enable it to better deliver targeted careers education services to teachers and parents. Teacher as Career Educator (TACE) seminars will be run for Year 7 and 8 teachers, while the Parents as Career Educator (PACE) package is aimed at parents with children in Years 7 and 8 at low decile schools.

“The funding will also be used to develop occupational and industry outlook information for inclusion on the KiwiCareers website which is used by people as a key source of impartial career and training information.

Steve Maharey also announced that the Government has agreed to permanently fund the CareerPoint 0800 information line which has been successfully trialed this year. CareerPoint provides free impartial career and training information and advice that helps people of all ages make the best possible decisions about their working lives.

“$4.3 million will be invested in CareerPoint over four years to secure the service. During piloting it was well-used by people in rural communities, and by Maori, and the Government has been impressed with its ability to reach New Zealanders who may otherwise have no access to careers advice,” Steve Maharey said.
