New Zealand is to boost its overseas aid by 6.5% during the coming year, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Matt Robson said today.

This year’s allocation of $226.5m represents 0.27% of GNP and a $14m increase since the 1999 Budget night figure.

"The increase, which includes a new $2 million allocation for East Timor, is a result of pre-election promises from both the Alliance and Labour, that the Overseas Development Assistance budget should be increased," says Matt Robson.

“Our programme remains strongly focused on the South Pacific, where New Zealand has its closest ties and a track record of effective aid delivery. Most of our effort will go into education and training, health and good governance.

“We are also responding to the vulnerability of South Pacific ecosystems through our environment initiatives, and we are encouraging full participation by the private sector and NGOs in development”, he says.

"There are new challenges for the ODA programme, including shaping effective and appropriate responses to ethnic conflict in the Solomon Islands and to the Fiji constitutional crisis.

"Higher allocations for key United Nations and Commonwealth agencies recognise what these agencies do to support development.

"Non-governmental organisations will get a bigger slice of aid expenditure in the new financial year, because of the active and valuable role they play. Volunteer Service Abroad, the Voluntary Agency Support Scheme, the Council for International Development and the Development Resource Centre will all benefit from the increased ODA budget," says Matt Robson.
