Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard today presented an export commendation award to Canterbury Voice Release International Ltd.

The Christchurch company was established in February 1999 specifically to exploit market opportunities identified through the development of a unique electronic sporting product for the competitive shotgun shooting industry. In its first year of operation it earned $1 million from foreign exchange.

"When looking at why CVR has received this award, I think the facts speak for themselves," Trevor Mallard said. “

"This is not only an export success story, but this innovative new product is also conquering the shooting sport world.

"Some 18-20 different disciplines of this sport are enjoyed by thousands of people around the world, from club level through to Olympics. The sport is based around shooting, by shotgun, at one or two round clay targets that are ejected into the air on a set path from a trap machine.

"Graham Callander, co-Director of CVR and an electronics expert, developed a voice-activated trap release system employing electronic components which mimic the reaction time of a human release. This product has overcome one of the most significant problems associated with this sport, the variable reaction time of the human ‘puller’ who has traditionally released the target. Graham sought a business partner to manage the sales and marketing of his invention and was joined by Bruce Rickard, previously of Trade NZ.

"The outstanding performance of the new product has quickly won it recognition at the highest levels of the sport. CVR units have now been used at several major international events and the product is recognised as the world leader within its field.

"In getting this product right, CVR has shown “dogged persistence”. It took lots of time, and trial and error, to get the CVR product to its present outstanding level of performance.

"It's a case of true Kiwi ingenuity and it is a pleasure to present the award today," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard said export commendation awards were awarded by Trade New Zealand to companies that have made specific achievements in exporting.
