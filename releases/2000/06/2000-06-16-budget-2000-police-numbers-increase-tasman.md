The Labour/Alliance Government has delivered Tasman Police District an increase in police staff.

This year's Budget has provided for 19.5 full time positions.

Tasman Police District will get an extra:  
· 18 Highway Patrol police  
· 0.5 Traffic Intel staff position  
· one constable to reduce youth offending.

These positions are on top of existing police numbers. The Highway Patrol positions will be fully established by November 2001.

Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said: "This Budget provides extra dedicated Highway Patrol police to ensure that our highways and state roads are safer. It also delivers on the Pledge Card promise to crack down on youth crime.

"It also links to the Key Government Goal of Restoring Trust in Government and Providing Strong Social Services, by contributing towards building safe communities," George Hawkins said.
