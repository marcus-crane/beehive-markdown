Health Minister Annette King is to be congratulated for implementing a package that will see migrant doctors retrained to be able to practice in New Zealand, the Minister of Immigration, Lianne Dalziel, says.

"Annette King and myself battled with the previous Government on this issue. It's wonderful that money has been committed to ensure that these highly-skilled migrants will be able to work in their chosen fields."

But Lianne Dalziel said there was still more to be done to ensure migrants have good employment results.

"Professional registration is one issue, but there are other barriers to employment," she said.

"Employers need to realise there is a huge wealth of untapped skills and knowledge that is going to waste in New Zealand, and I hope that many of them take up the opportunity to see that potential realised," Lianne Dalziel said.
