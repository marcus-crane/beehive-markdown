Aspiring sports stars will be assisted with education scholarships under a new $9 million initiative announced in this year's Budget.

Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard said the purpose of the Sport Education Scholarship fund is to enable emerging and talented young New Zealand athletes to pursue tertiary study and elite level sport development concurrently.

"It's offering support to our future sporting stars so they can reach their potential in sport while still gaining a solid education to fall back on," Trevor Mallard said.

"The scholarships will be available from next year to talented athletes who have the potential to represent New Zealand internationally.

"It is estimated that about 100 scholarships will be available from the start of next year and they will average about $10, 000 each and include tertiary fees and a living allowance. Final details and conditions will be developed over the next few months.

"The scholarships tie in with the Government's funding of $16 million for high performance sport for the next four year Olympic cycle announced last month. It will be largely targeted towards three high performance sport centres.

" New Zealand’s success in international sporting events contributes strongly to New Zealand’s national identity, our sense of pride and achievement, social and economic wellbeing. The Government has a role in supporting both our current high achievers and our future stars," Trevor Mallard said.
