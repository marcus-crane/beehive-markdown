New Zealand will donate NZ$150,000 to provide food supplements to children and other vulnerable groups in Iraq, the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Matt Robson, announced today.

The grant will be made to the World Food Programme’s Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (PRRO) for Iraq.

“The New Zealand Government supports the United Nations’ efforts to force Iraq to stop producing weapons of mass destruction. However the Government is also keenly aware of the disastrous humanitarian situation in Iraq and the impact of the UN Security Council sanctions on the ordinary people of the country," says Matt Robson.

The plight of Iraqi civilians was highlighted during a visit to New Zealand in February by the WFP’s Executive Director, Catherine Bertini. She said the WFP supplementary food aid programme for Iraq was under-subscribed.

“The Government supports practical steps to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. It is pleased to work with the WFP, which has a good record of delivering food assistance in Iraq," says Matt Robson.

“The grant is a practical response to Security Council Resolution 1284 which encourages member states to humanitarian assistance to Iraq.

“Ordinary Iraqis, and especially children, are suffering terribly as an unintended result of the sanctions and from the deliberate policies of Saddam Hussein. This grant will help the World Food Programme provide for children and other vulnerable groups.”

The WFP’s Iraq operation is focused on the nutritional needs of the most vulnerable population groups. Foods with important micronutrients are provided to the youngest children suffering from acute malnutrition, their mothers, and patients in hospitals and social institutions. The operation is separate from the oil-for-food programme, which the World Food Programme also monitors.

The grant will be made from the emergency and disaster relief allocation of New Zealand Official Development Assistance.
