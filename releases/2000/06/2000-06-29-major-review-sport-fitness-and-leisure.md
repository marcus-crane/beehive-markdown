Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the membership and terms of reference into the Government's Ministerial Taskforce into Sport, Fitness and Leisure.

The Taskforce will be headed by former Auckland Grammar School principal and former All Black John Graham and will report back to the Government by the end of the year.

Other members will be lawyer and mountaineer David Collins; former world squash champion Dame Susan Devoy; New Zealand Recreation Association president Janet MacKay; Black Ferns captain Farah Palmer - a coaching co-ordinator; Cardiologist Dr Mark Simmonds - a Clinical Senior Lecturer at Wellington Clinical School of Medicine; and Glenn Turner, former NZ Cricket Team Captain and Coach and Chief Executive of the Otago Sports Trust.

"We have set the taskforce a major challenge," Trevor Mallard said.

"But the sector is in desperate need for leadership and a vision for the future. And while Government does not 'own' sport, there are so many benefits from a healthy sector that we have a responsibility to help it flourish.

"Our Government's overall objectives for the sporting sector are to increase participation and support excellence.

"The terms of reference focus around these objectives and I have asked the taskforce to clearly define a vision for a sport, fitness and leisure sector that will meet the needs of New Zealanders over the next 25 years," Trevor Mallard said.
