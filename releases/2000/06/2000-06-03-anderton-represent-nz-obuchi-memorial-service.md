Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton would represent New Zealand at the memorial service for former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, to be held in Tokyo on 8 June.

"Both Mr Obuchi and Japan have been firm friends of New Zealand and senior representation at the ceremony is clearly appropriate," the Prime Minister said.

"I have already conveyed our condolences to Mr Obuchi's successor, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.

"The memorial service will allow Japan and the world to pay its respects to the late Japanese Prime Minister," Helen Clark said
