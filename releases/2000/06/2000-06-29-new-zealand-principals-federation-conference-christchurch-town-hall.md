A couple of months ago during a visit to the South Island I was handed a paper titled Creative Administration. It was an extract from a series of papers bound together under the banner Modern Trends in Education.

It struck me as being a very good summary of seven 'abilities', to focus on in school administration.

One – to recognise the especially worthwhile things that are taking place in the school system.

Two – to organise the school system so that the especially worthwhile things discovered are spread throughout the whole system.

Three – to overcome the inefficiencies of others without losing their goodwill.

Four – to set goals that are within reach.

Five – to make everyone in the school system feel their jobs are worthwhile.

Six – to make everyone in the system grow professionally and grow in service to society.

Seven – to make those who work for or with the administrator personally happy.

The document was written in 1937.

Yet it is still appropriate for the education system in the new Millennium.

This week, I've focused a bit on some of the developments in Information and Communication Technology in schools. I took part in a preview of Te Kete Ipurangi – The Online Learning Centre. Each one of the points I have just run through could be directly related to this one project. It improves efficiency within the system, it involves schools sharing resources for the benefit of children's learning, and it has a huge professional development component. Given that there are so many Australian delegates at this conference it is appropriate to acknowledge that there has been a fair bit of contact between Australian and New Zealand officials in this area to look at ways which we can share resources. I certainly hope that that kind of approach continues.

The potential for learning is stunning.

TKI has been developed as a fast and easy way to access good quality resource material.

It is not for computer geeks – it is for teachers and children they teach. Good use of it will enhance learning at all levels and areas of the school programme. For those of you who are still a bit scared of computers and other forms of modern technology, overcome that fear. I can tell you first hand that it is not that scary and I think you'll be amazed by the potential it offers.

It offers a real opportunity to learn from the work of others – to pick up lesson plans that work so they can be tweaked for use in your school.

It is an important aspect of the ICT strategy which we are committed to. This year's Budget increased financial support for key aspects of the ICT strategy by $18.1 million over the next four years.

It includes:

 $5.5 million to develop Maori and English material and technical developments for Te Kete Ipurangi  
 $2.5 million for an ICT Help Desk starting next year to support schools  
 $10.1million to establish 25 additional ICT clusters and extend the current programme

I think the innovations pool is also an important way of recognising the positive work that is occurring in schools. This year's Budget doubled the funding for the innovations pool. Schools can apply for funding for programmes designed to improve educational outcomes for students at risk of failure. Each year, some of the innovations that have been funded from the pool in previous years will be trialled in a broader range of schools and resources will be developed to assist other schools throughout New Zealand to implement these proven innovations.

I place a great importance on schools complementing and supporting each other rather than the open slather competition mentality that has developed in some areas over the last decade.

I don't like waste and I think where programmes have been developed successfully, there is a lot more potential for sharing the ideas and models elsewhere in the country than currently occurs.

It's probably appropriate to talk here about bulk funding. I'm sure that many of you who come from bulk funded schools will be sitting here thinking about some of the innovative programmes that you have implemented with your bulk funding money.

There have been a lot of positives in bulk funded schools and that's largely because of the extra money.

There will be significantly more money in schools, to run schools, next year.

The Budget allowed for $60 million dollars more. That is money that is made up of an increase in the base operational funding as well as the money that was never taken up through bulk funding.

It is on top of the bulk funding money that has been in schools this year. Many of you may remember my promise to deliver the full $106 million set aside by National for schools that opted for bulk-funding. Well, we have delivered on that promise – every last cent and another $15 million.

In previous years, too much money that could have been spent on schools was sent back to Treasury. I will not allow it to go back to Treasury again – it will be given to schools and it will stay in schools. Even as Associate Minister of Finance, I think it is put to better use in schools than in the Government's coffers.

On average it is about a 7.4 per cent increase in school operational funding. Next year, we will again keep our commitment to adjust it further in line with inflation.

We are introducing a lot of the flexibility that bulk funded schools have found positive but we will retain responsibility for paying for the minimum staffing entitlements.

For example, I want to make it easier for schools to use operations funding to employ extra teachers over and above what you receive through your staffing entitlement. I intend to have some of the current restrictions removed to allow schools more choice in employing additional teachers.

I am also considering a proposal to enable schools to “bank” part of their staffing allocation. Many of you have asked me to implement this provision. If you under-utilise your allocation at any point in the year, you will be able to “save” the difference for use later in the year. There will no longer be a “use it or lose it” arrangement if the staffing is used to its maximum within the year. I do expect that schools will use this flexibility wisely. Any schools which have over used their staffing entitlement at the end of the year would be required to repay the cost.

Finally I want to give schools the opportunity to enhance teachers’ salaries through the purchase of recognition payments from your operations funding. This would allow you more scope to attract, retain, manage and reward staff according to the needs of your school.

Details about the full flexibility package and the new funding rates will be sent to all schools no later than 31 August this year. In the meantime I would like you to think carefully about your priorities for using the redistributed money in 2001. In August you will be asked to advise the Ministry by the end of November as to how you intend to use the money before it is given to you in 2001. You will be sent a short checklist to complete. You won’t have to supply pages of information, but I do want to be assured that the needs of young people are being targeted appropriately.

I have read many of the written submissions and newspaper reports of the oral submissions made to the Education and Science select committee about bulk funding. They talked at length about the extra teachers bulk funding provided them, the extra programmes they were able to implement, the special help for children with particular needs. I have not seen any evidence from schools on how they could have achieved all of that without the extra money. Every 'extra' they have provided their children with will be possible under the centrally resourced model, with the same amount of money.

So I am looking forward to reading about more wonderful things that all schools are doing with the extra money that will be available next year.

We're currently waiting for the July 1 roll returns before working through the final funding formulas.

Staffing is probably the other major issue that I need to cover today.

Can I acknowledge here the work that your president is contributing to this group as one of the seven members of the review team.

While its work is still in its infancy, we do want to see improvements quite quickly. I don't want to have to wait until 2002 before even starting to introduce better staffing ratios in areas where I think there is a crucial need.

So we set aside $8.6 million for some extra staff next year. It is my privilege to announce to you today how that funding will be distributed. The Government accepted without change the recommendations from the review team.

So the additional staffing for small rural primary schools next year is:  
 a staffing allowance of between 0.2 and 0.4 Full Time Teacher Equivalents to primary schools with a roll under 160 and in reciept of Targeted Rural Funding;  
 a reduction of the Maximun Average Class Size from 28-27 for primary and area schools in recipt of TRF;  
 a rural staffing allowance of between 0.5 and 0.8 FTTEs for area schools in receipt of TRF;

There is also extra support for small area and secondary schools.

The review team is now working on a report for longer term plannning. I have asked for a phased plan which can be introduced over a number of years. As Minister, I will then take into account issues like affordability and teacher supply.

Our priorities are in the area of small rural schools and low decile schools, but as steps of the phased plan are introduced, all schools will benefit.

The Budget also included a further capital injection of $160 million next year to ensure the largest boost to school property funding ever.

Over the next two years, the Government we will spend $638 million on school property – an $88 million increase on last year's funding. It will provide for 220 new classrooms, as well as funding to buy 16 new sites for schools and pay for 12 new schools to be opened by 2004.

As we no longer have deferred maintenance to fund we will be able to make real progress on modernisation.

Related to this is my recent announcement of new 5-year property programmes for schools.

It will give schools the certainty they presently lack to get on with the job of self managing their property and meeting the expectations of their communities.

Each school will work with the Ministry of Education to decide their priorities for capital works within assured funding levels that are fair and equitable for all schools.

This system will be progressively rolled out to all schools by 2005 starting with sixty straight away and another 450 over the next year. These have been selected to give a mix of decile ranking, location, school type and size. Until the other schools enter the scheme regular property funding programmes will remain.

I want to talk now about the way I perceive your roles as principals.

Much has been written on the nature of the principals’ role. The international literature is clear that you make a real difference to educational outcomes. You do this through the direct educational leadership you provide to staff, the influence you have over the educational objectives of the school and the range of decisions you make to support these objectives. These cover the very specific decisions on the employment, performance management and professional development of staff and how school resources are used, through to the processes of creating and gaining support for an educational vision within the school and developing and maintaining a culture to support this vision.

I think the time has come to move on from arguments about leadership versus management. I don’t think the two are so easily separated. There is no doubt in my mind that principals need to be educational leaders. But the principals’ role is a complex one and principals need a mix of management as well as leadership skills. You need to be able to juggle multiple demands and be able to make time for the strategic and reflective among the day to day. This isn’t an easy task but it is one that I think managers and leaders in all fields have to grapple with.

As you are aware I have an interest in how the leadership and management skills of principals can be developed. The question will probably have different answers depending on where a principal is at with his or her career. There is a wide range of professional development options available for principals and we know that principals do engage in a range of development. However, I also know there are concerns about a lack of consistency in the development undertaken. Perhaps therefore the real question is whether principals are accessing the quantity and quality of development that they individually require at different points in their careers. Issues related to aspiring and new principals seem to be causing particular concern and this raises questions about whether new principals should meet specific requirements before they can be appointed. We need to think very seriously about this.

There are many developments overseas and we can certainly learn from these. But I am not sure that any other country would claim at this stage to know that they have got it right. Even if another country had got the approach right, we would need to adapt it to make it appropriate for the New Zealand context. I am also aware that there are many exciting things currently happening in the area of principals’ development and I do not want to do anything that will stifle these developments. In this year's Budget we have set aside $200,000 for the policy work that will be required to consider how government should fund this area.

The need for such work increased tremendously after the Tomorrow Schools changes and has been left to languish under previous governments for a decade.

It requires some quite complex policy work - I'm aware that there are 1300 views on priorities in this room alone - and committing funds to that work shows our commitment to analysing those views and getting an outcome.

Finally – there are always competing pressures and people asking us to do more but there is only so much work that government can do before we start sacrificing quality. In the education portfolio I think we have achieved a fair bit in six months.

I'd like to finish by focusing a bit on the Government's objective of closing the gaps.

It is one of our biggest challenges. Those of you who work in the low decile schools will see constant evidence of widening gaps which must worry you in the same way as it worries us.

The economic and social policy changes that have taken place in New Zealand through the 1980s and 1990s have seen the position of both Maori and Pacific peoples deteriorate relative to others.

While previous administrations might express an interest in alleviating some of the appalling Maori statistics, we are working really hard to put those words into action.

The Prime Minister announced in January that she would chair a committee into closing the gaps. She has a very real determination to instigate change and she has instructed all Ministers to make policy work in this area a priority within their portfolio areas.

Some of that was reflected in the Budget and there is another $50 million set aside to fund further initiatives in this financial year once policy work is completed.

I'm personally pleased with the start we have made in this area within the education portfolio.

It includes:

 $20.4 million over the next four years for 121 resource teachers of literacy.

 $3 million over the next four years on developing literacy and numeracy materials in English and Mäori.

 $7.5 million over four years for homework centres based in primary and intermediate schools.

 About $10 million extra next year for early childhood education.

Can I say here that I hope you will reap the benefits of the Government's commitment to increasing participation in quality early childhood education in your schools within a few years time.

Our aim is to see higher employment levels for Maori and Pacific communities, better health status, better housing, and higher educational achievement. We also want to build the capacity of Maori communities to reach these objectives. I hope this work will contribute to making your jobs easier.

I often refer back to the ideals promoted by the partnership between Education Minister Peter Fraser and Director of Education Clarence Beeby.

More than any government before them and many since, they saw the need and the right of all New Zealanders to a good quality education. They believed that no matter what their family background, all New Zealand children deserved a chance to reach their full potential in education.

There are many people of my generation who utilised that chance and who, despite coming from modest or poor backgrounds, are leaders in our country today in all sorts of areas.

Our gaps objective is the modern equivalent of that work. I look forward to working with you to develop that visi
