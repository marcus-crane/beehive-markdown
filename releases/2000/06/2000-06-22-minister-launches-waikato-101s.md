Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins will this Thursday launch the Waikato 101 Patrol Group.

The 101 Patrol Group has been made possible due to joint co-operation between the Police and Work and Income New Zealand. Members of the 101s are interviewed and vetted by police and if accepted, join in helping to create a safer community.

The 101 Patrol will provide foot and static patrols around Hamilton City and the Waikato Police District.

George Hawkins said: "It is not intended that the 101 Patrol Group become an ad hoc police service. Rather it is a scheme principally focussed on employment opportunities and community safety as part of a respected community scheme."

The 101 Patrol Group concept comes from an idea of senior constable Joe Diamond, of the Lower Hutt Police.

"I recently visited the Lower Hutt 101 Patrol Group and I was delighted and impressed of its professionalism," George Hawkins said.

"Not only have they made a very significant contribution to the safety of the Lower Hutt area, it is clear that many of the participants of the Lower Hutt 101s have realised hopes and goals. I expect the Waikato 101 Group will also share similar successes."

The 101 Patrol scheme is a path to full time employment: "I am also pleased to observe a considerable number of original participants in the Lower Hutt 101 scheme are now actively pursuing a career with the New Zealand Police," George Hawkins said.

Community safety is not solely the job of the Police.

There are many initiatives and schemes that in conjunction with Police serve to bring peace and order to our communities.

"The 101 Scheme is an excellent example of a Police/Community relationship that brings benefit not only to the participants of this scheme but to the wider community that we all choose to serve," George Hawkins said.
