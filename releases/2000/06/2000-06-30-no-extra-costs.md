The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche confirmed today that there would not be any extra money needed to fund the driver licensing review announced by Prime Minister Helen Clark this morning.

"We are paying for the review out of the current budget baselines of Vote Transport," he said today.

He said National MP Roger Sowry's comments that the licensing system was "hugely successful" demonstrated the previous government's failure to listen to everyday New Zealanders.

"I have received piles of letters of complaint from people all over the country and our Government will not ignore them."

"We are going to take a closer look at some aspects of the system however the whole regime will not be overturned because some things are working."

"However I am convinced that we need an independent reviewer to investigate and make recommendations for our consideration."
