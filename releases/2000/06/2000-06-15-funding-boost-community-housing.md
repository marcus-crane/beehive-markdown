Community Housing will benefit from significant funding assistance in this year's Budget, says Housing Minister Mark Gosche.

A capital cost of $28.7 million has been allocated to Community Housing Limited to buy and modify 120 properties.

This will contribute to increasing the total housing stock of Community Housing to approximately 1,200 residences by June 2001.

"Making safe, secure, affordable housing available for some of New Zealand's most vulnerable and at risk people is a housing priority for the Government. It is another way in which we are working to close disparity gaps in this country," said Mr Gosche.

"This cash injection recognises the valuable service Community Housing provides for those organisations working at the coal face with at risk people.

"The Government acknowledges its responsibility to make sure that all people have access to decent housing."

Community Housing Limited is a subsidiary company of Housing Corporation New Zealand and provides rental accommodation for groups working with people who have specific housing requirements.

This includes those with intellectual, psychiatric and physical disabilities, women who need refuge and others needing emergency support or access to suitable housing, including Mäori
