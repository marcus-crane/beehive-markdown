New Zealand will close its mission in Zimbabwe and consolidate its southern African representation in the South African post, which will be enlarged, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“Since 1996, New Zealand’s relationships with nine countries in southern Africa have been managed by two very small missions, located in Harare and Pretoria. It has been very difficult for these posts to manage their sizeable workloads,” Mr Goff said.

“We want to maintain a good level of representation in southern Africa. We will close the mission in Harare in November and transfer its responsibilities to Pretoria, raising staffing by one to a three-person post. We also plan to appoint an Honorary Consul in Harare to help manage some aspects of the post’s current work,” Mr Goff said.

“We do not envisage a significant change to our relationships with Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries, just a change in the machinery used to conduct them,” he added.

“The decision to close the Harare post was not related to the recent political events in Zimbabwe. It has been clear for some time that we need to find a more effective way of taking care of New Zealand’s interests in the region,” he said.
