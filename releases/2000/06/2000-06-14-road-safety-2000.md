The government's reduced tolerances announced in last week's road safety package is designed to save lives and prevent injuries on New Zealand roads and highways, the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said today.

Part of this included replacing the 85th percentile standard which targeted the top 15 per cent of fast drivers and therefore saw tolerances vary across the country.

"We have replaced this with a 10 kph tolerance, this standardises our approach and sends an important signal to motorists," said Mr Gosche.

"Speed is a significant contributor to road trauma on New Zealand roads."

"So far this year 218 New Zealanders have died on our roads and highways. The past five years have seen 2857 deaths that we believe could have been prevented. Thousands more have ended up with serious injuries. In fiscal terms this cost the country more than $3 billion only last year."

"Speed kills and we want to get this message through to New Zealand motorists."

"Reduced tolerances are just one part of the safety package announced by the Government."

"Road safety education is a key feature in the overall package and we believe that education alongside enhanced enforcement is the best way forward."

"Our road safety package aims to save lives and we believe the only way to do this is to make sure that road safety education is promoted alongside road safety enforcement."
