Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today that National MP Tony Ryall was suffering from a severe bout of amnesia.

"Mr Ryall has forgotten that his Government planned to sell off thousands of state homes."

"They were going to build 2,400 state houses – but Mr Ryall forgets to add that they planned to sell more than 10,000 state houses over a three-year-period," said Mr Gosche.

"This is a decrease in over 7,500 state houses."

"We are finalising plans with Housing New Zealand to increase the supply of state houses."

"We are also going to boost maintenance on many state homes who have fallen into disrepair thanks to the previous Government's neglect."

"Unlike Mr Ryall's colleagues the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government is convinced that housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of our famiiles and communities."
