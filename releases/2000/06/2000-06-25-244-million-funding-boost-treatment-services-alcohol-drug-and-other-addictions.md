Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the government has increased funding for alcohol, drug, and other addiction treatment and prevention programmes by $24.4 million over four years in the budget.

Helen Clark has been at the open day at Odyssey House in her electorate as part of 'Treatment Works Week' organised be drug, alcohol, and addiction services nationwide this week to highlight the important work of their services.

The Prime Minister said that alcohol and drug treatment and prevention services have been badly neglected in recent years.

"Last year, for example, the sector got no extra funding out of the then-National government, despite that government's supposed strong anti-drug stance. The services were told that funding for their work was frozen, even though the demand is growing.

"In the recent budget, the new government has increased funding for these services by $24.4 million over the next four years. This will greatly assist the important contributions of many organisations, like Odyssey House, in combatting the harmful impact of addictions on New Zealanders.

"The awareness week is an opportunity to recognise the tireless efforts of drug, alcohol, and other addiction workers in New Zealand. These people and their organisations make a significant contribution in turning people's lives around and rebuilding families and communities.

"The government greatly appreciates the important contributions of these organisations. Treatment and rehabilitation programmes give people with addictions fresh hope and a chance of a fresh start," Helen Clark said.
