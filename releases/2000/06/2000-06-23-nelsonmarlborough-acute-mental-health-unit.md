Thank you for your invitation to speak this morning. We are all here to celebrate the opening of the Nelson/ Malborough Acute Mental Health Unit. It is a pleasure to support and celebrate the work that has gone into this exciting project.

I have been assuring people since this Government came to power that mental health is a very high priority for the coalition.

I hope that after last week's Budget announcements I will no longer have to provide that assurance, because the Budget should have demonstrated just how committed we are in the mental health area. The Budget announcement of an additional $257.4 million over the next four years for mental health represents the maximum amount of money the Mental Health Commission says the sector is capable of spending over that period. I don't think we could have done better than that, or moved any faster, for reasons I will explain shortly.

The level and quality of specialist mental health services have improved over recent years, but there is still much to do to ensure that services are able to meet the full range of needs of people who experience mental and psychological distress.

The Government is committed to continually improving mental health services through implementing the Mental Health Commission’s Blueprint. This will result in comprehensive services that lead to:

 people with mental illnesses being treated fairly and with respect and dignity  
 people with mental illness having the opportunity to participate fully in their communities free from negative discrimination  
 more services that are easier to access and that are able to respond to a diverse range of needs more quickly  
 better quality services that are able to identify and respond to needs in a way that promotes recovery.

Collaboration between providers of mental health providers is imperative. Hospital-based and community-based services must collaborate with each other as well as with non-governmental providers and primary health care services. All are integral to improved co-ordination of mental health services.

It's not just a question of money. It is also a matter of working out, as I mentioned earlier, the rate of progress the sector has the ability to sustain. A limited workforce still remains the most significant barrier for the sector to overcome. However, some of the $257 million will go toward developing this area.

Mental health is not, of course, the only health sector that is short of trained staff, but it's certainly one of the worst examples. The process has begun to establish a Health Workforce Advisory Committee, which will advise on workforce issues throughout the health sector. The work this committee has to do is becoming increasingly crucial.

There are other specific issues affecting the mental health sector too. One, quite clearly, is discrimination toward people with mental illness. An important start has been made in addressing this, most obviously through the current national media campaign, Like Minds Like Mine.

The Government is also particularly concerned about Mäori mental health services. Mäori must have the choice to access mental health services that are aligned with cultural expectations.

To achieve this, however, another workforce issue arises. There must be an increase in the number of trained Mäori mental health workers. Mäori are significantly under-represented in the professionally qualified mental health workforce. This has resulted in reduced opportunities for cultural difference to be appreciated in assessment, treatment, support and education for recovery.

There has to be a short-term and long-term strategy to address this issue as the situation is urgent for tängata whai ora. A substantial Mäori workforce must have some presence in all kaupapa Mäori and mainstream services.

The establishment of Mäori provider skills in administration and management is also imperative. There is ample evidence to show how the cultural background of providers influences the results they achieve. The Government is committed to achieving the right balance.

Equally importantly, as the draft New Zealand Health Strategy I released on June 1 makes clear, is the need to work across sectors and services. There needs to be appropriate referrals, assessments and comprehensive strategies with other sectors to ensure that people’s full range of needs are met. Factors such as adequate housing, income and jobs for people recovering from mental illness are matters the Government will also address.

You may be aware of the formation of a Cabinet Committee to address intersectoral issues that impact on mental health consumers. I chair this committee and twelve other Ministers, including the Minister for Disability Issues and the Deputy Prime Minister, participate.

The Government will provide the leadership that is needed in mental health to make changes happen, to create an environment where you can all do your jobs better; and, most importantly, to ensure consumers get better services. The Government will ensure we have a chance to make a significant impact on health outcomes for both service users and for the population as a whole.

The mental health sector on its own cannot achieve this. It needs social policy that promotes and supports mental health, that doesn't work against it.

Nelson/ Marlborough Acute Mental Health Unit

I now want to talk specifically about this new unit.

It is important that we remember that most people with a mental illness do not need to be in hospital. Most people with a mental illness manage well within the community. However, occasionally, as with physical illness, people need to be admitted to an acute unit. This acute unit meets two very important needs.

The first is the need to see mental illness as just that- an illness. By having the unit located near general medical services, it will help remove the stigma so commonly associated with having a mental illness.

The second need is to have the service clearly visible in the community instead of tucked away in a valley that geographically keeps it isolated.

Mental illness is part of our community and by having the unit visible in the community, people will become more comfortable with the fact that anyone can have a mental illness, just as they can a physical illness. It is vital to have mental illness recognised as an illness rather than a lifetime disease that can only be treated under lock and key. Mental illness must be brought out into the open.

I understand that this new unit is built specifically as a therapeutic environment, and careful consideration has been given to the design of the physical environment where treatment takes place.

The vision for this unit was to have a building and outside environment that would help treatment by creating an interesting, aesthetically pleasing, therapeutic environment that balances the contrasting needs for safety, ease of access, privacy and personal space.

The project designers and staff have worked together to recognise and support the fact that people are individuals who have different problems and different needs. This has been met in sometimes subtle ways such as not having all spaces rectangular, bringing natural light into rooms, using calm but warm colours and providing views from windows. The five wings have been arranged at various angles to each other and to other parts of the building, so that a number of courtyards have been created, providing an attractive outside extension to indoor spaces.

It is interesting to note that the high ceilings not only provide a feeling of spaciousness but also, so I am told, capitalise on Nelson’s high sunshine hours by using skylights. Fluorescent lighting has been a feature often associated with outdated health facilities.

Where possible, materials and artwork from this community have been used to furnish the unit. Even the sofas and bean bags come from a local family company.

Many of you here will have had unique connections with the previous acute mental health service. I understand this new unit also has a special connection to the valley that housed mental health services in this region for 70 years. There is a very special side table that now takes pride of place in the main corridor. This table was discovered in a Nelson shop recently and is made from the recycled rimu timber saved from an old building that caught fire at Ngawhatu last year.

Some of you may recall fondly the outdoor environment- an attractive landscaped valley surrounded by beautiful trees and streams. As you can see this morning, the outdoor area here has been designed to provide an environment that is interesting, naturally stimulating and peaceful.

It is also important to remember that this building has been built to provide an improved environment for the team working here. Working in an acute psychiatric inpatient unit can be very stressful at times, and staff need an environment that is pleasant for them.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all who work here for the wonderful job you are doing, despite the pressure you work under and the changes you have been through. This unit is a credit to you all.

In closing, I wish to thank everyone who has contributed time and resources to making the original vision of this unit a reality. I am sure all here will agree that you can be very proud of this accomplishment.
