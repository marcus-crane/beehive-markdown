Justice Minister Phil Goff announced today a review of the Police Complaints Authority's structure and the manner in which it conducts its operations.

"The Authority has been in existence now for 12 years. It's time to take stock, to see where it's working well and where improvements can be made," Mr Goff said.

"There's no doubt the PCA has done much during the last 12 years to promote public confidence in police accountability. Currently it investigates approximately 2000 complaints a year and sustains about 15% of cases. It hasn't hesitated to criticise police action on numerous occasions where such criticism has been warranted.

"Following the Waitara shooting, however, some commentators made quite extraordinary allegations about the conduct of previous Police Complaints Authority investigations. I wrote to these people requesting urgently that they substantiate allegations. I have so far received one reply in which the individual accepts that he can offer no concrete example far less evidence of cover-ups.

"In order to maintain a high level of public confidence in the PCA's independence and credibility, the Government has decided that now would be a good time to re-examine publicly the advantages and disadvantages of PCA structure.

"Two key questions we will be asking are:

'Should the Authority have an independent investigative capacity for serious complaints and incidents', and

'To what degree should the function of the Authority be carried out in private and in secrecy'?

"In holding a review, I want to make it clear that this is not an expression of any dissatisfaction whatsoever with the Authority’s track record. Neither should this process in any way be seen as having a bearing on the conduct of the Waitara investigation or the validity of its eventual outcome", Mr Goff concluded.

Hon Justice Sir Rodney Gallen, retired judge of the High Court, will conduct the review and report to the Minister of Justice by 31 October 2000.
