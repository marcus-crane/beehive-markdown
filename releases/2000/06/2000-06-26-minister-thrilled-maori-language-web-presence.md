Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia said the development of an Online Learning Centre was a real breakthrough for teaching in te reo Maori.

Parekura Horomia was taking part in a preview of Te Kete Ipurangi – the Online Learning Centre which is set to become a major feature in New Zealand classrooms from the start of Term Three.

"I see this as a really exciting start for decent resources for teachers working in te reo Maori," Parekura Horomia said.

"These teachers have a great burden in that they constantly have to develop material themselves because there is a real lack of teaching resources available in te reo Maori.

"Within Information and Communications Technology there is the potential for the central development of resources for all teachers in te reo Maori. There is also scope for a lot more sharing of resources so that the work that a teacher in Auckland does, can be also used by a teacher in Tolaga Bay.

"This kind of approach is cost effective and has the added bonus that resources can be easily adapted to take into account dialectual differences.

“Through such innovations as Te Kete Ipurangi, Maori language content on the web will continue to grow at a rapid rate and be more accessible to all which is another great achievement for Maori language,” said Parekura Horomia.
