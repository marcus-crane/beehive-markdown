Minister of Corrections, Matt Robson will open the new drug and alcohol unit at Rolleston prison in Christchurch tomorrow.

He will also visit the Christchurch Victim Support group, Howard League for Penal Reform, the highly succcesful Kia Marama Unit which treats sex offenders, and the Paparua Remand centre where he will visit the inmate employment initiatives, the carving centre ect.

"If we are to stand any chance of success in reducing the re-offending rate, then we must eradicate drugs from prisons, and treat those inmates with addiction problems before we release them back into society," says Matt Robson.

"This is vital to the success of our rehabilitation and restorative justice focus. We must tackle the connection between crime and drug addiction head on."
