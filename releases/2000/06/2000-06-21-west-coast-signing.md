Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton will sign a Heads of Agreement for the West Coast package in Greymouth tomorrow.

The signing ceremony will be held at the Grey District Council Building, 105 Tainui Street, Greymouth at 12 noon. Media are invited.

The signatories will be Dr Cullen and Mr Anderton for the Crown; Westland District Mayor, John Drylie, Buller District Mayor, Pat 'Dea, Grey District Mayor, Kevin Brown and the Chairperson of the West Coast Regional Council, John  
Clayton.

Immediately after the signing, there will be a short press conference.

The $120 million package is to assist the West Coast economy to adjust,  
recognising that the Government's policies on indigenous logging will mean a more speedy adjustment process is required.

A direct payment of $7 million \[GST exclusive, $7.875 million GST inclusive] will be made to each of the West Coast Councils. This money will be for use at the councils' discretion, including covering any costs they may have incurred in negotiating the package.

The remaining $92 million will be paid to a Joint Committee of the Trust which will manage the funds and distribute the benefits. The nature of this entity will be decided by mutual agreement between the Crown and the West Coast Councils following consultation with the community.

The choices are: a Joint Committee set up under the Local Government Act 1974 or a Trust set up under a Trust Deed. A discussion document outlining these options will be circulated widely on the West Coast before a decision is taken.
