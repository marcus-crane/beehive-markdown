Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said: "This Budget delivers on the Pledge Card promise to crack down on burglary and youth crime. It provides extra dedicated Highway Patrol police to ensure that our highways and state roads are safer.

"It also links to the Key Government Goal of Restoring Trust in Government and Providing Strong Social Services, by contributing towards building safe communities," George Hawkins said.
