Students were the focus when Education Minister Trevor Mallard opened new facilities at Kaipara College in Helensville.

Trevor Mallard used the opportunity to encourage the students into taking part in elections for a represnetative on school boards of trustees.

The Education Amendment Bill – due to be reported back to Parliament – includes the right for a student representative on their school board of trustees.

"Most secondary schools boards already have student representatives on their boards but about a quarter do not. We believe that students should have a right to have their own democratically elected member of the board that controls their school.

"And until now student representatives have been elected to the job at the beginning of the year and for most of them it has been their seventh form year. It has usually taken them most of the first term to get to understand their responsibilities and by about September when they were getting fully into the swing of things they have, quite sensibly, had bursary on their mind.

"This new piece of law will require schools to hold elections for student rep in September. This will mean that a new student rep will know about their role in the final term of the year, they will have a chance to work alongside the outgoing student rep, and learn about the role so that they are ready to go as a fully fledged trustee at the beginning of the next year. "

Trevor Mallard also praised the new facilities at the school saying they would be well used by the students, the staff and were an asset for the entire community.

Ministry of Education funding had enabled upgrades for multi purpose courts; a special needs unit; a home economics block; an art block; two science laboratories
