The Leader of the Mana Motuhake Party, Cabinet Minister Hon Sandra Lee, has paid tribute to her good friend and veteran trade union leader Jock Barnes, who died in Auckland yesterday, describing him as "a great New Zealander".

"Jock Barnes set a high standard in leading de-registered Waterside Workers Union members, including my father, through the infamous 1951 waterfront lock-out," said Ms Lee.

"The shameful suspension of civil liberties and the free press by the National government at the time of the lock-out was unprecedented, " Ms Lee said.

"I'm sad that Jock Barnes will not now be able to mark the 50th anniversary of the lock-out next year," she said, "but I'm sure he would appreciate out-living all his political enemies."

"I and many others will gather then to mark the occasion and honour this brave man's memory," Ms Lee said. "He was a battler to the end."
