The Government is allocating $25,000 this year to the New Zealand Korean Veterans Association to assist with commemoration plans to mark the 50th anniversary of the Korean War, the Minister of Veterans' Affairs Mark Burton said today.

"My office has been in discussion for some time with the Korean Veterans Association, following the previous Government's rejection of a request for funding.

"The Association has now provided more details of the purposes to which any Government funding would be put.

"The Association has also asked the Government to pay for a reception which I have offered to host at Parliament, after previously indicating it would fund such a reception itself.

"I am happy to meet this request, by re-allocating some of the funding being offered to the Association," Mark Burton said.

In addition to the Parliamentary reception, the Government will put $10,000 towards the production of a commemorative booklet and $10,000 towards an exhibition of Korean War photographs and artefacts.
