Minister of Forestry Pete Hodgson today released Cabinet papers relating to decisions on Timberlands West Coast indigenous timber logging and the West Coast Accord.

One paper discusses the implications of a proposed early end to Timberlands' indigenous logging. It addresses questions about rimu and alternative timber supplies, employment impacts and unsustainable "overcut" logging in the Buller region.

A second paper discusses issues relating to the Forests (West Coast Accord) Bill, which would cancel the 1986 West Coast Accord and provide for a mechanism for adding Timberlands native forest to the Conservation estate. Mr Hodgson is the Minister responsible for the bill, which has been referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee for report back to Parliament by 3 August 2000.

Cabinet minutes recording decisions in relation to the papers have also been released.

"I hope the release of these papers will aid public understanding of the Government's decisions on West Coast forestry issues," Mr Hodgson said.

The papers are available as hard copy only. If you have not received copies with this statement and wish to receive them, please contact:
