The new Chair of the Broadcasting Standards Authority is to be Auckland lawyer, Peter Cartwright, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

Mr Cartwright, who is also chair of the Accident Compensation Appeal Authority, replaces Sam Maling, whose term has expired. The appointment is for three years.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints relating to broadcasting standards issues and encourages the development of Codes of Practice amongst broadcasters.

" Mr Cartwright brings to the Broadcasting Standards Authority extensive experience as a former Chair of the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal and the Indecent Publications Tribunal and in private practice as a solicitor," Marian Hobbs said.

She paid tribute to the work of the outgoing chair of the BSA, Sam Maling.

"Mr Maling has made a valuable contribution to the Authority during his term as Chair," the Minister said "I thank him for it."
