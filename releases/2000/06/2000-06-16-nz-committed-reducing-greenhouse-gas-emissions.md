New Zealand is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations, Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson said today.

Mr Hodgson is leading a ministerial group established by Prime Minister Helen Clark to oversee the development of a climate change action programme that will enable New Zealand to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by mid-2002.

The Protocol obliges New Zealand to stabilise its greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, on average, over the period 2008 to 2012.

"Given that the latest figures available show New Zealand’s carbon dioxide emissions in 1998 were about 14 percent higher than they were in 1990, we face a major challenge to reach our target," Mr Hodgson said. "We aim to reduce emissions to fulfil our obligations. We also anticipate earning credits for the carbon dioxide our forest sinks soak up."

Mr Hodgson said he was concerned at an inaccurate and misleading representation of New Zealand's position circulated recently by Greenpeace and endorsed by a global coalition of environmental organisations.

"New Zealand amongst other nations has been accused of trying to 'twist' interpretation of the Kyoto treaty to enable OECD countries to increase emissions by 15 to 20 percent. New Zealand intends no such thing and is in fact advancing proposals designed to limit windfall gains.

"A further bizarre accusation is that New Zealand, amongst others, favours 'loopholes' in rules for forestry that would give incentives to chop down old-growth forests and replace them with new plantations that would generate carbon sink credits. This is utterly untrue. New Zealand has always opposed deforestation and our proposals in this area explicitly preclude such an outcome.

"Finally, New Zealand has been grossly misrepresented as supporting the use of nuclear power under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which gives developed nations credit for assistance with projects in developing nations that avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New Zealand has a proud and well-known record of anti-nuclear advocacy and has never spoken in favour of nuclear energy at climate change negotiations."
