Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia said this year's Budget showed a real commitment to long-term Mäori education needs.

More than $50 million has been allocated in the Budget for specific Mäori education initiatives over the next four years.

Parekura Horomia said the initiatives included education in Mäori language and help to lift Mäori achievement in mainstream education.

"There will be a hui taumata later this year to further develop ways to help Mäori achieve more in education. But this Government does not want to waste time talking when we can act, so there are already a number of positive issues in this year's Budget.

The Budget includes spending over the next four years of:  
\* Almost $20 million for Mäori language education including $6.5 million on new teaching and learning material and $4.1 million specifically to help curriculum development at Wharekura level.

\* $12.9 million to improve Mäori teacher supply both in mainstream and kura kaupapa schools.

\* $11.2 million on ways to help young Mäori participate more fully in the school system including a mentoring programme.

\* $10.4 million for Mäori responsiveness initiatives including expanding the number of iwi education schooling improvement projects and piloting new approaches for professional development for teachers working with Mäori students.

"Mäori students will also benefit from many of the other commitments in Vote: Education, but I am pleased that there is such an emphasis on spending for specific Mäori initiatives.

"The Budget provides opportunity for Mäori to develop resources and to work with Government," Parekura Horomia said.

"This will not only benefit Mäori children, but benefit all New Zealanders as overall education standards rise."
