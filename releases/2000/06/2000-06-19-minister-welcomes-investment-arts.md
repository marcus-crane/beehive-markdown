Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard, said today's funding announcement by Creative New Zealand was good news for New Zealand arts and artists.

Creative New Zealand said today that the $20 million funding injection it received from the Government would allow it to focus on three key initiatives that had long-term benefits for the cultural sector.

In the first year of its three-year strategy, Creative New Zealand will focus on:

„h A Future Strengths strategy to support the professional arts infrastructure, with $3.2 million funding in its first year

„h A Seriously Maori strategy to benefit Maori artists, iwi and Maori authorities and to profile Maori arts nationwide, with $1.7 million funding in its first year

„h A Regional Strengths strategy to support larger arts initiatives spanning district boundaries, with $510,000 funding in its first year.

"The funding will help Creative New Zealand to stabilise professional arts organisations, boost Maori arts, individual artists and tours in the regions over the next three years," she said.

A Fellowships scheme will be launched later this year to acknowledge the role and contribution of individual artists and provide opportunities for them to practise their art over a sustained period of time.

The Government's $20 million cash injection was a one-off lump sum to be spread over the next three years.

It was designed to help the national arts development organisation to enter into longer term funding arrangements with major arts organisations.

"Once this happens, organisations will be in a better position to take greater artistic risks and push boundaries, something that is crucial if our arts are to continue developing in new and exciting directions," said Judith Tizard.
