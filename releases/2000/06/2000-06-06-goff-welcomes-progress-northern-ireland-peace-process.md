Foreign Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the news that the Northern Ireland peace process is back on track.

"I congratulate the political leaders of Northern Ireland and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom on what has been achieved. It has taken courage and determination from the leaders on all sides to end the stalemate.

"When I was in Northern Ireland last month there was a strong public mood and widespread hope for moving the peace process forward and the restoration of the Northern Ireland Government.

"There are extensive historical and personal links between both parts of Ireland and New Zealand. New Zealanders too have a keen interest in seeing the establishment of a lasting peace between the communities of the North.

"The restoration of the devolved government and the complexity of issues that had to be addressed to achieve it, particularly in respect of arms decommissioning, represent a huge achievement," Mr Goff concluded.
