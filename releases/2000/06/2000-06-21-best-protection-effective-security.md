Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has cautioned dairy owners from arming themselves against potential robbers.

George Hawkins' comments follow newspaper reports that an Indian Central Association spokesperson has asked that dairy owners be issued with limited firearms licences for protection and self-defence.

George Hawkins is asking the Police to meet with the Indian Central Association to promote ways to minimise the risk of robbery and to ensure that its dairy owner members are aware of effective security measures.

George Hawkins said such security measures include installing effective alarms, having at least two people present during open hours, having immediate access to a phone with a pre-set 111 number.

Other measures can include ensuring a wide counter with limited access to maintain a space between the dairy owner and any potential offender.

"I must caution dairy owners from arming themselves with firearms. To interact with robbers in this way does not add to one's longevity.

"Dairy owners must realise that neither the Police nor the general public carry firearms around at the ready. I would advise dairy owners that they should not either.

"I also advise dairy owners to take any concerns that they may have about security to the attention of their local police," George Hawkins said.
