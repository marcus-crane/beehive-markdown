Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said a Police operation that clamped down on truants could be considered by other districts.

Counties Manukau Police has found Operation Straight and Narrow, which clamped down on truants in Papatoetoe and Otahuhu, coincided with a daytime reduction in burglaries.

The Police believe this reduction in burglaries was as a direct result of this operation.

Over a three week period, 200 truants were picked up by Police. Most were taken back to school. Some truants were fingerprinted. A number of other truants were already known to Police.

Police have received phone calls and letters of support from parents and caregivers, many of whom did not know their child was truant from school.

Other agencies that took part in Operation Straight and Narrow included local schools, Ministry of Education and truancy officers.

George Hawkins said the results show a number of truants are likely to be responsible for a percentage of daytime household burglaries.

"Operation Straight and Narrow has no doubt sent a signal to truants that should they break the law they will be caught.

"I want to congratulate Counties Manukau Police for the success of Operation Straight and Narrow.

"It is my belief that many young people will be steered away from a life of crime should this type of operation become a regular exercise," George Hawkins said.
