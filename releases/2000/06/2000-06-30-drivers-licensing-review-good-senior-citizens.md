The Minister for Senior Citizens, Lianne Dalziel, welcomes today's announcement that the review into the cost and management of the driver licensing regime will look at issues raised by older New Zealanders.

"I am extremely pleased that my colleague Mark Gosche, the Minister of Transport, has included in his review aspects of the regime and how they affect senior citizens," Lianne Dalziel said.

"I have attended numerous Grey Power and Age Concern meetings all over the country in the last few months and at each meeting have been told that the current regime is not fair on older drivers.

"Some older drivers have been given driving tests in areas they wouldn't normally drive. For example, some rural drivers have been given tests in busy cities," the Minister said.

"I have been getting the message from older drivers around the country that the new licensing system has not been sensitive to their needs," Lianne Dalziel said.

The review is expected to be completed by November 2000.
