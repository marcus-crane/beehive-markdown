Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson today released the report of the Ministerial Inquiry into the Electricity Industry.

The report was formally delivered to Mr Hodgson yesterday.

¡§The inquiry panel has recommended a comprehensive and principle-driven approach to improving the efficiency and fairness of the electricity market¡¨, Mr Hodgson said. ¡§I am particularly pleased to see a focus on the needs of consumers, including through majority representation of independent members on the proposed new single market governance board.

¡§The panel also recommends measures to improve demand-side participation and energy efficiency. I welcome these and the other proposals as promising innovative ways forward for the electricity industry.

¡§My sincere thanks go to Hon David Caygill and the other panel members, Dr Susan Wakefield and Mr Stephen Kelly for the quality of the work they have undertaken in a short time. They considered 477written submissions and held three weeks of hearings in five centres. The panel also informed itself of the approaches to electricity governance and regulation in other jurisdictions. The extent of the panel¡¦s work has led directly to the very well-considered report I am releasing today.

¡§The Government will now carefully consider all the panel¡¦s recommendations. I expect to be able to announce decisions within the next six to seven weeks. Legislation is likely, and I expect to introduce this in October¡¨.

A summary of the report's recommendations is attached.

Ministerial Inquiry into the Electricity Industry - main recommendations

Wholesale market

athe governance framework for the physical wholesale market should be strengthened and made mandatory, with mechanisms to ensure that:

\* the views of all stakeholders, including consumers, are taken into account;

\* competition is enhanced wherever possible, and where it isn¡¦t possible, that outcomes mirror those that would arise if the market were competitive; and  
\* demand side participation is enhanced;

bthe current governance bodies (NZEM , MARIA and MACQs ) should be replaced by a new single market structure with the following key features:  
\* the board of the structure should be elected by stakeholders and comprise a  
majority of members independent of the industry;

\* membership of this structure should be compulsory for generators, distributors, retailers and Transpower;

\* the structure should operate under Government-agreed guiding principles and include robust mechanisms for self-regulation; and

\* service provision to the market should be contestable;

cthe Government should invite the industry to put these new arrangements in place within 12 months; if industry participants fail to commit to the required work, the Government should then legislate for regulatory powers to put the structure in place;

donce the new structure is in place, adoption of a real time wholesale market should be progressed as a priority;

ethe market system operator should publish projections of system adequacy;

Transmission

fTranspower¡¦s principal objectives should be to achieve a reasonable and transparent balance between a fair return to the taxpayer and energy policy objectives (including efficiency);

gTranspower¡¦s specific objectives should include:  
\* providing services agreed with users;

\* making its services contestable wherever possible;

\* pricing its services in line with principles determined by the Government, and, subject to those principles, according to a pricing methodology determined by the market on the basis of user-pays wherever possible;

\* pricing of new and replacement investment to provide:

\- grid users with strong incentives to identify least-cost investment options, including energy efficiency and demand management options; and  
\- clear location signals;

\* allocating sunk costs in a way that minimises distortions to the use of new and existing grid assets;

htransmission charges should be enforceable on the same basis as other market rules;

iTranspower should be required to ensure that minimum standards to deal with grid constraints are met;

Distribution

jthe Commerce Commission should:  
\* be responsible for the content and enforcement of the information disclosure regulations and analysis of line company performance;

\* require recalculation of asset values and mandate future asset valuation methodologies;

\* be empowered to impose price control on individual distribution companies (and Transpower) for a maximum of five years; and

\* be given responsibility for developing criteria and thresholds upon which price control should be imposed;

k the Commerce Act should be amended to permit the imposition of CPI-x price control;

ldistribution companies that are majority owned by trusts and local bodies should be required to have their statements of corporate intent modelled on Transpower¡¦s;

mdistribution companies that are majority owned by trusts should be subject to the Local Government Official Information Act, the Public Finance Act and the Ombudsman Act;

Retail

nprotocols for switching consumers should be enforced by the new market board;

othe Government should invite the industry to establish an Electricity Ombudsman Scheme to apply to retail and distribution companies, including provision for the application of fines on companies and compensation for consumers;

pthe Government should allow the industry six months to establish the Scheme, after which the Government should look for other options to ensure that the industry has an appropriate focus;

quse of system agreements that take account of retailers¡¦ interests should be developed by the industry;

rarrangements should be introduced for consumers whose retailer becomes insolvent to be supplied by the ¡§incumbent¡¨ retailer;

sthe Government should require retailers to supply pre-paid meters at reasonable cost;

Energy efficiency/sustainability and the environment

tfixed charges should comprise no more than about 25 per cent of the typical household¡¦s electricity bill;

uthe Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority should monitor fixed charges and refer the matter to the Commerce Commission if this percentage is exceeded; and

vtransmission charges should be amended to promote co-generation.
