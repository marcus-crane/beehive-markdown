New Zealand has prohibited entry of known associates of coup leader George Speight, Foreign Minister, Phil Goff, announced today.

"We regard Speight and those involved in the coup as terrorists who have illegally attempted to seize power. As such, they will not be allowed entry into New Zealand.

"With Australia, New Zealand has already prohibited entry of Speight himself. This further action extends the prohibition to 85 persons including military officers, opportunists and other criminals involved in the hostage taking, together with their legal and financial backers.

"These people would be prevented from entering New Zealand under section 7(1)(f) of the Immigration Act 1987 which relates to those engaged in an act of terrorism outside New Zealand.

"These smart sanctions will ensure that those responsible for the coup face the consequences of their actions", Mr Goff concluded.
