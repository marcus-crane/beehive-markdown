Mäori and Pacific peoples will get special help to solve their own housing problems, says Housing Minister Mark Gosche.

He said $21.6 million had been allocated over the next four years to establish a pilot in six Special Housing Action Zones that would be located in both rural and urban areas.

A cash injection into Housing Corporation New Zealand for additional loan finance will fund the pilot with $2.135 million in Year One, $3.900 million in Year Two, $5.8 million in Year Three and $7 million in Year Four. Additionally there will be funding of $0.7 million annually for capacity building and service delivery by community organisations.

"I am convinced that ensuring affordable, appropriate and secure housing is available to those in need is crucial to closing the gaps and improving the housing situation of Maori and Pacific peoples.

"Special Housing Action Zones are designed to concentrate resources and effort to alleviate housing need in areas that are particularly badly affected. Housing agencies will work closely with local communities to develop housing initiatives that specifically reflect the needs of that area.

"Our housing policy must have a regional focus to ensure communities can plan, and deliver housing to their own people," Mr Gosche said.

Over the four years of the scheme, a number of different projects will be undertaken in each zone guaranteeing a diverse and receptive approach to meeting housing needs. It will also increase the quality and supply of houses in these areas.

Targeted zones are yet to be identified, but they will be selected on the basis of greatest need amongst Maori and Pacific peoples.

"We need to take a creative and dynamic approach to solving the severe housing need suffered by many of our communities. The Government is keen to work closely with organisations and people dedicated to improving the outcome for all New Zealanders," Mr Gosche said.
