The Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Auckland issues, Judith Tizard, has welcomed Transfund's announcement that it is investing $170.8 million this year in the region's roading networks and passenger transport services.

"This is excellent news for Aucklanders – it reflects Transfund's commitment to providing transport solutions to the nation's fastest growing and most heavily populated region. It also reflects the Government's commitment to funding public transport," said Ms Tizard.

"Key projects such as the design work of the Auckland North Shore busway will be funded as a result of this investment. With Auckland traffic continuing to increase by between three and six per cent each year, the region clearly has severe transport problems. This money will go some way to helping relieve those problems.

"Transfund's investment in Auckland is an acknowledgment of the region's growth and the ever increasing demands being placed on its existing infrastructure," she said.

The funding is in addition to the $152 million national road safety package recently announced by the Government.

Auckland's transport needs will get a further boost with the introduction of patronage funding, highlighted in a pre-Budget Government announcement.

That system will give councils the certainty that if they can increase the number of passengers on their buses, trains or ferries then the Government will increase their funding to match.

"We still have a lot more to do, but this is a great start," said Judith Tizard.
