The Ministry of Youth Affairs will receive an extra $180,000 to expand the Youth Services Corps programme, Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré announced today. (Friday June 23)

The extra money will fund four additional programmes in two locations, Auckland and Rotorua, Laila Harré said.

The Youth Service Corps is a 20-week youth development programme that caters for16 to 20 year olds who have been registered as unemployed for 13 weeks or more or identified as at risk of long-term unemployment.

Last year 18 projects operated, each with 10 members.

"Rather than trying to match young people to jobs they may not be suited to, this programme works on increasing self-esteem, motivation and improving the basic skills all young people need to be successful in training or employment," Laila Harré said.

"Trust groups administering the Youth Service Corps on behalf of the Ministry of Youth Affairs are community-focused and tailor activities to meet the needs of the young people they are working with.

"The results speak for themselves. The Youth Service Corps has a 76% success rate for members moving into employment and other training within six months of completing a programme."

The scheme combines community projects with practical education and challenging recreation activities.

In both Auckland and Rotorua Youth Service Corps members will, among other things, help implement sport and fitness programmes in local schools.

Education activities include CV preparation, work experience placements and leadership training. Participants also gain NZQA units of learning while on the course.
