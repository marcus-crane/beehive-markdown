New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Chile will be career diplomat Richard Mann, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Chile is our longest-standing in Latin America, with diplomatic ties first established in 1972,” Mr Goff said.

“Chile is one of the most open economies in Latin America, and it has many similarities with New Zealand. Two-way trade is significant, and New Zealand companies maintain strong investment interests.

“New Zealand and Chile cooperate in a wide range of multilateral forums on issues such as the Law of the Sea, whaling, nuclear disarmament, Antarctica, and agricultural trade. We are members of APEC, the Cairns Group, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC), the Pacific basin Economic Council (PBEC), the East Asia Latin America Forum (EALAF), and the Valdivia Group,” Mr Goff said.

“These links reinforce the importance of our diplomatic ties with Santiago. With the momentum gathered during the Prime Minister’s visit to Chile in March, relations between New Zealand and Chile look set to move to a new level.”

Mr Mann is an experienced diplomat who joined the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 1981. He has previously been posted to Santiago, to Suva, and most recently to Bangkok, where he was Deputy Head of Mission. He is currently Deputy Director and Senior Negotiator in the Ministry’s Trade Negotiations Division.

Mr Mann will take up the position in October, replacing David McKee, who is returning to Wellington.
