Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey is hailing the success of New Zealand's first Children's Day and signalling Government support for it to become an annual event.

The inaugural Children's Day was held yesterday and promoted the theme of spending time with children. Many thousands of New Zealanders were involved in over 200 specially-organised events across the country. Mr Maharey said the day was an important opportunity to honour, treasure and celebrate children and is set to become a permanent feature on our calendars.

"Our first Children's Day was a stunning success.

"Thousands of Kiwis took the time to focus on their kids. Events ranged from sandcastle building at Timaru's Caroline Bay, through to the special open day for children at the Palmerston North YMCA I attended in my electorate and a well-attended special commerative service in honour of the victims of child abuse at Auckland's St Matthew-in-the-city.

"The Government supports Children's Day becoming an annual event. Planning is already underway for Children's Day next year which will be held on Sunday 28 October.

"Thanks needs to go to the many individuals and organisations who made the day such a success. Children’s Day 2000 was jointly organised by Child, Youth and Family, Barnardos and the Office of the Commissioner for Children at a national level. Locally a wide range of individuals and organisations, including grass roots organisations, local councils, businesses, schools, and cultural and religious groups organised a large number of events to commemorate the day.

"Recently many high profile cases of child abuse have gained considerable media attention. Children's Day was a chance to remember the victims of violence and also to promote positive parenting," Steve Maharey said.
