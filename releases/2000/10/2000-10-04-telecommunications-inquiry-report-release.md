Communications Minister Paul Swain has today released the report from the ministerial inquiry into telecommunications.

Paul Swain thanked inquiry leader Hugh Fletcher and his team – Cathie Harrison and Alan Asher – for the work they put into the report.

"The inquiry team has put in seven months of intense work on this document," he said.

"During that time the team released an issues paper, took submissions on the issues paper, issued a draft report and sought submissions on that. They took further public comments on the submissions and undertook rounds of public hearings. It has been a thorough consultative process and I welcome the input made by the industry.

"It is now over to the government to decide what our response will be.

"I intend making that response before Christmas, and I want to get any necessary legislative changes under way by then as well," Paul Swain said
