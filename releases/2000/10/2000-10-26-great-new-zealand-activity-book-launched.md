The Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton and Wellington illustrator Fifi Colston today launched the "Great New Zealand Activity Book" at Wellington Children's Hospital.

The book has been published in time for National Children's Day (Sunday 29th October) and 35,000 copies will be distributed to hospitals around the country.

"This is a wonderful project," Mark Burton said.

"Fifi Colston and the New Zealand Illustrators Guild, along with a number of New Zealand's leading children's authors, generously donated their time to create the book.

"They approached Internal Affairs for assistance in meeting the printing costs. After reviewing the project, I was delighted to approve a one-off grant from my ministerial discretionary fund.

"The initial print run will provide a copy of the book for every child who has to spend time in hospital over the next twelve months.

"A hospital stay – no matter how short or long - can be a difficult experience for any child. This Activity Book will play a small but important role in making that stay a little more enjoyable," Mark Burton said.
