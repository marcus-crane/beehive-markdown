Hong Kong’s Chief Secretary for Administration, Anson Chan, will visit New Zealand between 6 and 10 November 2000, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Mrs Chan will hold discussions with the Prime Minister and senior Ministers. She will also meet civic leaders and senior members of the New Zealand business community.

"I am delighted that Mrs Chan, who heads Hong Kong’s civil service and is ranked second to Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa, will visit New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"Hong Kong is vitally important to New Zealand's economic interests. It is our seventh largest export market and our sixth largest source of foreign direct investment. Hong Kong’s ongoing economic and political stability is also valuable to our region.

"New Zealand is a high quality education market for foreign students and a source of hi-tech industries and environmentally friendly initiatives.

"Above all, New Zealand offers great commercial and investment opportunities for Hong Kong. Her visit to New Zealand is a chance for Mrs Chan and her accompanying business delegation to see what we can offer in each of these areas," Helen Clark said.

Mrs Chan’s programme covers Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.
