A peace activist, a former soldier and a journalist will be amongst the new faces on the Public Advisory Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control (PACDAC) when it next meets in November.

Disarmament Minister Matt Robson and Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced the new members of the Committee today.

The Committee's input will add to advice already available through officials and non-governmental organisations, the Ministers say.

The Committee makes recommendations also on applications for funding from the Peace and Disarmament Education Trust, set up with funding from the Rainbow Warrior compensation.

The new members of the Committee are:

\* Cameron Bennett of Auckland, journalist and winner in 1997 of the New Zealand media Peace award;  
\* Dr Kate Dewes of Christchurch, who has worked long with New Zealand and international NGOs. Dr Dewes was a member of PACDAC from 1987-90;  
\* Dr John Harré of Auckland, who brings a broad understanding of Pacific Island, education and regional interests;  
\* Dr John Henderson of Wellington, who worked with Prime Ministers in Wellington from 1985 to 1989 and now teaches at Canterbury University;  
\* Brigadier Roger Mortlock of Ohope, who served with the New Zealand Army from 1966 to 1999, from Vietnam to Bougainville.  
Two members have been reappointed for a second three-year term:

\* Prof Ann Trotter of Wellington, who has taught international relations at Otago University, and also in London, Singapore and Tokyo  
\* Stuart McMillan of Christchurch, international affairs commentator and researcher.  
Graham Harding of Papakowhai continues in his full term of appointment to March 2001.  
The Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control chairs the Committee, which was established under the 1987 New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act.

The Committee meets several times a year, and is assisted by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Internal Affairs.
