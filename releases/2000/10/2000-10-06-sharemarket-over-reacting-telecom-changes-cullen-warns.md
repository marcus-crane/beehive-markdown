Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today that the sharemarket seemed to  
be over-reacting to possible regulatory changes in the telecommunications sector.  
He was referring to the recent loss of value on Telecom shares.  
Dr Cullen said Communications Minister Paul Swain had made it very clear  
that the recommendations of the Telecommunications Inquiry were just that  
and by no means represented the final views the Government would adopt.  
"In particular Mr Swain has always been sceptical about the value of  
industry specific regulation, rather preferring to look at using the  
Commerce Commission as a vehicle for any regulatory changes which may be  
approved.

"There seems to be some perception the Government is likely to put in place  
some form of heavy handed regime in this area.  
"A conclusion the markets ought to be drawing from the electricity  
decisions announced this week is that the present Government does not adopt  
unnecessarily heavy regulatory approaches and it is very unlikely we would  
do so with respect to telecommunications," Dr Cullen said.
