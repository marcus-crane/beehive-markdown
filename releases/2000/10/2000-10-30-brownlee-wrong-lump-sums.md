Brownlee wrong on lump sums

National ACC spokesperson Gerry Brownlee has got his facts wrong about the new lump sum compensation scheme introduced as part of the Injury Prevention & Rehabilitation Bill today said Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen.

"Mr Brownlee should perhaps take a better look at the Bill, before indulging in scaremongering tactics by claiming we have opened the floodgates for lump sum payments for mental injury and raising the spectre of multiple payments totalling more than $100,000.

"If he had, he would see that lump sums are limited to $100,000 based on whole person impairment which means that no matter how severe the injuries - whether mental or physical - nor how many times someone is injured, they cannot receive more than $100,000 over the course of their life.

"As well, we have introduced lump sums for mental injury as a result of a physical injury or sexual abuse - exactly the same as the Independence Allowance is paid now. We are not introducing lump sums for pain or suffering or for work place stress, nor for witnessing a traumatic event.

"However, I have said that this Bill marks the second part of the Government's commitment to improve and modernise the injury prevention and rehabilitation and compensation scheme. We will continue to look at improvements to entitlements and coverage as the economy and the performance of ACC allows," said Dr Cullen.
