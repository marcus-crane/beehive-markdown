Saving lives and making New Zealand roads safer is the main aim of the 2010 Road Safety Strategy launched by Transport Minister Mark Gosche today.

"The strategy is about saving lives and making our roads safer for all New Zealanders," he said.

"Government cannot do this alone – we must work in partnership with New Zealanders everywhere."

"The strategy is about what we as a country want to do about road safety over the next ten years."

While the road toll has steadily decreased in recent years Mr Gosche said he wouldn't be applauding too loudly because New Zealand's road toll figures were still shocking.

"Since 1990 6,200 New Zealanders have been killed in car crashes on our roads.

New Zealand still lags behind developed countries whose roads are twice as safe as ours and we want to match their safety records."

"Before we commit to anything we want to hear from New Zealanders about how we are going to make our roads safer."

The first stage in the 2010 campaign is a nationwide consultation process taking place throughout the country during October and November.

"It recognises that Government must work in partnership with communities throughout the country. We want New Zealanders talking about road safety and how we can end the pointless trauma on our roads."

The 2010 strategy includes a range of options for road users to consider.

"We all need to consider what we want our strategy to look like and how we are prepared to pay for it."

The proposals are not government policy but represent a list of options developed by the National Road Safety Committee based on years of research and experience.

"Now is the time for people to make their submissions on road safety so their views can be considered by government when developing New Zealand's strategy for the next ten years."
