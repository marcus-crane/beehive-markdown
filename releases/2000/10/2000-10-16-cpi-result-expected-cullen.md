CPI result in line with expectations - Cullen

"The September CPI result contains few surprises and is around market expectations," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The increase was dominated by petrol prices and the rise in the tobacco excise tax. They contributed more than half the quarterly movement.

"If both those influences are removed, the increase for the quarter becomes just 0.6 percent and the increase for the September year, 1.4 percent," Dr Cullen said.
