Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the establishment of government-funded study support centres throughout New Zealand would help to lift the educational achievement of thousands of primary school students.

Helen Clark was speaking at Wainoni School, in the Christchurch suburb of Aranui, where this afternoon she officially launched New Zealand's first government-funded study support centre.

Study support centres help senior primary students at risk of under-achievement to develop good study habits within a supportive, well-resourced environment.

"Study support centres are an excellent example of the type of proven, locally-driven initiative which the coalition is keen to support. In our first Budget we allocated $7.5 million for study support centres, which up until now have tended to be operated on a somewhat ad hoc basis.

"Wainoni School in Christchurch will receive $12,000 to run its study support centre for a year. It will cater for about thirty children – twenty per cent of the school's roll.

"I congratulate the efforts of Wainoni School principal Jack Morris QSM in setting up a homework centre at the school three years ago.

"These centres can make a big difference to the educational achievement of children attending low decile schools. Even by providing children with something to eat and drink after school, these centres can make all the difference to children's study habits.

"Government funding provides centres, like the one at Wainoni School, with more certainty, pays for qualified staff supervision, and will increase the information technology available to the students.

"The government is committed to resourcing study support centres throughout New Zealand.

"The Ministry of Education is currently in the process of working through more than 50 proposals for study support centres. Several hundred other schools and organisations are known to be considering applications," Helen Clark said.
