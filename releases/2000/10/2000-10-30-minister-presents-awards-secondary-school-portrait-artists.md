Education Minister Trevor Mallard today presented three secondary school artists with awards for portraits.

The competition was organised by the Friends of the National Portrait Gallery.

"I would say that portraiture is an extremely difficult form of art. You certainly would not get that impression if you look at the high quality of the work on display at the National Portrait Gallery," Trevor Mallard said.

The three prize winners were:

1stDavid Angus, Wellington College  
2ndStella Rutherford, Opononi Area School  
3rdBonnie Fraser, Massey High School, Auckland

The Minister also acknowledged the work of two highly commended students. They were:

\* Sarah Anderson, Hamilton Girls' High School  
\* Richard Trieu, Newlands College, Wellington

Trevor Mallard described the prize-winning entries and the entire exhibition as a tribute to artwork in schools

"The extraordinary array of work on display here tonight will surprise and delight you – and reassure any of you who doubted the ability of our schools to push students towards outstanding achievements.

"Most of all, the exhibition is a tribute to the skills, talents and perseverance of young artists emerging from our schools."

Students from about 100 secondary schools took part in the competition. The final exhibition includes work from about 40 schools and will be on display in Wellington for three weeks.
