The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Bay of Plenty Conservancy will be spending an extra $75,375 this year on protecting the region’s biodiversity as a result of the Government's Biodiversity funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

She said the extra funding was a welcome contribution to the conservation needs of the Bay of Plenty and its surroundings.

"The Tuhua (Mayor Island) rat and cat eradication, which was the major Bay of Plenty biodiversity funding project for 2000/2001 at $31,500, has been completed to budget and deadline, " said Ms Lee.

"Early monitoring suggests that the operation has been a success. If long term checks confirm this, it will have been one of the largest island eradication projects in the country and the first to simultaneously eradicate kiore, Norway rats and cats."

She said the Tuhua eradication project was the start of an exciting series of projects that would help to restore biodiversity to the Bay of Plenty.

"Island pest eradication projects are planned for Moutohora (Whale Island) and Mokoia Island as well, as a result of the additional biodiversity funding," Ms Lee said.
