Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard said the New Zealand Paralympian Team had done the country proud.

Trevor Mallard spent the weekend in Sydney watching the final two days of competition.

"These games have reinforced to the World that Paralympians are top class athletes who provide their fans with a sporting spectacle equal to any other top class event," Trevor Mallard said.

"With 18 medals over a wide range of sport, the New Zealand Team has performed superbly. I congratulate them on their success and acknowledge the hard work and training that goes into achieving such results.

"There also seems to have been more interest from the general public in this team and the sports which they competed in. I hope that this will result in more sponsor support for the athletes and a greater profile within the New Zealand media.

"The New Zealand public will be able to demonstrate their support at a welcome home ceremony at Auckland airport tomorrow afternoon. I hope as many people as possible will take the opportunity to personally congratulate the team members," Trevor Mallard said.
