Transport Minister Mark Gosche today announced he has made six appointments to the board of Transit New Zealand.

Sir Tipene O'Regan was the founding Chairperson of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission in 1990. He is a company director and academic historian.

"And I want especially to acknowledge the contribution the retiring Board members, Robert Browne (Chairperson), Robert Thompson (Deputy Chairperson), David Dew, Nicola Shadbolt and Bill Taylor, have made to the State highway sector programme" said Mr Gosche.

The other new board members are:

· Mike Williams, an information technology consultant

· Robin Ayling, a self employed consultant in the transport and tourism industries

David Stubbs and Janice Wright will be Transit's representatives on the board of Transfund.

All appointments take effect from 1 November.
