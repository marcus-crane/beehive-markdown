A six-million dollar package of improvements to the student loans and allowances processing system, was announced this afternoon by Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey. Specific performance targets for the Department of Work and Income (DWI) to achieve this coming summer were also released.

Following problems with loans processing earlier this year which badly affected students and tertiary providers, Mr Maharey commissioned an independent evaluation of the system to determine what caused the delays and what improvements need to be made in time for the next academic year.

The package of decisions now agreed to by the Cabinet provides funding to improve staffing levels and waiting times on the Student Services 0800 phone line and to provide limited networked on-campus services to students at 34 campus locations nationwide.

Mr Maharey said that previous National government had failed to ensure DWI was ready and properly resourced to cope with student loans processing. The Government has now given DWI the appropriate level of resourcing to ensure a greatly improved service and is expecting that students will get their loans on-time.

"The new Government inherited a system which was clearly not ready for the bulge of loan applications when they occurred at the start of the year. The additional funding I have had to seek from Cabinet is testament to the neglectful attitude that National took towards the transfer of loans administration.

"DWI will be held accountable for its performance this summer. While I expect that there will be individual cases of processing delay which will be put right immediately, I do not expect to see the type of widespread systemic failure that the Government inherited this past summer.

"The improvements package announced today contains measures aimed at:  
\* building a strong working relationship with stakeholder groups, including students' associations and tertiary providers;

\* improving all communications to students from DWI about their loan;

\* providing clear and unambiguous eligibility policy;

\* improving software to support communication between providers and DWI;

\* better managing loan applications at the National Student Centre, including during periods of peak demand; and

\* introducing an early identification system which alerts DWI staff to applications which are behind targeted processing time.

"Limited, networked, on-campus support will be provided on the 34 major campuses nationwide. These staff will be able to provide face-to-face assistance to students who have specific information needs, enquire on the status of students' applications and complete simple transactions such as a change of address or bank account details.

"Major improvements have been made to the 0800 Student Services information line and a revamped internet site will go live at the end of this month. Student waiting times will be dramatically reduced and loan applications on line will be the simplest and quickest way to apply for a loan.

"The Government is expecting to see a much higher standard of service to students and for institutions to get access to tuition fee income in good time. Students can expect the system to be responsive, but they also have a responsibility to apply early and to supply all the documentation and information required to complete their transaction.

"DWI has benefited considerably by working closely with a tertiary sector reference group, comprising both student and provider representatives. I am pleased that the changes that DWI is implementing will cement in a strong on-going working partnership," Steve Maharey said.
