"The increase in the ANZ job ads series over September indicates that the  
slough which afflicted the economy in the June quarter will be  
short-lived," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.  
"The rise in the large Auckland market is particularly encouraging, coming  
as it does after eight months of decline.  
"But the real strength is in provincial and export New Zealand. Job ads in  
Christchurch are up 35.1 percent on the same month last year; Otago is 23.3  
percent up; Hawkes Bay, 19 percent; the Waikato, 11.3 percent, and the  
Manawatu, 10.4 percent.  
"The improving jobs data is consistent with the retail trade figures for  
August which also showed growth," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said.
