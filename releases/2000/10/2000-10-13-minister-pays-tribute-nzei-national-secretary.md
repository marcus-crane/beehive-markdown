Education Minister Trevor Mallard today paid tribute to NZEI national secretary Joanna Beresford who will step down from her position early next year.

"Joanna has made a major contribution to education policy and worked tirelessly to promote a quality and equitable education system," Trevor Mallard.

"While the core job of unions is to protect the rights of their members, I have always been impressed by the efforts of the NZEI to look at the wider picture. Under Joanna's administration, it has been an organisation that has worked hard for a system whereby all New Zealand children can have access to a decent education.

"I believe that the quality of a teacher is the key factor within a school which determines the quality of learning.

"I have always been heartened that people like Joanna have been so willing to work with me to enhance quality teaching and learning and I have appreciated the open and frank discussions which we have engaged in.

"I wish her well, in whatever she chooses to pursue next," Trevor Mallard said.
