The Government is to second a dedicated project worker to Banks Peninsula's successful WorkPeninsula programme, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said this afternoon.

WorkPeninsula is a community-based employment programme working in the Lyttelton, Akaroa and Peninsula communities. Operated by the Work Peninsula Charitable Trust, the programme is supported by the Trust Bank Community Trust, The Tindall Foundation, the Lyttelton Port Company, Stark Bros Lyttelton and the Department of Work and Income (DWI). Shell Oil provided start-up assistance for the programme. A DWI work broker has been seconded to WorkPeninsula for the past six months.

Speaking at a relaunch celebration held in Lyttelton this afternoon, Mr Maharey said the relationship between DWI and WorkPeninsula had been so successful that Work and Income will fund the dedicated project worker for a further six months, and reimburse the Trust for the six month salary costs it had already incurred.

"WorkPeninsula has had real success in finding employment and training opportunities for job seekers on the Peninsula.

"The programme is an excellent example of the type of partnership between the community, government agencies and the private sector which the Government wants to promote.

"Partnerships with business and the local community are essential if we are to provide relevant and focussed training which prepares people for work and places them into real jobs.

"In many ways WorkPeninsula provides a successful locally-focused, flexible model which would work well in other communities across New Zealand," Steve Maharey said.
