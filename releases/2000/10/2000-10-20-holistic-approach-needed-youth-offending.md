The Minister of Maori Affairs the Hon Parekura Horomia said an holistic approach is needed when dealing with young offenders – services need to incorporate education and training, life-skills and personal health and safety. The Minister made the comments when he released the report Whanake Rangatahi. He said Whanake Rangatahi can mean the development of youth and the report looked specifically at programmes and services to address Maori Youth offending.

Mr Horomia said the report asked young people about their views on offending. "It is also very timely given recent statstics that show 25% of boys commit crimes before they are 19 and that if Maori and Pacific Islands people continue to be jailed at the current rate, then four new prisons will need to be built by 2013."The Minister of Maori Affairs said government agencies must adopt an integrated and holistic approach to services such as education and training, employment, health and justice sector services. He said the report also identified gaps in the current youth justice sector services, as well as a lack of information for young people about the available services.

"These include mental health services specifically for Maori, counselling services, direct assistance and support for whanau and young people in crisis, and alternative education opportunities for young people outside of schools." Mr Horomia said while it is beneficial to look at overseas models and solutions, it is important not to overlook Maori community-level solutions. "Maori have developed and are delivering tikanga-based programmes that focus on various aspects of a young person's life, their whanau and peer-group environment, educational achievement and other factors."Mr Horomia said the findings of this report will contribute to an integrated strategy focusing on reducing offending by Maori and Pacific Youth, which is due to be reported to Cabinet next month.

"It is also important for people to realise that this is part of Closing the Gaps and Capacity Building and that work should not wait until the next report. The work needs to be done and the Labour-Alliance government is trying to create opportunities for communities to develop and build their own solutions."
