Moody's reconfirmation of our Aa2 foreign currency ceiling and judgement that New Zealand's monetary and fiscal policies are both on a "sound footing" were today welcomed by Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

He said Moody's assessment of the country's sovereign risk rating was based firmly on its perception that "the objective of maintaining a surplus position over the business cycle remains well-anchored in the policy framework."

"That amounts to a vote of confidence in the Government's fiscal discipline," Dr Cullen said.

"Moody's rightly expresses concern at our low national savings levels and at our weak external accounts. But the Government has acknowledged these structural problems and put in place a strategy to address them."

Dr Cullen also welcomed Moody's comments on the Government's plans to partially prefund future superannuation costs.

"Moody's is correct that the proposed scheme relies on the public sector saving rather than creating incentives to increase the household savings rate.

"However I have already signalled that the Government is working on changes to make private superannuation savings more attractive," Dr Cullen said.
