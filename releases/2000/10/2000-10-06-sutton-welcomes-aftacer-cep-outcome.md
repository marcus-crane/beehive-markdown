Trade Negotiations Minister, Jim Sutton, today welcomed the decision of  
ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) and CER Ministers to  
instruct officials to draw up recommendations on how to achieve a Closer  
Economic Partnership (CEP) between the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) andCER.  
At their annual meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on 6 October Ministers  
considered the report of the High Level Task Force established to consider an AFTA-CER linkage. Ministers expressed appreciation for the excellent work of the Task Force and agreed that officials draw upon its conclusions to develop recommendations on a CEP linking the two regions.

"This decision makes good progress" said the Minister. "It takes what was  
a non-Governmental process and makes it inter-Governmental. Officials will  
report to Ministers within a year with recommendations on the actual shape  
of a CEP between AFTA and CER. Ministers will then decide on how to  
proceed".

The Task Force report ? "The Angkor Agenda" ? released in Chiang Mai,  
establishes a specific direction for further work by officials. The report  
sets a goal of a comprehensive and outward looking liberalisation covering  
all goods, services and investment. Achieving this goal would lead to the  
elimination of all forms of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in  
goods and services well within the APEC timeframes of 2010/2020.  
Mr Sutton noted that the Angkor Agenda brings trade and development  
together through calling for measures to assist the newer members of ASEAN  
participate successfully in trade and investment with CER.

"I am impressed at the pace at which this process has moved" Mr Sutton  
commented. "An AFTA/CER CEP was not on the table even a year and a half  
ago. Now we have a work process endorsed by Ministers with a report back  
required in only one year. The last GATT Uruguay Round negotiations took  
nearly 13 years to complete. CER itself took 7 years to pull together".  
"We will also ensure that the officials' process that has just been  
launched will be accompanied by the same type of domestic consultations as  
we have conducted for the CEP with Singapore. These consultations will  
have a direct bearing on the New Zealand negotiating mandate which I will  
seek from Cabinet in due course", concluded the Minister.

THE FIFTH CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE  
ASEAN ECONOMIC MINISTERS AND  
MINISTERS OF THE CER  
6 October 2000, Chiang Mai, Thailand  
JOINT PRESS STATEMENT

1\. The ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) and the Ministers from the Closer  
Economic Relations (CER) held their consultations on 6 October 2000 in  
Chiang Mai, Thailand. The Consultations was co-chaired by H.E. Dr. Supachai  
Panitchpakdi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce of Thailand,  
Hon. Mr Mark Vaile, Minister for Trade of Australia and Hon. Mr. Jim  
Sutton, Minister for Trade Negotiations of New Zealand.

FEASIBILITY STUDY ON THE AFTA-CER FREE TRADE AREA  
2\. At their last consultations in October 1999 in Singapore, the AEM and  
CER Ministers had established a High Level Task Force to look into the  
feasibility of an AFTA-CER free trade area. The Task Force had met three  
times during the course of the year to conduct the study and to prepare  
their recommendations to the Ministers.

3\. Mr Cesar E. A. Virata, Chairman of the High Level Task Force on the  
AFTA-CER Free Trade Area, was on hand to present the report and  
recommendations to the Ministers. The Task Force recommended that  
establishing a free trade area between AFTA and CER was not only feasible  
but also advisable. An AFTA-CER FTA will double each region's GDP to a  
combined value of around US$ 1 trillion. Estimates suggest that the  
proposed FTA will bring about a net discounted benefit of about US$ 48  
billion in additional GDP to the region up to the year 2020. As a result  
the Task Force proposed the following principles for the AFTA-CER FTA:

a) The AFTA-CER FTA would represent a separate arrangement which  
would be comprehensive, covering all goods, services, and  
investments and would lead to the elimination of all forms of  
tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services;

b) The pace of liberalization within the AFTA-CER FTA should proceed  
faster than that agreed within APEC. The AFTA-CER FTA would not  
normally go beyond the pace of liberalization which AFTA has  
already agreed for ASEAN members, i.e. elimination of tariffs for  
manufactured goods by 2010 for ASEAN-6 and 2015 for the four  
newer members, with some flexibility. CER would progressively  
reduce tariffs for ASEAN from the conclusion of negotiations,  
reaching free trade by 2005;

c) The proposed FTA should provide development assistance in the  
form of capacity-building measures and technical assistance and  
the adoption of a longer time-frame for the newer members of  
ASEAN; and

d) The AFTA-CER FTA would be open to accession by any other country  
or regional grouping.

4\. The Task Force also recommended that Ministers undertake the necessary  
steps toward the establishment of the proposed AFTA-CER FTA at the earliest  
possible time. The Report of the High Level Task Force on the AFTA-CER  
Free Trade Area is available at: http://www.aseansec.org.

5\. The Ministers expressed their appreciation to Mr Cesar Virata and the  
Members of the Task Force and commended them on their report.

6\. The Ministers acknowledged that enhanced AFTA-CER relations would  
strengthen the international bargaining position of both regions and send a  
positive signal to investors of both regions' commitment to continuing  
liberalisation. The Ministers noted the emerging challenges posed by  
globalisation, the proliferation of regional trading arrangements around  
the world and competition from other countries and regions. The Ministers  
were of the view that there was a need to work on the recommendations of  
the Task Force to sustain the momentum that has been generated by itsreport.

7\. In line with this objective, Ministers agreed to work towards a Closer  
Economic Partnership (CEP) which takes into account relevant  
recommendations of the Report and other issues relevant to the closer  
integration of ASEAN-CER countries.8. They, therefore, agreed that:

a) Senior Officials shall elaborate on the potentials and parameters  
of the CEP taking into account relevant recommendations of the  
Task Force, beginning next year;

b) In their discussions, particular attention should be placed on  
development assistance in the form of technical assistance and  
capacity building measures to ASEAN members in areas that have  
been proposed by the Task Force representatives from the New  
Members of ASEAN;

c) Capacity-building initiatives be undertaken on a number of items  
of export interest to ASEAN Members given some current trade  
issues concerning non-tariff barriers such as SPS and technical  
barriers to trade;

d) Senior Officials shall report on the outcome of their work to the 6th  
AEM-CER consultations in the year 2001; and

e) The ASEAN Secretariat be tasked to coordinate such work.  
PROGRESS IN AFTA-CER LINKAGE

9\. The Ministers noted the sustained economic recovery in the ASEAN  
region with both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and exports growing strongly.  
The Ministers welcomed the continued expansion of ASEAN-CER trade, which  
had grown to US $ 15.4 billion in 1999. The Ministers expressed  
satisfaction with the progress made during the past year in the AFTA-CER  
Linkage. These included completion of a number of projects under the ASEAN  
Consultative Committee on Standards and Quality (ACCSQ)-CER Action Plan,  
training on pre-entry tariff classification in January 2000, training  
provided on the WTO Valuation Agreement/Code for the four newer members of  
ASEAN and completion of the Mekong Freight Logistics Study. The Ministers  
noted that additional initiatives had been proposed for intellectual  
property, transport and competition policy and consumer protection.  
INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC ISSUES

10\. The Ministers exchanged views on international and regional economic  
issues of concern, including the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the  
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The Ministers agreed on the  
importance of accelerating the WTO accession process for Cambodia, Laos and  
Viet Nam. They agreed on the need for a balanced agenda and for the  
interests of developing countries to be taken into account in any new round  
of WTO negotiations. The Ministers commended Brunei Darussalam on its  
Chairmanship of APEC and expressed their strong support for the realization  
of the APEC 2000 theme of "Delivering to the Community", including Brunei  
Darussalam's initiative in Human Resources Development.
