Education Minister Trevor Mallard today paid tribute to excellence in teaching with the presentation of the AIMHI teachers' awards.

The awards were presented to 11 teachers from AIMHI schools.

"This is the first year of these peer awards. They are about teachers in some of our poorest secondary schools recognising the outstanding service of colleagues," Trevor Mallard said.

"Each year the AIMHI Forum will seek nominations for the award which will be presented at the AIMHI teachers' conference.

"Each occasion where we present awards for excellence creates an opportunity for public, tangible recognition of great successes in New Zealand education."

Teachers made their selection on the following criteria:

„h the teacher is recognised by teachers and students within their school as a person who has provided an excellent teaching environment for students for at least five years;  
„h the teacher has shared their skills and talents with other teachers in AIMHI schools;  
„h the teacher has shared their skills and talents with other teachers within the school;  
„h the teacher has significantly improved student achievement in their learning area.

"We will always value excellence," Trevor Mallard said.

"And while not every teacher can be the top teacher, we should always aspire towards a teaching profession in which we can be confident that every teacher is excellent.

"By encouraging teachers to share their talent and experiences, these awards complement that goal," Trevor Mallard said.
