Health Minister Annette King says this year's Commonwealth Fund International Symposium on Health Care Policy, beginning in Washington on Wednesday, should provide dynamic discussion of international views on quality health care and innovation.

Mrs King was leaving for Washington tonight to attend the symposium, and will return to New Zealand early next Monday. Director-General of Health Karen Poutasi and health adviser Stuart Bruce are also attending the symposium.

Mrs King, whose visit to Washington is being funded by the United States-based Commonwealth Fund, said she would take part with four overseas health ministers in a series of debates and panel discussions at the symposium. The other four ministers are United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala, UK Minister of State for Health John Denham, Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock, and Australian Health Minister Michael Wooldridge.

"There is no doubt that concerns about ensuring and improving the quality of health care are driving the health policy agendas in all developed countries," Mrs King said.

"New Zealand is certainly not alone in having to grapple with issues such as medical errors, access to health care and pharmaceuticals, patient expectations, the role of professional accountability and leadership, and the importance of health information systems in terms of improving quality."

Mrs King said there was often "a common theme" to what was happening in terms of health care in developed countries. "We can certainly learn from what other countries are doing, and I hope that other countries may be able to learn from some of the systems we have started to put into place in New Zealand this year. I feel privileged to be invited to take part in such a prestigious forum."

During the symposium Mrs King will discuss current quality issues and future directions in terms of New Zealand health care, and deliver a New Zealand policy perspective on the policy and quality implications of health information systems and infrastructure.
