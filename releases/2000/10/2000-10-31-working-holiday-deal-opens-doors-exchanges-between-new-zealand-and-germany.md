An agreement concluded this morning will allow more young New Zealanders and Germans to have working holidays in each other's country from 1 December, Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Immigration Lianne Dalziel said today.The agreement, handed over by visiting German Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke, is the first under a Cabinet decision earlier this year to double the quota of working holiday visas to 20,000."The working holiday scheme will build on the substantial connections that already exist between Germany and New Zealand.

It will also provide opportunities for New Zealanders to experience living and working in one of Europe's most populous and prosperous countries," Mr Goff and Ms Dalziel said."The scheme could assist with tourism both ways at a time when visitor numbers from Germany have only just started to pick up after having plateaued for several years. It will increase the opportunities for young Germans to visit New Zealand, and help to stimulate their interest in the country."The agreement could also assist the government's aim to attract high quality immigrants. A working holiday scheme can assist to attract immigrants with business and general skills, as some working holiday makers choose to settle here at the end of their stay, or may return later.

"The New Zealand/German working holiday scheme is the first to be concluded since the increase in places available. It is New Zealand’s tenth working holiday scheme overall. New Zealand is only the third country Germany has working holiday arrangements with, joining Australia and Japan."New Zealand is still negotiating similar schemes with Hong Kong and Italy. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are other countries we are keen to establish working holiday schemes with," the Ministers said.
