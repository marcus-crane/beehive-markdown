Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton says that Willie Jackson Alliance List MP has agreed not to make further comment on the Government policy regarding Treaty claims and petroleum at this time.

I have spoken to Willie today, and he understands the position, said Jim  
Anderton.

"We have an agreed Coalition process of working through any policy issues within the Government, and we will quietly work through any that emerge now", said Mr Anderton.

"Making back-bench press statements about what Cabinet did or did not agree, and what Ministers may or may not have signed up to, is not part of that process," he said.

Any further Alliance statements on this matter for the immediate future, will be made through the office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

On the policy questions, Mr Anderton observed that Cabinet colleague Paul Swain had earlier this week re-stated a carefully-discussed policy established by the Cabinet in April which aimed at setting a framework for historical Treaty issues. Mr Anderton said that it was critical to distinguish this from contemporary Treaty claims which were still subject to ongoing discussion and policy development, including wide consultation.

Mr Anderton said that he did not believe that Mr Swain had intended anything further than to make Government policy clear in relation to petroleum and historical Treaty claims. Certainly there should be no suggestion that this or any other Government would not respectfully consider any Tribunal recommendations.
