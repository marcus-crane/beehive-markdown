Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins is celebrating a major milestone - having reached 20 years in politics.

Mr Hawkins was first elected a councillor on the Papakura City Council on 20 October 1980.

Three years later he campaigned for mayor and managed a rare event - the Hawkins team won a clean landslide sweep taking all councillor positions, replacing the former council that had been in power for 27 years.

Mr Hawkins was re-elected as mayor, unopposed, in 1986 and 1989. During this time Papakura City Council became Papakura District Council. He had an all weather athletic track built at Massey Park, established a new public library, set up community homes for groups such as Plunket and adult literacy.

In 1990 Mr Hawkins campaigned for Parliament. Former Manurewa MP and former Finance Minister Roger Douglas was retiring from Parliament. Mr Hawkins contested the Manurewa seat and won. He has held the seat ever since.

As the new Labour MP for Manurewa, Mr Hawkins soon became Labour's spokesperson for Police. Mr Hawkins etched out a reputation for being a people's politician, fighting for the rights of people and frontline officers.

He became Minister of Police after Labour's successful general election in November 1999, also becoming Minister of Civil Defence, Minister for Ethnic Affairs, and Associate Minister of Internal Affairs.

Mr Hawkins has successfully achieved one of Parliament's largest electorate majorities - with a Manurewa Electorate majority of 13,062 votes in 1999.

Asked what has been his political career highlight: "Becoming mayor of Papakura City Council and having my team win with a clean sweep, taking all councillor seats. And being able to represent Manurewa and Counties Manukau as an MP and Cabinet Minister," George Hawkins said.

His biggest challenge? "Campaigning during the run-up to the 1990 general election and being chased by dogs!"
