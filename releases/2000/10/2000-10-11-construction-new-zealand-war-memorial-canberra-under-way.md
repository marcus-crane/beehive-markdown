Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the beginning of construction of the New Zealand war memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra, Australia.

The memorial expresses the joint co-operation of the New Zealand and Australian people in times of war and peace, and reflects the unique character of the ANZAC relationship from its birth at Gallipoli eighty-five years ago.

The memorial is to be formally dedicated on the eve of ANZAC Day next year. It is New Zealand’s gift to Australia for its Centenary of Federation in 2001.

The memorial features two 11.5-metre high bronze arches on either side of Anzac Parade. They represent the handles of a Maori kete or basket, and symbolise a sharing of the burdens of war and the benefits of peace.

The memorial's design is the work of New Zealand sculptor Kingsley Baird and the Wellington-based Studio of Pacific Architecture, winners of an international competition.

"A groundbreaking ceremony for the memorial is taking place in Canberra today. New Zealand is represented at the ceremony by our High Commissioner to Australia, Simon Murdoch.

"The memorial will be a lasting reminder of the special and deep relationship between Australia and New Zealand. I expect to be at the dedication ceremony in Canberra on 24 April 2001," Helen Clark said
