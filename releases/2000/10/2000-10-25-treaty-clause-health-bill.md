"Any suggestion that the Treaty clause will give Maori preferential treatment is false. The clause is to ensure that Maori can get equal access.

"Given the very poor health status of Maori people, it is clear that we need to be ensuring that they do access the treatments that are available.

"It is important that people make their views known to the Health Select Committee or to Hon Annette King, Minister of Health so they can ensure their views are known and understood.

"There are a number of iwi who agreed with the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill, and therefore chose not to make a submission. They did not realise that the voices of those who do make submissions against the bill could change those provisions. It is therefore important that they ensure the Minister of Health knows their views.

"This bill illustrates the firm establishment of the Crown and Iwi relationship," said Tariana Turia today.
