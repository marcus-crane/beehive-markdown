Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel today confirmed that following the events of last week she instructed the New Zealand Immigration Service not to undertake any further raids outside 7:00 am – 9:00 pm. An instruction was issued to that effect by the NZIS on the afternoon of 11 October.

"I also met with the Minister for State Services, and the Acting State Services Commissioner, yesterday to inform them of my concerns about the matter and to seek confirmation of the correctness of my approach in questioning the NZIS over the matter. The meeting was arranged on Monday.

"I have received an interim report from the New Zealand Immigration Service today. At this stage I will not be making any public comment on the contents of that report. I will also be receiving a more comprehensive report once investigations have been completed," Lianne Dalziel said.
