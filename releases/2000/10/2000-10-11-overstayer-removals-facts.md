Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel has reiterated that in future overstayer removals would not occur before 7 am.

"My officials informed me, incorrectly, that this raid to remove these overstayers occurred between 6.30 – 6.45 am.

"In fact it occurred between 6.05 and 6.10 am.

"This practice is unacceptable and I have said so in Parliament this afternoon.

"I have made it clear that, from now on, overstayer removals will not occur before 7 am. That is the government's policy.

"The previous government's policy regarding the timing of overstayer removals was hazy and ill-defined.

"My announcement in Parliament this afternoon has removed this uncertainty once and for all," Lianne Dalziel said.
