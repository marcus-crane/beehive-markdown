The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Auckland Conservancy will be spending an extra $894,375 this year on protecting the region’s biodiversity as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

She said the extra funding was a welcome contribution to the conservation needs of Auckland and its surroundings.

More than $100,000 will go to animal pest control on Great Barrier Island and in the Hunua Ranges, while a further $216,000 has been allocated to pest eradications on islands, $106,875 to the lorikeet project, and $7,800 to the eradication of argentine ants on Tiritiri Matangi.

$81,000 will go to the prevention of pest animal invasions on islands, which are one of the most significant features of the Auckland Region. Weed issues in Auckland will also be addressed through a $50,600 allocation to weed control."

She said Auckland’s unique maritime environment was recognised by the recent establishment of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park. Protection of this marine environment has also received a significant injection of money. About $236,000 has been allocated to marine reserve management and establishment in the region.

Ms Lee said the funding provided would contribute substantially to the protection of marine biodiversity in the region.

She said a further $106,000 will be spent on brown teal protection on Great Barrier Island, conservation of Hector’s dolphin along the west coast of the North Island, and conservation of freshwater ecosystems.
