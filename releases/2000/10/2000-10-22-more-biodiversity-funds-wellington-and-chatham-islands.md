The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Wellington Conservancy will be spending an extra $305,000 this year on protecting the region’s unique animals and plants as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee has welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

"Much of this money – around $100,000 -- will go towards protecting and restoring biodiversity on the Chatham Islands," Ms Lee said. "The Chatham Islands contain many species that occur nowhere else on earth and some of these species remain critically endangered. Resources will be targeted to controlling weeds and preventing rodents from reaching vulnerable sites. An additional $42,000 will be used to locate and protect breeding burrows of the Chatham Island taiko, of which there are fewer than ten known breeding pairs."

Ms Lee said another $100,000 would also help the Department keep rodents off numerous island sanctuaries. Wellington Conservancy manages five rodent-free islands, including Matiu/Somes Island in Wellington Harbour, and Kapiti Island. The successful rodent eradication on Kapiti Island in 1996 remains the largest such operation undertaken in New Zealand to date. "This new money will help us to keep rats and mice off these precious island through providing rodent-proof store rooms, permanent bait stations and signs and brochures to explain rodent-proofing measures."

The additional biodiversity money will also fund the following work to control weeds, noxious fish and to monitor species in Wellington Conservancy this year:  
Close to $19,300 will be spent targeting weeds in numerous places, including Mana Island, which is one of the main ecological restoration sites in the Wellington Conservancy. Other weed control will take place at Turakirae Head, Pencarrow Lakes and Hemi Matenga Scenic Reserve. Weed surveys will be undertaken at key sites on the Kapiti Coast and in the Wairarapa.  
$10,400 will be spent surveying the distribution of pest fish including rudd, tench, perch and mosquito fish. This is the first step in looking at ways to reduce the impacts of these fish on native freshwater ecosystems.  
$16,400 will enable a contractor to monitor the small populations of brown teal recently released on Mana and Kapiti islands.
