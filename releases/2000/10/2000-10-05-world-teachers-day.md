The Government marked World Teachers’ Day today with a special thanks to  
New Zealand’s school teachers.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said he joined with Boards of Trustees, principals and parents in acknowledging the outstanding contribution that teachers made to New Zealand’s education system, and to the future of its children.

"Our education system is rated one of the developed world’s best, and for their contribution to it the nation’s teachers must take full credit."

Trevor Mallard said the teaching profession enjoyed a deservedly high status in New Zealand, but the community often failed to appreciate the extra burdens it carried in today’s world.

"Our teachers must do more than impart skills and knowledge, in today’s fast-changing world they must continually adapt to new systems and technology. They  
are typically in the social front line, dealing with the results of disintegrating families, drugs, bullying, truancy, and the like.

"Overwhelmingly, they are committed, hard-working professionals, and we owe the best of them a debt larger than we can pay."

World Teachers’ Day was launched by UNESCO in 1993.
