Canterbury's 'third sector' – comprising community and voluntary organisations – deserve greater recognition for their essential work across the region, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey met with social services and community groups in Christchurch this afternoon to discuss the work of the Government's recently formed Community and Voluntary Sector Working Group. The twelve-member working group, including Christchurch City Mission senior community worker Jenny Smith, is developing the framework for an agreement between the Government and the community and voluntary sector. The contribution made by the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand has grown considerably in recent years and the Government wants to ensure it is fully recognised and valued.

Mr Maharey said that while the role of voluntary agencies often went unrecognised, strong local organisations are essential to build strong communities.

"Thousands of Canterbury people every day make a real contribution to improving the health and welfare of your society.

"Nationally, the contribution made by the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand is also huge. There are 60,000 voluntary organisations and approximately 1.1 million New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work according to the last census. Around $1.3 billion is invested in the they provide annually.

"Getting a closer working relationship with the sector based on trust and mutual respect is the key task I want to achieve as New Zealand's first Community and Voluntary Sector Minister.

"I encourage Canterbury people to make sure that their voices are well heard by the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Group. The Group will be visiting Christchurch on 2 and 3 November and holding a series of community group meetings, as well as taking the opportunity to meet with Mayor Gary Moore and other city representatives," Steve Maharey said.
