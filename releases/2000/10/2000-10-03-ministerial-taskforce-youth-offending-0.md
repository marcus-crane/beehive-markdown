A Ministerial Taskforce led by Principal Youth Court Judge, David Carruthers, has been established to develop and build on a co-ordinated package of initiatives to reduce youth crime, Justice Minister Phil Goff and Social Services Minister Steve Maharey announced today."Ministry of Justice figures show that over the decade of the 1990s, offending by 10 to 16 year olds increased by 55%."Children and young people of this age are at a formative stage in their life.

It is critical that we address their behavioural problems while they are still amenable to change and before their offending becomes an entrenched part of their adult lives."Tackling youth offending in the past has suffered from a fragmentation of approach with many agencies involved and inadequate coordination between them."Among the problems in dealing with young offenders under the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act have been insufficient involvement by family or victims, poorly structured plans and a lack of monitoring of Family Group Conference outcomes."Agencies too often took a 'silo' approach, when a holistic approach addressing a wide range of factors behind youth offending was necessary.

"The role of the Taskforce will be to develop and build on a set of initiatives to achieve a coordinated and effective response to youth offending."Judge Carruthers will chair the Taskforce while remaining a sitting judge. His vision, independence, experience and specialist knowledge of what is and is not working will be a key to ensuring agencies co-operate together and focus on effective and practical initiatives.

"Along with Judge Carruthers, the Taskforce will comprise the Chief Executives of the Ministries of Justice, Social Policy, Youth Affairs and Pacific Island Affairs, Departments of Child, Youth and Family Services, and Courts, New Zealand Police, the Crime Prevention Unit and Te Puni Kokiri. "The Taskforce was established on 1 October and will report finally to Ministers with detailed proposals to reduce youth offending by 30 September 2001.
