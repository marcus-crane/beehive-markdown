A three-person tribunal has been appointed to hear and report to the Minister for the Environment on a Water Conservation Order on the Rangitata River in South Canterbury, the Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

The order has been sought by the New Zealand and Central South Island Fish and Game Councils under the Resource Management Act.

The Chair of the Tribunal is Dr Jonet Ward, a senior lecturer at Lincoln University. She lectures in a range of resource management topics.

The members are Claire Mulcock, manager of the Rural Futures Trust which promotes sustainable management of rural land and communities and Dr Murray Parsons, a consultant working in botany, marine phycology and Treaty of Waitangi issues.

The purpose of a water conservation order is to recognise and sustain waters which are considered outstanding as a habitat or fishery, or for scenic, scientific or recreational values. When considering the application, in addition to the statutory purpose of water conservation orders, the tribunal is required to have regard to the application and submissions, the needs of industry and the community as well as existing policy statements or plans.

The Minister expects the process to take at least four months to complete. The tribunal will be serviced by the Southern Regional Office of the Ministry for the Environment in Christchurch.
