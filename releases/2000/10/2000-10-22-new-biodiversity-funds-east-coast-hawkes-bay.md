The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's East Coast-Hawke’s Bay Conservancy will be spending an extra $232,760 this year on protecting the region’s biodiversity as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000-2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee has welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

She said animal and plant pests would be targeted in the East Coast/Hawke’s Bay Conservancy. Major projects include fencing of an area of Te Urewera National Park boundary to prevent incursion by stock from neighbouring land, and intensive ground and aerial hunting of goats in the park. Both projects will provide protection for indigenous species in the park which include rare plants such as kowhai ngutukaka (kaka beak).

Pypgrass in Hawke’s Bay, lagarosiphon in Lake Waikaremoana, and wilding pines in the Galatea area are some of the many weed species which will be targeted. Weed control work will take place at Gray’s Bush, Motu Scenic Reserve and Whangaokena (East Island). The entire conservancy weed programme will benefit from inventory, surveillance and database work which will also be undertaken with the extra funding.

Over $84,375 of the extra funding will have a marine reserve focus with extra management funding going to Te Tapuwae o Rongokako and Te Angiangi Marine Reserves. Approval has also been given for a project to investigate public interest and opportunities to establish a new marine reserve along the coastline between Hicks Bay and Opotiki.
