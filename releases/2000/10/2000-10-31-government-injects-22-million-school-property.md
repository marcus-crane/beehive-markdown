Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that 880 school property improvement projects in 719 schools, have been approved under the Ministry of Education’s Financial Assistance Scheme.

The scheme supports projects that are partly funded by the schools and their communities themselves.

The Government allocated $22 million to the assistance scheme this year for projects ranging from upgraded classrooms to an auditorium,.

"Schools themselves are contributing $17 million to this year’s improvements," Trevor Mallard said.

"So, together with the Government's contribution of $22 million, a total of $39 million is going towards improving school property throughout the country."

The Financial Assistance Scheme is a feature of the Government’s $403 million dollar works programme for schools for 2000/2001, which also pays for classrooms to meet roll growth, new schools and general modernisation of existing schools, all at full cost to the state.

"The Financial Assistance Scheme is a good way for a school either to accelerate work that would otherwise have to wait for full funding from the Government, or to get community based facilities that are not usually fully funded by the state. This is tangible evidence of partnership in action between schools, their communities and the Government for improving school property."

"This year 330 applications for ICT cabling/wiring projects were received and I’m delighted that every one of those applications are approved, reinforcing Government's enthusiasm towards improving information communication technology in schools. In total $6 million will be invested in new ICT property projects at schools.

When applications closed nearly two months ago, 1,355 applications had been received. They were ranked by local District Property Consultative Committees within funding pools for modernisation projects and for community based "non code" projects.

"It won't just be the schools that will reap the benefit, the facilities are a community asset as well.

"The Government recognises the enthusiasm that schools and their communities have towards the Financial Assistance Scheme and we are looking to fund the maximum extent possible," Trevor Mallard said.
