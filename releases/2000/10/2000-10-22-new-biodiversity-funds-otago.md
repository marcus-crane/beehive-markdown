The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Otago Conservancy will be spending an extra $343,000 this year on protecting the region’s unique animals and plants as a result of a Government funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

"Most of the money allocated to Otago will be spent on work on animal pests, weeds, and species protection", Ms Lee said. In the animal pests area, money had been granted for additional thar control in the mountains to the west of the Haast Highway, and a small number of radio-collared Judas thar would be released in that area.

"There was also money for goat control in the Catlins, with the objective of preventing goats invading forests in the Thisbe area, which is a stronghold of the threatened mohua, or yellowhead, " she said.

Funding would also go to monitoring and possum control work in the head of the Siberia Valley and the East Matukituki Valley, Mount Aspiring National Park, to protect two rare occurrences of mountain cedar. These trees are very sensitive to possum browsing, since they have little or no capacity to re-sprout from damaged branches, and once the greater part of their foliage is damaged they cannot recover.

"The additional money will allow weed inventory work to continue, and it provides for control of Buck’s Horn plantain at Chapman Road Scientific Reserve, near Alexandra, where weeds are threatening the survival of rare salt-tolerant plants," said Ms Lee.

In the species protection area, a major survey of Otago galaxiids (native fish) will be carried out to determine the distribution and range of the species in Central Otago.
