Functions  
The Tax Review has been appointed to carry out a public review into the tax  
system so that the government has an appropriate framework within which to  
build tax policy.The functions of the Review will be:

(i) to examine and inquire into the structure and effects of the present  
tax system in New Zealand;

(ii) to formulate proposals for improving that system, either by way of  
making changes to the present system, abolishing any existing form of tax,  
or introducing new forms of tax; and

(iii) to report to Parliament through the Minister of Finance, the  
Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Economic Development.Context  
The last 15 years have seen an overhaul of the New Zealand tax system. The  
main changes have been to remove special allowances and exemptions and  
varied tax rates. The result has been to broaden the tax base, flatten tax  
scales and greater resource allocative neutrality.  
Critics say that the present tax system allows individuals to arrange their  
legal affairs so as to escape full rates of personal income tax, treats  
some types of production unevenly, and favours some forms of long-term  
saving over others.

A second concern is that the tax system as a whole has become less  
progressive, while at the same time the interface between the tax and  
benefit systems is generating very high effective marginal tax rates for  
some low income people and families.  
Thirdly, threats to the tax base are found in new forms of transacting  
(such as internet trading and internet banking) and the use of new tax  
havens. A related problem is whether increased globalisation requires  
re-examination of the very possibility of New Zealand setting its own tax  
rates and what will happen if it does.

Finally, there is a growing debate about how relevant the tax system is to  
the core features of the economic structure. (Rival) contenders to augment  
or replace elements of the current tax structure are sector-specific taxes  
to be used as an instrument for sectoral assistance, cash flow taxation,  
financial transactions taxes, and eco-taxes.

There is both the need for and scope to review the tax system at the level  
of broad principle as well as in some detail. For this reason, it is  
proposed to divide this process into two stages. The Tax Review is the  
first stage of the process and will explore the broad principles of the tax  
system. Stage two will consider the detail of implementing any changes  
proposed in stage one.PurposeIn the budget speech the Government announced:  
We will set up a broad-based and wide ranging tax review to advise on the principles and structures best suited to sustaining a robust revenue base over the long term.

The review will concentrate on how it is possible to ensure a sustainable  
and continuous flow of revenue to meet Government requirements in the face  
of changing economic, social and technological conditions. It will form the  
basis of advice to the Government in broad terms about whether the New  
Zealand tax system can be improved.

Ideally the tax system should raise revenue simply, efficiently, fairly and  
reliably in an environment of changing technology, growing globalisation  
and increasing complexity. It should do this in ways that do not  
materially undermine the environment, social cohesion or the effective use  
of resources.Task of the Tax ReviewThe Tax Review will:

(a) assess the extent to which the tax system can contribute to broader  
social and economic objectives such as encouraging secure, high-quality  
employment, generating a fair distribution of income, maintaining a  
sustainable environment and promoting higher savings;

(b) Recommend structural changes for the tax system, if appropriate. In  
doing so the Review will focus on the following questions:

(i) Can the tax system be made fairer in its role of redistributing  
income? This includes considering whether the income tax base  
should be broadened and the extent to which marginal rates should  
increase with levels of income, wealth and expenditure. The Review  
should consider the best mix between different tax bases such as  
income, consumption, financial transactions and wealth.

(ii) How can the tax system be designed to encourage desirable  
behaviour (e.g. work and savings) and discourage undesirable  
behaviour (e.g. the wasteful use of non-renewable resources)?  
(iii) How can the level of tax that is reasonably required by

government for the provision of essential social services such as  
health, education, superannuation and social welfare be achieved  
reliably in the medium and long-term bearing in mind the need for  
the tax system to be an effective instrument of fiscal policy in  
the management of the economy?

(iv) Do the tax system and tax rates need to be modified in light of  
new technology and international competition?

(c) The Tax Review will report on progress to the Minister of Finance, the  
Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Economic Development at regular  
intervals during the course of the review.  
The conclusions need to be sufficiently general so that they can serve as a  
guide to overall tax policy, but sufficiently particular so that they  
provide a clear idea of the actual tax policies that they would lead to.  
The Review will submit its final report to the Minister Finance, the  
Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Economic Development by the end of  
September 2001.

Process Expectations  
The process should be inclusive, with opportunity for the public and key  
stakeholders to provide input, perhaps by way of the Review commissioning  
studies, preparing and releasing issues papers and arranging various  
discussion fora.

Since tax policy is a well-developed field, the Review would gather and  
assess the views of stakeholders and previous studies, rather than devising  
principles and policies from scratch. The Review's reporting deadline (by  
the end of September 2001) reinforces this.

The Government would make available relevant tax-policy officials from  
Treasury and IRD to provide analytic and secretariat support, and would  
expect them to contribute significantly to the Review. The support will  
include a secretary to the Review, reporting to the Chair of the Review, to  
co-ordinate the support services to be provided. The Review team will have  
the ability and the budget to engage external parties to provide advice and  
assistance on specific issues.  
Officials and the Review team would keep Ministers informed of the progress  
of the Review.

The Government will consider the report of the Review, and indicate  
publicly its views on what principles should guide tax policy and what the  
general structure of the tax system should be.  
Stage two of the process will develop the conclusions reached during the  
tax review and construct a set of workable proposals that can be put before  
the New Zealand public in the context of the 2002 general election.
