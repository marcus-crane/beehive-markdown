The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's West Coast Conservancy will be spending an extra $816,000 this year on protecting the region’s unique animals and plants as a result of the Government's Biodiversity funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

"The funding will be spent mainly on protecting two species of kiwi – the tokoeka at Haast in South Westland, and the Okarito Brown Kiwi (rowi) at Franz Josef," said Ms Lee. The Haast project receives $190,500 and the Franz Josef project receives almost $436,000.

Some of the money will be used to compile the first accurate picture of the Haast kiwi numbers and the birds' survival prospects.

Tokoeka (meaning weka with a walking stick) are found mostly in the rugged alpine areas near Haast.

It is estimated that only 250 tokoeka exist but very little is known about the species. In summer, tokoeka are found in the sub-alpine and alpine tussock lands near Haast but nothing at all is known about their winter habitat.

Ms Lee said the extra biodiversity funding meant that more staff would be employed to help determine whether the existing tokoeka population is viable and how much human intervention is needed to ensure its continuing survival.

"This is going to unravel one of the most elusive wildlife mysteries in the world and at the same time it will ensure that this beautiful and rare icon is given a real future, Ms Lee said. "A tracking network is to be established, along with huts, in a survey area to allow monitoring to take place."

Ms Lee said the Department of Conservation would use the survey information to create an operational plan that might involve the removal of eggs and chicks to controlled rearing areas in Hokitika and Motuara Island in the Marlborough Sounds.

She said the Department might also need to implement extensive predator controls to assist natural breeding in the habitat area through the elimination of stoats and cats.

"The world's rarest kiwi has an increased chance of survival now on its home turf near Franz Josef in South Westland, thanks to the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding for kiwi management," the Conservation Minister said.

Ms Lee said $368,000 would go to protecting new born rowi chicks inside the Okarito Forest by creating a 10km square stoat-free-zone to protect an estimated remnant population of only about 200.

Details of the predator control programme inside the sanctuary are still being finalised by some of the best experts in New Zealand but it is likely to involve control points stationed 500 metres apart in lines totalling about 200kms in length.

"Rowi are the rarest of our kiwi species and now they have a real chance at survival inside their natural habitat without the need to move eggs and chicks to secure rearing areas," Ms Lee said.

"The Rowi have always been dear to my heart as they are part of Te Tai o Poutini as am I and my people," she said.

The Department of Conservation is also using the funding to step up its rowi monitoring programme at Okarito using miniature radio transmitters to track breading pairs and new born chicks.

Ms Lee said the increased funding will double current monitoring bringing the total to 30 chicks and 50 pairs. Funding will enable the further study of forest ecology and response to the reduction of predators.

The Department of Conservation plans to appoint two additional full-time and two seasonal staff as part of the programme.
