Foreign Minister Phil Goff this evening welcomed the decision by Fiji's High Court to formally charge George Speight and 15 others with treason for their May 19 plot against then Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry."The decision means that the court has found that a prima facie case exists that treason was committed prior to 19 May."New Zealand is anxious to see that justice is done in Fiji, and those responsible for the coup held responsible.

"Fiji continues to suffer greatly from the actions of Mr Speight and his supporters. His ongoing legacy is the absence of democratic and constitutional government, the personal suffering of those subject to racist intimidation, and the real damage done to the Fijian economy."New Zealand will continue to keep its smart sanctions against Mr Speight and those involved in the coup in place. "But real justice must be effected in Fiji itself. The Court's decision today is to be welcomed."
