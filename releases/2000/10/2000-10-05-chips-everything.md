Chips got the thumbs-up from Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today as he presented a New Zealand Enterprise Award to Aria Farm Ltd manufacturer of Beef and Lamb Chips.

Anna and Erik Arndt, directors of Aria Farm, applied for an Enterprise Award to help get the company export ready. They are keen to export their world first product, its technology and marketing. Australia, South America and the Falkland Islands have already shown interest.

Jim Anderton attended a barbecue party to celebrate the award and sample the product.

"I’m very happy that as a government and as a country we are getting behind New Zealand enterprise and giving an early helping hand. We are determined to help New Zealand to grow and to increase jobs. Products like Beef and Lamb Chips are innovative and unique and deserve our support," said Mr Anderton.

Anna said she and Erik are delighted to receive the Enterprise Award. "It’s just great. Small, growing businesses like ours need all the help they can get to take the next steps. It’s really appreciated."

Industry New Zealand has recently announced 22 grants in its first round of Enterprise Awards. There are a minimum of 250 awards available to businesses and entrepreneurs with a maximum of $10,000 each for assistance to help good ideas and clever concepts get up and running. Each month a new round of awards will be made and businesses that may be interested can contact Industry New Zealand.
