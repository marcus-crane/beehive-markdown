The Minister of Immigration, Hon Lianne Dalziel, announced today that she is calling for nominations for the Ministerial Advisory Group on Immigration and Refugee sub-group.

This follows her announcement in January that Advisory Groups would be set up to advise her on immigration issues. The Minister will be seeking a representative group of New Zealanders who can provide additional advice to Government on the community’s views on immigration policy and practice.

"Immigration plays a significant role in the social and economic fabric of this country. It impacts on who we are, brings skills and diversity to the economy and also represents our humanitarian commitment through our refugee programme. The Groups will enable me to ask direct questions of the community about how immigration policy affects them and hear their responses first hand" Ms Dalziel said.

The Ministerial Advisory Group is to comprise six members. A four member sub-group will have a particular focus on refugee-related issues.

"I am seeking a sounding board for specific aspects of Government’s immigration policy that will help me to understand what barriers exist to its effective implementation. This will provide me with additional access to community views" Ms Dalziel said.

"I am seeking nominees who have a genuine interest in immigration matters and who will bring with them relevant expertise, ideas and experience. I am hoping organisations will take a collaborative approach to nominating people, to enable the appointment of people who will be able to network with a range of organisations or associations within their sector. The Minister of Ethnic Affairs will also join me at the Group meetings".

"I am, of course, pleased to receive nominations from anyone who can make a valuable contribution to immigration issues. I look forward to receiving these nominations and to get the Groups up and running as soon as possible" Ms Dalziel said.
