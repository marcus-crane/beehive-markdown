Home detention for violent offenders who have served their prison term is being considered as an extra safeguard for the community, says Minister of Corrections Matt Robson.

"Home detention at the end of a prison sentence is clearly not an alternative to jail.

"I will not replace jail with home detention. We are not letting violent offenders out earlier.

"I want to give parole authorities an extra monitoring tool for closer supervision of released inmates.

"Contrary to Opposition claims of cost-cutting, this toughening of release conditions would be an extra cost to the Department of Corrections. I am more than happy look at anything to improve community safety.

"Act's claims that I am driven to home detention in order to cut inmate numbers is also ludicrous.

"Just this morning I announced the expansion of Rimutaka Prison. We are also building two new prisons in the southern Auckland region and one in Northland.

"But let me repeat: replacing prison terms with home detention for violent offenders is not on the agenda and never will be under this Alliance-Labour Government."
