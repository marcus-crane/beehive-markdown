The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department’s Waikato Conservancy will be spending another $1.13m this year on protecting the region’s biodiversity as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done in the region this year.

Most of the funding allocated will go to the northern Coromandel Peninsula, which is one of five areas to be established as a Kiwi Sanctuary this year.

Ms Lee said the Conservancy has been allocated $616,000 this financial year to carry out an extensive survey of the present kiwi population, establish the Kiwi Zone, and to plan and undertake predator control work.

"The northern Coromandel Peninsula, particularly around Moehau, is recognised as one of the five most important areas of New Zealand for kiwi protection, together with Northland, Tongariro/Wanganui and the Okarito and Haast areas of the South Island’s West Coast.

"The Department of Conservation has already put a huge effort into conservation management of the Moehau area over several years and this new funding for the Kiwi Zone complements that. Work has already begun on the inventory, with at least 143 kiwi located, 100 of which are thought to be males. The males are noisier, and therefore easier to locate. We expect that most of them will be paired up, so results to date are most encouraging."  
The Hauraki Area has also received additional funding of $169,000 for several other Biodiversity projects, including weed pest control at Tairua and on Coromandel off-shore islands, and for fish monitoring in Te Whanganui-A-Hei marine reserve, near Whitianga.

An additional $270,000 will be spent in the Waikato and King Country areas on projects including weed and pest control, and Hector's dolphin research.
