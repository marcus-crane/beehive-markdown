New Zealand’s image as the adventure capital of the world is being helped by Industry New Zealand with its support of De’Amalfi Survival to develop a survival helmet says Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

De’Amalfi’s is one of the 22 businesses in the first round of Enterprise Award Scheme recipients. The award will allow the company to test coast guard survival helmets both here and in Canada.

In presenting the award, Jim Anderton said "It is a privilege and a pleasure for me to be able to meet with innovative business people like David. His prototype helmet may eventually save lives and be a sought after commodity for export. Both have got to be good for New Zealand," said Mr Anderton.

"These awards are proof of the government’s commitment to the well-being of New Zealand and its support of enterprise."

With government assistance in the form of the Enterprise Award, De' Amalfi is now able to test the helmet in both New Zealand and Canada.

"I have been providing survival equipment for many years now and this helmet is an exciting new innovation. I am delighted to get financial assistance to help in its development and I hope that, long term, it will help those brave volunteers who do so much to improve our water safety," said Company Director David Manzi.

"In a rescue operation there is extreme speed, motor noise and often difficult conditions and while head protection is vital it hinders hearing. Noise levels and restricted hearing make communication difficult if not impossible and a new style of helmet is required to assist rather than hinder," said David.

Industry New Zealand has recently announced 22 awards in its first round of Enterprise Awards. There are a minimum of 250 awards available to businesses and entrepreneurs with a maximum of $10,000 each for assistance to help good ideas and clever concepts get up and running. Each month a new round of awards will be made and businesses who may be interested can contact Industry New Zealand.
