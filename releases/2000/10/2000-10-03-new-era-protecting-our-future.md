Otahuhu-based Alliance MP and Minister Matt Robson says the new Employment Relations Act will help protect Counties Manukau young people at work.

One of the key Alliance provisions in the Act is the guarantee that new staff will automatically be employed under any existing collective contract for thirty days.

This means new workers cannot be offered conditions below those of the collective agreement in the workplace.

"At last people moving into new work will have some backing from the law," says Mr Robson.

"Young people joining the workforce for the first time are often especially poorly informed about their options, and may lack the confidence and information they need to stand up for decent wages and conditions."

After a month they have the option of joining the union and becoming part of the collective or going it alone.

Under the much-vilified Employment Contracts Act, new staff often had their opportunities for collective bargaining undermined by employers.

For example, some employers were offering vulnerable new workers take it or leave it contracts. This won't be allowed under the Employment Relations Act.

"The Labour-Alliance Government has guaranteed new workers a month's breathing space to consider whether they want to join the collective."

Counties Manukau has a much more youthful population than the New Zealand average, so the changes pushed by the Alliance will be felt especially strongly here, says Mr Robson.

The Employment Relations Act, which came into effect on October 2, offers young workers further support by improving their access to information on workplace rights and union representation. Union reps can now visit all workplaces to talk with staff.

"That way unions can provide individual workers with the information they need to get a fair share of the pie," says Mr Robson.

"Our young people often make significant contributions to family finances, so the flow-on effects of the Employment Relations Act will be more secure families and stronger communities."

The Alliance is now focusing on dragging up the bottom line of working conditions through a minimum employment code.

Policies such as extending the minimum adult wage to cover 16 to 19 year-olds, boosting minimum wage rates and four weeks holiday will be up for discussion.

The campaign for 12 weeks paid parental leave also continues.
