The Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Mark Gosche welcomed news that 14 Pacific health providers are to receive funding from the $1.5 million Pacific Island Provider Development Fund.

A further $5 million will be distributed in the new year.

The fund was reinstated by Health Minister Annette King in June.

"This funding is desperately needed by Pacific health providers who have been underfunded by previous Governments."

"Many illnesses that plague Pacific New Zealanders are preventable and I am convinced that much of our ill-health has been driven by economic hardship and poverty."

Recent research has revealed that Pacific children living in South Auckland suffer from the highest rates of meningicoccal disease in the developed world – a disease whose rise has been linked to overcrowded housing and poverty.

"The past ten years have been incredibly hard on low-income people living in this country. As Pacific families are some the lowest earners in New Zealand – the decade has certainly taken its toll."

"Investing in healthcare and healthy communities is long overdue. It make's sense whichever way you look at it and reflects our Government's drive to restore some balance and sense back into public policy."

The money has been allocated to:

Auckland: Family Life Education Pasifika, Health Star Pacific Ltd, Pasifika Fono, Health Pasifica, South Seas Healthcare Ltd, Tongan Health Society, Pacific Island Womens Health Project, Pacific Islands Homecare Services Trust.  
Hamilton: Central Pacific Trust.  
Wellington: Hutt Union Health, Newtown Union Health, Pacific Island Resource Centre, Porirua Union Health.  
Christchurch: Pacific Trust Canterbury.
