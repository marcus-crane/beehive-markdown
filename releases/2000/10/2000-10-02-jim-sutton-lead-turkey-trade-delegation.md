Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton is to lead a trade delegation to  
Turkey at the end of this month.  
Mr Sutton said his trip would build on the groundwork laid by the Prime  
Minister Helen Clark during her trip to Turkey in April.  
During the trip, Mr Sutton is to take part in a two-day Joint Economic  
Commission meeting and hold talks with relevant Turkish officials in Ankara,  
Turkey's capital city. The Joint Economic Commission is a formal meeting of  
New Zealand and Turkish ministers and officials.

This will be its fifth meeting since establishment in 1991. For the first time, the commission will include business participation ? those business people accompanying Mr Sutton will be able to make presentations to Turkish officials.  
As well as the commission, Mr Sutton will travel to Istanbul, the commercial  
centre of Turkey, to make calls with business people on relevant officialsthere.  
Business people expected to travel as part of the delegation to Turkey work  
mainly in construction and earthquake engineering areas.

Mr Sutton said he hoped to be able to lift the two-way trade between New  
Zealand and Turkey, which was not as high as both countries would like. Last  
year, New Zealand exported $25.8 million of goods to Turkey, and during the  
same period, Turkey exported $27.8 million of goods to New Zealand.  
"The two countries have a good relationship, built on our mutual war-time  
history at Gallipoli. We would like to make it a broad-based relationship  
based on respect and mutally beneficial trade."  
Mr Sutton will leave New Zealand for Turkey on October 21 and will return to  
New Zealand on October 29.
