It was with much sadness I learned Ruth Dyson had resigned her ministerial posts this morning, says Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia.

"Ruth is a very strong advocate for the people whom she represented within her portfolio responsibilities.

"I have the utmost respect for her integrity and the ethical basis from which she works. I have learnt a great deal from Ruth over the past four years.

"In particular I admire her professionalism and dedication to delivering the best outcomes for all peoples in this country.

"She is one of the most supportive colleagues at the Ministerial level. Her resignation is a great loss.

"I acknowledge the extreme regret of the Prime Minister in accepting her resignation at this time.

"I commend Ruth for the dignity with which she has acted under these circumstances and look forward to continuing our relationship as Labour MPs," Tariana Turia said today.
