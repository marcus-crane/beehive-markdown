The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Canterbury Conservancy will be spending an extra $392,000 this year on protecting the region’s unique animals and plants as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

"Much of this money - $57,000 - will go towards management and biological monitoring work at Pohatu, one of New Zealand’ s newest marine reserves near Akaroa on Banks Peninsula," said Ms Lee.

Pohatu Marine Reserve extends from Redcliffe Point to Ounu-hau Point (Gateway Point), and covers an area of 218 hectares. It was named Pohatu in recognition of the ancient pa site at the head of the bay and was officially opened 4 July 1999. A baseline survey of marine life within the reserve and collection of data on habitats by side scan sonar techniques will benefit from the funding.

"Pohatu was established to help protect aquatic wild life and habitat, including the endangered white flippered penguin," said Ms Lee. "It’s the first Marine Reserve for Canterbury, and indeed for the East Coast of the South Island".

Extra funding will cover the costs of running the Pohatu Marine Advisory Committee set up to provide the Minister of Conservation with advice on management issues. It will also allow for compliance monitoring in the reserve as well as training in law enforcement for rangers.

"As a marine reserve, Pohatu will become an important attraction and a valued place for education and science," she says. "Community support, understanding and co-operation are essential to manage and look after this reserve."

Pohatu Marine Reserve is the 15th reserve in the country. The reserve typifies the varied coastal environment of Banks Peninsula with spectacular cliffs, rocky platforms, islands, reef and sand flat features and marine communities.
