Health Minister Annette King has announced terms of reference for the Health Workforce Advisory Committee, and is seeking nominations for the body.

Mrs King said the committee would formally come into being following the passage of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Bill later this year, but the cabinet had now approved the terms of reference.

"The committee's key tasks include providing advice on national goals for the health workforce, and recommending strategies to develop an appropriate workforce capacity," Mrs King said.

"There are serious shortages across many areas of our health workforce. Many of the shortages can be attributed to a lack of planning, or a deluded belief the market would provide the workforce that was needed. The lack of planning is now preventing us moving as quickly as we want to move in making our public health service as good as it could be."

Mrs King said another key committee task would be to provide an independent assessment on the capacity of the current workforce, and the workforce needed to meet the objectives of the New Zealand Health and Disability strategies.

The committee would also facilitate cooperation between organisations involved with health education and training to ensure a strategic approach was developed on workforce issues, she said.

"The Labour-Alliance Government is committed to developing a strong and capable workforce as it is crucial to our goals of improving the health of New Zealanders and reducing disparities in health status."

Mrs King said nominations would close on October 27, and she expected the committee would start meeting early next year. "The committee of up to 10 members will have strategic skills, sector experience, credibility and a knowledge of health workforce issues. They will be drawn from a wide range of health sector groups, including medical, nursing, disability support, employer, education and consumer groups, and Maori and Pacific people."
