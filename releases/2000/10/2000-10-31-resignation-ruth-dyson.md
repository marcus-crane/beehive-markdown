This morning I received a letter from Ruth Dyson offering her resignation from all ministerial warrants, following an incident where she was apprehended by the police and failed a breath alcohol test.

I have accepted her resignation with extreme regret, as Ruth has been one of our hardest working Ministers.

Ruth recognises, however, that Ministers are expected to set an example and that her actions of driving when she had been drinking were inappropriate.

I still consider Ruth to be an invaluable member of our team and this decision today does not rule out the possibility that she will be reinstated to ministerial responsibility some time in the future.
