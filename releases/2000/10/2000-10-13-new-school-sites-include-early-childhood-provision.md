New school sites will in future include provision for early childhood centres, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said he had instructed the Ministry of Education that when looking for land for new schools, they were to ensure it was large enough to include an early childhood centre.

Speaking to kindergarten presidents and managers in Wellington today, Trevor Mallard said the change in policy was one which the kindergarten movement had lobbied particularly hard on.

Securing a site had been identified as one of the major barriers to establish the new Glendowie Kindergarten which opened in Auckland today.

"It is my pleasure to tell you today that the lobbying has been successful and it is now policy that when the Ministry is looking for sites for new schools, there is enough land for an early childhood centre.

"The type of ECE centre will be a matter for consultation involving the community and the Ministry. The Ministry will assist by providing information like demographic projections. I expect that many of these arrangements will involve kindergartens.

"For existing schools, we will be supportive of early childhood centres attached to schools as land and buildings are available and not needed for roll growth.

"I hope that by looking at early childhood provision before a school site is even bought will ease the establishment of early childhood centres and will help the Government meet one of our objectives to increase participation in early childhood education.

"This Government sees early childhood education as an important part of the education system. We are really keen to see better links between early childhood education and the compulsory sector and I will certainly look favourably at initiatives that work towards this goal," Trevor Mallard said.
