The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson has announced the first appointments to the Employment Relations Authority.

The Employment Relations Authority is a new body established by the Employment Relations Act. The Act came into effect on Monday.

The new authority is an investigative body that will deal with disputes which cannot be solved in mediation. The law under which it operates is substantially different from the law under which the old Employment Tribunal operated.

While many problems will be dealt with by the parties themselves or at mediation, some will need to be settled at the higher level of the Authority.

Applicants for the role of Authority member do not need to be lawyers, but a substantial undestanding of the law and legal processes is needed, along with the ability to understand the complexities of the employment environment.

"Now that the Act is in effect it has been possible to present the names of successful applicants to the Governor-General to allow warrants to be signed", said Ms Wilson.

"I'm delighted to have been able to present such strong applicants for appointment. Some are members of the Employment Tribunal which was set up under the old law. Others have gained their experience in different roles".

Ms Wilson thanked the members of the old Employment Tribunal, the functions of which are from this week being taken over by the Mediation Service and the Authority.

"I'm pleased to see that so many members of the Tribunal have found new roles in the structures created by the Employment Relations Act", said Ms Wilson.

Background

· Cabinet endorsed the recommendations this week.

· Authority members are not employees but statutory officers of the Crown. Mediators under the new law are employees of the Department of Labour.

· The Employment Relations Authority is established pursuant to sections 156-185 of the Employment Relations Act.

· The Tribunal remains in existence to deal with matters which arose under the old law. Its work will gradually wind down
