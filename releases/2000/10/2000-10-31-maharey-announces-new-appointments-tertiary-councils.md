New Government appointees to university and polytechnic councils were announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Tertiary institution councils have the responsibility under the Education Act for the governance of New Zealand's thirty-eight public tertiary institutions. The councils are composed of community, industry, staff, student and Ministerial representatives and appointments. Mr Maharey said that the new Government was making the first batch of appointments to university and polytechnic councils to strengthen their ability to respond to the local needs of their communities and ensure the quality of their programmes.

"Attracting high quality council members is essential if our public tertiary institutions are to make a successful transition to the cooperative and collaborative tertiary system we are committed to building.

"Reflecting these new responsibilities, the Government has changed the process used to appoint Ministerial representatives to tertiary councils. All appointees must be agreed by the Cabinet and are subject to an assessment by the Ministry of Education.

"The Cabinet has agreed to appoint the following people to university and polytechnic councils to replace resigning and retiring members:

\*John Jackman, a Senior Policy Analyst for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and formerly Deputy CEO of AgResearch, to the University of Waikato Council. Mr Jackman will provide a valuable link to Crown Research Institutes for the University;

\*Prudence Taylor, Principal of Christchurch Girls’ High School, to the Lincoln University Council. Mrs Taylor's knowledge and experience in the Canterbury education sector will be a valuable asset to the Council;

\*Peter Cook, a dairy farmer and former company director in the local dairy industry, to be reappointed to the Taranaki Polytechnic Council. Mr Cook provides an essential link to the rural community and to the South Taranaki region;

\*Kinsley Sampson, General Manager of the New Plymouth District Council, to the Taranaki Polytechnic Council. Mr Sampson brings his leadership skills and strong links to the local community to the Council;

\*Bob Francis, Mayor of Masterton, to the UCOL Council. Mayor Francis will help ensure that the needs of the Wairarapa community are reflected in UCOL's delivery of tertiary education in the region;

\*Chris Kirk-Burnnand, Managing Director and owner of the Autostop Group Ltd and Chair of the Life Education Trust North Wellington, to be reappointed to the Whitireia Community Polytechnic Council. Mr Kirk-Burnnand brings his strong community links and commitment and understanding of issues for the region to the Council; and,

\*David Moloney, Executive Director of the Interlock Group, Board member of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and President of the New Zealand Manufacturers Federation to the Hutt Valley Polytechnic Council. Mr Moloney brings his wide experience in governance in the education sector and industry links to the Council.

"The Government will be making further appointments to tertiary councils to ensure that they have the appropriate blend of skills and expertise they need.

"The demands on tertiary governance and management will be even greater in an integrated and responsive national tertiary education system. We must ensure that the running of institutions is totally professional," Steve Maharey said.
