Minister of Corrections Matt Robson has pledged to support the call for more Pacific Island input in prisons.

Yesterday Mr Robson launched the communications programme of the Regional Prisons Programme's Pacific Island Committee at the Cecilia Convention Centre, Papatoetoe.

Before the launch he met with the committee to hear of their progress over the last five months.

The committee confirmed the main thrust of the Regional Prisons Programme: that inmates must be in a prison near their families to improve rehabilitation and reintegration. This in turn reduces re-offending.

The committee recommended:

\* New regional prisons easily accessible by public transport for the many Pacific families without private vehicles.  
\* Expansion of restorative justice from sentencing and imprisonment through to post-release, with inclusion of leaders, elders, and families of the victims and offenders.  
\* Delivery of programmes for inmates by members of their own culture to increase success rates.  
\* More Pacific prison staff to boost success of rehabilitation and discipline of Pacific inmates.  
\* Designs that fulfil the call of Pacific communities for prisons which rehabilitate and heal.  
\* A high level of face to face meetings with Pacific communities, rather than reliance on printed material.

"It's vital that the new regional prisons are effective at turning criminals away from crime," says Mr Robson.

"Reluctant as we are to pour precious resources into new prisons, we all agree some people have to be held in safe and secure confinement.

"Only by building links with communities can we maximise the chance of turning inmates around so they do not re-offend.

"Families have a huge role to play, so we need prisons which families aren't scared to visit. Old prisons like Mt Eden were designed when we simply locked away our social problems and I don't believe any prisoner's family feels welcome there."

The committee was formed after a community meeting in November 1999, to ensure Pacific Island views are taken into account during the site selection process for new men's and women's prisons in southern Auckland.

The committee has been meeting monthly since June 2000 to increase understanding  
\* of Pacific views within the Regional Prisons Programme  
\* and of the programme within Pacific communities.

"We don't know where the new prisons will be built yet," said Mr Robson. "The Department will be presenting me with a shortlist of possible sites for my approval in November.

"The Department is committed to consulting all interested communities in greater southern Auckland during the site selection process. This communication programme is an important part of that wider programme which invites the whole community to take part."
