Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has congratulated New Zealand Police and Customs officers for their part in a major Heroin bust in Fiji.

Up to 400 kilograms of Heroin has been seized in Suva after a major Police investigation, involving officers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Fiji, intercepted a major drug trafficking operation.

Two people have been arrested and Police investigations are continuing.

Police initially seized 35 kilograms of Heroin but further investigations discovered a stockpile of between 350 and 400 kilograms of the drug.

"The Heroin bust is huge, even by world standards," George Hawkins said.

"Four New Zealand Police drug squad detectives from Auckland have been involved in an ongoing investigation in Fiji. National Drug Intelligence Bureau co-ordinator, Cam Ronald, said that the Heroin was most likely destined for Australia and/or North America.

"Through excellent detective work and international crime fighting intelligence, millions of dollars worth of this most debilitating drug has been taken out of circulation.

"I want to congratulate all New Zealand Police Officers who played a part in this successful investigation," George Hawkins said.
