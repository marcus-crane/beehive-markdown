New Zealand schools are being encouraged to share ideas that help at-risk students through the internet.

At the AIMHI Teachers' conference in Auckland today Education Minister Trevor Mallard today launched a new section to Te Kete Ipurangi – the Online Learning Centre.

From today, TKI will be host to an online community for schools support, schooling improvement and iwi initiatives.

"Over the coming year, information will continue to be added so that schools, teachers and communities can see what is happening across the various initiatives taking place in this area.

"During the next few months, eight school projects will be profiled in detail, including adding more information from the AIMHI initiative. During next year, we will add further profiles. A main aim of establishing this online environment is to provide the means for teachers and principals to publish and share their insights, materials and resources – either in public or within private areas that the site will provide.

"For example, materials that schools have developed with their communities could be published here, including materials in Pacific languages. As well, this is an area where you’ll be able to communicate with each other through online message boards – for example to share strategies you’ve used or to post queries or ideas," Trevor Mallard said.

The AIMHI initiative is a collaborative partnership between the Ministry of Education and nine decile 1 secondary schools in Auckland and Wellington which work together to develop generic and individual school projects to raise student achievement.
