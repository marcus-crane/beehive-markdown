The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee has announced that the Department's Nelson-Marlborough Conservancy will be spending an extra $700,000 this year on protecting the region’s unique animals and plants as a result of the Government's Biodiversity Strategy funding package.

The Government committed in the June Budget an extra $187 million to biodiversity protection over the next five years, from 2000–2005. In the first year, the Department of Conservation receives an extra $12 million, including more than $2 million to assist protection of biodiversity on private land. The Department’s extra funding increases progressively over the five years, to $48 million in 2005.

Ms Lee has welcomed the additional funding for the region and said it would significantly boost the conservation work being done this year.

"The bulk of this money – around $630,000 - will go towards pest control including against possums, weeds and pest freshwater fish," Ms Lee said.

"This work is vital if we are to retain the biodiversity of our natural areas. The Nelson/ Marlborough Conservancy has the largest diversity of natural values among any of the 13 conservancies in New Zealand, and pest control work is needed to protect these values.

"One area, in particular, in which the extra funding will help us make a difference is in and around Kahurangi National Park. The park contains native plant and snail species that are unique to the area and animal pest and weed control work will help us protect these threatened special species."

The additional biodiversity money will fund the following work in the Nelson/Marlborough Conservancy this year:

Close to $190,000 will be spent on weed removal and control. Climbing spindleberry and Madeira vine are being targeted in Golden Bay and in areas of the Marlborough Sounds including Clova and North West Bays and Resolution Inlet. This work will be done in conjunction with the Tasman and Marlborough District Councils.

Weeds, mainly Old Man’s Beard and Buddleia, will also be removed from the Isolated Hill Scenic Reserve in Marlborough which has high conservation importance. Other weed control work will take place on Nelson’s Boulder Bank, at Gouland Downs in Kahurangi National Park and on Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds.

Improvements will be made to systems for preventing rodents getting onto the around 20 predator-free islands in the Marlborough Sounds. These islands have high conservation importance because of their predator-free status and a number are used as safe havens for some of New Zealand’s most endangered species such as the kakapo, takahe and tuatara. The additional funding will allow more frequent checks of traps on islands and improvements to methods for ensuring predators are not brought onto the island in visitors’ bags or with supplies.

The Conservancy has received an extra $440,000 for animal pest control work, primarily in the Kahurangi and Abel Tasman National Parks. Chamois and goats are being targeted to the west of the Karamea River in the central area of Kahurangi National Park to prevent their spread further into the park and to protect rare and unique plants. Operations are also being conducted against possums in the Parapara Peak area west of Takaka and in the Leslie area on the western side of the Arthur Range. This will help protect rare snails and plants. In the Canaan area of the Abel Tasman National Park predators including possums, rats and mice are being targeted to protect giant land snails, forest and rare mistletoes.

Funding will assist the survival of the critically endangered Paturau Snail, a sub-species of the native Powelliphanta snail genus. The Paturau Snail is unique to north west Nelson and struggling to survive in its last remaining habitat - a coastal forest area of only one third of a hectare. It is estimated that there are only 200 Paturau Snails left. The extra biodversity funds will be used to intensify predator control in a bid to increase the population to around 400. It is hoped that if the snail numbers reach this level that in a few years time some can be transferred to two other nearby sites, increasing the species’ chances of survival. Predator control work as well as revegetation planting will also be carried out at the two sites being prepared for the snails. Predators to be targeted include rats, mice, hedgehogs, thrushes, stoats and possums.

Funding has been provided for genetic research on a South Marlborough plant Cheesemania "Chalk Range", commonly known as chalk cress. The research will determine whether it is a separate species to other types of Cheesemania and confirm how seriously threatened it is. A survey last year found only 16 plants of Cheesemania "Chalk Range" whereas five years ago there had been 48. If the DNA research establishes that it is a separate species then it will be confirmed as critically endangered and urgent steps will be taken to protect the few remaining plants. This Cheesemania plant is found only in the Chalk Range and adjacent limestone areas in inland Marlborough. It grows up to 15cm tall and has the appearance of a small palm tree with its leathery strap-like leaves forming a rosette.

Funding has also been provided for action against pest freshwater fish in the Tasman district. This follows the discovery of koi carp, Gambusia/mosquitofish, rudd and tench in the region this year. The funding is being used for searches of ponds in the Tasman Bay area for pest fish and for eradication plans for any unwanted fish found.

More than $18,000 has been given for mapping and monitoring of ecological changes in the Tonga Island Marine Reserve.
