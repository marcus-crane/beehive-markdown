A unique arrangement for the management of Marlborough’s roads has been approved by the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche.

Marlborough Roads, as the district’s new roading office is known, will be formally established from 1 December 2000, responsible for the management of both Transit New Zealand-owned State Highways in Marlborough and Marlborough District Council-owned roads.

It is the first such joint initiative between Transit and a local authority.

Announcing his approval of Marlborough Roads today, Transport Minister Mark Gosche described it as “an exciting initiative” by the Marlborough District Council.

The arrangement is expected to cut annual roading maintenance costs from $11.1 million to $9.4 million, with the council’s share of the $1.7 million savings about $500,000.

Marlborough Mayor Gerald Hope says that not only will local ratepayers benefit from these savings, but they will also have a “one-stop-shop” for all roading matters.

“Marlborough Roads will be responsible for all things roading, taking away any doubt as to whether people should contact the council or Transit about any road problem,” he said.

“It is a very significant venture for our district and I am sure other local authorities around the country will watch with great interest this innovative approach to road maintenance. There are potentially huge savings to be made from local authorities joining with Transit to manage roading networks.”

Ministerial approval of Marlborough Roads was required because it involves extending functions of Transit New Zealand as defined in the Transit New Zealand Act 1989. The Act specifies its functions as relating only to State Highways.

The council came up with the idea in 1999, with the Minister’s approval the final step in the process. Pending his approval, contracts combining State Highway and council roading requirements have been let, with savings already accruing from this combined approach. These contracts can now be formalised under the Marlborough Roads banner.

Marlborough Roads will formally begin operations in December from an office Transit will open in Blenheim. The council’s road management staff will transfer to Marlborough Roads, which will be contracted to the council for upkeep of its roads.

Mr Gosche said Marlborough Roads “shows just how well central and local government can work together”.

“I was very pleased to help it go ahead by extending Transit’s functions.”

Mr Hope thanked Mr Gosche for his assistance ... “the Marlborough Roads concept is unique and we’ve had to satisfy him that it was feasible. He has now agreed - and Marlborough Roads is a reality.”
