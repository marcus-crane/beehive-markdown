"The quality of the Ministerial Review into the Tax System was always going to depend on the personnel and I am confident we have the right people for the job," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Robert McLeod, Managing Partner of Arthur Andersen (New Zealand) will chair the Review. The other four members are Srikanta Chatterjee, Professor of Economics at Massey University; Shirley Jones, Chair of the Council of Otago Polytechnic and an accountant specialising in small business; David Patterson, a Partner with the law firm Rudd Watts and Stone; and Ted Sieper, an Australian economist who has advised Governments on both sides of the Tasman.

Their backgrounds include tax accounting, law, economics and involvement with community organisations, providing the Review with a wide range of skills and experience.

"The tax system is a fundamental determinant of economic prosperity so it was vital that we got reviewers of the highest calibre. I am very pleased to have been able to assemble such a depth and breadth of experience on the panel," Dr Cullen said.

"I am certain that they will make a significant contribution in assisting us to ensure that the tax structure meets New Zealand’s current and future needs."

The Review will be independent and has been given a comprehensive brief that allows it to consider all relevant options.

"One of my key objectives in establishing the Review is to create a forum in which the important tax policy issues facing New Zealand can be debated and discussed. The Review sends a challenge to all people with a stake in the tax system to think long and hard about what they want to tax or not tax.

"I hope people will rise to that challenge and we can see an informed and constructive debate.

"The Review is not intended to ‘re-invent the wheel’, but to draw upon knowledge and expertise that already exists in New Zealand and elsewhere" said Dr Cullen.

He noted that the Review Team’s budget had been increased from an earlier provisional estimate of $520,000 to $985,000 (including GST). The budget will allow for regular meetings of the Team, consultation with the public, and for the Team to commission external advice.

The Review Team is to report to Government by the end of September 2001. The Government will release the Team’s report and will make public its response to the Review’s recommendations.

"Significant new taxes will not be implemented without first seeking a mandate from the electorate through the 2002 general election," Dr Cullen said.
