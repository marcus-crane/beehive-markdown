National's Finance spokesman Bill English revealed his own laziness today when he accused the Labour-Alliance Government of spending undertaken by his own National colleagues Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

"He should check with his own colleagues before accusing the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government of racking up big legal bills for housing advice that was undertaken by the National Government."

Mr Gosche confirmed that more than $300,000 worth of services contracted by Housing New Zealand to law firm Buddle Findlay date back to the previous National Government.

"Of the $312,724 spent by Housing New Zealand for legal advice from law firm Buddle Findlay - $303,313 relates to spending undertaken by the previous National Government when Bill English's front bench mate Tony Ryall was the Minister of Housing ."

The entire bill for service is made up of:

· $93,279 for advice on a maintenance contract that dates back to June 1999

· $5,679 for advice on a maintenance contract that dates back to June 1999

· $204,355 for further legal advice on Housing New Zealand work programme that dates back to June 1999

"Only one contract was undertaken during this Government's time and relates to a $9,411 contract for advice in the implementation of income-related rents."
