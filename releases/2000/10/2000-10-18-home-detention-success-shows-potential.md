The success of the first year of home detention shows its potential in a 21st century corrections system, says Minister of Corrections Matt Robson.

Today we celebrate 12 months of the electronic bracelet monitoring system. Currently 179 people are wearing the ankle bracelets.

"The success of home detention has been outstanding. 513 people have been monitored in the first year but only 9 have been recalled and 9 breached their detention conditions.

"That level of success shows how useful home detention could be for inmates released with parole conditions. Such close monitoring offers more effective community protection than current release options.

"That's why I am looking into home detention for offenders who have served their prison term. This does not mean replacing jail with home detention. Nor does it mean letting violent offenders out earlier."

Rehabilitation programmes form a major part of home detention conditions for ninety per cent of the detainees. International evaluations show re-offending is cut where electronic monitoring is used hand-in-hand with rehabilitative programmes and probation supervision.

The eligibility criteria for home detention are very strict.

Detainees are monitored on a 24 hour basis and their probation officer liaises closely with employers and co-residents to ensure the detainee complies with home detention conditions.
