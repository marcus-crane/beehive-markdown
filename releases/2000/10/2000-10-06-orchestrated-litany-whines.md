Cabinet Minister Pete Hodgson says the Business Roundtable and its political allies should stop depressing New Zealanders with their orchestrated whining about the country's future.

"Roger Kerr has been leading a chorus of moans about this country and now has the gall to fund an advertising campaign that complains about 'a generally negative feeling about New Zealand'," Mr Hodgson said.

"Many New Zealanders are appalled to discover that this campaign has been funded by precisely those people who have dedicated themselves for almost a year to creating negative feeling about this country's future.

"What makes this orchestrated whining even more destructive is the absence of any constructive ideas. All we hear from Mr Kerr is the same tired ideology he has been peddling for more than a decade.

"Promises of more privatisation and tax cuts did not win the last election for National and Act, nor did they have a positive effect on migration flows. In fact there was a higher net outflow of people from New Zealand last year than this year.

"Fortunately Mr Kerr is not the 'voice of business' he pretends to be. There are plenty of people in business, including members of the Business Roundtable, who do not share his extreme views and his enthusiasm for advancing them through dodgy public relations campaigns.

"The Government has a productive dialogue with many such people in the business community, and will continue this at its summit with business leaders on October 24. Mr Kerr unfortunately believes the Government is not 'listening to business' unless it is following his orders."

Mr Hodgson said he was disappointed that Mr Kerr's latest publicity stunt had been abetted by some unprofessional journalism by the Holmes show, which failed to reveal the Roundtable's connection with it when it first featured the issue on Wednesday.
