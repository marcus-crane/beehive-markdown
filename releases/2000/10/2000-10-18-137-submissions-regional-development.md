"The regions of New Zealand are buzzing with enthusiasm and ideas. That has come through loud and clear with 137 expressions of interest for Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnerships Programme," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today.

The programme is designed to assist individuals, businesses and communities to work together to identify and develop the opportunities in their area.

It offers financial support for development strategies and building local partnerships; financial support to gather expertise and employing leadership to develop and implement strategies; grants for major regional initiatives that are consistent with regional strategies and contribute to the government's goal of sustainable development.

The bids cover a wide range of endeavours, from tourist ventures to new tertiary institutes.

The programme has created high expectations and the majority of the submissions are seeking maximum funding. The 137 expressions of interest submitted applied for a total of $109 million.

Regions can apply for funding in 3 components:

\* Up to $100,000 for Strategy Development (total of $8 million applied for

\* Up to $100,000 for Building Capability (total of $8 million applied for)

\* Up to $2,000,000 for major regional initiatives (total of $93 million applied for)

"The total budget for the Regional Partnerships Programme is $33.750 million (incl. GST) over the next three years, including $5.6 million in the current financial year."

"The enthusiasm is overwhelming and of course demand outstrips resource. However, Industry NZ will be working with applicants and encouraging groups to work together where multiple expressions of interest were received from the same or overlapping regions," said Mr Anderton.

A major element in successful proposals will be co-operation within the region. Competition between regions is not encouraged, and competition within regions is contrary to the objectives of the programme. The programme is designed to build partnerships between central and local government.

During November, Industry New Zealand will begin discussions with bidders to work out the best possible partnerships. Detailed guidelines for putting forward a full proposal will then be provided.

Full proposals will be received by Industry NZ starting in November and an Approval Committee will make final assessments of proposals and funding in February. In addition to the economic benefits of the proposal, the assessment will take into account the level of disadvantage of the region.

"It will be a positive start to the New Year for the successful applicants when they hear we are ready to enter into contracts," said Mr Anderton.
