New Zealanders have more dollars in their pockets and those dollars are buying more, Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton told an Alliance Hutt South meeting tonight.

He says new GDP figures are very encouraging.

GDP measures all the goods and services produced in New Zealand in the twelve months to the end of June.

"In that time the economy grew by 4.8%. Compare that to the last full year the National Party had in office. Under Jenny Shipley, Bill English and Richard Prebble, the economy shrank by 0.8% in the year to June 1999.

"Even more importantly, we should look at the real incomes of New Zealanders.

"The actual purchasing power of New Zealanders increased by 6.8% in the year to June. If we adjust the figure for an increase in the population, then – on a per capita basis – real disposable incomes are up by 6.4%.

"The economy is much stronger under the stable coalition than it was under the shambles last year. With a lower New Zealand dollar, the export sector will become a driving force for growth.

"It’s important to remember how many things there are to be positive about in New Zealand.

"The Opposition spend a lot of time running this country down. I want to remind New Zealanders of the reasons this country is still the best small country in the world," Jim Anderton said.
