Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the benefit from well-designed immigration policies is illustrated by the enduring contribution to New Zealand by Dutch migrants and their descendants.

At a function at Parliament marking the 50th anniversary of the Netherlands Migration Scheme, Helen Clark said around 30,000 Dutch migrants had arrived in New Zealand in the twenty years after the treaty's signing.

"The Netherlands Migration Scheme brought to New Zealand many skilled people, and they and their families have contributed hugely to our economy and society.

"The first group which came under the scheme consisted of 55 single dairy workers. They were flown to New Zealand. On arriving at Whenuapai on 20 December 1950, they were immediately dispatched to dairy factories throughout the country.

"The scheme was also of benefit to the Netherlands, in providing an outlet for its people struggling to find work during a period of high unemployment in the aftermath of World War Two and the collapse of the Dutch colonial empire.

"When the flow of Dutch migrants began in the early 1950s, it was the first significant intake of non-British migrants to this country. It helped foster a more culturally diverse and tolerant society, something of which New Zealanders are justly proud of today.

"It has also helped cultivate lasting good relations with the Netherlands. Our relations with the Dutch government have been warm and friendly, and today we still retain direct immigration links with the Netherlands/New Zealand Working Holiday Scheme.

"While the Netherlands Migration Scheme was suspended in 1976, around 250 Dutch migrants are still attracted to New Zealand each year," Helen Clark said.
