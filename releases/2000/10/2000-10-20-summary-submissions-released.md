A Ministry of Justice paper summarising reponses to the discussion paper "Same Sex Couples and the Law" has been released.

The discussion paper was issued under the previous government. The summary of responses looks at the range of views put forward in submissions. It does not propose policy or include recommendations.

"The government will refer to the submissions as policy matters arise," said the Associate Minister of Justice Margaret Wilson.

"There is, of course, no single view represented by the submissions. The 'sample' represents the views only of those who decided to make submissions, so can't be relied on as a guide to overall public opinion.

"But the submissions do represent significant work and effort by those who put them forward and the government will take them into account as policy is developed," said Ms Wilson.

The issues raised in the discussion paper included domestic partnerships, children of people in same sex relationships, entitlements, relationship breakdown and death.
