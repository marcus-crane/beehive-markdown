The Minister of Internal Affairs Hon Mark Burton has enlisted the help of experienced volunteers from Kaikohe to Te Anau to assist in the organisation and promotion of International Year of the Volunteers 2001 (IYV), which runs from 5 December 2000 to 5 December 2001.

Mr Burton, the Minister responsible for the Year, announced the formation of the IYV Ministerial Reference Group today. Members are Denise Henigan, Pam McLeod, Te Warana Ratima, Cheryll Martin, Nick Toonan, Jane Poa, Karen Roberts, John Thornely, Ekara Lewis, Carol Quirk, Bella Tari.

"The Ministerial Reference Group will greatly help in shaping the Year, as well as providing me with a valuable conduit for information and issues surrounding the Year", Mark Burton said.

"The group has been selected both for their contacts and networks within volunteer groups, and also for their grass roots volunteering experience".

In appointing the group Mark Burton said he was mindful of the fact that the Year is about recognising the work that volunteers do both formally (via voluntary groups) and informally.

"Volunteering in New Zealand makes a vital contribution to cohesive society and 'capacity building' despite the fact that many volunteers are modest in relating their accomplishments".

The Group will hold its first meeting in Wellington on 26-27 October; where they will finalise their terms of reference, develop the first draft of a national plan of action for the Year, and elect a Chairperson from within the Group.

Details on the Group¡¦s members follow.
