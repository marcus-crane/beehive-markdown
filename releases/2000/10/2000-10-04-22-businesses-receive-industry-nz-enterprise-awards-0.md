Twenty two innovative small businesses from all over New Zealand have been offered the Government's first Enterprise Awards, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

In this first round, 22 awards have been made out of 47 applications, ranging in value from $800 to $10,000. Some were seeking expert advice for developing a prototype, while others needed help with protecting their intellectual property, business planning or doing a feasibility study for a new project. The awards will give these small businesses the boost they need to move to the next stage of development.

"The Government is committed to building partnerships with both large and small companies and this award programme is part of our aim to boost small business success and growth. It is a boost that they deserve and they have been overlooked for far too long because small and medium sized businesses are the engine room of the NZ economy," says Mr Anderton. "This first round of awards go to small businesses throughout New Zealand, with products ranging from seafood to blankets, possum products to physiotherapy equipment."

The Enterprise Awards Scheme was one of three new Industry NZ programmes announced by Mr Anderton in July. It offers up to $10,000 for small businesses or entrepreneurs who need support and advice in order to test and develop good ideas.

The Enterprise Awards Scheme is gathering steam, he says. "It takes six months for this type of scheme to become known and for small businesses to see how it might help them. We are now experiencing a strong build-up of interest throughout the country."

A panel comprising private sector representatives along with the Ministry of Economic Development and Industry NZ will meet monthly to evaluate more award applications.

"The Enterprise Awards Scheme does not give any one business a large injection of cash - these are not handouts, but a springboard to growth for entrepreneurs and small businesses. While the amounts are not large, they can make all the difference to a small business that needs some practical advice and early financing so that it can grow and develop."

Over the coming weeks, Mr Anderton will visit many of the award recipients. On Thursday he will be personally presenting two of the awards to businesses in Hamilton and Auckland.

He says that the firms who were turned down this time should not be discouraged.

"The calibre of applications was very high and not everyone who applied received an award. But many of the ideas had potential and Industry New Zealand's advisors will work with those people to develop their ideas further, and encourage them to re-apply", says Mr Anderton.

Businesses interested in applying for an Enterprise Award should contact Industry NZ.
