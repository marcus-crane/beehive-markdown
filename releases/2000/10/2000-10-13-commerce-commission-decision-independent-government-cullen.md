Commerce Commission decision independent of Government - Cullen

"The Government has no influence over Commerce Commission decisions, and that is the way it should stay," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

He said it was important to the Commission's integrity that it was seen to operate independently of Government interference.

Dr Cullen issued the statement after being approached by several media for comment on the Commission's decision to turn down Shell's application to buy Fletcher Energy's New Zealand exploration and production assets.

"It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the ruling as to do so would compromise the Commission's independence and might prejudice any future legal action," he said.
