Question 1

What do you see as the problems with the rating of Maori land, and how do those problems impact on the Crown, local government, and Maori?

Care needs to be taken with the term "Maori land". This does not simply mean the ordinary residential, farming or business properties occupied by Maori. "Maori land" in this context is the 5.63 percent of New Zealand's land area that has not been alienated from Maori ownership. In general, the issues that are of concern to Maori land owners and councils relate to Maori freehold land in multiple ownership. There are an average 62-owners for every parcel of multiple-owned freehold Maori land.

Some of the problem areas have been identified during consultations with Maori, local government and other key groups:  
\* Maori perceive the current rating regime places pressure on them to alienate their land, which they find unacceptable;  
\* the current valuation systems on which rates are based do not take account of Maori relationships to their land, nor of the practical circumstances facing the owners of Mäori land in joint ownership;  
\* Mäori have stated that generally they are happy to pay their "fair share" of the costs of local government, but there is considerable debate about what that is. In particular, Mäori are concerned about having to pay for services which they do not receive or use, particularly in the case of land-locked land.

Because the rating of land is a local government matter, there is generally no direct impact on the Crown. Local authorities may face problems arising from the collection of rates from multiple-owners of some blocks of Maori freehold land. Often, these difficulties arise because of problems associated with the identification of owners, and with the collection of rates from all owners of a property once the owners are identified. Maori who are part-owners sometimes face problems getting agreement of their co-owners to land management or development initiatives.

Question 2

How are rates arrears on Maori land impacting on Maori use of the land?

Maori have expressed concern that some owners are wary of developing their land in case they are required to pay rates arrears. They claim this would make development projects uneconomic. It is difficult to measure the extent and the validity of this concern.

Question 3

Is the problem one for the Government or for the councils to fix?

Present legislation allows for councils to use some discretion in terms of writing off arrears. The most appropriate solution may be for councils to develop policies within the context of a legislated framework. At this stage, it is inappropriate to be specific about what may or may not be done in the future, as the current funding powers review has not yet reached the point where public consultation can occur .

Question 4

Should the Government and councils be looking for ways to recover more rates on Maori land, or for mechanisms to exempt Maori land from rating?

Both may be appropriate, depending on circumstances. The collection of rates is a matter for local authorities. Current legislation provides for mechanisms to levy and collect rates, and for some local discretion in terms of enforcement.

The Rating Powers Act 1988 allows for rates postponements, exemptions, remissions, and waivers on a diverse range of property types and uses - whether the land be classified as Maori or general. More specifically, and in addition to that range of measures, section 189 of the Act states that "A local authority may, if it thinks fit, remit the payment of any rates due on Maori freehold land or any additional charge thereon … either wholly or in part, or may postpone the payment of any such rates for such time as it thinks fit."

Question 5

What solutions to the problem is the Government considering?

Again, it is inappropriate to be specific about what may or may not be done in the future, as the current funding powers review has not yet reached the point where public consultation can occur.

Question 6

What is the anticipated process and time line for changes under the rating powers review?

The Government is developing proposals for public consultation on matters related to the current funding powers review, and will discuss timing issues with sector representatives at the next Local Government Forum (to be held on Thursday 9 November, hosted by the Prime Minister at Premier House, Wellington).
