His Honour Judge Neville Jaine retired from the position of Police Complaints Authority with effect from 30 June 2000, the Minister of Justice Phil Goff announced today.

Judge Jaine gave notice at the end of last year of his wish to step down from the position due to personal reasons.

“Judge Jaine has had a distinguished career,” says Justice Minister Hon Phil Goff. “He was appointed as the Authority in 1997. Previously he was the Judge Administrator to the Chief Justice and the Chief District Court Judge. He was first appointed to the Bench in 1978 and was a former Chairperson of the Representation Commission.

“I would like to thank Judge Jaine for his dedicated and professional service over the years as the Police Complaints Authority.

“His Deputy, His Honour Judge Borrin has been appointed the Acting Police Complaints Authority and will continue until such time as the current Review of the PCA is completed and Ministers have considered its recommendations,” says Mr Goff.
