Changes to the way the self-employed are billed by ACC came under scrutiny today with Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen promising a fair deal for people who are struggling to pay.

The way the self-employed pay for workplace accident cover was changed from paying in arrears to paying in advance in 1998 in order to bring them in line with normal commercial practice. Approximately two thirds of the liability built up by self employed people is for workplace and non-work cover they have already enjoyed by not yet paid for. It is analogous to a tax holiday that business enjoy in their first year of business.

Dr Cullen said while the decision to move to common business practice makes good sense, the previous government gave very little thought to its implementation and the effects on small business.

He said because the arrears have arisen through no fault of the self-employed, it is especially important people are treated fairly during the cross over period from paying in arrears to paying in advance.

"ACC has been instructed to help the self-employed with spreading options and instalment payments to ease the cash flow concerns for small business. If their 12 month invoice is $2,000 or more they can pay by instalments for up to 2 years. I have further requested that the Accident Compensation Corporation adopt a very lenient approach to any penalties incurred over these payments, given that people are in arrears through no fault of their own".

Dr Cullen said the process has been quite confusing for many people.

"Not only are people being billed for cover they received two years ago, and cover they are receiving now, but they still have to pay for the cost of residual long term claims – the ACC "tail" in a separate payment to Inland Revenue. In the past they may not have even noticed this payment.

"However, by the end of the year both the self-employed and employers will be paying for workplace accident insurance in advance instead of in arrears," said Dr Cullen.
