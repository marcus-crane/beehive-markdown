Taupo MP and Minister of Tourism Mark Burton today handed over a cheque for $5,250 for further development of Te Waihou Walkway near Putaruru.

Te Waihou walkway covers a distance of 4.7 kilometres, and follows the Waihou River to the internationally acclaimed Blue Spring.

The money will be used for further native plantings along the track.

"Development of the walkway has been a tremendous community effort," Mark Burton said.

"Local and regional authorities, local businesses, Putaruru High School and the Lotteries Board have all been involved, along with the generous support of local landowners.

"This project has significant recreational, social and economic benefits for the South Waikato region.

"Prime Minister Helen Clark and I were immensely impressed when we attended the official opening of Te Waihou walkway in April.

"The financial support I have announced today is a demonstration of this Government's determination to encourage worthy projects which contribute to regional development, and which come from and continue to have the strong backing of local communities.

"Te Waihou Walkway is an excellent example of what can be achieved when a local community, central and local government combine with a common purpose," Mark Burton said.
