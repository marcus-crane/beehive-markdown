Education Minister Trevor Mallard has praised the work of the Fire Service in providing quality resource material to help teach the fire safety message in New Zealand schools.

Trevor Mallard today launched the Fire Wise programme at Eastern Hutt School.

"The Fire Service has done a great job in making sure the material they provide fits in with the new health curriculum. Already there has been positive feedback from teachers who have started using this new resource," Trevor Mallard said.

"I'm also impressed by the way that children are encouraged to involve their families in fire safety.

"On average 40 people, including 11 children, die in fires each year. The Fire Wise programme focuses on reducing statistics like this in a way that encompasses good and can enhance a child's wider learning."

At today's launch, Trevor Mallard told Eastern Hutt School children that they could be a big help in keeping their homes 'fire wise'.

"I'm sure that you children are all old enough to know not to play with matches and lighters," he said.

"But some of you might have little brothers and sisters, or little cousins that don't know some of these kind of things. So one of your jobs at home could be to make sure that things like matches and lighters aren't left lying around where little kids can play with them."
