New Zealand’s next ambassador to Viet Nam will be Malcolm McGoun, Foreign Minister Phil Goff, announced today.

“Viet Nam is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand,” Mr Goff said. “Our bilateral relationship has developed steadily since our embassy in Ha Noi opened in 1995. Two way trade last year totalled $150 million. Our exports to Viet Nam, worth $99.6 million last year, have increased by 94 per cent in the last two years.”

New Zealand’s development assistance to Viet Nam, which totals $4 million, is focused on human resource development, rural development, and the health sector. A number of senior officials have undertaken English language training in New Zealand.

As well as bilateral contacts, New Zealand and Viet Nam have regular exchanges on economic and security matters within regional forums such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

Mr McGoun is a career diplomat. In 1998-99 he was Director of the Auckland office of the APEC Task Force. His previous overseas postings include The Hague, Seoul, Paris, and Kuala Lumpur, where he was Deputy Head of Mission.

Mr McGoun takes up his position in August 2000.
