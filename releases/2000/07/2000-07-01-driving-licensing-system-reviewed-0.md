The Government plans to take a closer look at some aspects of the new driver licensing regime, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister of Transport Mark Gosche announced today.

An independent reviewer will conduct the review, which fulfils Labour's pre-election pledge.

The review will include:

\* Costs to drivers in complying with the regime; and

\* How licensing services are managed.

“The review will ask, Are we making drivers jump through too many hoops to get their license, and is that justified when we weigh up the safety risks? And have we got the costs as low as they could be?

"The review will look at three areas that have caused the Government serious concern: policies governing novice drivers, older drivers and professional drivers.

“These groups are of particular concern to us, especially the older drivers. The Government is getting the message from older drivers loud and clear: the new licensing system has not been sensitive to their needs.

"The review will not cover all aspects of the licensing regime.

“There are aspects of it that are working very well. For example, the new regime has had a very real impact on the numbers of disqualified and unlicensed drivers who feature significantly in road crashes - they cause about one in ten fatal road crashes.

"The police report that in the year since the new regime came into place, there has been a 29% reduction in offences detected for driving while disqualified, compared to the same period in the previous year.

"However, the Government is in no doubt that certain aspects of the regime needed to be re-examined.

“It is now a year since the new regime came into effect, and it is therefore timely to be asking whether it is working as we want it to," Helen Clark and Mark Gosche said.

The review is expected to be completed by November 2000.
