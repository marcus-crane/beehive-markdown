"I am aware of the concerns of community boards about the present provisions allowing dual membership of territorial authorities and community boards. In particular, the impact these can have, in conjunction with other provisions relating to appointments to boards, on the effectiveness of boards.

"I propose to address this matter through a local government electoral bill, although I must stress that at this stage no policy decisions have been taken."

"The Government is reviewing the Local Elections and Polls Act 1976. This is an important task that is well overdue.

"The review of the Act is designed to develop policy proposals in time for legislation to be introduced this year and to be enacted in time for the October 2001 local authority elections. These proposals include:

\* multiple candidacies; as well as

\* sufficiently flexible legislation for the conduct of local elections and polls which, for example, accommodates future technological advances;

\* measures to guide candidates’ election expenses; and

\* an option for local authorities to adopt an alternative voting system (ie. STV) for the 2004 elections onwards."
