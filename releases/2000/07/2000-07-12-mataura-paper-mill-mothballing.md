Employment and Social Services Minister Steve Maharey said he was sad to learn of the decision by Carter Holt Harvey to mothball its Mataura Paper Mill from 18 August and said Work and Income staff would be actively assisting affected staff to find new employment opportunities.

"The Government is sad to hear that 155 staff are to lose their jobs as a result of the decision to mothball the Mataura Paper Mill. Work and Income staff in Southland have been alerted to the mothballing and they are ready to work with the affected staff to help them find alternative employment.

"The Department will be contacting Carter Holt Harvey today and are available to meet all the workers affected by this decision. The Department has a range of services which will be of assistance.

"These include help marketing their skills to other employers in the region and identification of other job opportunities.

"In addition I understand that Carter Holt Harvey is making every effort to assist affected staff and their families. Having taken this difficult decision, the company should be commended for the support systems they have put in place" Steve Maharey said.
