Community housing tenants will benefit significantly from a $3 million fund to help them pay their rents Housing Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

"Community housing tenants like women's refuges have been under enormous financial pressure for many years under the previous Government's market rents policy," said Mr Gosche.

"We have established a $3 million fund for this financial year to contribute towards community housing tenants where a need is identified."

"Each request for assistance will be dealt with on a case by case basis," said Mr Gosche.

"This is the first step to next years new community housing rents and further details will be released next week."

Today's announcement was in addition to June's announcement that Community Housing Limited would be allocated a further $28.7 million to buy and modify 120 properties.

"Making safe, secure, affordable housing available for some of New Zealand's most vulnerable and at risk people is a housing priority for the Government. It is another way in which we are working to close disparity gaps in this country," said Mr Gosche.

"We recognise the valuable service Community Housing provides for those organisations working at the coal face with at risk people."

Community Housing Limited is a subsidiary company of Housing Corporation New Zealand and provides rental accommodation for groups working with people who have specific housing requirements.

This includes those with intellectual, psychiatric and physical disabilities, women and children who need refuge and others needing emergency support or access to suitable housing.

Within the next two weeks Community Housing Limited tenants will receive information inviting them to apply for additional assistance towards their rental costs.
