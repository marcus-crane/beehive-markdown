Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said that the Government's plans to transfer the Community Employment function of the Department of Work and Income to the Department of Labour are on track.

Mr Maharey today released the officials papers relating to the transfer decision. The Government announced in June that it was moving to strengthen its community employment capacity by relocating Community Employment within the Department of Labour as a separate service unit.

"Investment in the growth of community-based employment opportunities is a key element in the Government's employment strategy. Our decision to relocate Community Employment and to re-establish it as a distinct entity was made to ensure that we have all the tools we need to fufil our manifesto commitments to improve local employment development and to close the gaps.

"The resolution to the placement of Community Employment was a key decision and, because of its inter-relationship to the review and refocusing of the Department of Work and Income, Cabinet took the time to fully consider advice from a variety of agencies and the Ministerial Inquiry into the Department of Work and Income (the Hunn report).

"The formal transfer of Community Employment to the Department of Labour is on track for a target date of Monday, 31 July 2000. We are acing to make the transfer as rapid as possible to ensure there is no diminution of its ability within the communities it works in across New Zealand," Steve Maharey said.
