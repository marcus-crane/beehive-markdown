Ladies and Gentlemen, I know you were expecting Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton to speak with you today. He apologises for missing your conference, but ill health has confined him to Wellington. He has asked me to deliver this speech to you instead.

In many respects, horticulture is the leading edge industry of New Zealand. The developments in the sector over the past decade, even the past year have been astonishing.

Not only are there many new varieties of fruit and vegetables, but growers have also grasped new market opportunities.

I and Mr Sutton would both like to commend the horticultural industry for the way you have focussed on big-picture, strategic issues, furthering your industry.

I know you have Biosecurity and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs speaking with you tomorrow, and many of the pressing domestic issues you have ¡V such as the varroa mite outbreak and concerns about the Resource Management Act ¡V fall in her portfolios.

I would like to concentrate my talk with you today on international issues.

The New Zealand horticultural industry has an enviable international reputation that has been hard won.

Our strength has come from not only our natural environment and image ¡V which we need to maintain ¡V but also from the development of strong international brands, such as Zespri and Enza. To back up those brands and other exports, we have also worked to strict quality standards in production and grading.

While it can be frustrating that our customers and trading partners seek to increase the weights for us, meeting higher standards is also a means of keeping in front of our competitors. For example, our big pipfruit customers are demanding that all fruit be produced using the environmentally friendly Integrated Fruit Production system, which will give us an advantage.

There is a clear international trend to good systems of traceability, reduced use of chemicals and additives to food. That trend is likely to continue as the baby boom bulge moves through the major markets such as Japan, Europe, and the United States, and the ageing population becomes increasingly concerned with health issues. This will create opportunities for developing products to satisfy those demands, while we will also see changes in general standards.

Organic produce fits clearly into this area of opportunity.

While there are premiums for many organic products, as supply meets demand those premiums may disappear, but the fact that a product is organic may overcome quality and or entry barriers to some markets or customers.

The Government is keen to encourage the further development of the organics sector as an area of opportunity in horticulture. We have recently set up a working group of government agencies and organics representatives to look at roadblocks to development and how we can remove them.

The organics sector is projecting an increase in organic exports from the current $60 million to $500 million by 2005. That is an exciting prospect and an area where Trade NZ has been working to support the development of key international markets.

It is also important to remember that science and research offers opportunities and solutions for the industry. This is from the development of new varieties through to increasing pest resistance.

Obviously, consumer attitudes need to be taken into account in any of this work.

Other trends I see relate to the increasing globalisation of business. We can see this in the expansion of major retailers and supermarket chains. With that, there are also some fundamental changes happening in purchasing practices and the need for strong partnerships with suppliers who supply year round.

There will also be opportunities for our suppliers of frozen and processed horticultural products.

We must also not ignore the emergence of new competitors. For instance, China is becoming a threat to some of our vegetable exports to Japan. We must recognise that as it increases its standards, it will become an increasing threat, along with India and a number of traditional Southern Hemisphere producers.

We need to be vigilant to opportunities for partnerships and investment in these competitors, while at the same time improving our own standards and being innovative in our branding, marketing, and new product development.

This is something your industry has done well at. The horticultural sector continues to grow in importance and the future looks bright indeed.

Currently, some 61% of New Zealand¡¦s exports come from the farm, fisheries and from horticulture. Consequently, the removal of barriers to agricultural trade remains an issue of the highest national priority.

Given the importance of export earnings to you in the horticultural industries and to us as a country, my Government has made a firm commitment to ensure that the multilateral trading system provides us with certainty of access to existing markets and to lever open new ones.

I want to focus today on the way in which the dry almost academic world of trade negotiations is helping New Zealand horticultural products maintain their place in the international sun.

As most of you will be aware, the World Trade Organisation resumed negotiations on agriculture at the beginning of this year. These were mandated by the Uruguay Round of negotiations - where for the first time the process of putting trade in agricultural products on the same basis as trade in other products was begun. The horticultural industry was a major beneficiary of that process.

This Government¡¦s view remains that we can only make real progress on winding back agricultural protectionism through the multilateral system. The WTO agriculture negotiations will address issues of tariffs, tariff quotas, export subsidies and domestic support. We will be working with other members of the Cairns Group to make meaningful progress.

New Zealand, Australia and the Cairns Group have a clear set of objectives. We want the elimination of export subsidies, deep cuts in agricultural tariffs, large increases in tariff quotas, and an end to trade distorting domestic support.

For too long, agricultural trade has been treated as ¡§special¡¨ and exempted from the rules that apply to other products. There is no justification for this. Our ultimate objective is that agricultural trade should be treated on the same basis as trade in industrial goods.

Australia and New Zealand, as members of the Cairns Group, will be looking for substantial improvements in the international trading environment for the benefit of among others, our horticultural sectors.

In fact, the Cairns Group has already submitted a negotiating proposal which calls for the elimination of export subsidies. Further proposals to address other aspects are under preparation.

An expansion of this rules-based system in agricultural trade will make a key contribution to global development and benefit us all.

As the current Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Mike Moore recently said ¡§Rules make a more level playing field.¡¨ We all benefit from this.

Against the backdrop of the rules-based system, I want to touch upon a specific WTO Agreement which should be particularly dear to your hearts - the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, or the SPS Agreement.

This document is crucial to horticultural exporters and, indeed, the New Zealand economy

It is the SPS Agreement which delivers guaranteed market access to horticulturalists. Before the SPS Agreement came into effect in 1995, provisions protecting the right of access to other countries¡¦ markets were woefully inadequate. Countries had a virtual carte blanche to take measures arbitrarily and there was next to no means of redress for the victims.

The Uruguay Round delivered many benefits to New Zealand. But, perhaps the most significant benefit for the horticultural industry is that there are now clear rules - in the SPS Agreement which govern what can and can¡¦t be done. In other words, the Agreement established principles which bind countries when they set sanitary measures which may affect international trade.

This important Agreement has three basic tenets. It

„hrecognises a country¡¦s sovereign right to protect plant, animal and human health and life through SPS measures consistent with the Agreement.

„hupholds scientific principles and risk analysis as the basis for national measures affecting trade.

„hrecognises the role of international harmonisation and equivalency in measures. that require sanitary measures to be based on science and as least trade restrictive as possible.

So what are the benefits of this Agreement?

I believe that the paramount advantage delivered to small exporting nations like our own is that the new framework of rules has created a new mindset amongst countries employing sanitary measures.

More practically, and in a way which addresses your bottom line, the Agreement has delivered measurable benefits in four specific areas: harmonisation; enhanced use of science based principles; consultation and access to a dispute settlement mechanism

First, international harmonisation and agreements on equivalency of SPS measures through the Agreement lower the compliance costs for exporters. Given New Zealand¡¦s excellent reputation for meeting the requirements of importing countries, New Zealand exporters continue to gain every day from this.

Second, SPS measures applied by any WTO member must now be built on scientific evidence, with regard to both assessment of risk and the determination of appropriate levels of protection.

This is very important. Basing sanitary measures on sound science means that we, as consumers, can be confident that both domestic products and imports meet approved standards.

For you as exporters in the horticulture industry, this aspect is of critical significance.

It means that you will no longer be undermined in your efforts to ensure that other countries scientifically justify their SPS measures. I think it is now a reasonable assumption that politics and protectionism will intrude less and less on scientifically based risk assessment.

Third, the consultation provisions under-pinning the SPS Agreement allow one to challenge the regulations of another country. While a nation¡¦s ability to establish legislation is not restricted, a specific food safety, animal or plant health requirement can be questioned on the grounds that there is not sufficient scientific evidence supporting the need for a trade restriction. By accepting the WTO Agreement, governments have agreed to be bound by WTO rules.

Fourth, the dispute settlement provisions of the WTO encourage governments involved in a difficult issue to seek a mutually acceptable solution through formal, bilateral consultations. If no resolution is reached governments can pursue the issue in the WTO¡¦s formal dispute settlement processes. Although formal disputes related to the SPS Agreement are limited, the fact that countries are willing to challenge national SPS measures reflects confidence in the new rules and its usefulness to address the problems of technical barriers to trade.

In saying all of this, I know that many of you will be thinking that, all this theory is all very well for lawyers and economists to get excited about, but we still can't get access to such and such a market for such and such a product.

You are right. The situation is not perfect. Problems remain. We are working on those on a daily basis.

I think, however, that as a consequence of this Agreement there is now a clearer basis for working through these kinds of problems in older developed markets. Furthermore, the SPS Agreement has helped open up new ones.

Let me give you some concrete examples. When the Kyrgyz Republic, a former member of the Soviet Union and a country with a population slight larger than New Zealand joined the WTO, it signed on to the SPS Agreement.

This benefited New Zealand.

For many years, New Zealand products, including fruit had had a high and positive profile in the Soviet Union as ¡¥ecologically clean.¡¦

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, exporters from this country have been trying to sell horticultural products like kiwi fruit and New Zealand apples to the newly independent states, including among others the Kyrgyz Republic.

The Kyrgyz Republic, like many of the former Soviet bloc countries, used to have in place a bewildering range of certification requirements for fruit and vegetables. To export a consignment of kiwi fruit to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1997, a New Zealand exporter needed five certificates, including one which certified the product free of contamination from the Chernobyl disaster.

In effect, these requirements which were burdensome and complicated acted as effective barriers to trade. Between 1991 and 1998, you couldn¡¦t find any foreign produced fruit in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Once it joined the WTO in 1998, however, it implemented science-based requirements to control access to the domestic market of, among other things, kiwi fruit and apples. The old discriminatory and complicated certification requirements were eliminated.

Before too long, enterprising Kyrgyz trader were buying up New Zealand apples and kiwifruit for sale in Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic.

That is an example of a new market opening for New Zealand as a result of this esoteric little Agreement designed in Geneva.

Established markets have been prised further open as a consequence of the science-based requirements instituted by the SPS Agreement. Nectarines and peaches to Korea and a myriad of other examples of products like capsicum and others indicate the importance of this Agreement to New Zealand.

Let me conclude by saying that I know that the system is not perfect and I cannot promise you any instant solutions today to the problems facing the industry internationally. But I do promise you that I am working hard to resolve them.
