Youth Parliament 2000 is a key event in the government's programme to boost youth participation in decision-making, Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré says.

"Youth empowerment and youth participation to hand in hand, and Youth Parliament is one of the few forums young New Zealanders have to voice their opinions on issues that could have a huge bearing on their lives."

Laila Harré says this year's youth MPs will be debating one of the hottest topics of the moment – the decriminalisation of cannabis.

"Young people chose this topic themselves and I'm glad they did.

"Issues raised during this debate will give me a clear indication of what young people really think of this issue, information the government will be obliged to consider when it looks at any proposed changes to cannabis laws.

Information gathered during the inaugural Youth Parliament debate on lowering the drinking age was used in the Ministry of Youth Affairs select committee submission on the Sale of Liquor Act some five years later.

"The arguments raised for and against the partial decriminalisation of cannabis during Youth Parliament 2000 will not be ignored."

Laila Harré said young people themselves are the best resources the government has for designing youth-friendly policies, and they should be encouraged to play an active role in designing the New Zealand they live in.

"I hope to see many more examples of youth empowerment through participation during my term as Minister of Youth Affairs, and I have made it one of the priorities of the work that the Ministry of Youth Affairs will do this year."

Youth Parliament 2000 takes place on August 28 and 29 in Wellington.
