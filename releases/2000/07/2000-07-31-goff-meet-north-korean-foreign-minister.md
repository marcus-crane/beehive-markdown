"A move towards the establishment of full diplomatic relations between New Zealand and North Korea will be on the agenda for my meeting with Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun" Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

Mr Goff was speaking from Bangkok where he is attending the ASEAN Regional Forum and Post-Ministerial Conference. North Korea is attending the Forum meeting for the first time.

"This will be the first formal ministerial between New Zealand and North Korea."

"I will convey to Minister Paek how much New Zealand welcomed the commencement of a process of dialogue and cooperation on the Korean peninsula following the recent North/South summit."

"The international community needs to continue to urge both sides to keep up the momentum in this historic process."

"The summit provided a good background for New Zealand and North Korea to move towards a formal diplomatic relationship."

"I expect that officials on both sides will take that process forward over the next few months."

"I will also express to Minister Paek New Zealand's concerns on issues like North Korea's stance on arms control and human rights, as well as our support for international humanitarian assistance to deal with North Korea's economic problems."

"I expect those issues will continue to be part of our future dialogue with North Korea."
