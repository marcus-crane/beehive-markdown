Pacific peoples helped build New Zealand into the country that it is today.

Parents and families migrated here to give their children the kinds of educational opportunities they never had themselves.

Pacific people have paid taxes and worked in jobs for many years and this has helped make New Zealand strong.

We came here for a better future but recent forecasts do not bode well.

Pacific people continue to lag behind other New Zealanders in terms of health, education, employment, housing and income.

The story is the same for tangata whenua Maori.

Our Government does not want disparity to shape the future of New Zealand and future generations of Maori and Pacific New Zealanders.

We have the responsibility as well as the opportunity to address the huge gaps that have grown up over the past decade.

Maori and Pacific communities are the country's fastest growing population and by 2050 nearly half of all Kiwis will have a Polynesian heritage.

We are not prepared to stand by and designate a huge section of our community to the economic scrap heap.

However we also know that the only way to address disparity gaps facing Pacific peoples is by the Government and Pacific communities working together.

Subsequently Pacific communities will benefit from significant funding in this years Budget.

The new funding is set aside to strengthen our communities so that they can develop and deliver their own initiatives to their own members. The key phrase many will have heard is "capacity building" – basically this means that we as a Government will stand behind and strengthen our Maori and Pacific communities.

Over the next four years there will be millions going towards capacity building in Pacific communities.

This reflects a new partnership between Pacific New Zealanders and the New Zealand Government.

For the first time ever the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs has had their budget significantly increased. They will need to monitor Government policies that impact on Pacific communities to make sure that the impact is a positive one. On top of this more than $2 million over the next four years is to go towards Pacific community workers who will be contracted by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs to assist with capacity building.

There are a range of other announcements across portfolios that will impact positively on Pacific peoples.

As the Minister of Housing I was proud to announce an end to the previous government's market rent regime. From December 1 low income state house tenants will pay no more than 25% o their income in rent.

Independent research tells us that high housing costs are the single largest cause of poverty in New Zealand. I have personally visited many Pacific homes where families were living in overcrowded, unsatisfactory conditions. Quite simply when rents are so high there is little left in the family budget for essentials like healthy food, doctor's bills, medicines and school lunches for our children.

Our most valuable yet vulnerable assets are our children.

There are over seventy brand new education programmes set to start over the next year. The Government has announced money for resource teachers to help children read, new homework centre and more funding for early childhood education.

In April my colleague Education Minister Trevor Mallard announcement of extra funding or early childhood education directly benefited Pacific youngsters.

An immediate injection of more than $3 million was made to centres nationwide and around half would go towards Pacific centres. This means nine new Pacific early childhood centres will be funded and more than 250 Pacific children may be soon getting the heard start in life that many have been missing out on. The budget added a further $2 million this year for new centres.

Around 35% of Pacific three-year-olds miss out on early childhood education compared with only 10% of non-Pacific youngsters. While nearly 100% of European youngsters attend kindergarten – the attendance rate for Pacific four-year-olds is only 60%.

Investing this money in our early childhood centres gives our children the head start that they need.

The Budget also saw the first increase in road safety education in more than six years. Maori and Pacific communities have been targeted for the first time ever.

As the Minister of Transport I know that road safety messages are not getting through to enough of our communities. Unlicensed drivers cause huge headaches for Police and I know of few families who can afford to go without their car once it is impounded.

We need education packages designed and delivered by Pacific organisations and that is just one programme the Government is working on.

Finally I would like to thank Pacific community groups throughout New Zealand who have worked in the face of severe hardship to provide services to Pacific families and households.

Your work is invaluable and we want to strengthen your ability to serve our people and make our communities strong.
