Prime Minister Helen Clark is asking the public to nominate people for consideration for the honours lists.

“In late August – early September the Government will be looking at the nominations it has received to make a selection for inclusion in the New Year Honours for 2001. Consideration of honours occurs every six months.

“We now have an entirely New Zealand honours system, which recognises outstanding New Zealanders in a New Zealand way. To be successful the system relies almost entirely on receiving nominations from the community at large.

"The Government wants to encourage people to nominate fellow citizens who give freely of their time and resources to assist and support others in the community.

“There are many unsung heroes who work tirelessly in a voluntary capacity to help others, particularly children, low income groups, welfare, cultural and community groups. Many deserve to be honoured, but cannot be considered because no-one has thought to put forward their names."

Helen Clark said that nomination forms can be obtained from Members of Parliament and their electorate offices, and from the Honours Secretariat, Cabinet Office, Parliament Buildings, Wellington.
