Mana Motuhake leader and Deputy Alliance leader Sandra Lee has welcomed Parekura Horomia's promotion to Cabinet, and offered her congratulations on his appointment as the new Minister of Maori Affairs.

"I believe he will carry the mantle of leadership on Maori issues in this Government with dignity, humility and pride," she said.

"As an Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, I will be giving him the same wholehearted support that I gave to his predecessor and will endeavour to assist him in becoming our most effective Maori Affairs Minister yet," Ms Lee said.

"No one can deny that the past few months have been tumultuous for the Government's Maori MPs," she said.

"The Labour-Alliance coalition has been looking to make the most far-reaching economic and social changes in Maori policy areas, and the implications for New Zealand's future are potentially greater than even our accident insurance or employment relations initiatives."

"It is only natural that my Maori colleagues in Government have borne the brunt of the opposition's fury, which has largely taken the form of personal attacks rather than reasoned policy debate," Ms Lee said.

"With the appointment of Parekura Horomia today, I am confident that all the Maori Government MPs will want to move forward now and work cooperatively for the benefit of our people, and indeed all New Zealanders."
