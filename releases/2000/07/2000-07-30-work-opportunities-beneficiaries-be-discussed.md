Opportunities for beneficiaries to move into work will be discussed at a national conference in August, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

“The conference provides a unique opportunity for government officials to discuss future opportunity and employment policy directions with beneficiary advocates from around the country, “ he said.

The three-day conference, being held at Tatum Park, Otaki, in late August, is a joint venture between the advocates, the Ministry of Social Policy and the Department of Work and Income.

The conference programme is yet to be finalised but will consist of a number of forums including a presentation on the linkages between benefits and jobs.

“This builds on the constructive discussions officials have established with the Beneficiary Advocates Reference Group since January 2000,” said Mr Maharey.

“As the reference group is not representative of all beneficiary advocacy groups, the national conference is seen as a worthwhile opportunity to meet a wider group for a discussion on increased incentives and opportunities for beneficiaries to move into work.”

The estimated total cost of the conference is $34,200 (GST incl.) which will cover accommodation, travel, meals and incidental costs for 50 delegates and 10 officials. The cost will be met by the Ministry of Social Policy ($16,100), the Department of Work and Income ($16,100) and the beneficiary advocates ($2,000).
