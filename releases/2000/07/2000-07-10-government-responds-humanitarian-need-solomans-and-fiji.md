“The New Zealand Government has contributed a total of $466,000 to Red Cross Societies in response to humanitarian needs arising from the Solomon Islands and Fiji crises”, the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Matt Robson, says.

He announced a grant of $216,000 to the New Zealand Red Cross to assist with the purchase of essential pharmaceutical supplies for Solomon Islands health services.

This will supplement a previously announced grant of $150,000 to support capacity building for the Solomon Islands Red Cross.

He also announced a $100,000 to assist the Fiji Red Cross with additional expenses incurred during the continuing hostage crisis, including the costs of the curfew ambulance and assistance to the hostages.

“The New Zealand Red Cross and other National Societies are very effective channels for humanitarian assistance of this kind” says Matt Robson.
