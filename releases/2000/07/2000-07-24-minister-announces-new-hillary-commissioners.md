Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the appointment of Louisa Wall and Graeme Marshall to the Hillary Commission.

Graeme Marshall is the former principal of Hutt Valley High School with a strong background in management in education and curriculum development.

Louisa Wall is a New Zealand rugby representative and former New Zealand netball representative. She has a degree in social policy and a Diploma in Sport and Recreation and has worked with youth at risk within the spheres of education and sport. She is currently completing a Masters in Social Policy.

"Louisa will help bring a stronger youth and Maori focus to the Commission," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Government sees participation in sport and physical activity as valuable tool in helping us achieve our closing the gaps objective and I know this is an area that Louisa also has a personal interest in.

"We also see school sport as integral to the wider Government aim of increasing participation in this area. Already the Hillary Commission runs programmes like SportFit to support participation in sport and physical activity among secondary school students.

"Graeme's contribution in areas like this will be invaluable."

Trevor Mallard also announced the reappointment of Colleen Mills to the Commission for a further year.

The Hillary Commission was established through legislation to develop and encourage sport, fitness and leisure.
