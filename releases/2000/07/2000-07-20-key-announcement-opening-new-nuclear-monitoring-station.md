Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control Matt Robson and Minister of Health Annette King will open a new nuclear monitoring station at Kaitaia tomorrow.

The $800,000 state-of-the-art station will monitor radionuclide activitiy or the minute particles of radioactive dust released into the atmosphere by nuclear explosions.

It is New Zealand's newest station. The other New Zealand operated sites are in the Chathams and in the Cook Islands.

Matt Robson will also make a key annoucement on New Zealand's next step towards the promotion of a nuclear weapon free world.
