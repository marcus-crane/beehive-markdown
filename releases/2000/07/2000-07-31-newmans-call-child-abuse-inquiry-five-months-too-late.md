ACT MP Muriel Newman's call for a review of family placement procedures by the Child, Youth and Family is five months too late, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

In March the Government appointed respected former Principal Youth Court Judge Mick Brown to conduct two independent reviews into how Child, Youth and Family Services responds to referrals of child abuse or neglect, and places at risk children. Mr Brown is currently working on the reviews and is due to deliver the completed reports to Steve Maharey later this year.

"The Government wants to ensure the very best care and protection possible is available to those children and young people who may be suffering from neglect, abuse, or otherwise be at risk.

"As Labour's Opposition spokesperson I was critical of a number of high profile cases in recent years which have rightly caused public concern. Once in Government we moved quickly to determine how the Government can improve public confidence in Child, Youth and Family and to ensure that they make necessary improvements to their practices in child abuse cases.

"The reviews will consider issues relevant to the distressing cases which have come to light in the past fortnight, including placements with extended family members and with whanau, hapu and iwi kin groups.

"ACT MP Muriel Newman's apparent support for the in-process reviews is welcome – if belated.

"I have recently met with Mick Brown and agreed to his suggestion that, because of the significant degree of overlap between the two reviews, he can present them together towards the end of this year rather than sequentially starting in June 2000 as was initially proposed," Steve Maharey said.

Contact: Michael Gibbs, Press Secretary, (04) 471 9154 or (025) 270 9115. Attached are the terms of reference for the review of procedures for referral and notification and the review of procedures for placement.

Review of procedures for referral and notification

\* obtain information on Departmental casework processes, practices and support systems (procedures, guidelines, instruments, supervision, training), and its capacity to meet demand in relation to referrals and notifications, with particular reference to capacity to meet Maori demand;

\* assess the strengths and weaknesses of procedures for placement and their capacity;

\* make recommendations for improvements to procedures for placement, including the areas of service delivery, management and funding;
