Fifty families in Porirua and South Auckland will be part of a pilot for a new Computers in Homes project, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Trevor Mallard said the project would involve 25 families from Cannons Creek School in Porirua and 25 families from Panmure Bridge School in Auckland. The families would be provided with a recycled computer along with training and technical support.

"We are becoming increasingly aware of the 'digital divide' issue – that is the gap between those who have access to ICT and those who don’t," Trevor Mallard said.

"If left unchecked, the digital divide has the potential to damage opportunities for individuals, communities and the ability for all New Zealanders to participate in the knowledge economy.

"The Ministry of Education is putting $10,000 into this project. It will be carefully evaluated to help us develop ideas and systems to overcome some of these issues.

"The project is being run by the 2020 Communications Trust, a group committed to raising awareness of, and access to, the benefits of information and communications technology networks, with a particular focus on promoting access to the Internet.

"It will also work on creating closer links between schools and homes as the schools will be overseeing the computer training for the students and their families.

"These two schools have a high proportion of Mäori and Pacific Island students and the Computers in Homes project will be another step in the closing the gaps initiatives," Trevor Mallard said.
