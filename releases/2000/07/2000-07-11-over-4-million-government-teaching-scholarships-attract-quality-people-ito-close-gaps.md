Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released details of a $4 million plus programme to attract high quality people into the teaching profession.

The programme makes 405 scholarships of $10,000 each available to selected teacher trainees.

¡§This major investment by the Government aims to get new people into secondary teaching in particular.

¡§It has been developed in co-operation with schools and teachers. They are part of the campaign itself, demonstrating yet again that in the profession there are talented, creative teachers who are making a fantastic contribution to the development of young New Zealanders,¡¨ Trevor Mallard said.

¡§Real teachers will be featured right throughout the Government¡¦s recruitment programme this year which will help to direct interested people to understand the rewards that teaching now offers.¡¨

Trevor Mallard said a focus of this year¡¦s scholarship programme was to increase the number of secondary teachers in the key shortage areas of physics, maths, and information and communications technology. There is an international shortage of secondary teachers of maths. Teachers of physics, computing and physical education are anticipated to be in short supply over the next few years.

¡§We also need quality Maori and Pacific teachers, and that is why we have further increased the number of scholarships available in these categories. This emphasises our absolute determination to provide a better education for our Maori and Pacific children,¡¨ he said.

Trevor Mallard announced the following categories and numbers of teacher scholarships available:

„h 100 scholarships for Maori graduates  
„h 50 for Maori non-graduates  
„h 55 for people to train as Maori-medium teachers  
„h 50 for people to train as Maori language teachers  
„h 50 for Pacific graduates  
„h 25 for Pacific non-graduates  
„h 30 for graduates to train as secondary maths teachers  
„h 10 for graduates to train as secondary ICT teachers  
„h 10 for graduates to train as secondary physical education teachers  
„h 10 for graduates to train as secondary physics teachers  
„h 15 for people to train and then teach in rural areas where teacher shortages exist.

Applicants may apply for more than one scholarship. These will be promoted by the TeachNZ unit of the Ministry of Education throughout July and August.

Applications for the scholarships close on 4 September.

Successful applicants must enter teaching training by the end of 2001.

The TeachNZ website www.TeachNZ.govt.nz is the first point of contact for people interested in teaching, and there is also an 0800 Teach NZ (832 246) contact number. Intending applicants can either access the site or ring to receive the relevant information and application forms.

The TeachNZ programme also includes active face-to¡Vface recruitment of Maori and Pacific people in their communities as well as a broad information campaign to involved education groups.

¡§This year we have the start of a roll bulge in secondary schools as large numbers move through from primary schools, and this will continue over the next few years,¡¨ Trevor Mallard said.
