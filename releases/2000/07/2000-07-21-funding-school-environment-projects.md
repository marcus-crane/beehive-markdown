Six South Island and 12 North Island schools have been successful in seeking grants from the NZ Glass Environmental Fund.

ACI Glass Packaging provides $20,000 annually from its glass recycling operations to assist schools with environmental projects.

The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, endorsed the latest round of approvals describing projects as "stunning" and "superb". They included water sampling of Ashburton River by Ashburton College, a wetlands rehabilitation scheme by Huntly's Te Wharekura O Rakaumangamanga and a scented and vegetable garden and composting operation by Putaruru's Glenshead Kindergarten.

The grants were decided by a committee drawn from the Ministries for the Environment and Economic Development, Wellington College of Education and ACI. Seven applications were declined because they did not provide either detailed cost breakdowns or sufficient student learning outcomes or involvement. These applications often did not reflect strong community partnership, the committee said.
