Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey today urged tertiary education managers to take a more active role in developing a cooperative and innovative tertiary education system.

Addressing the Association for Tertiary Education Management conference in Auckland Mr Maharey said a decade of competition between New Zealand's universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, wananga and over 800 private providers had not served the nation's interests.

"The challenges for New Zealand in an age of globalisation are enormous and can only be met if our tertiary education system works together.

"If New Zealanders are to be able to foot it in a world where knowledge is of central importance then we cannot afford to waste our resources on fruitless competition."

Mr Maharey said the Government was looking for institutions to clearly define the role they will play in the tertiary education system.

"We will be asking institutions to differentiate themselves from one another and to identify areas of specialisation.

"We will be asking all tertiary providers to meet very high quality standards because New Zealand needs internationally relevant education and research.

"We will also be asking that institutions work hard to be accessible to all students. in particular they need to look at innovative ways of lifting the participation of Mâori and Pacific peoples.

Mr Maharey said that the previous National government had left the tertiary sector in a very weak state.

"It is no secret that many institutions are in a financially-marginal position.

"This Government has already done a great deal to change the situation by providing $664 million in new funding for students through to 2002/03 and an additional $30.5 million to enable fees to be stablisised next year. We will also be announcing plans to support the participation of Mâori and Pacific students later this year.

"But the success of any strategy will depend heavily on quality managers running innovative institutions that are able to meet the needs of New Zealand's economy and society," Steve Maharey said.
