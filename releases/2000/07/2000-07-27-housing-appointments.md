The Minister of Housing Mark Gosche announced appointments to Housing New Zealand and the Housing Corporation today.

"Government is working to reintegrate housing policy and delivery into one agency," said Mr Gosche.

"A step towards this is to provide some common membership between the boards of Housing New Zealand and the Housing Corporation."

Housing New Zealand has two new board members, Auckland business adviser Patrick Sneddon and Ngai Tahu Corporation chief executive Paul White.

Mr Sneddon has also been appointed to the board of the Housing Corporation as has Housing New Zealand's current deputy chairman Roger Bonifant.

Auckland architectural consultant John Hill and employee relations manager Maryann Street have also been appointed to the Housing Corporation board.

Both boards will now have three members in common; the current Chairman Michael Cashin, Roger Bonifant and Patrick Sneddon.

Mr Gosche also announced that current Housing New Zealand chairman Michael Cashin had agreed to a temporary extension of his term.

"Michael has undertaken his position with distinction and his term has been extended to ensure a smooth transition."

Today's announcements follows a decision earlier this year to integrate the boards of Housing Corporation and Community Housing to rationalise the number of housing organisations.
