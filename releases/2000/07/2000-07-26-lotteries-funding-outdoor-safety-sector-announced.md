Almost $6 million in Lottery profits will go to help keep Kiwis safe in the great outdoors this year, Lottery Grants Board Chairperson and Internal Affairs Minister Mark Burton announced today.

"The largest grant of $2 million goes to Surf Life Saving New Zealand for operating and programme costs," Mr Burton said.

Water Safety New Zealand and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard Federation Inc will both receive $1.5 million.

The New Zealand Mountain Safety Council gets $970,000 to meet its 2000/2001 operating and programme costs.

“These allocations are all up on the previous year with the total increase across the four organisations totalling $148,111,” Mr Burton said.
