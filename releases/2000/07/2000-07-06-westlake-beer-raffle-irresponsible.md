Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said it is totally irresponsible for beer to be raffled to raise money for a secondary school's First 15 rugby team.

North Shore City's Westlake High School's First 15 rugby team has been raffling a pallet of beer \[124 dozen] to raise funds for a sporting event.

"This is absurd," George Hawkins said.

"I have been told by the Department of Internal Affairs that it is illegal to offer liquor as a prize in a raffle. Beer is a prohibited prize under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977.

"I have also been informed that the beer raffle has been cancelled.

"Internal Affairs will be investigating this issue and I have asked for a report to be returned to me on the matter as soon as possible," George Hawkins said.

"It is well known that North Shore has its problems with under-age drinking, and teenager parties.

"June on the North Shore is recognised as the School Ball Season. In June alone, North Shore Police were called to six teenage parties. The problems with underage drinking are obvious.

"Over recent months the Police have asked all North Shore schools if officers can visit as part of an education programme to curb under-age drinking. Five secondary schools have responded to the request. Two schools have been interested. Westlake High School has yet to take up the police's request.

"I want to invite Westlake Principal Jim Dale to discuss with Takapuna Police programmes where problems associated with under-age drinking can be addressed," George Hawkins said.

He said secondary schools need to set an example to young teenagers: "and those responsible for organising the Westlake High School beer raffle need to realise that beer is not a suitable prize," George Hawkins said.
