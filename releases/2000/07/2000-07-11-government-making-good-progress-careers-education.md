The Government is making good progress implementing manifesto commitments to improve access to quality careers information and advice, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Mr Maharey met this evening with members of the Careers Practitioners Association of New Zealand to discuss the future of careers and learning services. Ensuring that New Zealanders have access to quality information and advice to assist them to plan their learning and employment careers is a key ingredient in the Government's skills strategy. Mr Maharey said that quality career decision making is central to development of a productive labour market.

"Today workers are likely to change careers, or to seek further education, several times over their working lives. The Government wants to ensure that all New Zealanders can get good quality, impartial advice to assist them to make these study and career choices.

"We are committed to working in partnership with private career advice practitioners, and to boosting the capacity of services provided by government agencies, because the need to see an increase in the general level of skills in our economy is urgent.

"New funding provided in the Budget this year is being targeted at improving the quality of careers information and at parents and teachers who have a key role in ethusing and encouraging young people to make good career planning decisions.

"In addition, new funding has been provided to support Career Services' 0800 CareerPoint information line which provides careers advice over the telephone. CareerPoint has been particularly well used by people in rural communities who have often not had access to good quality careers advice.

"Cabinet is shortly to consider a series initiatives to improve the effectiveness of careers advice to Mäori and Pacific peoples and the Government remains committed to raising the awareness and use of career information, advice and guidance," Steve Maharey said.
