Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins today welcomed the Government's property works programme for schools and said Manurewa schools will benefit from the announcement by over $2 million.

George Hawkins said 12 schools will receive property help over the next year (see attached list).

"The 12 Manurewa schools will receive $1,775,122 for modernisation projects from the Government's school property works programme, and will also get an additional $435,000 for health and safety projects," George Hawkins said.

Nationwide, $403 million will be spent on school property this financial year. That's a $30 million increase from the works programme of the previous Government.

"Students and teachers will benefit from better facilities.

"This Government is committed to supporting schools and to providing students and teachers with a better learning environment as education enters the new millennium," George Hawkins said.

Nationwide, 450 schools will be part of this year's general modernisation programme and will receive funding with an average budget of $215,000.

This is in addition to the 60 schools nationwide which are included in the new five-year property programme announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard last month.

Those schools will enter into agreements with the Ministry of Education to cover all their property expenditure required over a five-year period. By 2005, all schools will operate under this system.

George Hawkins said those schools will still have the option of funding from the Financial Assistance Scheme. The Ministry of Education will call for applications shortly and allocations will be announced in October.

"It is important that the Government supports schools that provide their own money up front to help themselves.

"But this should not be at the expense of centrally resourcing those that cannot," George Hawkins said.

"This boost to Manurewa schools is excellent news for our community.

"It is vital that as our community grows in number and in stature that we provide excellent facilities of education and opportunity for our children," George Hawkins said.
