Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey today celebrated the 10th anniversary of Career Services with staff from around New Zealand attending a training session at the Central Institute of Technology.

Mr Maharey said the importance of effective careers information, advice and guidance is recognised by the new Government and is a key element in its skills strategy. Quality career decision making is central to the development of a productive labour market.

"Skill levels in our society are low by world standards. It is essential that we properly equip New Zealanders to succeed in today's global economy.

"Career Services staff provide comprehensive advice and guidance services which assist New Zealanders to make good study and career choices. The organisation also makes a significant contribution to the work of other career professionals through its work providing training in career industry standards.

"Our ambition for Career Services is that it continues to develop to the point where it is acknowledged within New Zealand, and internationally, as being amongst the best careers organisations in the world.

"Making this ambition a reality will require active support from the Government and we have made a creditable start. New funding provided in the Budget will provide careers information to teachers and parents, keep the KiwiCareers website up to date, and permanently fund the 0800 CareerPoint information line which has been particularly well used by people living in rural communities.

"In addition, Cabinet is to shortly consider a series of initiatives to improve the effectiveness of careers advice to Mäori and Pacific peoples.

"Careers education, and Career Services, can look forward a positive future under this Government," Steve Maharey said.
