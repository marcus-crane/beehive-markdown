"North Korea is participating in the ARF for the first time and I will be meeting the North Korean Foreign Minister to discuss the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.

Mr Goff will also hold bilateral talks with Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov (to discuss bilateral issues, human rights, Chechnya) and with US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright (South Pacific, Middle East) who will both be at the meeting.

After Bangkok, Mr Goff will visit the Philippines, 29-31 July, where talks are scheduled with Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the Secretaries of Justice and Defence, the Human Rights Commission and the President of the Asian Development Bank.
