Home Detention will be extended into the regions of New Zealand, Minister of Corrections, Matt Robson, announced today.

Currently Home Detention is only available in major urban areas, but as from this month, boundaries in these areas will be extended and Home Detention will also be made available in a number of smaller urban and some rural areas.

Serious violent offenders are not eligible for Home Detention. Only offenders who have been sentenced to two years imprisonment or less are eligible.

Non serious violent offenders serving sentences may also apply to be released on Home Detention as they approach their parole period.

"In these cases, Home Detention allows us to monitor offenders more closely as they come to the end of their prison sentence. I'm keen to look at ways of increasing post-release supervision so that we can be sure that former offenders integrate safely back into the community.

“Although Home Detention has only been operating in New Zealand since October last year we are already pleased with how well it’s working. Probation officers on the ground are doing a great job."

"Those less serious offenders who are eligible to serve their whole sentence at home can maintain normal family relationships, continue with their programmes and in some cases their employment. This is our best way of preventing re-offending.

“Home Detention is a positive alternative to imprisonment in some cases. It combines intensively supervised detention programmes while allowing offenders to lead a relatively 'normal' life albeit within the confines of their home. It helps to keep families together,” says Matt Robson.

Three hundred and two offenders have been placed on Home Detention since it started and there are 126 offenders currently under Home Detention supervision.

Home Detention is a unique initiative aimed at combining state of the art electronic surveillance and security with an intensive focus on casework and rehabilitation programmes to reduce re-offending.  
EXPANSION OF HOME DETENTION BOUNDARIES

Boundaries defined by ‘x’ minutes means Home Detention is available in the area from a main centre within a driving time of that many minutes. For example, Home Detention is now available to offenders who live within 40 minutes driving time of Kaikohe but not available to offenders who live 50 minutes drive time from Kaikohe.
