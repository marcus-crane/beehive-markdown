A draft charter for TVNZ will be the priority as development of the Government's broadcasting policy moves to a new phase, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, said today.

The charter is being drawn up under the guidance of a set of objectives agreed by the Government.

"Successive governments have acknowledged a role in ensuring that desired kinds of broadcast content are available to the New Zealand public in addition to what may be provided commercially," Marian Hobbs said. "The objectives that Cabinet has endorsed will guide the development of our broadcasting policies and ensure that public needs are met."

In developing the charter there will be public consultation before final decisions are made, the Minister said.

The objectives agreed by the Cabinet will guide the development of the broadcasting policies to ensure that desired kinds of broadcast content are available to the New Zealand public. They are:

\* Ensuring all New Zealanders have reasonable and regular access to broadcasting representing the uniqueness and diversity of New Zealand life, recognising that the histories and stories of whanau, hapu and iwi are integral to any description of that life;

\* Meeting the information and entertainment needs of as many interests as reasonably possible, including those that cannot be met by commercial broadcasting;

\* Contributing to public awareness of and participation in the political and social debates of the day;

\* Providing for minority interests and increased choice;

\* Encouraging innovation and creativity in broadcasting while aiming to continually increase audience satisfaction with the quality of the content.
