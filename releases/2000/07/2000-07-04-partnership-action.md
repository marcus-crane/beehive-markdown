The new business and regional development programmes launched today are powerful examples of partnership in action, says Associate Minister for Economic Development Pete Hodgson.

"New Zealand is at last joining the rest of the developed world in recognising that there is a role for a modern Government in the development of a modern economy. The ideology that says government has no business with business has been discarded, as all ideologies should be.

"The secret of a good economic development policy is partnership – between central and local government, or government and enterprise. This Government is ready to work with the private sector, communities and local government to create new business and jobs. The programmes launched today are the first in a series of initiatives backing up that commitment with funding and organisation."

The new programmes are:

The Industry NZ Enterprise Award Scheme, which will make awards of up to $10,000 to at least 250 small businesses over the next six months.

The Industry NZ Regional Partnership Programme, which will provide up to. $100,000 to a region for planning and up to $2 million for major regional initiatives to strengthen regional economies.

The Industry NZ Investment Ready Scheme, which will give business a better chance of raising finance in the early stages of development. Its Small Business Investment Readiness component offers training and information about obtaining capital for small businesses. Its Small Business Deal Brokering component provides ideas brokering and deal-making services to encourage private investors to commit funds to new innovative small businesses.

"We'll be monitoring and evaluating the results of these programmes carefully," Mr Hodgson said. "We're determined to get value for taxpayers' money and we'll take lessons from what works and what doesn’t.

"Programmes like these will show that Government can help this country's economy grow. Carefully measured and tested investment, in partnerships, will bring results."
