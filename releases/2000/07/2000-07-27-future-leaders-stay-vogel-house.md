Jim and Carol Anderton will be using Vogel house to host nine students from Christchurch Girls High School this weekend. The students are attending the Model UN conference to be held at Victoria University.

Carol Anderton met them as part of her encouragement of young people to get involved in local body politics on the Christchurch city council. Two of the students regularly attend the committee she chairs.

"The are coming to stay at Vogel house as part of our plan to better utilise the house for the community," Jim Anderton said.

"It is also an excellent example of partnership between local and central government," Carole Anderton said.
