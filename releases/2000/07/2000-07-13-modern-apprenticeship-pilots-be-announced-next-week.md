Details of Modern Apprenticeship pilot programmes, which will provide on-job training for over 500 apprentices over the remainder of this year, will be announced next Thursday (20 July), Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Modern Apprenticeships is a new work-based education initiative, targeted at young people, providing a mentored and supported training pathway into highly valued skills and qualifications. The programme is scheduled to expand nationwide at the beginning of 2001 and aims to provide training for 3000 modern apprentices by 2002.

"Interest in the Government's new Modern Apprenticeships programme has been very high. Over 50 expressions of interest were received from a wide range of organisations to run pilot programmes.

"Business tells us that they particularly like the work-based practical nature of the training Modern Apprenticeships will offer. Apprenticeship Coordinators, who will assist employers to recruit and manage their apprentices, also make taking on an apprentice a viable and attractive option for small and large businesses.

"Modern Apprenticeships are a key response to tackling the skills shortages in our economy and will provide young New Zealanders with the abilities and motivation necessary to succeed in the modern economy," Steve Maharey said.
