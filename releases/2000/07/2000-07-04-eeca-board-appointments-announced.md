Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today announced six appointments to the board of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

Mr Giff Davidson (Chair), a Wellington company director, is a past president of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs, past chairman of the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce and past president and life member of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce.

Mr Mike Underhill (Deputy Chair) is the Hamilton-based chief executive of WEL Energy Group.

Mr Richard Thompson of Wanganui is the president of the Ecologic Foundation (formerly the Maruia Society) and an environmental consultant.

Mrs Susan Paterson of Auckland is a board member of Transpower and Tower Health Ltd and past president of the New Zealand Strategic Management Society.

Mr Bill Smith of Auckland is general manager of Tasman Insulation New Zealand Limited.

Ms Judy Bischoff is a farmer and permaculture expert in Waiuku, South Auckland, an environmental consultant, and a director of EnviroWaste Services Ltd.

All the appointees except Judy Bischoff were on the old board of EECA. The new appointments are for up to three months, enabling the establishment of EECA as a Crown Entity. Until the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 came into effect on July 1, EECA was part of the Ministry of Economic Development.

Mr Hodgson said there had been a good response to the public call for nominations for members of the new Authority and there was scope for bringing on new members in the next three months.

“I’ve opted for short-term appointments and a minimum number of board members because I want to have a good look at all the names that have come forward. This interim board enables the new agency to get started, as it has important things to do."

EECA has a staff of about 30 energy efficiency and renewable energy experts.  
Under its new Act it is setting up the process for a national strategy for energy efficiency and conservation, which must be renewed every five years.

The Act also provides for minimum energy performance standards and energy performance labelling for appliances and other equipment. Officials are due to report to the Government before the end of the year on detailed proposals for energy standards and labelling.

"Energy efficiency and renewable energy got a $3 million boost in last month’s Budget. With the new Act in force EECA now has the chance to make that investment really pay off for energy users," Mr Hodgson said.
