Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Pete Hodgson today announced a new science and technology representative for New Zealand in Germany.

He is German born Christchurch science consultant Dr Udo Benecke.

Dr Benecke has more than 40 years experience in forestry and environmental science and has worked extensively in Germany. In his new role as Coordinator of the New Zealand/Germany Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement Dr Benecke will create opportunities for New Zealand researchers and technology-based businesses to work with their German equivalents. He will also build on formal relationships between the two countries and keep the New Zealand Government informed of science and technology developments in Germany.

"New Zealand’s relationship with the German science and technology communities is very important. Germany is at the forefront of innovation, and New Zealand scientists have established very good collaborative relationships with a large number of world class research groups in Germany," Mr Hodgson said.

"Dr Benecke’s scientific background, diplomacy skills and very good links with the German and New Zealand science sectors make him well suited to keep relations between the two countries moving forward."
