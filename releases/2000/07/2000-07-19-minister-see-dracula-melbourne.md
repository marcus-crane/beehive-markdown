Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard said today she is attending the opening performance of Dracula performed by the Royal New Zealand Ballet, at the Victorian Arts Centre in Melbourne on Thursday, July 20.

"I am very excited to be able to support the Royal New Zealand Ballet in their first overseas tour in nine years" Judith Tizard said.

Dracula presents a fine example of cultural diplomacy, which the government is keen to encourage. "Not only do we want to foster the enormous wealth of creative talent within New Zealand, but we also want to share it with the world," she said.

Royal New Zealand Ballet General Manager, Sue Paterson, was delighted that the Minister and a number of other New Zealand ballet supporters were flying to Melbourne to attend the premiere.

Dracula, sponsored by Air New Zealand, will be performed by the Royal New Zealand Ballet at the Victorian Arts Centre from July 20. Book at Ticketmaster. www.ticketmaster.com.au.

The Minister will meet her own travel expenses to attend the Australian premiere.
