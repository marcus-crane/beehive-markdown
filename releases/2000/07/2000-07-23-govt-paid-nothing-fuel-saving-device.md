A 'fuel-saver' device did not receive Government funding, despite an Act-Party claim that 'the Ministry of Economic Development is wasting money on this.'

Economic development Minister Jim Anderton says Nathan Balasingham approached Industry New Zealand for help, and a specialist assessed the business.

The advice Mr Balasingham was given was that the device would not be marketable without independent proof of its credibility.

Neither Industry New Zealand not the Ministry of Economic Development provided any funding.

Jim Anderton says the Government's approach could not have been better.

"I cannot see what is wrong with a Government agency telling this business not to try marketing the product or attracting capital without independent proof that it works. That advice is good for the business concerned, good for the consumer and good for the Government."
