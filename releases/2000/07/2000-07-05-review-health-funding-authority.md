The Acting Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, today released two reports on the Health Funding Authority.  
Mr Horomia is pleased the Health Funding Authority has made advances in developing relationships with Maori providers and communities. “It is important these relationships are maintained to ensure our people receive consistent health services at a time of significant change in the health sector.  
The HFA is to be disestablished in November 2000 and its functions moved to District Health Boards and the Ministry of Health. Mr Horomia believes the reports are well positioned “to assist health sector agencies establish the responsibilities and accountabilities of District Health Boards and the Ministry of Health."

However, Mr Horomia acknowledged that the sector needed to undertake further work to close the gaps. In the provider report, health providers clearly indicated that there needed to be greater improvement in building relationships and contracting processes.  
"Maori want to participate in decision making. Participation in decision-making is crucial if improvements in Maori health are to be achieved. The government has recognised this through its policy of capacity building. These reports reinforce that kaupapa. The health sector, and all public sector organisations need to take up this challenge" he said.
