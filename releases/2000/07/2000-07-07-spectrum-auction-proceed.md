This week the High Court dismissed an application by Maori to stop the 2GHz radio spectrum auction due to start on Monday 10 July. The Court found that there was no cause of action against the Government.

The Acting Minister of Communications Trevor Mallard has welcomed the court decision.

"With this claim, and the previous claim by IHUG, being dismissed, the auction of 2GHZ spectrum is on track to start on Monday 10 July, as planned," he said.

"It is in the interests of all New Zealanders that the auction proceed without further delay and I am pleased to see that happening," he said.
