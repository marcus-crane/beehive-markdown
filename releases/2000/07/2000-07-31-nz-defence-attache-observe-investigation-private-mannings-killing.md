Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the New Zealand Defence Attache in Jakarta, Colonel Neville Reilly, will be travelling to West Timor this week to observe the investigation into the killing of Private Leonard Manning.

Helen Clark said that a Joint Investigation Team had been formed between the Indonesian Army and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force In East Timor to investigate the killing.

"The Indonesian Army has invited Colonel Reilly to be an observer. Both the United Nations in New York and the head of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor agree that he should observe the investigations.

"The Joint Investigation Team has already commenced questioning suspects and will also be questioning known militia leaders about the incident.

"Indonesia has declared an intention to take all necessary measures to find the killers and bring them to justice. New Zealand regards the investigation and the invitation to New Zealand to observe as positive developments," Helen Clark said.
