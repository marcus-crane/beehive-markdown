Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that New Zealand is donating $200,000 to a UNICEF programme aimed at meeting the health and nutritional needs of children affected by last year's devastating earthquakes in Turkey.

"The UNICEF recovery plan for the children in the Turkish provinces hit by the earthquake is addressing important needs," Helen Clark said while on a visit to the region.

"Many people affected by the earthquake are still living in tents while houses and basic services are rebuilt. Obviously these conditions pose a considerable risk to their health and wellbeing.

"New Zealand has identified the health and nutrition programme of UNICEF's Recovery Plan for Turkey's Children as a high priority programme for our support."

New Zealand earlier made a $250,000 grant to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies to support relief work after the earthquakes.

Helen Clark will meet UNICEF workers during a visit today to Duzce, which will include calls at a school and health centre. Duzce, Bolu, Adapazari, Kocaeli, Yalova, and Kaynasli suffered the bulk of the casualties and damage in the 1999 earthquakes.

"More than 200,000 people are still living in tented camps. The programme New Zealand is supporting is responding to the basic needs of the women and children in those camps, " Helen Clark said.

The programme includes support for primary health care centres, expanded immunisation programmes, disease control measures, and the monitoring of nutritional standards.
