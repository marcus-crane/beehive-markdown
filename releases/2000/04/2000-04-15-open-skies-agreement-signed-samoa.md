A new air services agreement between New Zealand and Samoa will benefit all air travellers the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said from Apia today.

"I am very pleased to announce the signature of a new 'open skies' Air Services Agreement by Samoa and New Zealand,' he said.

"This will ultimately benefit all traders and travellers in the region."

Mr Gosche signed the Agreement with Samoa’s Minister of Transport, the Hon Joe Keil.

The new Air Services Agreement replaces previous arrangements dating from 1978.

“The old Agreement could be said to have passed its use by date”, Mr Gosche said.

"Negotiations with Samoa were held last month after Polynesian Airlines sought access to serve additional routes beyond New Zealand to Australia and points in the South Pacific. Both countries agreed that a new framework was needed in which to further develop air services between and beyond New Zealand and Samoa.”

"Polynesian Airlines is acquiring a new B737 aircraft and the runway at Faleolo International Airport is being lengthened", Mr Gosche said.

"The new Agreement will provide opportunities for maximum benefit to be gained from these developments."

Under the new Agreement, the airlines of each side may operate over any routing and with unlimited aircraft capacity. Liberal provisions for passenger fares and airline ownership are included. Code-sharing is permitted, including on the aircraft of third countries. There is a temporary limitation on the number of airlines of each side that may commence services. At the request of Samoa, it has been agreed that no additional passenger airlines will operate on the route for a period of two years from today’s signature.

"New Zealand’s closest neighbours are in the South Pacific and it is important for a number of reasons, not least the benefit of traders and travellers in the region, that the most open air services arrangements are in place. This new Agreement with Samoa advances that goal and follows New Zealand’s signing of an ‘open skies’ Air Services Agreement with the Cook Islands in January", Mr Gosche said.
