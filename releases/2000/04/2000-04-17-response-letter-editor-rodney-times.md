Hon Sandra Lee, responds as follows:

The Rodney District Council unanimously requested that the Minister of Local Government establish a Review Authority under section 692M of the Local Government Act.  
It was that request that led to the setting up of the Review Authority.  
Section 692W of the Local Government Act allows the Minister of Local Government, on the recommendation of a Review Authority, to appoint a Commission to act in place of a council.  
The Review Authority recommended that the Minister appoint a Commission, under section 692W, to act in place of the Rodney District Council.

Your correspondent is correct to note that Section 721 of the Local Government Act allows the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to appoint a commissioner to exercise the duties and powers of a council where, in the opinion of the Governor General, a council:  
\* wilfully refuses to act in the performance or exercise of the duties or powers reposed or vested in it by or under this Act or any other enactment; or  
\* substantially refuses so to act; or  
\* where a council has requested that provision be made for the temporary exercise of its powers and functions by a person appointed for that purpose.  
The Section 721 provisions were not seen as being legally applicable given the circumstances surrounding the Rodney District Council.

I would also point out that the remaining councillors were not "sacked". They remain as the elected members of the Council. However, they have effectively been "suspended" as section 692ZA provides that:  
"While a Commission is in office, the chairperson of the local authority, and any member of the local authority, shall not exercise or purport to exercise any power, right, or entitlement, or perform or purport to perform any function or duty conferred or imposed on it or him or her in that capacity by this or any other Act, or by any instrument or otherwise and shall not be entitled to be paid in that capacity any salary, allowances, or expenses under Part IVC of this Act".

The holding of a general election for all council positions by March 2001 will remove the existing suspended councillors from their elected positions (although they may, of course, choose to again stand for election). The new elections will restore local democracy to the people of Rodney and will allow the new Council to make a "fresh start".

Please find following a letter to the editor received from a Whangaparaoa  
resident. Does the Minister or her office wish to make any comment on its  
interpretations?  
Thanks  
Pam Tipa

The Local Government Minister’s action in her purported sacking of the seven  
remaining Rodney councillors and her appointing of a commissioner to  
replace, have some serious downsides.  
Firstly, the Local Government Act confers no power on the minister to do  
either, and so both were illegal, no matter how well-intended.  
Secondly, her actions also unprofitably divert attention from what the act  
does better provide for under its Section 721.  
Namely for the Governor-General (not the minister, and only by an order in  
council) to appoint a commissioner to take over the statutory powers and  
duties of the councillors who (note this) remain; and, very pertinently, for  
the Governor-General to make provisions for the commissioner’s performance  
and exercise of those duties and powers.  
Paramount among such provisions would be the commissioner’s appointment of  
committees (like those provided for in S. 692 1 of the Act) consisting of  
councillors and council officers to advise and assist the commissioner in  
his work.

That is, if the councillors are still there; and nowhere does the Act say  
that they cannot or should not be left there when a commissioner is put in  
place.

Rather the opposite.  
Nor does the Act give power to anyone, not even the Governor-General, to sack  
councillors for the reasons being implied by the minister.  
Clearly the Act provides, and wisely provides, for councillors such as want  
to, to remain in place, relieved of the decision-making powers and duties  
but recruited to committees to assist and advise the commissioner who has  
taken over those powers and duties.  
The Act, as it stands, if properly observed, provides the very best for the  
situation we have now in Rodney, and the minister’s purported sacking are an  
unnecessary and unwise waste of knowledge, wisdom, experience and goodwill  
of our individual councillors who, while they have been oftimes unable to  
co-operate sufficiently in the council chamber, are at this time still the  
best resource we have.
