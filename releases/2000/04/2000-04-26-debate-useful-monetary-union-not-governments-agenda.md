"Monetary union is not on the Government's agenda. However the issue is worth  
debating and I welcome the contribution made by Dr Grimes and Sir Frank Holmes,"  
Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

He was responding to the Institute of Policy Studies report - An Anzac Dollar?

"It is a comprehensive document which should stimulate a lively debate. The  
Government will monitor that debate carefully," Dr Cullen said.

The report was commissioned by the Australia-New Zealand Business Council from  
Sir Frank Holmes and Dr Arthur Grimes, the Director of the Institute of Policy  
Studies.
