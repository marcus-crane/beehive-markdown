Finance Minister Michael Cullen says Ericsson is to be congratulated for the $6 million Internet technology deal signed today with Telecom Poland.

"It is an example of the knowledge economy that the Government is keen to encourage," Dr Cullen said.

"New Zealand's future lies in just this sort of advanced technology, high value-added manufacture."

The product, which was developed in New Zealand, allows PC users to surf the Internet and to make and receive telephone calls at the same time using only one line.
