The New Zealand government is providing ongoing grief counselling for the students, teachers and families affected by the tragic school fire last month the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Mark Gosche said today.

Last month 18 teenage girls and their teacher died in the dormitory fire at Tuvalu's national secondary school on Vaitupu Island.

"The fire devastated the tiny population of Tuvalu. It is difficult to grasp the magnitude of the loss suffered - in New Zealand terms it would be the same as if a single disaster claimed the lives of 3500 people," said Mr Gosche.

"No formal request from the Tuvalu Government has been received our Government offered to provide grief counselling to the students, teachers and families affected."

The offer was accepted and a Victoria University psychology lecturer Tony Taylor arrived in Tuvalu last month.

Mr Taylor has spent time in the past co-ordinating grief counselling for cyclone victims in the Cook Islands.

He recently spent two weeks working with Tuvalu health sector representatives and then visited villages and communities with a local support team.

Mr Taylor and his health team visited, listened and talked with members from each village and in Tuvalu including the national secondary school on Vaitupu Island.

Following these meetings those in serious need of assistance were identified and one-on-one counselling sessions set up.

A database has been built up and two local Tuvalu health workers are to receive further training in New Zealand to enable them to provide ongoing counselling assistance.

"I understand that at this stage more than $25000 has been spent on assisting Tuvalu with grief counselling and this help is expected to continue," said Mr Gosche.

"Our hearts went out to Tuvalu when news of the fire arrived in New Zealand. I sincerely hope this small gesture will help ease their pain."
