Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins said the Police's commitment to solving fraud is excellent, with almost 130,000 investigative hours having been delivered since July 1 1999.

"This shows how serious the Police are in their commitment to investigating and solving fraud and crimes of dishonesty in New Zealand," George Hawkins said.

He said this kind of commitment pays dividends in reducing the number of crimes committed and proactively encourages a more honest society.

Police hours dedicated to investigating fraud add up to $9,321,700.00 from July 1 1999 to March 31 2000.

"I am pleased to see the New Zealand Police are as determined to crack crime rings and criminal activity irrespective of whether the crime is considered a blue collar or white collar crime.

"Criminals of all walks of life fall into the same category – they are crooks. And this Government encourages and applauds the Police's efforts to crack down on all types of criminal activity," George Hawkins said.
