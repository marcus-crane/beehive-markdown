There is currently no official electronic version of New Zealand legislation. The Government is taking the next steps in a process designed to remedy that gap," said Attorney-General, Margaret Wilson.

"This announcement signals the next stage in the steps being taken by the Government to improve public access to legislation," said the Minister. "The Government has authorised the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to produce a business case for the development of a system that would provide an authoritative, accurate and up-to-date electronic database of New Zealand legislation, made publicly available over the internet."

"Responses to a 1998 Parliamentary Counsel Office public discussion paper on this issue indicated that many people felt frustration that while they could access legislation of numerous overseas jurisdictions over the internet they could not do so for themselves here at home. It was clear from the submissions received that there was a high level and broad range of interest in improving public access to legislation. A clear majority of submissions felt that a key function of the State was to make official, up-to-date legislation available in both printed and electronic form.

The Government endorses that view."In July 1999, the PCO engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to review the options for improving public access to legislation.

PricewaterhouseCoopers has examined similar systems or proposed systems in New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. Consequently it has recommended

\* PCO Review the requirements for the printing of legislation

\* Review the administrative processes for handling legislative documents in the legislative process

\* Develop a business case for a system that would integrate the drafting process, an electronic database of New Zealand legislation and the provision of public access to the legislation.

"PCO now has been directed to submit the business case on these matters (including detailed costings) to the Government by the middle of this year. If the Government accepts the business case the next phase involves putting that new system into action," said Margaret Wilson.

"This initiative fits well with the Government's vision of being a leader and model user of information technology. It would be an excellent example of what my ministerial colleague, Trevor Mallard has described as the Government walking the talk in harnessing information technology to provide a high quality service to the public."

The PricewaterhouseCoopers report on improving access to legislation is now available on the PCO website at www.pco.parliament.govt.nz.

Copies are also available on request from the PCO at Level 13 Reserve Bank Building 2 The Terrace PO Box 18-070 (04) 472 9639.
