Minister of Justice Phil Goff today released a briefing paper on sentencing reform and outlined in further detail the scope of the sentencing review project he has instructed the Ministry of Justice to undertake.

"In February this year I instructed the Ministry to undertake a major project to review sentencing and parole laws in New Zealand. The end result of this review is to be a major Sentencing Reform Bill, which I expect to be ready for introduction early next year."

"The Bill will establish a legislative framework that emphasises that the punishment must fit the crime. It will achieve consistency in sentencing, and ensure that Parliament’s intentions are reflected in the sentences handed down."

"It will also produce a parole and early release regime that is more transparent and comprehensible."

"The sentencing reform project will be a major overhaul of the fundamentals of sentencing and parole in our justice system and it is crucial that we get it right. The end result will be improved public understanding of, confidence in, and support for the judiciary and the justice system."

"Too often the debate over sentencing has been used as a political football by electioneering politicians. Simplistic solutions like truth in sentencing, mandatory sentences, and sentencing commissions are raised as solutions when often the American models on which they are based have been discredited by experience."

"The current exercise by the Ministry of Justice will be comprehensive, thorough and objective. The select committee process once the Bill is introduced will enable both the public and groups with expertise in this area to have an input into the final shape of the new legislation," Mr Goff said.
