The Government would wait and see what formal proposal dairy farmers had for the future of their industry, Agriculture Minister Hon Jim Sutton said today.Dairy Farmers NZ ? the dairy section of Federated Farmers ? chaired a meeting in Hamilton, which supported the concept of a mega-cooperative and suggested a new structure.

Mr Sutton said he was very interested to see the exact details which would emerge when they had been around the dairy farming community and what response their proposal received.The Government has said it would support dairy industry restructuring if it had farmer support, was in the public interest, and was fair to industry minority groups.
