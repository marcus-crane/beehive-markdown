"The release of background and policy formation papers today will give a clearer picture of how the Employment Relations Bill has emerged in its current legislative form," says Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson.

"The papers in particular reveal  
„h the range and complexity of the issues dealt with  
„h the diversity of the contemporary labour market and employment relationships  
„h the depth of consideration as to policy options and their likely consequences  
„h the consultative partnerships - including that between the Minister of Labour and Associate Minister of Labour - emerging in the course of the development of the Employment Relations Bill."

"The release of these papers provides an insight into the real nature of policy development and its translation into legislative form. Policy formation in an area such as employment relations requires an awareness of the diversity of workplace relations as well as the difficulty often of striking the appropriate balance amongst legitimate competing interests," says Margaret Wilson.

"Finding a balance as well as constructing an employment relations environment which is fairer to those with the least bargaining power is a continuing challenge to Ministers involved in this process."

The Employment Relations Bill is currently before a Select Committee of the Parliament. Submissions on the Bill close 3 May. The Bill is due back into the House on 20 June. The Bill is intended to come into force after its passage through the House on 1 August 2000.
