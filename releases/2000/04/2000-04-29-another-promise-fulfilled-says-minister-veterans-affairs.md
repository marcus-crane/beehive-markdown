The Minister of Veterans' Affairs Mark Burton has announced that the Government is making a one-off grant of $200,000 to the New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans' Association.  
The Association, which is a charitable trust, will be able to use the money to further objectives to assist those veterans who took part in Operation Grapple.  
The announcement was made by Mr Burton this afternoon at the Association's AGM in Palmerston North.

"The Association has been a vociferous advocate for the 528 New Zealand naval personnel who participated in the British Government nuclear testing programme in the Pacific, in 1957 and 1958.

"Research has indicated possible correlation between participation in the tests and the development of cancers. Many servicemen believe there is a link between their radiation exposure and disabilities in their children.  
"The Bolger-Peters Government promised up to $200,000 for legal expenses for a possible class action by New Zealand veterans. That promise was broken.  
"This Coalition Government will honour the pre-election promise to make a one-off grant of $200,000.

"By agreement with the Association, the $200,000 grant will be made to assist the purposes of the Association, including further research and other initiatives to provide support for veterans and their families," Mark Burton said.  
In November last year, the previous government accepted the recommendations of the Inquiry into the Health Status of Children of Vietnam and Operation Grapple Veterans, that these children should have access to medical care and special assistance.  
"I am expecting a report by the end of next month on the implementation of those recommendations," Mr Burton said.
