Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today released details of costs incurred by the Department of Work and Income during its investigation of the charter incident.

In response to Parliamentary Questions Mr Maharey said that WINZ spent $148,505.52 determining how the incident had occurred and on related advice. This comprises $62,360.00 spent on public relations advice, $84,990.52 spent on legal advice and $1,155.00 spent on private investigators. Mr Maharey said he was continuing to closely monitor WINZ as the Government sought to reorient the Department.

"These figures show that Labour in Opposition was right to be outraged by the charter plane incident.

"The whole incident was a fiasco presided over by a do nothing National Government.

"In contrast the current Government has acted to ensure that the problems in WINZ mean that such an incident can never happen again.

"We have made it crystal clear that we want accountability, moderation and public service to characterise everything WINZ does.

"I can reassure the public that WINZ has done exactly what the Government has asked and is working closely with me and my Associate Minister Ruth Dyson to build the kind of organisation that will serve the interests of New Zealanders," Steve Maharey said.
