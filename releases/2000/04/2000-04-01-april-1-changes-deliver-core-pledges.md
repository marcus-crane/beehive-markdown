Pay increases for superannuitants and key changes to the student loan scheme and take effect from this Saturday (April 1), along with an annual inflation adjustment to preserve the value of benefits, Steve Maharey said today.

From April 1 superannuitants will have their pensions increased in line with the commitment card to reverse National's 1999 superannuation cuts. Student loan changes taking effect tomorrow include the freezing of the current student loan interest rate for the coming tax year and a significant increase in the income part-time students can earn while still qualifying for a full-interest write off. In addition, all benefits will rise by 0.51% in line with inflation for the year to December 1999.

"Labour and the Alliance have a clear commitment to ensuring that all New Zealanders are able to participate in their society and achieve their potential.

"April 1 sees many of our core commitment card pledges delivered. We are determined to restore public confidence in the electoral system by keeping our word with the electorate.

"National was prepared to let the position of older New Zealanders get steadily worse but this Government believes that the guarantee of an adequate income in retirement is amongst the most fundamental duties for any Government.

"Students too suffered nine long years of hostile indifference during which time student debt levels spiralled out of control. We have moved quickly to cut the costs to students of tertiary education.

"Using combination of effective economic policies and sound social policies this Government will provide greater security and opportunity. We have inflation-adjusted all benefits to preserve their existing value and we are presently working on a range of initiatives to improve the position of low income New Zealanders," Steve Maharey said.
