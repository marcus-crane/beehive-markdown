Employers who want to take direct responsibility for the health and safety and rehabilitation of their employees will be able to apply to become an accredited employer through the ACC Partnership Programme said Accident Insurance Minister Dr Michael Cullen today.

Cabinet has given the green light to the framework for the programme, which was re-established with the new legislation that returns workplace accident insurance to a single public scheme. The framework will be gazetted and the scheme will take effect from 1 July 2000.

Dr Cullen says the partnership programme gives employers a direct financial interest in maintaining their standards of workplace safety and integrating injured employees back into the workforce.

"We believe the programme will help ACC meet its objectives of promoting injury prevention, workplace rehabilitation, reducing work-related personal injury claims costs and premiums."

Employers who want to enter the ACC partnership programme must qualify under a range of criteria, including:  
„h Positive experience in self-management of occupational health and safety  
„h A demonstrated commitment to injury prevention and rehabilitation  
„h Procedures and resources for the prevention of injury, for claims management and rehabilitation  
„h Demonstrated financial solvency

Dr Cullen says there are two options open to employers ¡V Full Self-Cover and Partnership Discount Plan. "The two plans have different pricing and premium structures, with scope for third party providers as long as employers maintain a direct personal involvement in the claim's progress.

He says there is no room in the new scheme for private insurers. "An important concept behind the scheme is the employers will have responsibility for and a direct financial interest in the safety of their own workplace. They must agree to have no other insurance covering accidents, and they cannot reinsure or contract out of their agreed responsibilities."

ACC will be holding partnership programme briefings beginning 17 April. Employers interested in the programme should contact ACC on 04 918 4088.
