Local Government Minister Sandra Lee says the period of statutory consultation, on the recommendation of the Ministerial Review Authority to appoint a commission of one or more people to run the Rodney District Council, ends at "close of business" tomorrow.

The parties that the Minister has to consult, including the Rodney District Council, have had a period of 20 working days in which to respond to her with their views on the recommendation. That period ends on Wednesday 5 April.

"I realise that there is a real interest in my decision by the people of Rodney, but this is a complex issue. It will not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the outcome for Rodney until after next Monday's Cabinet meeting. Until then, I will give careful consideration to the submissions I receive," Ms Lee said.

A spokesperson for the Minister of Local Government said she was unlikely to make any public comment before next week on any aspect of the Rodney District Council.
