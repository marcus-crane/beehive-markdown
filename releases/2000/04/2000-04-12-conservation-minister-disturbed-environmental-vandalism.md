The Minister of Conservation Hon Sandra Lee says she was disturbed to learn today of an incident of "environmental vandalism"on the West Coast of the South Island involving damage to silver beech trees on public land.

Near Reefton this morning, Police and DOC staff discovered about 20 silver beech trees on public land next to the main highway had been sprayed with florescent paint and drilled with holes that suggested poison may have been inserted.

"Environmental vandalism will be punished to the full extent that the law allows," the Conservation Minister said today.

"The culprit or culprits responsible for damage to the West Coast trees will face vandalism or similar damage-to-public-property charges if they can be identified, and called to account before the appropriate Court," said Ms Lee.
