Trade New Zealand chief executive Fran Wilde has a long record of environmental responsibility, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said yesterday.Responding to criticism of Ms Wilde by Green MP Rod Donald, Mr Sutton said Ms Wilde had his total support."The main theme of Ms Wilde's comments was the need for informed debate on biotechnology and genetic engineering."What has Rod Donald got against that? Why would he wish to suppress informed debate?"Mr Sutton said Mr Donald had a lot of gall to describe anyone else as opininated."Ms Wilde has a record as a proponent of environmental responsibility that goes back a long way. She was a minister of conservation."She has got my total support."
