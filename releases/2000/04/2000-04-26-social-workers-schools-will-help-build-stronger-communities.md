A major expansion of the Social Workers in Schools programme means that from today about 35,000 primary and intermediate schoolchildren will be covered by the scheme, says Minister of Social Services and Employment Steve Maharey.

As the new school term gets underway, an extra 55 social workers will join the 12 already working in schools as part of a pilot programme. The 67 social workers will cover 185 schools located in 29 priority regions across the country. Each social worker will work with a cluster of schools.

Mr Maharey says the Social Workers in Schools programme fits with the Government’s desire to build strong communities in which all children are physically, emotionally and intellectually supported.

It also ties in with the Government’s ‘Closing the Gaps’ strategy which is designed to improve health, education and social outcomes for young Maori and Pacific Islanders.

"Our society demands a great deal from parents but we can’t just expect them to bring up children on their own. Children are the responsibility of the whole community and we need to nurture and look after them outside the home environment as best we can."

"Schools are the ideal place in which to base social workers who can be on hand to help nip family and social problems in the bud before they have a major impact on a child’s growth and development. Their work will be mainly preventative."

"One of the key elements of the initiative is the emphasis on a partnership approach in which the social workers work closely with family/whanau, teachers, health workers and others to resolve problems," says Steve Maharey.

The social workers are not from Child, Youth and Family and they will not be undertaking statutory social work. They are employed by non-government organisations that are approved under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act to deliver social services. The providers were selected through a formal tender process.

The Social Workers in Schools programme has been developed by Child, Youth and Family, and the Ministry of Education, in partnership with the Ministeries of Health, Maori Development (Te Puni Kokiri), Pacific Island Affairs, and the Health Funding Authority.
