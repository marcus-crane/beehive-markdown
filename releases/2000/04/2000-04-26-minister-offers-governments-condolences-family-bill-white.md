The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has expressed his sympathy to the family of Staff Sergeant Bill White following the East Timor accident in which Staff Sergeant White was killed and three other New Zealanders were injured.  
"The tragic death on ANZAC day of a soldier serving his country has particular poignancy.  
"At this time our thoughts are with Bill White's family," Mr Burton said.  
"A full military investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding the incident.  
"But our first priority is to ensure all possible support is available to Bill White's family and that he can be brought home as soon as possible."
