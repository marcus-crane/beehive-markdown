Rimutaka MP and local member Paul Swain is returning to hospital this Tuesday for a planned operation.

This is a final planned procedure following his illness at the beginning of this year.

Paul Swain said that he expected to be out of action for a few weeks but that the recuperation period this time round would be much faster.

In the meantime the Hon. Trevor Mallard will be handling his ministerial responsibilites.
