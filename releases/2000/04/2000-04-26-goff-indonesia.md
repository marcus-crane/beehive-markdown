The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Phil Goff, will meet the Indonesian President KH Abdurrahman Wahid, Foreign Minister Dr Alwi Shihab and other senior Ministers today during a two day visit to Indonesia.

This will be the first bilateral meeting between the two countries since President Wahid came to power last year following Indonesia¡¦s first free and fair elections in over 40 years. Previously, New Zealand¡¦s relationship with Indonesia was constrained by Indonesia¡¦s presence in East Timor and former President Soeharto¡¦s style of Government.

President Wahid¡¦s new government is Indonesia¡¦s best chance in over three decades to embrace democratic principles and values. It provides a good basis for moving the relationship between New Zealand and Indonesia forward.

Among the issues to be discussed will be:

„h the progress of democratic reforms in Indonesia  
„h the future of East Timor refugees in West Timor  
„h the activities of militia in East Timor  
„h the pursuit of prosecutions for human rights violations in East Timor by the Attorney-General  
„h New Zealand¡¦s trade and official development assistance to Indonesia  
„h Developing closer bilateral calls with Indonesia particularly people-to-people contacts.
