Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins has called for New Zealand Police to have a clearly identified and visible presence in our communities and on our roads.

"I am working with Police to obtain a livery that is highly visible. Over time, through replacement, the whole Police fleet will change," George Hawkins said.

New vehicles dedicated to traffic patrol units within each Police District will display 'Highway Patrol' or similar signage in clear distinct lettering on the side of each vehicle.

"Currently, Police, taxis and security vehicles are virtually indistinguishable. Many security firms have their livery similar to police vehicles. New Zealanders will soon see changes.

"Police are currently investigating vehicle livery that is designed to stand out.

"We will ensure that Police vehicles are clearly marked to ensure that they are highly visible and, with the dedicated traffic vehicles, with a name that spells out that core activity," George Hawkins said.

A recent LTSA survey of 1645 New Zealand adults showed New Zealanders believe enforcement is one of the main things to make travelling on our roads safer.

"Therefore, we will have a specialist Highway Patrol that will once again ensure New Zealand roads are well policed and that speedsters and drivers, who have a disregard for others, will be brought to justice.

"The benefits of having visible dedicated traffic units are clear. There will be improvements in the way crash sites are managed, it will elevate the status of traffic enforcement in the Police, and most importantly will be an obvious reminder to all drivers to drive safely while travelling on New Zealand roads," George Hawkins said.
