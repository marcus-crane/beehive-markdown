Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Hon. George Hawkins has welcomed SKY Television's announcement that six Asian channels will be added to its service.

Sky Television in association with World Television Ltd (WTV) has announced four Chinese channels, one Japanese channel and one Korean channel will be available to SKY Digital subscribers in June this year.

"I welcome SKY Television's announcement. It is recognition of the growing importance of the Asian community in New Zealand.

"The Asian channels will provide a vital link between New Zealand's Asian community and events, trends, and issues of regional and worldwide interest," George Hawkins said.

"This announcement will also play a valuable role in keeping the various Asian languages alive.

"I wish to encourage all media to progress ways of broadcasting and publishing issues of interest to people of all races and ethnicities who have settled in New Zealand," George Hawkins said.
