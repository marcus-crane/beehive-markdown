Minister of Police Hon. George Hawkins is encouraged that total recorded crime dropped for the year ending December 1999.

Total recorded crime dropped by 5.1 percent, from 461,677 to 438,074 offences during the 12 months to December 31 1999.

"It is always encouraging to see the incidence of recorded crime reducing, and I wish to congratulate the work of all Police staff for their efforts in fighting crime," George Hawkins said.

Decreases in recorded crimes include: violent offending, robbery, minor assaults, sexual offences, sexual violation, drugs, anti social crimes, and dishonesty crimes. Burglary reduced by 5.5 percent or 4020 fewer offences than the previous year.

"There are however, areas that cause concern," George Hawkins said.

"While recorded sexual violation offences have dropped by 17.5 percent, the Police are solving only 45 percent of these crimes. That's down almost ten percent on three years ago.

"That is not good enough. Criminals who commit such crimes must be caught.

"As Police Minister I am working with police to deliver results in the resolution of crimes. It is excellent that recorded crime is down. Now is the time to solve more crimes and arrest criminals," George Hawkins said.
