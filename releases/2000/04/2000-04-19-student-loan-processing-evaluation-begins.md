Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today announced details of the evaluation he had promised into the processing of student loan applications.

The processing of student loan applications has been dogged by problems this year. Mr Maharey said he has asked the Ministry of Social Policy to determine the reasons why loans processing problems have arisen and what specific steps need to be taken to prevent these problems from arising again.

"Students have been badly affected by problems with loans processing this year. I want to be sure we find out why so we can get on with fixing the problems.

"The Ministry has recommended, and I have agreed, that the evaluation should be led by an outside consultant who will be perceived as neutral on the issues likely to be raised in the evaluation. The Ministry has contracted Karen Erenstrom Associates to lead the evaluation, the costs of which will be met from within the Ministry's existing budget.

"The focus of this evaluation is squarely on making sure students don't have to face the delays they experienced this year.

"The evaluation team will be seeking information from students' associations, representatives of tertiary institutions and relevant government agencies.

"I have asked for the evaluation to be completed as quickly as possible. The Government is committed to spending the remainder of this year getting the process right for the start of 2001," Steve Maharey said.
