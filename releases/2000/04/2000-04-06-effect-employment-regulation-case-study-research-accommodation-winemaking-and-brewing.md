The Minister of Labour, Hon Margaret Wilson, today welcomed as "timely and significant" the release of a recent research report entitled Case Study Research in the Accommodation, Winemaking and Brewing Industries. The research by the Labour Market Policy Group of the Department of Labour together with WEB Research was undertaken and completed last year."By undertaking in depth interviews with employers and employees, the research provides rich, real information on perceptions, attitudes and behaviours," Margaret Wilson said. "It provides a human face to the turbulent changes in employment patterns over the past decade as well as bedding this in a broad and intellectually rigorous research methodology.".

"This report fills a real gap in our understanding of the qualitative, human impacts and experiences of employment regulation," said Ms Wilson.Employment regulation includes legislation such as the Employment Contracts Act, the Holidays Act, and the Health and Safety in Employment Act, as well as regulations such as the minimum wage, and case law. The research was undertaken using a case study methodology in 21 enterprises. Both employees and employers were interviewed, as were peak organisations. Industries were selected because they represented contrasting products and markets, including labour markets. They also provided a mix of high-tech and labour intensive processes, management styles, degree of unionisation of the workforce, large corporate as well as small and medium size enterprises, including iwi enterprises, urban and rural, and markets that were expanding and contracting.The enterprises were asked three main questions:

\* How did they utilise human resources to meet the needs of production; · What influences the choices of employers and employees in the employment relationship; and

\* What part does the regulatory framework play in these choices? "The conclusions of the report have highlighted some substantial issues both at a human level as well as a macro policy level, which I believe are worthy  
of serious consideration as the Government works through its policy programme in the labour area."

Some of the key findings of the report include the following:  
\* The ECA has had important psychological impacts on employers and employees. There is a real perception across all industries that the ECA has strengthened the ability of employers to determine bargaining and working arrangements.

\* There was a pervasive sense amongst employees that employment is insecure, and that for low skill jobs, employers generally offered contracts with  
little or no input from employees. Real negotiation over terms and conditions was more common amongst longer term staff and those with higher skills regarded as "star" employees.

\* Small enterprises in all industries were generally highly informal, with employment regulation often perceived as of little consequence by employers  
or employees.

\* Medium and large enterprises tended to be more bureaucratic and aware of their obligations, with formal systems established for handling employee matters.

The Health and Safety in Employment Act had a significant impact on health and safety thinking in large and medium sized enterprises. Awareness was high, however, compliance was variable.

\* Information is a vital factor in the overall balance of power in the workplace with employees often reliant on employers for information about  
employee rights. However for many employers and employees, understanding of the legislation was limited to 'sound bites', such as "you can't win a PG" or "what the boss says goes".

\* The Holidays Act was generally applied with little difficulty, however difficulties are being experienced with days-in-lieu for casual workers working on public holidays. "The Government intends to review the Holidays Act and the HSE Act this year, as well as working towards a clearer minimum code of employment rights. This research will provide important background nformation to those reviews," said Margaret Wilson.
