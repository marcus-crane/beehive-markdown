Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today welcomed news that Taiwan has cut tariffs on imports of New Zealand lobsters.Mr Sutton said the 25 percent cut in tariffs applied to live, fresh or chilled New Zealand lobsters would be a useful boost to the industry, which last year exported over NZ$12 million of lobsters to Taiwan.

"This issue was most recently taken up with Taiwan at economic consultations last December, and I am pleased the Taiwanese response was positive,"Mr Sutton said. "I'm sure the tariff cut will be warmly welcomed by the New Zealand lobster industry, and it underlines the importance of working with our trading partners to ensure our exporters can operate on a level playing field."Mr Sutton said the tariff cut applied on lobsters exported from 1 April this year to 31 March 2001, by which time he hoped that Chinese Taipei would be part of the World Trade Organisation. Membership of the WTO will lead to further tariff reductions.
