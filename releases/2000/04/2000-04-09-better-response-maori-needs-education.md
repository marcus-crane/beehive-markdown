Material is being sent to schools showing how they can be more responsive to Maori needs and meet the aspirations of Maori for better access to education, said Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia today.

Schools throughout the country are being sent copies of a new booklet called "Better Relationship for Better Learning," which provides guidelines for Boards of Trustees and schools on engaging with Maori parents, whanau, and communities.

"Within this resource there are ways in which schools and boards can get more Maori involved in education like providing training courses for prospective board trustees," Parekura Horomia said.

Within the booklet there is also a Self Review section to help schools to implement the new parts of the National Administration Guidelines.

"The Guidelines offer practical positive steps that schools and boards can take to encourage more Maori involvement and achievement in education," said Parekura Horomia.

"This is just one example of how Government is committed to helping schools to close the gap and improve life outcomes for Maori."
