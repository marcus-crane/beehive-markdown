The Minister of Transport Mark Gosche said today that there are no plans to liberalise A shares in Air New Zealand.

He rejected any suggestions to the contrary.

"The government has done no work on the liberalisation of A shares and has no intention to do so," said Mr Gosche.

No application had been received for an amendment to Air New Zealand's constitution and A share system.
