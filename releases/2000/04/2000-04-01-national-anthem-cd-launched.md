The call by the country’s sporting organisations for more guidance in the singing of our National Anthem has been answered.  
On tonight's Live Lotto draw, singer Frankie Stevens unveiled a new National Anthem CD.  
The Minister of Internal Affairs Mark Burton said that his department, working with the Hillary Commission, has produced the CD which will be sent free to all sporting organisations, stadia and libraries around the country. It will also be published on the Internal Affairs website.

“The CD features four different performances including male and female voices and soloists,” he said. “All of the performances have been successfully used at major sporting events.  
"We are not dictating how the National Anthem should be performed. The CD offers examples which should promote a more consistent approach and encourage New Zealanders to join in with confidence."

Mr Burton said the CD also includes a backing track, arranged by composer/musician David Dell, for use by smaller sporting bodies, schools or community organisations with their own singers. This backing track is not intended for use at any major sporting event.  
The words in Maori and English are included with the CD, along with a musical score.

"The Maori version of the opening verse of the Anthem is sung first in each example, following the successful approach taken by the Silver Ferns. Most Kiwis are familiar with the English words and I hope this CD will now see more people learning the Maori words."  
Mr Burton acknowledged with gratitude that the performers - String of Pearls, Ainslie Allen and Frankie Stevens - all gave their services free, as did the back tracking arranger David Dell.
