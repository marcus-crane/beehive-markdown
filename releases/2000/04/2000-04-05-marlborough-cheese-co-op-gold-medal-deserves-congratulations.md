Parliament today adopted a motion congratulating a small South Island dairy company on beating all comers to win the gold medal for best cheese in the world at the Wisconsin World Champion Cheese Contest.

"Marlborough Cheese Co-operative is a great example for dairy companies and for New Zealand business generally. The country could use more businesses like this South Island champion," said John Wright MP

"The Tuamarina team are creating wealth for the co-operative farmers who own the company, they're responsible for nearly 300 jobs, and they're helping New Zealand pay its way in the world. Last year they earned $28 million in export income which means the country can pay for its imports.

"Marlborough Cheese Co-operative won a gold medal with Koromiko vegetarian cheddar taken straight from the production line ? no special treatment or preparation. That shows clearly the standards of excellence this company meets.

Text of the motion adopted by Parliament at two o'clock:  
That this House congratulates Marlborough Cheese Co-operative Limited on winning the gold medal at the Wisconsin World Champion Cheese Contest for its Koromiko vegetarian mild cheddar that was judged best in the world; notes that the contest is regarded as one of the two most prestigious competitions anywhere for cheese; and further notes that the company employs 50 people directly, takes milk from 81 Marlborough farmers who are responsible for a further 240 jobs, and exports over two-thirds of its production worth $28 million last year.
