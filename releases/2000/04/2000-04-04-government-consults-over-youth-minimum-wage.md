The Labour-Alliance Government is seeking public feedback on options for increasing the minimum wage of 16 and 17 year olds and employees on training contracts.

Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson and Minister of Youth Affairs Laila Harré today announced that the government has agreed in principle to lower the age threshold for the adult minimum wage from 20 to 18.

"We now need input from key stakeholders on options for 16 and 17 year olds and people on training contracts," Margaret Wilson and Laila Harré said.

Under current legislation the minimum wage for 16 and 17 year olds is 60% of the adult wage, $4.55 an hour or $182 a week.

There is no minimum wage rate for employees who have a training agreement with their employer to undertake at least 60 credits of training a year as part of the National Qualifications Framework.

"We are keen to ensure that young people have protection from very low wages and opportunities to train while earning a decent wage," Margaret Wilson said.

The government has decided to consult further on options available for 16 and 17 year olds and those in training.

New Zealanders have until April 14 to submit their views and experiences.

"We realise the consultation time is limited, but the government wishes to ensure that any new regulations are consistent with the introduction of the Modern Apprenticeship Programme in July," Laila Harré said.

As well as seeking public feedback the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Department of Labour will be consulting directly with key stakeholders and conducting focus groups with young people and employers.

A discussion paper on options around the youth minimum wage for 16 and 17 year olds and employees on training exemptions is available at www.youthaffairs.govt.nz.

The public has until April 14 to e-mail feedback to info@youthaffairs.govt.nz.

An Invitation from the Ministers of Labour and Youth Affairs to have your say on:

Minimum Wages for 16 and 17 Year Olds and Those  
Undertaking Training

Government is keen to ensure that young people have protection  
from very low wages and have opportunities to train while working.  
We have already increased the level of the minimum wage (adult and  
youth) and decided, in principle, to lower the age threshold for the  
adult minimum wage from 20 to 18 years of age.

We are now seeking views on which options are best for 16 and 17  
year olds and the level of minimum wage for employees on training  
contracts. Two options we are considering are:

a.Increasing the youth minimum wage for 16-17 year olds by  
raising the ratio of the youth to adult minimum wage rate to  
somewhere between the current level of approximately 60  
percent ($4.55 per hour) to 100 percent ($7.55 per hour); and  
b.Setting the minimum wage rate for those with a training  
exemption somewhere between approximately 60 percent  
($4.55 per hour) and 100 percent ($7.55 per hour) of the adult  
minimum wage.

We are also interested to hear the experiences of those likely to be  
directly affected by these two options.

A discussion paper outlines some of the issues you might like to  
consider before submitting your reply.

Please send your views and experiences to  
info@youthaffairs.govt.nz or mail to Ministry of Youth Affairs,  
Minimum Youth Wage Consultation, P O Box 10 300, Wellington by  
14 April 2000.

We realise this consultation time is limited. This is because we are  
aiming to have any new regulations made in time for the introduction  
of the Modern Apprenticeship Programme in July. We are also  
consulting directly with a range of key organisations including  
employers, trade unions, and youth organisations and conducting  
focus groups with young people most likely to be affected.

Minimum Wages for 16 and 17 Year Olds and Those  
Undertaking Training: Discussion Document

Here is your opportunity to have your say on options the Government  
is considering for the level of the youth minimum wage for 16 and 17  
year olds and the level of the minimum wage for people undertaking  
training.

Government is keen to hear your thoughts on the options being  
considered and how they would affect you.

Below is some background information on the youth minimum wage  
and some issues to consider when thinking about changes to New  
Zealand’s youth minimum wage.

Youth and Adult Minimum Wage

On 6 March 2000, the adult minimum wage (for those aged 20 years  
of age or more) was increased from $7.00 per hour to $7.55 per  
hour. On the same date the youth minimum wage (for those aged  
16-19 years) was increased from $4.20 to $4.55 per hour.

Since its introduction in 1994, the youth minimum wage has equated  
to approximately 60 percent of the adult minimum wage.

Current New Zealand Minimum Wage Rates

Rate/Hour  
Rate /40 Hour  
Week  
Adult Rate (20+ years  
old)  
$7.55 per  
hour  
$302  
Youth Rate (16-19 years  
old)  
$4.55 per  
hour  
$182

On 22 March 2000, Cabinet agreed in principle to lower the age of  
eligibility for the adult minimum wage from 20 years to 18 years of  
age.

Training Exemptions

There is no minimum wage rate for people who meet the  
requirements of a training exemption. This training exemption  
applies to the youth and adult minimum wages for employees who  
have a training agreement with their employer to undertake at least  
60 credits of training per year, linked to the National Qualifications  
Framework.

Options for Consideration

The following options are being considered:

a.Increasing the youth minimum wage for 16-17 year olds by  
raising the ratio of the youth to adult minimum wage rate to  
somewhere between the current level of approximately 60  
percent ($4.55 per hour) to 100 percent ($7.55 per hour); and  
b.Setting the minimum wage rate for those with a training  
exemption somewhere between approximately 60 percent  
($4.55 per hour) and 100 percent ($7.55 per hour) of the adult  
minimum wage.

Cabinet decided to consult further on these options. The following is  
a brief outline of some of the issues you might like to consider before  
submitting your reply.

What is increasing the minimum wage for 16 and 17 year olds  
likely to mean for New Zealanders?

An increase from 60 percent of the adult rate would represent an  
improvement from the current minimum wage rate for some 16 and  
17 year olds. For some this will be an immediate increase in their  
pay. Many of those who gain from an increase will be young people  
who left school early with low levels of skills or qualifications. Maori  
and Pacific people are likely to be a significant proportion of people  
in the group that will benefit.

Increasing the youth minimum wage may encourage some people  
who are not currently seeking work to seek work. It may also  
encourage those currently in work to work harder or increase  
productivity.

On the other hand, increasing the minimum wage may mean that  
young people, especially those with low levels of skills and  
qualifications, find it harder to find work. Employers might prefer to  
hire an adult rather than a youth or just not hire someone at all. Maori  
and Pacific people are likely to be over-represented in this group.

What is setting a minimum wage for those subject to training  
exemptions likely to mean for New Zealanders?

Currently little is known about the use of training exemptions due to  
an almost complete lack of information. Under current policy, no  
minimum wage applies where an employee is undertaking 60 or  
more credits per year of training linked to the National Qualifications  
Framework (equivalent to 600 hours or half a full time course).

Setting a minimum rate payable under training exemptions from the  
minimum wage may mean that some young people and older  
employees currently in training receive an increase in their wage.  
This may encourage some young people to seek training in  
employment. It may also encourage those currently in work to work  
harder or increase productivity. However, this option might also  
mean that an employer is less willing to provide training or  
employment to those in work or those seeking work.
