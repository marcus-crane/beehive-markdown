Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton has welcomed the observation by organic dairy farmer Tom Lambie, who is also the national vice-chairman of Federated Farmers, that biotechnology and organic farming are compatible."Most people, including most farmers, want to be sure the food offered for sale to the public is safe, and is produced by systems that are environmentally sustainable," Mr Sutton said."So naturally there is widespread concern when environmental and other activists claim that biotechnology, including genetic engineering, is dangerous and should be prohibited.

"On the other hand, modern farmers, who are familiar with production systems using sophisticated agricultural chemicals and animal remedies according to scientifically developed safety protocols, can't help but notice that the most vocal opponents of biotechnology also want to end the use of fertilisers such as superphosphate, herbicides such as Roundup, and animal remedies such as worm drenches. These are tools farmers know can be used with complete safety and without which current levels of production could not as a practicable matter be sustained, let alone increased to the levels required by the world's relentlessly growing population."Mr Sutton said most people now knew that genetic engineering was the technology that provided most of the insulin needed to manage diabetes.

"Genetically engineered sheep are being used in the Waikato to produce (in their milk) proteins which it is hoped will provide an effective treatment for cystic fibrosis and emphysema."Mr Sutton said the endorsement of the Waikato GE sheep by a high-profile organic farmer such as Tom Lambie would reassure mainstream farmers that a rational approach to the debate about genetic modification was possible."One does not have to be a fanatical supporter of all or nothing to take part."
