Ten training and business development grants to support private sector development in six Pacific Island countries were announced today by Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade the Hon Matt Robson.

The grants, totalling NZ$388,873 come under the Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS), part of New Zealand¡¦s Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme.

PIIDS is a development programme which relies on private sector initiatives. It provides an opportunity for the New Zealand private sector to be involved in assisting our South Pacific neighbours to meet their developmental needs.

Grants were allocated according to each proposal¡¦s development merit, commercial viability and the likely long-term economic and employment benefits for the recipient country. Proposals were assessed by a panel including development specialists, and New Zealand private sector representation.

Proposals for the next round of PIIDS grants should be sent to the Development Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade by 28 July 2000.

Background Note: The Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS)

The scheme has developed from a combination of the old Pacific Islands Industrial Development Scheme, and the South Pacific Development Assistance Facility (SPDAF). It is funded as part of the New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme.

Basic Objectives Of PIIDS

„h To encourage private sector development in Pacific Island Countries in partnership with the New Zealand private sector.

„h To encourage the development of employment and economic growth in the South Pacific based on Pacific Island economies¡¦ comparative advantages.

„h To encourage New Zealand private sector investment in the Pacific Islands.

„h To facilitate the transfer of knowledge from New Zealand to the South Pacific through the provision of training, marketing, technical, and managerial support.

How the Scheme Works

The scheme aims to meet the needs of the private sector directly. PIIDS has been designed to be flexible with a range of funding options available including training, feasibility, and equity assistance.

There are six separate grants available under the scheme. PIIDS Investment allows for the funding of up to 50% of the cost of a feasibility study to a maximum of $10,000 and may contribute up to $75,000 as an Equity Grant to the new venture on a dollar for dollar basis. PIIDS Development can provide grants of up to $25,000 to facilitate Training Needs Analyses, Training Programmes, Advisory Missions, and Personnel Attachments to New Zealand.

PIIDS proposals are assessed by a panel made up of Development Division staff and an independent private sector consultant during three competitive assessment rounds each year. Proposals are assessed on the basis of their developmental merit, and in the case of PIIDS Investment - their commercial viability.

The total 1999/2000 PIIDS allocation is $1.5 million.
