Prime Minister Helen Clark will represent New Zealand at international summits in Singapore and Uganda, address a sustainable development conference in Germany, and open New Zealand’s embassy in Egypt in the latter part of November.

Helen Clark departs on 20 November to attend the East Asia Summit, in Singapore. Climate change and environmental sustainability have been identified as the main themes of the meeting.

"The inclusion of New Zealand in the inaugural EAS meeting in 2005 was a significant milestone in our relations with East Asia. With this third Leaders’ meeting, the Summit is cementing its place in Asia’s regional architecture. New Zealand’s involvement helps us deepen our relationships in the region.

“New Zealand also sees the EAS as a forum to promote discussion in the region around the UN Alliance of Civilisations initiative to build greater understanding between civilisations and faiths,” Helen Clark said.

After the EAS, Helen Clark will travel to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kampala, Uganda, from 23 – 25 November.

“New Zealand expects CHOGM to send a clear message in support of the restoration of constitutional and democratic government in Fiji and Pakistan.

“The Commonwealth is a unique voice in world affairs. Its approximately two billion citizens are drawn from a broad range of cultures, faiths, and traditions, yet they can speak with a single voice on shared Commonwealth values, including a strong commitment to democracy, good governance and the rule of law.

“Heads of Government will also consider how the Commonwealth can further build on these shared values to promote mutual respect and understanding between faiths and communities.”

“It is also hoped that CHOGM can help build momentum for positive outcomes at the United Nations climate change summit in Bali in December,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark has been invited to speak at the German Sustainable Development Council’s annual conference in Berlin on 27 November. She will also meet Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel and Federal Foreign Affairs Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

“New Zealand and Germany have a strong relationship, founded on extensive links across many sectors.

“My visit is an opportunity to build on German interest in New Zealand’s aspirations to become truly sustainable and carbon neutral, and to highlight the initiatives we are taking on climate change and broader sustainability issues..

“Last year I spoke in Berlin about New Zealand and the European Union being natural partners in a globalising world. Since then, we developed a detailed action plan for co-operation with the EU. Germany is an important partner for New Zealand in Europe.

Helen Clark then travels to Egypt on 28 November for the official opening of the New Zealand embassy in Cairo. She will meet with President Mubarak, the Prime Minister and other ministers, host a meeting for New Zealand and Egyptian businesspeople, and visit the New Zealand Defence Force contingent in the Multinational Force and Observers deployment in the Sinai.

“Our embassy opening in Cairo is aimed at boosting the development of New Zealand’s relationships with Egypt and the wider region. Egypt hosts the Arab League and is an acknowledged leader in the region.

“Egypt has long been an important Middle East trading partner and there is  
potential for increased trade and other exchanges in a wide range of fields.

“New Zealand’s new embassy will boost efforts to build up the bilateral relationship, and facilitate closer collaboration on international issues of mutual concern, including nuclear disarmament,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark returns to New Zealand on 2 December.
