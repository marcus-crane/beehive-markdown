Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today paid tribute to Emma Agnew, and offered her sincere condolences to Emma's family and friends.

"Emma was a future leader of the Deaf community and will be very much missed by Deaf people all over New Zealand, as well as by her family and many friends in Christchurch," said Ruth Dyson.

"I would also like to thank the New Zealand Police and the Ministry of Social Development for the extraordinary lengths they've gone to, giving outstanding support to the Deaf community since Emma went missing on 15 November."
