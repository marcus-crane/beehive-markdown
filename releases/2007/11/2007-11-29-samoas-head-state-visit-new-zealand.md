Samoa’s recently appointed Head of State, His Highness Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi, will make his first official State Visit to New Zealand from 2 - 8 December, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark said Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi who assumed the title Head of State in June this year, would be welcomed by Governor-General Anand Satyanand. He will attend an official lunch at Government House hosted by the Governor-General, and dinner at Premier House.

“The special relationship between New Zealand and Samoa is underpinned by the Treaty of Friendship concluded when Samoa became independent in 1962,’’ Helen Clark said.

“Samoa and New Zealand are close friends and it is an honour to host the Head of State on his first official visit to New Zealand.

His Highness and Helen Clark will view the Tagata o le Moana exhibition at Te Papa, which celebrates Pacific peoples and includes a fine mat presented to the Prime Minister by Tui Atua in 2002.

“The exhibition at Te Papa is a fitting representation of the closeness of the relationship between New Zealand and the Pacific, but particularly with Samoa.

“Samoans have made an important contribution to New Zealand society through their involvement in many fields from sport to politics and the exhibition is in part a celebration of these contributions,” Clark said.

During his official visit, Tui Atua and his wife Her Highness Masiofo Filifilia Tamasese will visit schools they attended in New Zealand – St Patrick’s Silverstream and New Plymouth Girls’ High School respectively. The couple will also undertake official engagements Auckland.

His Highness Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi was appointed on 19 June as the new Head of State for a period of five years. He replaced the late Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II, who passed away in May, and who had been appointed for life under the 1962 Constitution.
