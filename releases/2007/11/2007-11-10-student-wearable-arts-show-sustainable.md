The wearable arts show by students at the EcoExpo in Christchurch was a heartening example of people, especially young people, recognising climate change as an issue we can’t duck, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“It’s emerging as one of the most difficult and far-reaching issues of our generation, and it will be for the young generation who have created the wearable art on display here.”

Jim Anderton said he liked the way some of the students had included their own ideas about the future, and linked New Zealand’s future to the crisis facing our climate, in the wearable art on display.

“And I applaud the way recycled materials have been used to make items that are artistic and creative.”

Jim Anderton said that when people were questioned about what they wanted New Zealand to be known in the world for, some said for our sporting excellence, others for our precious natural environment, and beautiful physical resources, and many wanted New Zealand to be known as a fair and just land of opportunity, where everyone gets a fair go and gets well treated.

“But there was another characteristic of New Zealand that the majority of us wanted to be known for: Our talent, our creativity and our innovation. New Zealanders see ourselves above all else as creative and innovative people.

“We New Zealanders are used to being innovators and pioneers. We have a culture of being open to new ways of doing things; and we can apply that openness and flexibility to the problem of climate change.”
