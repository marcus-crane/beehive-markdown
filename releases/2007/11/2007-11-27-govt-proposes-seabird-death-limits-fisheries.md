The Government today published a document that proposes, as part of its commitment to sustainability, to set limits for the number of seabird deaths in New Zealand fisheries.

Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said the proposed seabird standard outlined goals that would help ensure the future survival of New Zealand’s protected species of albatrosses and petrels. It will do this by setting a seabird by-catch limit that the Government does not want exceeded.

“Consumers and the public want to know their food is produced sustainably. In New Zealand fisheries, this means limiting our damage to the environment and other species, as well as maintaining sustainable catches.

“Seabird bycatch is an area that must be addressed for our fisheries to be both ecologically and financially sustainable over the long-term. Doing this will require a joint effort, involving both government and industry.”

The draft proposals to manage seabird deaths in New Zealand fisheries involve:  
•Setting clear seabird by-catch limits in New Zealand fisheries;  
•Assessing whether a fishery will meet these limits without intervention;  
•If intervention is needed, providing advice on whether regulations are likely to be necessary to meet bycatch limits;  
•An assessment of the type of regulatory intervention required to achieve the seabird by-catch limit;  
•A transparent process for monitoring the fishery’s performance against its seabird by-catch limit.

The best information available to date suggests that in 2004, seabird by-catch in New Zealand trawl and longline fisheries was around 5,500 birds. However, there is uncertainty about the actual number of birds killed, and the scientific model used suggests this could have been as low as 2500 or as high as 7500 birds.

Jim Anderton said that work done in some of the fisheries since then has probably reduced this number.

However, he said that albatrosses and petrels are slow breeders and many of their populations cannot withstand a lot of extra deaths.

The draft proposals suggest a national seabird by-catch limit be set at somewhere between 500 and 2000 birds, and suggests how this should be monitored. The actual number will be set next year by the Minister of Fisheries following consultation.

Jim Anderton said the limit is not proposed as a mechanism to automatically close fisheries once a certain number is reached, but a performance standard for government and industry to work together to achieve. If the standard is not achieved then it is expected to prompt further action and regulation.

The Minister is inviting stakeholders and the New Zealand public to make submissions on the standard. Submissions close on 18 February 2008. Visit www.fish.govt.nz/seabirds for more details.

BACKGROUND  
New Zealand waters host the greatest variety of albatross and petrel species in the world – over a third of the world’s 280 species breed in New Zealand waters. Fishing is one of the greatest threats to these species’ survival.

Albatrosses and petrels forage widely and are attracted to the fish, offal and discards they often find around fishing vessels.

In longline fisheries, they risk getting caught on hooks and drowning as they try to eat bait from the lines. In trawl fisheries, the birds risk hitting the heavy trawl cables as they chase offal and discards behind a trawler; or risk drowning in the net as they try to take fish from it.

Albatross and petrel species typically live a long time and produce few offspring. If a breeding adult dies, the chick almost always dies too, and the remaining partner may take several years to start nesting again with a new partner.

New Zealand’s international obligations  
New Zealand has a number of international obligations around seabirds and fishing. These include:  
•Convention on Migratory Species (CMS);  
•Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP); and  
•FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA).

2004 National Plan of Action  
In response to the IPOA, New Zealand developed a National Plan of Action to Reduce the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in New Zealand Fisheries (NPOA) in 2004.

Its goals are:  
•To ensure the long-term viability of protected seabird species is not threatened by fishing operations in New Zealand waters or by New Zealand flagged vessels in the high seas; and  
•To further reduce the effects of fishing on these species as far as practicable.

The NPOA allowed fishers to manage their seabird by-catch through voluntary Codes of Practice. But it said that if voluntary measures did not work, the government would introduce regulations.

After three years, the voluntary approach has had most success in the Japan joint venture tuna, and ling autoline fisheries.

New measures  
The government is now consulting on regulations and/or processes to achieve its NPOA goals across all New Zealand’s fisheries.

This will involve:  
•Setting clear seabird by-catch limits in New Zealand fisheries;  
•Assessing whether a fishery will meet these limits without intervention;  
•If intervention is needed, providing advice on whether regulations are likely to be necessary to meet bycatch limits;  
•A transparent process for monitoring the fishery’s performance against its seabird by-catch limits.

The only reliable and comprehensive way of checking fisheries against set by-catch limits is through observer coverage and subsequent modelling of by-catch data.

Reliable performance monitoring may mean higher observer coverage than at present, the costs of which will need to be borne by industry. Over time, other monitoring methods (like electronic monitoring) may be allowed as an alternative to observer coverage.

The Ministry of Fisheries’ new ‘seabird standard’ will set seabird by-catch limits for fisheries, and the procedures for monitoring these. These limits will clearly state the level of environmental effect deemed acceptable by government.
