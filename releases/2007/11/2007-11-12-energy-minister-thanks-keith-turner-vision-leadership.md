Energy Minister David Parker has thanked Meridian Energy chief executive Keith Turner for his vision and leadership over the past nine years he has spent at the helm of the state-owned energy company.

Mr Turner has announced he will step down in the New Year, to make way for new blood.

"Keith Turner has been an innovator and visionary in the energy sector," David Parker said.

"He recognised, earlier than most, the important role renewable energy will play in our country’s future and he has sought to prioritise the affordable development of those resources.

"Not only that, Keith has actively sought out new avenues and technologies to keep Meridian ahead of the game, and to make New Zealand more sustainable.

"His departure will be sorely felt, and I will personally miss the valuable insights he brings.

"I wish him all the best in whatever future endeavours he takes on, and I am comfortable that he leaves Meridian in an excellent state to take on crucial challenges such as climate change," David Parker concluded.
