Minister of Health approves $6.05 million funding to support general practice quality

Health Minister David Cunliffe today announced the allocation $6.05 million over the next four years to support general practice quality improvement through the professionally led accreditation system, Cornerstone.

Funding will be available this financial year for more than 700 practices seeking accreditation to the Cornerstone programme run by the Royal New Zealand College of GPs. Practices to be funded need to be affiliated to Primary Health Organisations (PHOs).

Cornerstone accreditation means a practice has met the essential legal and safety requirements for general practice in New Zealand and is undertaking a continuous quality improvement process.

The Cornerstone programme also encourages practices to adopt quality processes that will assist with the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy.

“Cornerstone accreditation confirms a practice is committed to putting patients first, and that its staff and management are truly working as a team,” Mr Cunliffe said.

There are 1100 general practices affiliated to PHOs throughout New Zealand.

Since the College of GPs established the Cornerstone programme in 2004, 271 general practices from Hokianga Health in the far North to Waihope Health Services in Invercargill have undergone the accreditation process.

“A considerable number of practices have shown keen interest in achieving accreditation. That is truly heartening because we need practices providing high standards of care to be able to cope with the changing health needs of New Zealanders,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“New Zealand is recognised internationally as having one of the best primary health care systems in the world. We want to maintain and improve on that record,” he added.
