Targets to boost visitor satisfaction and increase the amount of money visitors spend are part of a new strategy for the New Zealand tourism sector.

The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, a joint government-industry initiative, was launched today by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

“The Strategy sets out a vision for tourism in this country to be valued as the leading contributor to a sustainable New Zealand economy,” said Helen Clark.

“Sustainability is at the forefront of the Labour-led government’s agenda. The Strategy challenges us as a nation to ensure we are economically, environmentally, culturally and socially sustainable.”

Damien O’Connor said tourism's future depends upon sustainability and delivering greater value from each and every visitor to this country.

“Delivering a world class experience, ensuring the sector attracts ongoing investment, protecting and enhancing our environment and ensuring communities work together are the fundamental goals in the Strategy,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Strategy sets new targets to help us measure our progress in delivering our ultimate goal – sustainable tourism.”

Mr O’Connor said that while visitor satisfaction is already high, the Strategy aims to increase the number of international travellers who rate their overall experience of New Zealand as eight or more on a ten point scale.

“The quality of the goods and services we offer is crucial in achieving this goal. We need to ensure New Zealand’s infrastructure supports a quality visitor experience, that our booking services and web information sites are easy to use, and that we are committed to monitoring visitor satisfaction,” said Mr O’Connor.

Other targets include increasing the average amount that visitors spend per night from $130 to $160 and increasing the number of visitors who arrive in the shoulder season (March and April, September and October).

“Tourism is one of the most significant contributors to the New Zealand economy, contributing nine per cent of GDP. Its sheer size and its potential to help transform our economy into one which is more sustainable and of higher value means it is a priority sector for government attention, Helen Clark said.

“We all need to work together towards a sustainable future for our country. I look forward to seeing our goals in the Strategy actioned,” Damien O’Connor said.
