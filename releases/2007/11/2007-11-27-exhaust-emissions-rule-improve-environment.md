The Government is taking a further step towards cleaning up our air quality with the introduction of exhaust emissions standards for used imported vehicles from 3 January next year.

Vehicles entering New Zealand from that date will have to meet minimum emissions standards under the new Land Transport Vehicle Exhaust Emissions Rule 2007. The Rule imposes higher minimum emission standards on all new and used vehicles entering the fleet, bringing New Zealand in line with Japanese and European standards.

“Under the Rule all used vehicles will now be tested before entering New Zealand to ensure their emissions control equipment is working. It will also be illegal to modify any new or used vehicles’ equipment that could cause their emissions to worsen,” said Associate Minister of Transport Judith Tizard.

The Japan 02/04 standard will be the new minimum standard required for all used diesel imports from January next year said Minister Tizard.

“Many of the diesel vehicles coming into this country have already been banned from Tokyo’s roads because of the concern over air quality. The Tokyo Government won’t allow these vehicles on their roads and we are taking the same stance.”

The Rule was modified from its initial draft, released in May this year, following consultation and submissions from a wide range of interested parties. Changes made following stakeholder engagement included removing the requirement that all used petrol vehicles to comply with the Japan 00/02 standard.

“Petrol vehicles built to the Japan 98 standard can continue to be imported into New Zealand next year. The Japan 00/02 standard will be introduced from 2009. This should result in improved air quality and minimise potential economic and social impacts.”

The new Rule also changes the requirements for new vehicles entering the fleet. The current Rule had in some cases allowed delays of up to four years for some standards to come into force. The timeframe has been shortened by two years – a move which is supported by the new vehicle industry.

“The Rule now gives clear guidance to the new car industry that New Zealand will adopt new standards as they are adopted internationally,” Judith Tizard said.

“Emissions from vehicles, particularly older diesel vehicles, are costing the New Zealand environment and costing New Zealanders their health. The HAPINZ Report released earlier this year showed that 500 New Zealanders are dying prematurely every year as a result of vehicle emissions. That number has grown from 399 in 2002. This Rule is an important part of our plan to arrest that trend.”

Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven said that more new cars coming into New Zealand is good news for motorists who can also look forward to driving safer vehicles.
