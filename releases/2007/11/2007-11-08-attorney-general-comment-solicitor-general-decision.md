“While I will not comment on the details of the decision of the Solicitor General, I will say that he has my full confidence,” Attorney-General Michael Cullen said.

“I will act on his recommendation to refer the Terrorism Suppression Act to the Law Commission for consideration.

“I will note, however, that contrary to some of what has been said in recent weeks, the Solicitor General states that the Act has a high threshold for the laying of terrorism-related charges,” Dr Cullen said.

Dr Cullen will make no further comment.
