Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard is pleased to announce the appointment of John Acland as the new Chair of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Board.

Mr Acland, currently the Trust Board’s Deputy Chair, will succeed the retiring Chair, Dame Anne Salmond, who leaves the position today after five years as Chair.

Mr Acland, a member of the board since 2003, is a well-known conservationist and heritage advocate. His practical heritage experience includes the ongoing maintenance of the Category 1 Mount Peel Station Homestead and overseeing the development of the Totara Estate property in North Otago.

Judith Tizard welcomed Mr Acland’s willingness to step up as Chair of the Trust Board.

“John is one of New Zealand's most renowned conservationists and businessmen. His extensive governance experience on the Historic Places Trust Board and before that on the New Zealand Meat Board will bring wisdom and a clear direction to the role that will lead the Board’s work from its already strong base,” she said.

The Historic Places Trust Board has six government appointees and three positions elected by the Trust's subscribing members. It promotes the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand.
