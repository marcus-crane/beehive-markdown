In a clamour to be seen to be supporting technology-savvy older New Zealanders, Sandra Goudie has blamed the Tertiary Education reforms for reducing SeniorNet funding, said Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson and Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today.

"The truth is that they have had a reduction of $317,000 in private sponsorship."

"At no stage did the Tertiary Education Commission undertake to fund SeniorNet for $800,000 per annum and in fact TEC funding for SeniorNet has remained relatively stable over the last few years," said Pete Hodgson.

"We wish SeniorNet well in their discussions with TEC and with the private sponsors, but silly and misinformed statements need to be set straight," said Ruth Dyson.
