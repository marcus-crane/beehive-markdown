The Government wants to see at least 30 percent of all inter-regional freight carried by coastal shipping by the year 2040, Transport Minister Annette King said today.

Ms King today released Sea Change, a draft strategy designed to revitalise and transform coastal shipping services in New Zealand. “At present about 15 percent of freight is carried by coastal services, including the Cook Strait ferries. For too long coastal shipping has been the poor cousin of the transport sector, instead of being interconnected with rail and road, effectively linking all transport modes.

“In the next 10 years, the amount of freight that must be moved around New Zealand is expected to double, putting pressure on the existing transportation system and network,” she said.

“We need to reduce the transport system’s heavy dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“This Government is committed to making New Zealand the world’s first carbon neutral country, and we have announced a raft of initiatives to address climate change. Coastal shipping allows both cost savings and environmental benefits which are not being realised now. If we move more domestic freight by sea, we can reduce congestion on the roads and reduce environmental impacts. The objective of the Sea Change draft strategy is to promote a level playing field for coastal shipping in competing with other transport modes.”

Ms King says the strategy “is not just aspirational. It is also a practical plan for action, and proposes four steps to help transform domestic freight services.”  
•It will establish a Maritime Liaison Unit (MLU) within the Transport Ministry to create a visible focal point for the coastal shipping sector;  
•It will address perceived barriers to coastal shipping interests accessing government funds;  
•It will address the need for government agencies and the sector to work together to increase the supply of skilled workers;  
•It will emphasise the need for information gathering to provide a clear picture of services, their performance and required improvements;  
“I believe the Sea Change strategy will signal a bold new future for coastal shipping in New Zealand, and that it will be the start of a new partnership between the government, coastal shipping providers and other parts of the transport sector.”

Question and Answers

What is Sea Change?

Sea Change is a draft strategy setting out proposed actions to help industry and government transform the domestic sea freight sector so that it can play its part in the overall transportation system. The draft strategy has been produced by officials from the Ministry of Transport in consultation with representatives from maritime transport sector groups. Sea Change is about building an integrated transport network that meets both present and future needs and is aligned to the overall New Zealand Transport Strategy. The development of Sea Change follows the New Zealand Shipping Federation’s report Roadways to Waterways in September 2006, and the Shipping Industry Review in December 2000.

What is the present situation with the carriage of domestic freight by sea?

At present about 15 percent of New Zealand’s domestic freight (measured in tonne-kilometres) is carried by sea.

What are the drivers for moving more freight by sea?

In the next 10 years, the amount of domestic freight that will have to be moved around the country is expected to double and the trickle down implications of this will be significant for the New Zealand transport sector. International shipping is also expected to continue a trend towards larger ships calling at fewer ports. Unless freight can be transferred to coastal vessels, this trend will add to the pressure on road and rail. Another factor is the high dependence of the transport industry on fossil fuels and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Recently the government announced a number of initiatives to address climate change, including an Emissions Trading Scheme. All the overseas evidence is that sea is the most energy-efficient way to move freight. An IMO study in 2000 on greenhouse gas emissions from ships found that shipping contributed to 1.8 percent of the world’s total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

What is the situation in other countries?

Japan, which has similar geography to New Zealand, moves more than twice as much of its domestic freight by sea. In countries of the European Union, which admittedly have larger rivers and a network of canals, the amount of freight moved via water is expected to exceed the amount of freight moved by road within the next 10 years.

Is New Zealand planning to set any targets?

In the draft strategy, it is proposed that by 2040 New Zealand will move 30 percent of its inter-regional domestic freight by sea. This is a realistic target but it assumes that there will some changes within the overall transport sector to allow this to happen.

How will this target be achieved?

The action plan set out in the proposed strategy comprises:  
•A Maritime Liaison Unit (MLU) to provide a point of focus for the domestic sea freight sector. This small unit, based in the Transport Ministry, will be responsible for creating awareness of coastal shipping, and help to keep central and local government policymakers informed about the role that domestic sea freight can play in developing a sustainable, integrated transport network;  
•Improved access to funding to support development of domestic sea freight services by updating criteria and processes for accessing funding;  
•Information gathering to provide a clear picture of services, their performance and required improvements;  
•Workforce initiatives to help ensure skilled personnel are available to provide services.

What impact will this initiative have on other transport modes?

Given that there will be a growth in the amount of domestic freight to be moved in the next years, the Sea Change initiatives will simply absorb some of this new growth. It is expected that domestic sea freight and other transport services, especially rail and road, will become increasingly integrated.

What steps are planned to improve information on freight movement?

The freight study mentioned in Sea Change will be completed by the end of May 2008.

What does Sea Change propose about ‘cabotage’?

In maritime transport, ‘cabotage’ means reserving the carriage of domestic sea freight to local shipping operators. It is a form of industry protection that existed prior to 1994. Sea Change does not propose re-introducing cabotage. Neither does it propose tax breaks in any form, nor tariffs on imported shipping services. The draft strategy is based on the current policy setting. Overseas ships are an important supplement to coastal shipping services in New Zealand. They will continue to be able to carry domestic sea freight when it is done in the course of a voyage through New Zealand to load or unload international goods and passengers at New Zealand ports.
