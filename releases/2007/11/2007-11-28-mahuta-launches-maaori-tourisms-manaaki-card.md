Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta has highlighted the Labour-led government’s commitment to Maaori tourism following the launch of the new Manaaki Card for visitors to Aotearoa New Zealand.

“The growth of Maaori tourism is crucial to the growth of New Zealand tourism, and this Labour-led government is committed to supporting this growth. The Manaaki card is another step forward in promoting some of the best of Maaori tourism and provides tourists with a link back to their homelands,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Manaaki is the art of hospitality and a core value in Maaori society. The card therefore has a distinct kaupapa.

“It’s fantastic to note the key partners of this new venture are proven winners in their specialist fields. With the likes of AA Tourism, Telstra Clear, Intercity and Qualmark, the Manaaki Card has quality support,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Associate Tourism Minister says the Maaori tourism industry is continuing to grow, and with the recent launch of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 - the joint government-industry industry setting out Aotearoa New Zealand’s tourism vision for the future - it bodes well for the indegenous industry.

“We have seen in the last decade, the strong growth of Maaori tourism, from very few operators, to more than 70. Maaori tourism businesses now number more than 350,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“When you have statistics that suggest more than 450,000 visitor have experience some form of tourism relating to a Maaori experience, it tells us that Maaori tourism is a force to reckoned with,” says Nanaia Mahuta. “It’s exciting to know that visitors travelling from all over the world are choosing to get a taste of culture and the Maaori experience.
