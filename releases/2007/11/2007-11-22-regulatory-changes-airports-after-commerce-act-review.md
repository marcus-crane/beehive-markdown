The charges imposed by Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch international airports will now be regulated under the Commerce Act instead of the Airport Authorities Act, Commerce Minister, Lianne Dalziel, announced today.

Lianne Dalziel said the new rules would not control the level of airport charges, but would subject airports to an enhanced disclosure regime, which would include information on how their charges are set based on binding input methodologies (how costs should be calculated) developed by the Commerce Commission.

The Commerce Commission will monitor the way airports are setting charges against non-binding pricing principles and, if it finds stricter controls are needed, they will be able to recommend that further regulatory measures be imposed.

Lianne Dalziel said that the airports are not being required to ‘negotiate’ as the requirement to ‘consult’ with the airlines will be carried forward into the Commerce Act.

“There has been debate for many years over whether airports, as natural monopolies, should be regulated, given that the current arrangements are at the very light-handed end of the regulatory spectrum,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“Next year the Ministry of Economic Development will commission an independent consultant to undertake further work on whether the scope of airports’ coverage should be widened and whether further regulation is required,” Lianne Dalziel said.
