Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the climate change declaration made by leaders at the East Asia Summit (EAS) sends a strong international message that cannot be ignored.

“Regional leaders, including three of the world’s four most populous countries, China, India and Indonesia, have shown they are prepared to stand up and be counted on climate change,” Helen Clark said.

“EAS leaders have expressed support for a long-term global emissions reduction goal to pave the way for post 2012 climate change arrangements. They have also agreed to work towards increasing forest cover in the region by at least 15 million hectares by 2020.

“The combination of high population, fast growth and fragile environments poses big challenges for the region. It is encouraging that the Declaration acknowledges that so many of the problems are interrelated, and so cannot be addressed in isolation.

“The Singapore Declaration on Climate Change, Energy and the Environment adds to the political momentum that’s been building all this year.

“Coming just after the release of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report and just before the Bali climate change meetings, the Declaration is timely.

“With this Declaration following the APEC Leaders Declaration, I am very pleased that such a strong and consistent message has been delivered from the region. It will help to create the right atmosphere for the launch of the next phase of negotiations towards comprehensive post 2012 climate change arrangements.

“New Zealand has worked hard with our partners in the region to achieve this result. This is a message that cannot be ignored,” Helen Clark said.

The third East Asia Summit (EAS) in Singapore involved the ten ASEAN countries, along with leaders or representatives from New Zealand, Australia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea.
