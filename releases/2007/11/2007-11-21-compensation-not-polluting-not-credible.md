“The suggestion by Federated Farmers President Charlie Pederson that farmers should be compensated for being bound by rules on water quality is simply outrageous,” Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

"Where farming is affected by the need to change practices to protect the environment it is not unreasonable to expect help from the Government, which is precisely why we have mechanisms such as the East Coast Forestry Project and Hill Country Erosion fund.

“The Government is investing $175 million over the next five years into the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Plan of Action, with a major focus on nitrogen management and afforestation of erosion prone hill country, so we are playing out part. But to suggest farmers should be compensated for not polluting waterways is simply not credible.

“Farmers, like all industry, must accept responsibility for the effects of their production and sometimes this will mean time and money for farmers, just like other businesses,” Jim Anderton said.

"Charlie takes exception to the possibility that farm production could be capped or restricted, and therefore farm businesses not be allowed to grow. What he clearly fails to understand is that the land and water bodies that farming uses have a carrying capacity and at some point there is a limit to what the system can cope with. We have to accept there are limits to production output and it is not acceptable to keep intensifying production regardless of the impacts.

“In some cases our farming systems are at the limit now, so people have to realise that screwing more out of the system is no longer an option. The suggestion that we should do a cost benefit analysis and trade off the health of Lake Taupo or the Rotorua Lakes for economic development is not acceptable the rest of New Zealand.

“I happen to share Charlie's view that these issues are intergenerational and will take time to fix, but this does not detract from the need to act with urgency. Problems with erosion and nitrification have been known about for decades and too little action for too long has put us behind the eight ball. I appreciate the leadership being shown by others in the farming community who recognise that the world has changed and we just need to get on and improve practice. Lifting the game is all about investing in the value of farming for the long-term.  
“Fed Farmers continually talk about protection of private property rights. They fail to appreciate that the very things that make the RMA costly and time-consuming are the rights of individuals to consultation, participation and appeal, both at planning and concent levels. When power lines are proposed over farm land Fed Farmers have been quick to use RMA processes to frustrate development but when the 'RMA work sock' is on the other foot, they want no one to interfere with their activities. You just can't have it both ways. Personally I'm a strong supporter of central planning, because it can be more efficient, but this means sometimes overriding the rights of individuals and communities, which Fed Farmers oppose.

“One of the biggest deficiencies of the RMA is the quality of planning around rural land, particularly within councils with poor capacity. But we need to be clear that improving this requires more resources for councils, and this can only come from ratepayers. It is therefore ironic that Fed Farmers want better quality planning and yet are also campaigning against rate increases.

“So when you really get down to it, the Federation wants less regulatory oversight and more freedom to keep farming, whatever the consequences. This puts them out of step with other farming leaders who are attuned to the rapidly changing expectations of consumers, export markets, overseas regulators and society at large. If the Federation wants to address its ailing membership, then it needs to enter the 21st century and show true leadership,” Jim Anderton said.

“Farming is first and foremost about using natural resources to generate production, therefore farmers should expect that the Resource Management Act is the primary piece of legislation governing their activities. Without the RMA it would be a wild-west without a sheriff out there, and this cannot be in the longer term interests of New Zealand farming.”
