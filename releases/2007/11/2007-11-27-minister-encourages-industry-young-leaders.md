“Leadership is about having a vision, and inspiring and motivating others towards it,” Jim Anderton said today as he launched the Inspired Futures programme in Christchurch, as part of the Primary Industries 2007 Summit.

This mentoring scheme is to develop new leaders for the future of the primary sector. Fifteen emerging leaders, aged between 20-34, have been selected to be partnered with established senior managers. They were nominated by AGMARDT (the Agricultural and Marketing Research and Development Trust) or associated industry good bodies as outstanding leaders of their generation.

“Nothing happens without leadership,” Jim Anderton said. “The only way we change the world is through individuals taking responsibility for making things happen, imagining improvements and inspiring others to force a path forward.

“An economist whom I admire a lot, John Kenneth Galbraith, said all great leaders have had a single characteristic in common: “the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.

“Your challenge as leaders will be to confront the major issues in the development of our primary industries − to confront what Galbraith calls the ‘anxieties’ people in the primary sector have about its future.”

Jim Anderton said those challenges included how to grow the primary industries; how to meet competition from low cost countries; how to find the innovation, creativity and technological uniqueness to set New Zealand apart in global markets; and how to inspire more skilled New Zealanders to get engaged in the primary industries, where their talents are urgently needed.

He said the Inspired Futures programme is about fostering a new generation of leaders and about existing leaders in the industry passing on their expertise, insight, confidence and advice.

“I want to acknowledge everyone who has brought this programme to this day and to thank particularly those who are offering their time, their talent and their expertise to be the mentors of our future leaders,” Jim Anderton concluded.

With the sponsorship of AGMARDT, and the professional training of the New Zealand Mentoring Centre, the mentoring partners will continue to meet with the selected young leaders through to the middle of next year.
