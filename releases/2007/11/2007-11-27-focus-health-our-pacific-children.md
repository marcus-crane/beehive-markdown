The Paediatric Society's report on monitoring the health status of children highlights that the Labour-led governments investment in primary health care will benefit Pacific children.

"It's important that our children have the best possible start to life and that our Pacific families have access to quality healthcare," said Pacific Islands Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"Since 1999, the Labour-led government's has invested $2.2 billion to lower the cost of primary health care for families, so all New Zealanders have access to affordable primary healthcare."

The average cost of seeing the doctor has fallen by around half and the standard prescription charges have been reduced from $15 to $3.

Pacific families will also benefit from free doctor's visits for their children aged under six. This is part of the government's $8.25 million investment, which will be available each year from 1 January 2008, to general practices that commit to providing free health care for children under six.

“I don't want any parent or caregiver to think twice about taking their young child or children to the doctor because they can't afford it” said Laban.

"As Pacific Island Affairs Minister I am focused on working with Health Minister David Cunliffe, and our Pacific communities and families to ensure our children have access to quality and affordable health care services, which is vital for improving their wellbeing."
