Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen and Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia have been working with central North Island Iwi on proposals for a collective approach to claims over Crown forest land in the region.

The central North Island collective initiative is led by Ngâti Tuwharetoa Ariki Tumu te Heuheu, and includes a number of Iwi with interests in licensed Crown forest land, including Ngâti Tuwharetoa, Ngâi Tuhoe, and those Te Arawa Iwi and Hapû who are not covered by the Affiliate Te Arawa settlement.

"The Crown supports the efforts by Iwi to come together to help resolve some of the issues posed by the settlement of historical grievances in the central North Island. It is a considerable challenge, and if these efforts are successful, it will ultimately benefit all in the region," Dr Cullen said.

"At the same time, the Crown is committed to honouring the Crown settlement offer accepted so overwhelmingly by the members of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapû. I have assured them that they will in no way be disadvantaged by any collective approach that may develop out of these discussions. The Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapû are vital participants in resolving these issues.

“The Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapû and the Crown have agreed that the introduction of settlement legislation should be delayed to allow that collective process to run its course. We have also agreed to a key amendment to the settlement. The Crown will no longer be declared the beneficiary of accumulated rentals for the licensed Crown forest land the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapû will purchase as part of their settlement. Instead, the funds will be held by the Crown Forestry Rental Trust on trust until a specific use and entity is identified that will use the funds for Mâori development.”

Discussions with Iwi representatives are still at an early stage, and the Crown will not be commenting on the content of these discussions until greater certainty has been achieved.
