Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today kick started the biggest New Zealand promotional event ever held in Japan.

The New Zealand Paradise Week promotes New Zealand’s food, wine, fashion, music and tourism activities and aims to encourage more Japanese people to travel to New Zealand.

Mr O’Connor said Japan is our fourth biggest market for international visitors, yet the number of Japanese travelling to New Zealand in recent years has declined.

“A number of factors have contributed to a decline in the Japanese market, including a low awareness of what New Zealand has to offer. Promotional activities such as New Zealand Paradise Week aim to market New Zealand as a fun, exciting, modern place to visit with experiences aplenty and lots to offer international travelers,” said Mr O’Connor.

To address the issue of a decline in the Japanese market the government has initiated a long term strategy to stabilise, grow and increase yield from Japanese visitors.

“The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 set out a vision for tourism in New Zealand to be valued as the leading contributor to a sustainable New Zealand economy. This includes ensuring we deliver a world class visitor experience and ensuring the sector attracts ongoing investment.

“We need to distinguish ourselves as a premier destination and promote our quality visitor experiences which differentiate New Zealand from elsewhere, so we can encourage more international visitors to travel to our country. New Zealand Paradise Week does just that.

“Drawing more international visitors to New Zealand in the shoulder season and setting goals to boost visitor satisfaction and increase the amount that visitors spend per night are fundamental goals in the Strategy,” said Mr O’Connor.

“With tourism being one of the most significant contributors to the New Zealand economy and its potential to help transform our economy into one which is more sustainable and of higher value means it is a priority sector for government attention,” said Mr O’Connor.

New Zealand Paradise Week is primarily funded through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage's Cultural Diplomacy International Programme. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise are also providing support.
