Visuals for the redevelopment of the Whangarei Courthouse were made public today by Courts Minister Rick Barker. The redevelopment forms part of the largest courts capital investment programme in New Zealand’s recent history.

"Courthouses are recognised within the community as symbols of civic duty and it is important that Whangarei has a Courthouse which reflects this sentiment," Mr Barker said.

“This building project will provide a new Jury courtroom and Jury assembly area, additional judicial Chambers and increased custodial facilities.

“The redevelopment will see an additional 1173m2 added to the existing court, and extensive alterations and refurbishment to the court building in Bank Street.

“The redeveloped Whangarei courthouse has been designed to meet the needs of the community both now and in the future.

“As well as being bigger, the courthouse will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology, including video conferencing and evidence recording and transcription services. This will mean increases in court efficiency and better access to justice for all court users.

“Where possible, environmentally sustainable design practices will also be incorporated into the concept for the courthouse. By investing now we are better placed to provide long term savings and solutions to ongoing concerns for our environment in the future," Mr Barker said.

The construction phase of the redevelopment of the Whangarei Courthouse is scheduled to begin in mid 2008 and is expected to be complete by mid 2009.

Over the last eight years five new courthouses have been built and 28 major courthouses refurbished around New Zealand. Four courthouses are currently being built and eight more major refurbishments are either planned or underway.
