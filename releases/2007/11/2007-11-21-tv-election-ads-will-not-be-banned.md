The National Party continues to dance on the head of a pin in trying to create concern over the Electoral Finance Bill through claiming that TVNZ will not be able to run election advertisements during 2008, Justice Minister Annette King says.

“Parliament has no intention of banning election ads on television in election year, so the National Party need not worry. They will be able to have their dancing Cossacks.

“I have asked officials to look at their claim, and if a minor amendment is needed to make it absolutely clear that TVNZ can continue to undertake the activities that they have always been able to undertake under the Broadcasting Act, then we will make sure that happens.”
