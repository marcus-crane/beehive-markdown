Prime Minister Helen Clark and Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the first four areas in New Zealand to trial recycling facilities in public places under the Labour-led Government's Recycling in Public Places Initiative.

Wellington City Council, Far North District Council, Kaikoura District Council and Christchurch City Council will be the first councils to receive government support to set up recycling bins in public places.

Helen Clark said that tourism industry surveys of overseas visitors’ experiences report that the lack of good public waste disposal facilities is one of the most common criticisms received.

“A visible, easily identifiable public recycling facility will help us improve visitor experiences and give more substance to our clean and green reputation.

“Recycling is one of the easy things everybody can do to contribute to greater sustainability and minimise the waste stream. Household recycling is progressing well, but New Zealand needs more public facilities to encourage recycling of waste. This government programme is designed to kick-start a nationwide network of commonly branded recycling bins in public places,” Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said that the government has allocated $4.6 million over three years to establish around 600 public recycling bins throughout New Zealand. The pilot project announced today will cost $1.5 million in the first year to install, operate, and publicise.

"This initiative is one of many sustainability initiatives being progressively rolled out, as part of a broader work programme to lead New Zealand to greater sustainability in our use of resources and our way of life."

“The pilots will serve as a model for recycling in public places for other regions.

“Once the pilots are up and running, and have been evaluated, two more funding rounds for councils will open in 2008 and 2009, and more facilities will be developed across the country,” Trevor Mallard said.
