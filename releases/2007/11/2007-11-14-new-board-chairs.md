Health Minister David Cunliffe today announced the appointment of 19 District Health Board chairs.

Mr Cunliffe has reappointed 13 current chairs, with another two chairs moving to other boards.

There are also four new chairs at Taranaki, Waikato, Canterbury and West Coast DHBs.

“I am looking forward to working with new chairs and wish to thank all current chairs for their contribution over the current term,” said Mr Cunliffe.

“The DHB chair role is demanding, and chairs need to be able to manage and draw together a team of people from a wide range of experience, abilities and backgrounds.”

Chairs who will be moving from their current boards to take up new positions are Pat Snedden who moves from Counties Manukau DHB to Auckland DHB. Mr Sneddon succeeds Wayne Brown who has chosen to focus on his new role as the Mayor of the Far North.

Meanwhile Professor Gregor Coster moves from the West Coast DHB to Counties Manukau.

The four new chairs are: Jerry Rickman, who takes the chair at Waikato DHB from Michael Ludbrook; John Young, who succeeds Hayden Wano as chair of Taranaki DHB; Rex Williams, takes up the chair at West Coast DHB from Gregor Coster; and Alister James, who succeeds Syd Bradley as the Canterbury DHB chair.

“While Mr James was not re-elected at this year’s DHB board elections, I believe he has the necessary skills and experience to take on the chair role,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“His appointment enables these valuable skills to remain at the board table. Continuity was also an important consideration, given that the board will have at least four new members from 10 December.”

“I would like to thank, Michael Ludbrook, Hayden Wano, Syd Bradley and Wayne Brown for the contribution they have made as chairs of their respective DHBs, and to the health sector as a whole, over many years,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“All four are stepping aside to pursue other interests and I wish them well in their future endeavours.”

Mr Cunliffe is awaiting the outcome of the review of conflict of interest matters at Hawke's Bay DHB, before making appointments to that board.

The Minister is currently also considering his appointment to positions at Capital & Coast DHB.

'The health sector the Government spends almost $12 billion on health each year with around 70 percent of that figure devolved to the country's 21 DHBs,' he adds.

DHB boards consist of seven elected members, and up to four members appointed by the Health Minister.

The Minister also appoints the chair and deputy chair from among the elected and appointed membership.

Four of the chairs are elected members (at Bay of Plenty, Tairawhiti, Hutt Valley and Otago DHBs) who were re-elected to their boards in October.

Mr Cunliffe intends to announce further appointments to DHB boards in the near future. The new boards take office on 10 December 2007.

How long will the chairs serve?  
Most of the chairs will be appointed for a three-year term except for Lynette Stewart (Northland), Ian Wilson (MidCentral), Joe Butterfield (South Canterbury) and Dennis Cairns (Southland), who will only be appointed for around two years. This is because appointed board members are only allowed to serve a maximum of nine consecutive years, and these chairs will reach that milestone at the end of December 2009.

Who are the new chairs?  
Jerry Rickman is a consultant to Pricewaterhouse Coopers and is a former partner of Hamilton accountancy firm Beattie Rickman. He served as Waikato DHB’s Acting Chief Executive Officer from May to August 2007. Mr Rickman is an Associate of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand, and is the Chair of Learning Media Ltd and Waikato Regional Airport Ltd. He is also a former Council Member of the University of Waikato.

John Young has been a member of the Taranaki DHB board since January 2002. He has an extensive background in dairying governance, including as a former Chair of Kiwi Co-op Dairies and a member of the New Zealand Dairy Board. He is currently a Director of Port Taranaki Ltd, Auroam Investments Ltd and Parininihi Ki Waitotara Farms Ltd, as well as a Trustee of Venture Taranaki.

Rex Williams has recently retired as the Managing Director of Holcim (New Zealand) Ltd and has significant governance and management experience, both locally and abroad. He is a Council Member of the University of Canterbury, a Director of MainPower New Zealand Ltd, an Advisor to HW Richardson Group Ltd, and a Trustee of the Water Rights Trust and the Styx Living Laboratory Trust.

Alister James joined the Canterbury DHB in 2004. He is a Barrister and former Principal/Partner of Brockett James.

Mr James also served for a significant time on the Christchurch City Council and was a Director of Christchurch City Holdings Ltd.

What is a District Health Board?  
District Health Boards (DHBs) are responsible for providing, or funding the provision of, health and disability services in their districts. There are 21 DHBs in New Zealand and each DHB is governed by a board.

How are boards made up?  
Each DHB board consists of seven elected members, and up to a further four members appointed by the Minister of Health. This structure allows for a range of perspectives, skills and knowledge on each DHB board. The Minister of Health also appoints a chair and deputy chair for each board from among the board’s elected and appointed members. Four of the chairs announced today are elected members.

Are board members paid for their work?  
Yes. Board members are paid an annual fee for their service on the board, and fee levels vary from DHB to DHB (depending on the size and assessed complexity of the DHB). Fees currently range from $16,000 to $26,000 per annum. The board chair and deputy chair receive a higher fee. Board members are paid an additional annual fee of up to $2,500 for each statutory advisory committee they are a member of. Members serving on some other committees (eg, audit, risk and finance committee) also receive an additional annual fee. Members are covered for reasonable expenses associated with board and committee business, such as travel costs.

Who are board members responsible to?  
While most board members are elected by the public, all board members (both elected and appointed) are directly responsible and accountable to the Minister of Health. This is because DHBs are funded by the Government. It is acknowledged though that elected members provide an important community voice on DHB boards.  
Board decision-making is highly transparent. Meetings, agendas and board papers are normally required to be open and available to the public. The DHB’s District Strategic Plan is also subject to a public consultation process, as are many other decisions DHBs make.
