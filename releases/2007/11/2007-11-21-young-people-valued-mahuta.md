Government-led initiatives are at the heart of Aotearoa/New Zealand’s commitment to the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCROC), says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta  
“Aotearoa/New Zealand has led the way on initiatives for children and young people. We have worked hard to ensure that we adhere to UNCROC principles which give our young people better protection of their rights and contributes to a better country for New Zealand’s young people to grow up in,” says Nanaia Mahuta.  
The Minister gave a keynote speech at UNROC’s 18th birthday celebrations, and highlighted what the government, in partnership with communities and non-government organisations like United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are doing.  
“We have been able to mark the progress that New Zealand has made. We all want our children to be safe and nurtured,” says Nanaia Mahuta.  
“We know how important families are to making sure children get a good start in life and are supported in health and other services.  
“One of the key achievements I’m proud to note is the repeal earlier this year of section 59 of the Crimes Act, which has effectively removed the justification of using physical force to discipline children,” says Nanaia Mahuta.  
“It is great to know that we are on the path to providing today’s young people with the services they need to be able to get on and live full lives.  
“We have seen some terrific programmes already coming through, including initiatives like one stop health shops like Waves in New Plymouth, and youth-friendly places like Zeal in Wellington where young people can get together and enjoy different activities,”  
“These are the real signs that we are on the right track. There is still a lot to be done but we it is important to note that the partnerships formed between communities, local and central government, are striving to make sure our young people have the support and guidance they need.”
