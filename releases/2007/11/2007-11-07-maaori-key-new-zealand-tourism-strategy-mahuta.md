The growth of Maaori tourism is crucial to the growth of New Zealand tourism, Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta said today.

“The Maaori Tourism industry continues to grow, and latest statistics suggest more than 450,000 visitors have experienced some form of tourism relating to a Maaori experience, whether through a tour, performance or exhibition, in the past year,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “What is even more exciting is the number of visitors travelling from all over the world who choose to get a taste of culture and the Maaori experience.”

The Prime Minister, Helen Clark and Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today launched the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015. The joint government-industry initiative sets out a tourism vision for Aotearoa New Zealand, and Nanaia Mahuta says this bodes well for the unique niche of Maaori tourism.

“The role Maaori tourism and its contribution to the New Zealand experience has, should not be underestimated,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“When people are coming from the United Kingdom, Australia, China, the United States and Korea, not to mention New Zealanders wanting to get that ‘authentic experience’ to Maaori culture, it is important the industry is supported.

Tourism is one of the most significant contributors to the New Zealand economy, bringing in $18.6 billion a year to the local tourism market. Nanaia Mahuta says the role that Maaori tourism plays is crucial.

“The key for Maaori is that we are caring and managing our environment in the spirit of kaitiakitanga (guardianship), and this has to be an enduring foundation for our tourism sector,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “Welcoming our visitors with mutual respect, sharing our knowledge, stories and beliefs in the sprit of manaakitanga (hospitality) will ensure the experience we offer is world class and benefits both our visitors and our communities.

“There is also the adage of the tourism sector playing a key role in protecting our environment, and taking the lead as an important contributor to a sustainable Aotearoa New Zealand economy.

Nanaia Mahuta is confident Maaori can set a quality benchmark.

“There are many challenges facing Maaori tourism, but we have, in the past six years, seen significant improvements in the Maaori tourism industry, which has resulted in more Qualmark-accredited ventures, not to mention the profile they now enjoy internationally,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “The role of central and local government, together with the private sector is critical in providing the right infrastructure, so visitors can have a genuine experience.

“Maaori tourism is an essential part of the New Zealand tourism experience and the Labour-led Government is committed to providing the support to ensure the continued growth of this vital industry.”
