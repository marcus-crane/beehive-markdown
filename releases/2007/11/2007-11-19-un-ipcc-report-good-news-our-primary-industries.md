The new report from the International Panel on Climate Change is good news for our primary industries if New Zealand seizes the opportunities, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton says.  
“The reassuring news is that we can reverse carbon emissions and that there are real economic benefits from doing so.  
“If New Zealand becomes the first truly sustainable country in the world we will not only reap the potential gains that everyone else reaps but we will also have the opportunity to achieve a unique marketing gain.”  
Jim Anderton is disappointed some business interests risk sabotaging the New Zealand economy by associating with climate change deniers.  
“Climate change is a huge issue for New Zealand’s primary industries.  
“We are more dependent on agriculture exports than any other developed country. More of our production is exposed to climate change than anyone else’s. We are further away from markets than other countries and more exposed to mis-directed carbon control measures such as the spurious ‘food miles’ measure.”  
“When business groups associate with climate change deniers, such as when the Business Roundtable brings Nigel Lawson here, it smears all our primary industries with association. It makes it harder for New Zealand to win a premium in global markets for providing the clean, environmentally responsible products consumers are demanding.  
“When supermarkets are putting ‘food miles’ stickers on their products, we need a better response than telling consumers they are wrong to worry.  
“If the Business Roundtable is actually successful in doing anything about climate change, they will put our most important industries at real risk. We are already being harmed by changes to our climate that are happening now. Next time the Business Roundtable tells you climate change is nothing to worry about, ask farmers on the East Coast how they will cope with further droughts.  
“Business groups that are living in climate change wonderland are retarding the strong efforts which most of our primary sectors are making to prepare for climate change and to take advantage of the business opportunities that the issue presents.  
“The UN report on this issue is highly credible and reflects the best information we have. It is the height of irresponsibility to ignore the best advice available because you simply hope the advice is wrong.  
“But I am very encouraged by the UN’s finding there are economic advantages from acting to reduce carbon emissions. It confirms New Zealand’s primary sectors are on the right track.  
“New Zealand is in a very strong position and we should use our strength to care for our environment and care for the future of our most important export industries,” Jim Anderton said.
