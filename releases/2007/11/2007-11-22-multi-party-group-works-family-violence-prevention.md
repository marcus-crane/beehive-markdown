The Multi-Party Working Group on Family Violence is committed to working together to eliminate family violence in New Zealand, said Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson today.

"The multi-party group is made up of MPs from ACT, the Greens, Labour, the Maori Party, New Zealand First, Progressive and United Future. The group is committed to providing leadership to end family violence and to promote stable, healthy family relationships. All New Zealanders have a role to play in eliminating family violence," said Ruth Dyson.

"The group are working well together and have recently agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding which is a commitment to a sustained and collaborative effort to deal with this complex social issue."

Tomorrow the group will visit family violence related initiatives in South Auckland. The programme includes visits to initiatives that target people at key developmental and transition stages such as Family Start that works with new parents and Mangere Genesis Youth Project Trust who work with young offenders and their families.

The group is also preparing for White Ribbon Day on 25 November 2007. This is the international day when people wear a white ribbon to show that they do not condone men’s violence towards women.

"We also acknowledge the need to recognise New Zealand research that highlights the fact that family violence involves both male and female perpetrators and victims and that more needs to be done to reduce all forms of partner violence, as well as violence towards children," said Ruth Dyson.

The group stresses that violent behaviour of any sort is unacceptable in the home.

"Family violence is such a serious and multi-faceted problem that we all need to work together, at all levels of society, to make New Zealand a safe place for our children and families to grow and thrive."
