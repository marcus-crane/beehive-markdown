Climate Change Minister David Parker and Climate Change Leadership Forum chair Stephen Tindall today responded to requests for further information on emissions trading, by a coalition of lobby groups representing intensive energy users.

The group is asking for reports prepared for the Climate Change Leadership Forum to be made public.

The request comes from the Greenhouse Policy Coalition, the New Zealand Business Roundtable, the Road Transport Forum, the Petroleum Exploration & Production Association, New Zealand Minerals Industry Assn, and the Major Electricity Users Group.

Forum chair Stephen Tindall says the forum is happy to make these reports public within the next few weeks.

"These are reports prepared by government officials at the request of forum members, as they consider some of the questions and challenges raised by the emissions trading framework."

The Leadership Forum is made up of around 30 leaders, experts and key stakeholders from a broad spectrum of business, NGO, and science interests.

Mr Tindall said the forum is a chance for business, non-business interests and government to interact at the highest level.

"The group has come up with valuable feedback for the government to take on board," he said.

David Parker said the government was grateful to the members of the forum for giving up their time to contribute constructively to the development of the emissions trading framework.
