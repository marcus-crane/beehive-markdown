Three-year funding levels for New Zealand’s tertiary education institutions will be announced in early December, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

They form part of wider reforms within the sector which will offer universities, polytechnics and industry training organisations more certainty of funding, and taxpayers additional confidence that they are getting value for money.

“At the same time that universities and polytechnics are finalising their triennial plans with the Tertiary Education Commission, I read a standard doom and gloom message from National's Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison, attempting to spread pessimism. The only person who seems unduly alarmed is Dr Hutchison, as the sector has known about the funding decision for some time. If he could just hold his breath for a fortnight he may be able to make a more informed comment,” said Pete Hodgson

“We are also about to pass legislation that confirms a shift towards even greater responsiveness between educators and those they serve. The legislation will also take into account inflation pressures, expected demographic change, student demand and competing priorities within and outside the education sector.” Pete Hodgson said.
