Prime Minister Helen Clark and Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson tonight announced changes to the Market Development Scheme which make it easier for New Zealand businesses to develop export markets.

Helen Clark said that the Labour-led Government is halving the threshold for claiming reimbursements under the scheme to $10,000. The reduced threshold will be effective from tomorrow.

The Prime Minister made the announcement during her speech at the 2007 New Zealand Export Awards in Auckland tonight.

“Export Year 2007 has seen many events and initiatives involving the government and the private sector to improve New Zealand's competitiveness in the global marketplace.

“These include addressing our skill levels, the capability and capacity of enterprises, technology, productivity, creativity and innovation.

“Today’s announcement follows the major boosts to the Market Development Scheme the government has made in the last 12 months, and means that it is now easier for firms building markets offshore,” Helen Clark said.

Pete Hodgson said that nearly 600 Kiwi companies have had half of their investment in developing international marketing initiatives approved for reimbursement in the last 12 months, and that during this period over $48 million dollars has been approved to businesses operating offshore.

“This scheme is obviously working well, but businesses have told us that the threshold needs to be lowered to help them manage their cash flow and ensure that their efforts to break into international markets are successful. The govt has responded to this request,” Pete Hodgson said.
