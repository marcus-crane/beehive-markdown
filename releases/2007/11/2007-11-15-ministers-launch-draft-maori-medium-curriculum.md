The draft curriculum for Mâori-medium schools Te Marautanga o Aotearoa was launched today by Mâori Affairs and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia and Education Minister Chris Carter.

“Te Marautanga is a world-leading curriculum that is not just a translation of the New Zealand Curriculum for English-medium schools, but comes from a truly indigenous perspective,” Parekura Horomia said.

“Te Marautanga sets the direction for teaching and learning for the 17,500 students in New Zealand’s 350 primary and secondary Mâori-medium schools; schools that use te reo Mâori for all communication, including teaching.”

Chris Carter said Te Marautanga was a partner document to the New Zealand Curriculum, launched by the Prime Minister in early November.

“Both curricula focus on the importance of students gaining knowledge in its traditional sense, and also add the values, skills, and competencies that students need for the 21st century,” Chris Carter said.

“Te Marautanga aims to increase Mâori achievement in all parts of the education system, particularly in reading, writing and mathematics; to increase the number of bilingual and multilingual students in New Zealand; and to strengthen kaupapa mâtauranga Mâori.”

Ministers Horomia and Carter encouraged educators to lead discussions in their local communities about Te Marautanga.

“It’s important that we get feedback and ensure that the needs and aspirations of Mâori are reflected in Te Marautanga, and that it is fully aligned with the Mâori education strategy Ka Hikitia,” Parekura Horomia said.

Consultation on the draft is underway until 22 April 2008. A series of regional workshops will be held to get feedback.
