An Air Force C130 Hercules will fly to Papua New Guinea tomorrow, carrying emergency supplies for victims of severe flooding in the eastern province of Oro, Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“New Zealand is sending two generators, tarpaulins, collapsible water containers, and 500 blankets following a request for assistance from Papua New Guinea,” Mr Peters said.

“The supplies, from stockpiles held by the government’s aid agency NZAID, will help thousands of people in the affected area, who desperately need shelter and clean drinking water,” Mr Peters said.  
“The C130 will have 10 to 12 Defence Force crew, engineers and loaders on board. It will route via Port Moresby and is due to arrive at Girua Airport near Ponpendetta, the main logistical support hub for the relief effort, to unload the supplies on Saturday. The flight is expected back in New Zealand on Sunday evening,” Mr Goff said.

“The Government made an initial contribution of $100,000 last week to help PNG Red Cross replenish its stocks of mosquito nets, tarpaulins, water containers and cooking equipment. Officials in PNG are continuing to assess the most urgent needs, and NZAID are ready to provide further assistance if needed,” Mr Peters said.
