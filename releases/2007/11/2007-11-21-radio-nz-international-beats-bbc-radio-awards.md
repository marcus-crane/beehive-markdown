Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard today congratulated Radio New Zealand International for its outstanding achievement in winning the International Radio Station of the Year Award at a prestigious international competition.

"Radio New Zealand International won the top award at Association for International Broadcasting (AIB) Media Excellence Awards in London today (NZT) - beating international heavyweights like BBC World and the Middle Eastern Broadcasting Network," Trevor Mallard said

"Congratulations to Radio New Zealand International and its small and dedicated team of journalists who can be especially proud of this David versus Goliath outcome. Radio New Zealand International's profile and reputation in covering the Pacific, including the high profile and often turbulent events of recent times, has been deservedly rewarded.

"Radio New Zealand International is a division of New Zealand's national public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand Limited so this is an award that we can all be proud of.

" The acknowledgement of Radio New Zealand International comes at a time when its service is more valued than ever, as it delivers independent news, reporting and programmes to residents of the Pacific as well as listeners in Japan, North America, the Middle East and Europe, and travellers. "

Trevor Mallard also congratulated the broadcaster for winning the AIB's "Most innovative partnership between a local and international broadcaster" in recognition of its close work with Pacific radio stations and local Pacific journalists.

Radio New Zealand International broadcasts in short wave from Papua New Guinea to French Polynesia, covering all the Pacific nations in between. It broadcasts Pacific news and current affairs, business sports and feature programmes as well as relaying Radio New Zealand National. They carry news in seven Pacific languages.

The Association for International Broadcasting (AIB) is an international network of some 25,000 public and commercial radio and television professionals.
