Prime Minister Helen Clark has today conveyed congratulations to Kevin Rudd on the Labor Party’s decisive victory in the Australian Federal Election.

Helen Clark said that she looks forward to working closely with Mr Rudd and his government on the many areas of mutual interest to New Zealand and Australia, bilaterally, regionally and globally.

“Our many areas of co-operation with Australia include developing a single economic market, climate change, strengthening institutions in the South Pacific, improving international trade rules, and making the world a safer place through peacekeeping and promoting inter-faith dialogue,” Helen Clark said.

“The relationship between Australia and New Zealand is of considerable significance to both countries. I anticipate that our close and familiar relationship will continue to flourish under Mr Rudd and his new Labor Government.”

Helen Clark also paid tribute to John Howard's strong commitment as Prime Minister of Australia to building trans-Tasman connections.

“Over more than 11 ½ years as Prime Minister, Mr Howard has been a good friend to New Zealand, and his legacy includes a substantial deepening in the trans-Tasman relationship,” Helen Clark said.
