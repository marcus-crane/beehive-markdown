Setting priorities and planning for the future is at the heart of the Quality of Life Report 2007, launched today by Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta welcomed the release of the report, the third of its kind, which focused on key issues including sustainability, housing, and youth.

“While the primary aim is to provide decision-makers in urban areas particularly, with a greater level of information, I know it will also be valuable for councils, central government and community organisations,” said Nanaia Mahuta

“Sustainable growth is a key issue for councils and communities, and is at the heart of the Labour-led government’s agenda. Being sustainable involves improving the quality of life for today’s generation, without compromising the wellbeing of tomorrow’s generation.”

Nanaia Mahuta also welcomed the report’s focus on housing and on caring for young people.

“One of the issues raised in the Quality of Life Report is housing, where it has noted that home ownership is lowest in some communities, namely Maaori and Pasifika communities, as well as those on lower incomes,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “The government is developing a bill aimed at providing more affordable housing.

“As Youth Affairs Minister, I was also interested to note the report highlighting the importance of our young people. The young are our future and I firmly believe that to achieve in the future, we must look after our young.” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“One of the key things for this report has been the importance of working together. When there is a joint effort put in by local government, central government, and our combined communities, the chances of achieving something that has everyone’s interests at heart, is that much greater.

“The report is comprehensive and well researched, and undoubtedly will be an invaluable resource for councils. I congratulate everyone who have been a part of this very important process,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
