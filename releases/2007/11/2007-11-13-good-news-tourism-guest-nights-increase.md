Data released by Statistics New Zealand showing an increase in total guest nights in short term accommodation is great news for the tourism sector, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

New figures from the Commercial Accommodation Monitor show that the number of guest nights increased 4.1 percent or by 89,000, in September this year compared with September 2006. This is the highest number ever recorded for the month of September since the survey began over 10 years ago.

Most Regional Tourism Organisation areas recorded more guest nights, with the Auckland region showing the largest increase.

“The trend in total number of guest nights has been growing since January last year,” said Damien O’Connor.

“This shows that more visitors, whether domestic or international, are getting out about and exploring New Zealand. This is excellent news for both local businesses and the New Zealand economy.

“The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, which I launched with the Prime Minister last week, set new targets to increase the average amount that visitors spend per night, increase visitor satisfaction and increase the number of visitors who arrive in the shoulder season.

“Two of the fundamental goals in the Strategy are for New Zealand to deliver a world class experience and to ensure the tourism sector prospers by attracting ongoing investment.

“Our clean green natural environment and the associated wide selection of outdoor activities available attract huge amounts of both domestic and international travellers.

“An increase in total guest nights in commercial accommodation flows on to increases in spending on food and activities.

“Tourism is one of the most significant contributors to our economy, contributing nine percent of GDP, therefore it is a priority sector for government attention.

“This latest survey is not only good news for the tourism sector in New Zealand, but for our economy also,” said Damien O’Connor.
