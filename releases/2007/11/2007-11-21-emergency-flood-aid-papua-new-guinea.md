New Zealand is providing emergency funding to help people affected by severe flooding in Oro province in eastern Papua New Guinea, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“An initial contribution of $100,000 will help the PNG Red Cross immediately replenish supplies of mosquito nets, tarpaulins, water containers and cooking equipment,” Mr Peters said.

“We are continuing to monitor the situation in Oro and neighbouring Milne Bay province, and our High Commission in Port Moresby is in regular contact with local authorities.

“The small number of New Zealanders known to be resident in the affected areas are all safe.

“Assessments are being made of the most urgent requirements, and New Zealand is ready to provide further assistance if this is sought. The funding is being made through New Zealand Red Cross, from the regional emergency fund of the government’s international aid agency, NZAID.”

Mr Peters said New Zealand was also giving $500,000 to the World Food Programme (WFP) for relief efforts following Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh, as well as providing $687,000 for flood victims in Viet Nam’s Bih Dinh province.

“The full scale of the disaster in Bangladesh is emerging, and getting humanitarian supplies in to the affected area as soon as possible is the priority. Current estimates put the death toll at 2400, with many more missing.

“WFP is already working with the Bangladesh Air Force to get food to those stranded in areas left inaccessible by the cyclone. Thousands of families have lost crops and livestock, and cannot access clean water.

“In Viet Nam, an estimated 10,000 hectares of rice paddy have been lost in Binh Dinh. Our contribution will help provide 1000 tonnes of rice and maize seedlings to replace lost crops, as well as medical supplies to treat cholera and purify drinking water,” Mr Peters said.
