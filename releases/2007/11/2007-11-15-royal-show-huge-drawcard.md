Every politician in Parliament should visit the Royal Show, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton officially opened the 77th Royal New Zealand Show at the Canterbury Agricultural Pack in Christchurch this afternoon.

He said that at the Paris agricultural fair, which he visited two years ago, every French politician was expected to be there, “kissing cows and shaking sheep”.

“There’s an irony in that - because as a country, we are far more dependent than the French on our agriculture. Yet we let our politicians off the hook from coming here.

“It’s vital to New Zealand because no other developed country in the world earns as much of their national income overseas from agriculture as we do.  
So this show is a celebration of the lifeblood of our economy. It’s a celebration of the farmers I see around this region who are innovating and growing their productivity faster than the rest of the economy.”

Jim Anderton said agriculture was vitally important to all New Zealanders. “If we want to keep buying cars ands ipods, clothes and travel from overseas… then we have to earn overseas income; and our agriculture earns two thirds of it.

“This show is highlighting some of the examples of the high-value production and innovation that’s helping to keep our primary sector strong.”

Jim Anderton congratulated exhibitors, and encouraged people to enjoy the show.
