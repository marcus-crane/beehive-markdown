New Zealand has set bold goals so it can lead the way to carbon neutrality and a more sustainable future, Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey told a US audience in Washington DC.

Steve Maharey’s speech to the Washington Science Policy Alliance, ‘First to see the light – science, society and sustainability in New Zealand’, was hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Mr Maharey shared New Zealand’s unique vision to becoming a sustainable nation, highlighting some of the world-leading science behind our drive to achieve this.

“New Zealand and the United States have cooperated on world-leading research that has greatly enhanced our understanding of global concerns, notably climate change and the depletion of the ozone layer.

“Scientific cooperation is a linchpin of the work that our two countries do together to enhance our understanding of pressing environmental challenges. For example, we have worked together in Antarctica for more than 50 years to investigate how past climate change may impact us in the future.”

New Zealand aims to be a world leader in tackling climate change, with measures ranging from introducing an emissions trading scheme, setting targets to increase the use of renewable energy and encouraging people to use public transport or electrically powered vehicles.

“This science mission to the US not only showcases our work on climate change, but gives us the opportunity to look for US scientists and institutions to collaborate with to continue the challenge to becoming truly sustainable.

“It has also given us the chance to invite world leading US organisations and institutions to look at New Zealand as a place to invest in research and science to develop future strategies for climate change.”
