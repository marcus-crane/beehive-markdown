“When we look at the potential role wood can play in our future − New Zealand’s future and the planet’s future − there is every reason to feel confident,” Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He was speaking at the second annual conference of the Wood Processors Association in Wellington and talked of how the environmental market place is changing. “All over the world right now − and particularly in high value markets − consumers and regulators are growing more aware of environmental issues.

“I feel positive about the future for wood because it has to be part of the solution,” Jim Anderton said. “I’d like to talk about some of the achievements we have been able to record through a strong partnership between government and the wood sector:  
•The RADA centre in Rotorua was established as a centre of excellence for wood processing education and training with $6.4 million dollars of government assistance.  
•The government-backed the FIDA wood processing market development projects to the tune of $1.5 million dollars.  
•We’ve already spent another $1.5 million dollars in the NZWood campaign, with a further $3.3 million dollars to be spent.  
•Another $1.2 million dollars has been spent on a special fund related to improved market access for wood products.  
•The government contributed $2 million dollars towards two professorial positions to teach and research the use of timber in commercial building design.  
•$2.5 million dollars is available to part-fund up to two government buildings that would ordinarily be built in other materials. They will be demonstration projects to show how multi-story buildings can be constructed with wood.  
•And by late next year all government-funded project proposals for new buildings up to four storeys high will require a build-in-wood option at the initial concept stage (with sketches and price estimates). Departments will have to at least consider a build-in-wood option. That will provide a platform for the Wood Processing Association’s members when decisions are being made.

“That is a convincing list of examples of the government’s commitment to play its part in ensuring the industry can take advantage of its own strengths,” Jim Anderton said.

He acknowledged the difficulties faced by wood exporters but also urged the industry to speak out. “When I read our political opponents’ pledges to cut taxes and spend more, I am very clear about what I am hearing: Higher inflationary pressure, higher interest rates, a higher exchange rate for longer, and yet more pressure on exporters.

“If exporters don’t want an even higher exchange rate, it’s time for them to start speaking out about the opposition’s statements that the government should hand out more cash. If you don’t say something about it, you’re not really serious about the exchange rate.”

Jim Anderton concluded by congratulating the Wood Processing Association for the proactive approach it has taken over the last year to the issues the industry faces. “And I congratulate the Association also for engaging positively with me and with the government.”
