Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson welcomed the success of Food Hotel China, held in Shanghai 14 -16 November.

Food Hotel China was the first of three key events organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) under the Food and Beverage Taskforce. It attracted 18 New Zealand companies who participated in the NZTE pavilion and provided them with an opportunity to showcase some of their top food and beverage products, including those from the wine, horticulture, dairy, meat and seafood sectors.

Foodex in Japan (March 2008) and the National Restaurants’ Association Show in Chicago (May 2008) are the two further events scheduled by the Taskforce.

Feedback from companies who attended FHC has been extremely positive.

“Food Hotel China provided exhibitors with a unique platform to showcase their products and the right audiences to pitch them to. In an environment where it is difficult to stand out the New Zealand pavilion created a true presence and made a great impact,” said Pete Hodgson.

Highlights of the event included cooking demonstrations using New Zealand products by celebrity chef, Ray McVinnie, performances by the Pounamu Performing Arts Group, a host of networking opportunities, and exceptional coverage of New Zealand products and involvement in FHC in the region’s media.

New Zealand’s high-value food and beverage exports received a major boost under the Government’s work programme for partnering with industry in July. The Minister for Economic Development announced that $19 million of additional funding over the next four years was to be dedicated to expand in-market assistance for New Zealand food and beverage firms.

Lead by NZTE, the Food and Beverage Taskforce will use this funding to help New Zealand’s food and beverage exporters overcome some fundamental challenges including the small size of New Zealand firms, the cost of establishing new branded products in international markets and New Zealand’s distance from markets.
