The government’s commitment to the roll-out of faster and cheaper broadband service took a significant step forward this week, announced Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe and Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today.

“Cabinet made key decisions on the allocation and auction of spectrum suitable for broadband wireless in the 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands. The decisions mean there are a number of ways for Mâori to participate in the spectrum allocation and take advantage of the economic development opportunity this auction provides,” said Mr Horomia.

“In addition to individuals or organisations participating in the main auction, the government has allocated one nationwide lot for a representative Mâori group as determined by the Minister of Mâori Affairs, and one lot for a managed spectrum park”.

“The allocation of spectrum for Mâori will be key to ensuring Mâori can participate in the knowledge economy, and to assist with the promotion of the Mâori language and culture. A decision on the representative group is expected to be announced next week.

“In terms of the managed spectrum park – this is a new concept for New Zealand and one that I encourage all local iwi and regional Mâori organisations to look at. The managed spectrum park will allow a number of local and regional users to operate services in a band on a shared basis and provides business opportunities for smaller interested parties without them having to face the cost of a major investment in a nationwide lot.”

This week Cabinet agreed to the final details for an auction of radio spectrum suitable for wireless broadband access services, typically internet services, and in the future advanced mobile services. The auction is expected to commence on Tuesday 11 December 2007. The proposed allocation of radio spectrum at the 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands provides significant opportunities for Mâori.

“This auction is a high priority for this government,” said Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe. “It is one of the key policies within our Digital Strategy and an auction date as soon as practicable will ensure early certainty for interested parties planning networks, acquiring sites and scheduling investment in advanced internet services for New Zealanders.”

The Auction Catalogue, outlining the auction rules, lots, deed and conditions of sale is available on the Ministry of Economic Development’s radio spectrum website at www.rsm.govt.nz on Friday 2 November 2007.
