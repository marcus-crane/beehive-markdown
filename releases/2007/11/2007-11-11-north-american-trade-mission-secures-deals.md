The recent trade mission to North America’s Pacific north-west region has resulted in significant value for the specialised manufacturing sector in New Zealand, Trade Minister Phil Goff said today.

The trade mission flew up on Air New Zealand’s inaugural flight to Vancouver and involved visits to that city and Seattle. The mission included 20 representatives from leading New Zealand specialised manufacturing companies, including in aviation, electronics, engineering, marine and plastics.

“The total value of deals concluded during the trip is estimated by trade mission members at US$23.5 million. In addition to this, agency agreements, alliances, marketing agreements, new clients, and potential new contracts have been secured,” Mr Goff said.

“There is big potential for New Zealand exporters in the Pacific north-west, within the wider relationship with key economic partners the United States and Canada. The mission took place as part of Export Year 07.”

Among the successes:

- Auckland-based airport baggage handling company **Glidepath**, which is already working across Canada and the US, consolidated their business with Vancouver International Airport Services Ltd, and further deals are being followed up. Glidepath Chairman Ken Stevens is Business Champion for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Export Year 07.
- **Allison Avionics** from Christchurch are in negotiations with a large balloon manufacturer in North America, for the sale of customized on-board tracking devices.
- Auckland-based car pooling software company **Trip Convergence** secured a draft contract in Seattle and is in talks to establish a pilot project in Vancouver.
- **Windsor Engineering Group**, from Wellington, commenced discussions to establish a pilot project for its kiln dryer technology with Forintek, Canada's national wood products research institute.
- Christchurch-based **Metalcraft Engineering** plans to establish a joint venture with a Seattle manufacturer to have its glass transportation, factory handling and flat glass storage systems manufactured under licence in Seattle for the US market.
- **Cavotec MSL Holdings Ltd**, from Christchurch, received strong interest from three industry groups for its shore power supply and mooring technology.
- Auckland-based **Rocket Lab Ltd** met leading universities and research institutes across Canada interested in suborbital research into areas such as micro gravity, solar physics, high altitude atmospheric research and climate change science.

“The mission showed the possibilities that exist for focused, ambitious and innovative New Zealand companies which are able to identify opportunities in overseas markets,” Phil Goff said.

“We already have a healthy presence in the Pacific north-west region through New Zealand companies such as boat designer Teknicraft, boat jet engine manufacturer Hamilton Jet and Glidepath.

“During the trip I held bilateral and multilateral trade discussions with Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson, Premier of British Columbia Gordon Campbell and provincial ministers, and Mayor of Vancouver Sam Sullivan. In Washington State I met Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen, Cabinet ministers, congressmen and Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels.

“Discussions focussed on pathways to enhanced trade, tourism and people to people relationships. Tourism is set to boom with the new direct Vancouver to Auckland flight.

“We also discussed in some detail: issues of climate change and environmental sustainability, with proposals both for closer political interaction and commercial opportunities for New Zealand companies on the mission to contribute solutions,” Phil Goff said.
