New recycling facilities to be set up in four regions across the country further highlight the government’s commitment to a clean green, 100% Pure New Zealand, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

The Recycling in Public Places Initiative, announced yesterday by the Prime Minister and Environment Minister Trevor Mallard, will see the Wellington City Council, Far North District Council, Kaikoura District Council and Christchurch City Council receive government support to set up recycling bins in public places.

Mr O’Connor said the recycling initiative will not only help protect the environment, one of the areas of focus in the recently released [Tourism Strategy](http://www.nztourismstrategy.com/), but it will also enhance our image as a clean green nation.

“One of the key goals in the [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.nztourismstrategy.com/) is to ensure environmental sustainability. It is our natural environment and the associated selection of outdoor activities available that make our country such a major attraction for visitors,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Strategy highlights the need for waste management practices to improve to bring New Zealand into line with the standards in many of the countries our international visitors come from. This includes providing recycling services in public spaces.

“Reducing waste and engaging with local, regional and national agencies that provide waste management standards and facilities are key components of the Strategy and it is great to see that the government and local councils are showing leadership in this area.

"Sustainability is at the forefront of the Labour-led government’s agenda. This recycling initiative is one of many projects being rolled out over time as part of a broader work programme to lead New Zealand to greater sustainability.

“Not only will initiatives such as this one protect our environment, they will also contribute to our ultimate goal for the sector – sustainable tourism,” said Mr O’Connor.
