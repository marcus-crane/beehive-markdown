Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor leaves today for a nine day visit to London and Japan.

In London the Minister will attend the World Travel Market and the United Nations World Travel Organisation (UNWTO) Ministers’ Summit on Tourism and Climate Change.

The World Travel Market is considered one of the world’s leading travel trade events that draws the attention of tourism industry people from all over the world.

“The Summit is a key part of an international programme to widen and deepen the debate on one of the biggest challenges facing the tourism industry,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Tourism Strategy 2015 which the Prime Minister and I launched this week, highlighted the importance of sustainability in the tourism sector. This visit is an opportunity to deepen New Zealand’s exposure and voice our position on a range of important international issues such as climate change, sustainability and the concerns of long haul destinations.

Mr O’Connor will then travel to Tokyo to speak at the 34th Japan-New Zealand Business Council meeting and open the 100% Pure New Zealand Lifestyle Festival.

The Festival aims to showcase New Zealand food, wine, fashion, tourism and music and in doing so, promote New Zealand travel experience to Japanese travel consumers.

The Minister will also attend the WorldSkills Leaders Forum in Shizuoka to support the “Tool Blacks”, the New Zealand team competing at the 2007 WorldSkills Competition. WorldSkills competitors are aged between 18 – 22 and are working in their trade or undertaking an apprenticeship.

“The Labour-led government is committed to improving achievement in education, building a skilled workforce and lifting business productivity. Our investment in programmes such as the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme and Industry Training highlights this commitment. I am looking forward to supporting our young people who are ambassadors for both their trade and New Zealand youth,” said Mr O’Connor.
