Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour Party’s annual conference continued to re-enforce that Labour-led initiatives were working for all New Zealanders.

“This is a clear indication that the Labour-led Government is making progress well into its third term, and in doing so is ensuring that the needs of all New Zealanders are taken into account,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Prime Minister’s keynote speech for the conference highlighted the progress which has already been made, with regards to key issues like the economy, and sustainability, not to mention the leadership being made with regards to Treaty of Waitangi issues and the reconciliation of historical injustices.”

Nanaia Mahuta, who is also Minister of Local Government, said the Labour-led Government is showing the leadership in setting up the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance.

“Auckland is very important to the country’s economic development, and Labour is leading the way with trying to identify the issues, and once more, to get some crucial feedback, which can allow Auckland to move forward,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Labour-led Government has showed the way with paid parental leave for working parents, introducing four weeks holiday so families get that time together, as well as the Working for Families tax credits which is delivering for thousands of families.

“We have also seen the benefits for our Maaori and Pacific Island communities, including help for those wanting to save for retirement. Kiwisaver has been a fantastic success for savers.

“What we’ve seen through the Labour Conference is the importance of working through issues together – something the Labour-led Government has provided clear and responsible leadership, and it is resulting in benefits for all New Zealanders.”
