“ King Country is a great piece of New Zealand and the Labour-led government’s support of local community projects will go a long way to protect our native fauna,” said MP for Tainui Nanaia Mahuta.

She says nearly $40,000 in government grants was going to the Dibble Trust Partnership in Pirongia, King Country.

“The newly announced government funding will go towards a range of initiatives and I am delighted that King Country will benefit from this initiative,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The Dibble Trust getting $39,500 for forest restoration on a fragile wetland and kahikatea swamp near Pirongia, West of Te Awamutu, and for a management plan for a kahikatea stand and wetland on a Waikato farm.

"Across the country, kiwi, geckos, blue penguins and coastal seabirds are benefiting, along with the wetlands, coastal habitats and forests that are their homes," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"King Country community organisations, businesses, DoC workers and enthusiasts all play a vital role in pest management and biodiversity recovery programmes – it's a constant battle to ensure sustainability for New Zealand native forests and wildlife.

The grants are from the Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds, which aim to improve the prospects of native species and habitats living on private land. The local projects are amongst over a hundred around the country sharing in grants totalling $2.68 million, announced last week by Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Acting Environment Minister David Parker. Further support comes from around $3.2 million in funds and volunteer hours from landowners, local and regional government and others, bringing the total current investment to almost $6 million.

“I am pleased to endorse the work of my ministerial colleagues to work alongside the community and with landowners to make a difference for our natural landscape and native species. Aotearoa New Zealand is a great place to live and we want to continue that unique identity,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
