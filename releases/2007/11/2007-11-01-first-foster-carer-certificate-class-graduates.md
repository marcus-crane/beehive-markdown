Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services today congratulated the first graduates of the New Zealand Family and Foster Care Federation course for foster carers.

"I am pleased to be able to celebrate the achievements of the foster carers graduating today; they represent a huge step for all caregivers.

"It is fitting that the graduation is taking place during Foster Care Awareness Week. I am pleased to see that the course requires carers to prepare a self care plan as part of the assessment, which fits in well with this year's theme which is 'Look after Yourself'."

"What we, as a nation, are saying by having a nationally recognised qualification for foster parents, is that being a foster parent is a profession; it demands a special set of skills and a special kind of person. It recognises the status of the work they do."

Graduates were each presented with the National Certificate in Whanau/Family and Foster Care (Level 4) at the Nga Hau e Wha National Marae in Christchurch.

Fifty people received funding support from Te Kaiawhina Ahumahi, the social services industry training organisation, to undertake the course.
