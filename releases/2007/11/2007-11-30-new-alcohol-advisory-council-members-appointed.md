Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor today announced the appointment of two new members to the Alcohol Advisory Council (ALAC).

“I am pleased to welcome Anne Hobby and Dr Helen Moriarty to the Council. They bring considerable experience in the health sector, particularly in the treatment of alcohol dependence, and in youth and public health,” said Mr O’Connor.

Anne Hobby is the Manager of Te Rapuora O Te Waiharakeke Trust, a Maori Health and Social Services agency in Blenheim. She has extensive experience in the provision of services for alcohol dependence and addiction, and public and mental health.

Helen Moriarty is a senior lecturer and Co-ordinator of Drug and Alcohol Education in the Medical School at Otago University, Wellington. She is a medical practitioner with experience in alcohol and drug issues including in the treatment of dependence, rehabilitation, addiction, general practice, public health and public health policy.

“We are seeing too many examples in the media of the harm that alcohol abuse can cause. New Zealand's drinking culture must change so that drunkenness is no longer socially acceptable and we are looking to ALAC to help bring about this change.

“ALAC have recently developed a new Strategic Direction to tackle this huge challenge. The skills that Anne and Helen bring are particularly important in bringing about change to our drinking culture.

“The government also recently announced a package of proposals to address youth drinking and to tighten the rules around liquor advertising.

“With the festive season upon us it is timely to remind people who wish to drink alcohol to enjoy it safely and in moderation,” said Mr O’Connor.
