Good evening and thank you for the invitation to close Buddle Findlay's sustainability seminar series.

Over the past months, this series has heard a great deal about the Labour-led government's sustainability agenda. The Prime Minister launched this series in May, with a speech on why our government is placing so much emphasis on sustainability. You have heard from David Parker and Dave Brash on the thinking behind emissions trading.

Tonight I want to tie all of this together and speak about the big picture and the impact our sustainability agenda will have on the whole of the New Zealand economy, especially over the medium to long term.

I want to discuss the very real economic threats posed by climate change that demand our action.

I want to discuss the opportunities that addressing those threats will create for our economy and our society.

But through it all, I want to focus on the absolute need for leadership at all levels if we are to make the most of the sustainability challenge.

As I speak to you tonight, the Leader of the Opposition is making his first trip to Antarctica, travelling alongside New Zealand's Climate Change Minister David Parker. In many ways, the earth's polar regions have served as the canary in the coal mine in the climate change debate. The images of melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, and isolated wildlife have been the tipping point for individuals all over the world in coming to the conclusion that climate change is real and that it is happening now.

For John Key, the canary was of an altogether different variety, characterised more by concern about the public's frosty reaction to National's climate change policies in political polls rather than warming temperatures at geographical poles. But I have no doubt that Mr Key will return from his Antarctic photo op as a publicly professed true-believer in the dangers of climate change. The transformation of his 'brand' from passionate climate change denier, to reluctant agnostic, to emissions-cutting evangelist, to fully-fledged guardian angel of the planet will be complete in all but substance.

I raise this not just to make a political point, although a very serious political message sits behind my characterisation of Mr Key. I raise it in order to contrast it with the genuine leadership that I believe the Labour-led government has provided on sustainability since 1999. I raise it in contrast to the leadership that businesses and communities have shown on this issue.

But most of all I raise it because I believe strongly that it is real leadership that is required from us all if we are to make the most of the opportunities greater sustainability provides. There are still calls from some quarters for New Zealand to follow and free-ride on climate change. This would not only mean missed opportunities, but it would mean certain damage to our economy and our society.

In other words, leadership on sustainability is a necessity.

Some of the clearest evidence of this came from the Stern Review, released in October last year. It showed that if climate change is left uncontrolled, global GDP could fall by as much as 20 per cent per head. Countries like New Zealand that are so dependent on our primary sector would be particularly vulnerable.

But even if you don't look at the numbers, the threat of rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns no longer seem as distant as they once did

It is true that New Zealand is only a very small contributor to global emissions. But those who are still calling for New Zealand to free-ride on the back of the efforts of other nations completely misunderstand the way climate change is influencing purchasing decisions around the world and will increasingly influence the competitiveness of firms.

There is a growing understanding of the challenges posed to our exporters by the misleading food miles debate, which must be seen as a warning to all New Zealand businesses. Our long-term economic competitiveness will be increasingly grounded in the success of our clean and green national branding. If we expect people to continually buy our products, if we want a steady increase in the number of foreign tourists who fly to New Zealand, and if we want to be seen as an acceptable place for foreign investment, we cannot allow any questions about our sustainable credentials to linger.

We must pursue sustainability in every way and we must be seen internationally to be pursuing sustainability in every way. That means support for domestic policy like the Emissions Trading Scheme, home insulation programmes, sustainable government procurement, energy efficient building code changes, waste minimisation, public transport investment, renewable energy generation, and energy conservation campaigns.

Again, the threat is real - to our economy, to our environment, and to our way of life. And it is leadership on all levels - from families, from business, and from government - that is required to combat it.

The incentives to act, however, are more than just negative. The seizing of the sustainability challenge provides enormous opportunity. In fact, the pursuit of sustainability provides an opportunity to fully transform our economy.

Already, New Zealand businesses are proving to be world-leaders in sustainable practice.

Air New Zealand is trialling biofuels  
The wine industry wants all its businesses in accredited sustainability schemes by 2012  
Sustainability is at the core of the new tourism industry strategy  
Our agricultural industries are supporting the research and innovation which will help lower their greenhouse gas emissions.

The Bank of New Zealand has announced plans to be carbon neutral by 2010, while Westpac in March launched a Green Home Loans initiative to help homeowners make their houses more energy efficient.

The question we must consider is why is all of this happening. Even ahead of the government creating a price on carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme, businesses are already taking up the sustainability challenge

The reason this is happening is because businesses know that the same steps they take to protect the environment will make them more efficient, their investments more cost-effective, their workforces more productive, and not least of all their brands more competitive.

We are, in short, entering a new phase of economic transformation. Over the last quarter of a century New Zealand has seen two distinct periods of transformation. The first, beginning in 1984 and lasting through the 1990s, saw tariff barriers fall, agricultural subsidies eliminated, and our previously closed economy opened to the global market. It unfortunately also saw a huge increase in poverty, stubbornly high unemployment, and a general decline in the principle of fairness that had underpinned the New Zealand economy for generations.

The second phase of transformation, beginning with the election of the Fifth Labour Government in 1999, has sought to restore the place of fairness and social justice in our economy. By focusing on fair labour laws, support for families and seniors, and investing in skills and education, we have achieved a great deal.

At 3.5 per cent our unemployment rate is the lowest on record and the envy of the developed world  
360,000 jobs have been created and more New Zealanders are in work than ever before  
We have seen the longest period of sustained economic growth in more than a generation  
New Zealand's GDP is now 28 per cent larger in real terms than it was in 1999  
Wages are up and profits are up more  
Work stoppages are down  
Over 100,000 children have been lifted out of poverty  
Regional economies that were in decline are now thriving

And as a result of this success, we can broaden our sights even further.

If the first wave of economic transformation applied only a policy test of growth, and if the second wave added a focus on fairness, the next wave of transformation will be about building an economy that is strong, fair, and sustainable.

I believe that pursuing sustainability is an enormous economic opportunity for New Zealand. We have a real chance to be an example to the rest of the world on how to deliver more jobs, higher wages, and higher profits all while protecting the environment.

And I want to assure everyone that the Labour-led government knows the only way to succeed in this next wave of transformation is by continuing to work very closely with the business sector and workers. That is something we have clearly demonstrated not only in the months following the announcement of the Emissions Trading Scheme, but over the past five years of consultation on climate change policy, the development of the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, and our overall approach on sustainability issues since our election in 1999.

For our government, leadership is not about single-mindedness and directives. Our model of leadership is about consensus and deliberation, about consultation and inclusiveness.

The work to date on the Emissions Trading Scheme has been a strong demonstration of this approach.

Since the scheme's announcement we have undertaken an extensive engagement programme with sector groups.

We have undertaken:  
three two-day workshops on the design of the Emissions Trading Scheme in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch  
thirteen regional and one national hui with Maori  
seven regional forestry meetings  
numerous "one on one" meetings with individual businesses and sectors  
and a forum for non-governmental organisations.

In total, almost 2000 people have attended these meetings already.

The Government invited 32 leaders from business, agriculture and forestry, science and the environment, the union movement, and non-government organisations to participate in a Leadership Forum to work with us on climate change issues.

The Forum, chaired by Stephen Tindall, is providing input to the government on some key issues around the design of the Emissions Trading Scheme including:  
allocation  
the unit of trade  
liquidity in the market, and  
how to account for carbon decreases in pre-1990 forests.

In the weeks ahead, the government will table the Emissions Trading Bill in Parliament, which will reflect the feedback we have received from people and organisations all over New Zealand. It will be a better piece of legislation thanks in no small part to the constructive way people have been willing to engage on this issue.

What is clear is that there is a broad consensus supporting the Emissions Trading Scheme and supporting an effort for New Zealand to be among the global leaders on pursuing sustainability.

There is an understanding that this scheme will necessarily change the relative competitiveness of firms, both within the domestic economy and within the global marketplace. There is an appreciation that it will, in summary, transform New Zealand's economy into a more sustainable one, and one that will be better prepared to compete in a global economy that increasingly places a premium on sustainable practice.

The government is aware, however, that there are still calls for New Zealand to abdicate our responsibility to lead on this issue. There are calls for our country to be a fast-follower, and there are still calls for New Zealand to do absolutely nothing in the face of the climate change threat. I have already outlined the reasons the government cannot follow that advice, but I do want to take a moment to reflect on the changing tactics some of our opponents are deploying.

The days when major polluters and emitters of greenhouse gases can deny the existence of climate change and have half of Parliament stand behind them are gone. The days when industry-funded think tanks can get away with distorting the huge scientific consensus on climate change through the media are gone. The days when a small number of non-supportive business groups can claim to speak for the majority of the business community are over.

Those who still are unwilling to face up to their moral and economic responsibilities on climate change have been forced to up their game. They are employing research consortiums, marketers, and increasingly sophisticated tactics in an attempt to raise doubts about the wisdom of the path ahead.

But the government and those who are constructively engaging with us on the way ahead are responding effectively.

We have released well-considered research from Infometrics showing that the impact of the Emissions Trading Scheme on GDP growth will be very small over our first Kyoto commitment period. In fact, we have argued as I have tonight, that the impact of more sustainable practice will be very positive.

We have been quick to point out that alarmist studies, like the Greenhouse Policy Coalition commissioned Castalia report, often totally fail to recognise that standing still is not an option. The cost of doing nothing cannot be ignored, but our critics still cannot seem to grasp that basic fact.

We have continued to point out that while we are leaders in many respects on sustainability issues, we are in other ways not yet with the leading pack. Emissions trading is well advanced in the European Union and a number of American states, and Australia is now working on a scheme.

But the key to our ongoing success will be to continue to engage with businesses, with unions, with farmers, with communities, and with families on what we can all do to be leaders on climate change.

The critics will not go away anytime soon, but our work will continue.

The Labour-led government believes New Zealand can be the world's first truly sustainable nation.

I am confident that pursuing that goal will have enormous benefits for our economy and for our society. It is our job now to continue our work and continue to build a consensus around the need for New Zealand to be a global leader in the fight against climate change.
