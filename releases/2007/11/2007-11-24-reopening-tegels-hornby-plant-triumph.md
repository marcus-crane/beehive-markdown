The re-built Tegel plant in Hornby contributed to the lives of many families throughout New Zealand, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today at a ceremony to officially re-open the facility.

He said it was a pleasure to be there for the re-opening and to welcome the confidence in the Hornby economy that it represented.

“It’s in places like this, and in the work done here, that the heart of the New Zealand economy beats, in the investment made in this factory and in the dedication and effort of the staff here.

“Plant or facility is about much more than the bricks and mortar. More than anything else the plant is a symbol of the services it represents and a symbol of the people who work within it.

“So what we are really celebrating here today is much more than the building itself.

“We’re celebrating a contribution to our local Hornby community and Canterbury economy.”

Jim Anderton said this weekend was an auspicious one for the industry in the United States, as it was Thanksgiving, when families all over America get together with a dinner of turkey.

“We don’t have a similar tradition in New Zealand - but we do have a tradition of marking many of our festive occasions with a roast chicken - or two. And over the years chicken has become a regular staple of family diets.

“So you might not always think about this when you come to work each day at the plant, but what you are doing is part of the everyday lives of a large number of families around our region and further away … Everyone who is part of the plant has a role in its mission. And because this plant produces goods that are such a big part of New Zealanders’ lives, everyone here is helping put food on New Zealanders’ dinner tables.”

Jim Anderton congratulated everyone at the plant and Tegel who worked together to keep the plant running since the fire.

“I understand everyone had to pitch in, with the plant operating below normal capacity. There had to be shift changes and altered conditions to keep the show on the road. And it’s especially impressive that you managed to make it all work without passing on increased costs to consumers.”

He said the plant was an example of the “very substantial” investments the industry had at stake, and the Government was committed to working in partnership with industry to deal with issues together in good faith.

“I want us to work as partners because I recognise the importance to this community of the jobs and investment the company makes here.

“I care about our community - and everyone here does too. A caring community goes hand in hand with a strong economy. So I wish you every success with this new facility. The stronger it grows, the stronger Hornby grows.”
