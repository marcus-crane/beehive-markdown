A bigger slice of New Zealand's history is now available online following the launch of Archives New Zealand new audio visual website.

The site – www.audiovisual.archives.govt.nz – features over 100 film clips sourced from the National Film Unit and is a big step forward in making Archives New Zealand's audio visual collection more accessible and visible to New Zealand and international viewers.

"Through the events of our past we gain a greater understanding of who we are as a people and a nation. This new site gives New Zealanders the opportunity to experience more of their national history in their homes, schools, and workplaces," said Minister Responsible for National Archives Judith Tizard.

"The Labour-led Government's Digital Strategy sets a framework for New Zealand to be a world leader in using information and technology to realise out economic, social and cultural goals. Having access to comprehensive and relevant content is vital to that goal, and this site delivers."

"The remastered film 'This is New Zealand' toured the country to packed houses in the Telecom 2007 New Zealand International Film Festivals. New Zealanders have demonstrated a strong interest in seeing their history and developing a greater sense of national identity which this new website will satisfy."

The site embraces Web 2.0 through the inclusion of a wiki, giving users the opportunity to add descriptive information and discuss the films with others. This feature helps to increase accessibility and connection to these films and important archival records.

The site contains information on the National Film Unit, Archives New Zealand's preservation work and features stories on filmmakers and films. The films will be streamed onto viewers' desktops using flash video with new titles being added every day.

Films featuring on the site include Weekly Review and Pictorial Parade newsreels as well as one-off documentaries. Historic events covered include Queen Elizabeth's visit to New Zealand in 1953, New Zealanders leaving for Europe at the beginning of World War Two and the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel.
