"I first met with the Foundation and the Governor during my visit to Mexico in July this year. We identified a range of areas with strong potential for strategic and profitable collaboration," Jim Anderton said. "This visit is a tangible demonstration of that potential and I look forward to seeing mutually beneficial results."

He met with the Foundation delegation at Parliament today. Jalisco has the third largest economy of the Mexican states and is the largest producer of milk in Mexico, as well as being an important producer of other agricultural goods. The Foundation is working to develop potential high-value sectors where the state has a competitive advantage, and is looking to New Zealand as its key source of commercial advice and agribusiness development.

"Jalisco's commitment to innovation and to learning from the best experience of others is very much in line with New Zealand's own approach," Jim Anderton said. "As Minister of Agriculture I see great potential for New Zealand's relationship with Mexico. Its growth and demographics point towards increased demand for meat and dairy products, as well as presenting other opportunities for New Zealand. Our strength in agricultural technology and development make it an ideal strategic partner for this important North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) economy."  
In the year to June 2007, Mexico imported NZ$463 million of New Zealand products, making it New Zealand's largest Latin American trading partner. Mexico exports a diverse range of products to New Zealand, including computers, beer, motor vehicles and telephone equipment.

The delegation from the Jalisco Foundation is undertaking a five day visit to Auckland, Hamilton and Wellington. Their programme has included meetings with Crown Research Institutes, agribusiness firms, livestock exporters, and government officials, as well as farm and orchard visits.
