Food Safety Minister, Lianne Dalziel is pleased to be visiting two Timaru food processing premises this week.

After less than two weeks in her new portfolio, Lianne Dalziel is taking the opportunity to visit the first operating day of [Alliance](http://www.alliance.co.nz/) Smithfield's new multi-million dollar high-tech boning room.

Smithfield's is the oldest freezing works in the country which still operates on its original site, and will provide the Minister insights into developments in the meat processing industry and the company's history since it began there in 1885.

The second visit is to [Denheath Desserts Limited](http://www.denheath.co.nz/) who are famous for their custard squares and other delicious cakes. As a Cantabrian who has "eaten quite a few in the past", Lianne Dalziel is especially looking forward to seeing where and how the iconic custard squares are made.

The visits will add another dimension to Lianne Dalziel 's ongoing interest in small and medium businesses by focussing on issues facing food industry operators as they keep their businesses up to date with emerging technology and food safety requirements.
