New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to India will be career diplomat Rupert Holborow, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

The High Commission is also accredited to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.

“India’s rapidly growing economy, expertise in science and technology, and increasing geo-political importance makes it a priority relationship for New Zealand,” Mr Peters said.

“There is also tremendous scope for increased business interaction, and the recent India-New Zealand Joint Trade Committee made progress towards examining prospects for a Free Trade Agreement.

“New Zealand’s exports to India have grown substantially in the past few years, and reached $NZ357 million in the year to June – an 85 per cent increase on 2004 figures.

“Indians are the second largest Asian group in New Zealand, They make a valuable contribution to our society, and will play an important role in broadening bilateral relations, including the growth of our trade and economic ties,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Holborow is currently New Zealand’s Senior Official for APEC and Co-Director of Asia Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has previously been posted to Jakarta, and twice to Canberra.

Mr Holborow takes up his position in December, replacing Graeme Waters, who returns to Wellington.
