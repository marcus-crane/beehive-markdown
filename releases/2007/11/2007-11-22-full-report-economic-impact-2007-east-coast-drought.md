Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Jim Anderton today welcomed the release of the full report into the economic impact of the 2007 East Coast drought.

“The drought has obviously had a severe impact on the East Coast region. The next three years will be difficult for the sheep and beef sector, including those that provide services to farms affected by drought,” Jim Anderton said.

“MAF commissioned this report to get an objective assessment of the likely impact of the drought on the sector, the wider regional economy and the national economy.

“The drought has clearly had a significant impact and follows on from recent difficult years, particularly for those producing lamb,” Jim Anderton acknowledged, “but many of the farms in the region have strong balance sheets as a result of good years earlier in the decade.

“Under the Government’s On-farm Adverse Events Recovery Framework, a range of support is being provided to farmers affected by the drought. The Government will continue to monitor the sector’s recovery from the drought through the new season,” Jim Anderton said.

The report estimates that the East Coast sheep and beef sector GDP will decline by $161 million over the three years to the end of 2008/09 as a result of the drought. This is a 20 percent decline from the 2005/06 year.

Given that GDP was expected to increase by $136 million over the same period, the total loss of GDP for the sheep and beef farming sector is expected to be $297 million.

The impact on the total East Coast region GDP is a $326 million fall in regional GDP over the three years.

As the sector was expected to contribute an additional $375 million to regional GDP in this period, a total reduction of $701 million in regional GDP is expected over the three year period.

Nationally, the drought is estimated to result in a $588 million decline over three years in the contribution of the East Coast sheep and beef sector to national GDP.

The region is a key component of the New Zealand sheep and beef farming sector, contributing approximately 20% of all sheep and beef farms in the country and 20% of the sector’s national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Q&A  
Why did MAF commission the report?

MAF commissioned the report to get an objective assessment, at a relatively early stage in the event, of the likely impact of the drought on the sector and regional economy.

The report is based on forecast production assessments made in July 2007. The actual production outcome and response of farmers may be somewhat different. For instance, we will not know precisely from farm monitoring until July next year the actual lambing percentages and the prices farmers receive for their lambs.

Farmers are also adapting to the drought and using the recovery phase to try crop production followed by re-grassing to improve pastures, to mitigate the income effects of less stock on hand this spring.

Is the Government reconsidering its classification of the drought as a medium scale event which has the potential to become a large-scale event?

In May, the drought was classified as a medium-scale event with the potential to become a large-scale event.

The classification of an event is assessed against a number of criteria, including the impact on the local and regional economy; the likelihood of similar events occurring and their relative frequency; and the availability of risk management options.

This early classification process is used to determine the most appropriate response in terms of the Government’s On-Farm Adverse Events Recovery Framework. As a result of that classification in May, a number of measures were put in place.

The framework for the government’s response to on-farm adverse events can be read at:

Existing programmes will continue and MAF will take the report into account in terms of making any recommendation to government updating the relative scale of the event. This work is currently underway now the report is to hand. However, any reclassification is not likely to have a significant impact on decisions going forward.

What assistance has government provided to farmers affected by the drought?

In response to the drought the government put in place funding for:  
•The employment by the East Coast Rural Support Trust of Agricultural Recovery Facilitators  
•Drought seminars for farmers to complement those organised with Meat & Wool New Zealand support  
•Brochures produced by the Hawke’s Bay Regional Drought Committee, to help farming families deal with the stress of the drought and offering information about feeding options and where to go for advice  
•Support for other industry-led events and field days related to drought recovery

The government also authorised Rural Assistance Payments via Work and Income New Zealand for the most affected farming families that do not have off-farm income or assets to call on. This assistance is still available to farming families. The flow-on effect to families that rely on income from providing services to the farming sector is also acknowledged and existing WINZ programmes are available to assist those whose contract income or farm employment has dried up.

Income Equalisation Scheme provisions with the Inland Revenue Department were also relaxed in line with its adverse events policy, allowing farmers to make decisions immediately to sell stock without worrying about the taxation impact. They can decide later in the season to opt in and deposit funds in the Income Equalisation scheme and then withdraw them as necessary to replace capital stock sold due to the drought.
