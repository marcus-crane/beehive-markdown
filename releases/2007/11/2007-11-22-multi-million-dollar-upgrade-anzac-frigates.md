Cabinet has approved funding for an upgrade of the platform systems on the Royal New Zealand Navy’s two ANZAC frigates, HMNZ Ships TE KAHA and TE MANA, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The upgrade of the ANZAC platform systems – including control and monitoring systems, stability management, propulsion system, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning – is a stage of the ships’ planned mid-life upgrade, which was included in the 2006 Defence Long-Term Development Plan,” Phil Goff said.

“Cabinet’s decision this week to approve the required funding – between $50 million and $60 million depending on contract negotiations – reaffirms the Labour-led Government’s ongoing commitment to rebuilding and re-equipping the New Zealand Defence Force as a combat capable force.

“Since the ANZACs were introduced into service in the late 1990s they have achieved a broad range of tasks across diverse operating environments, including in the Pacific, South East Asia and the Middle East. This project will enable the Government to continue to realise the full value of the ANZACs as a combat capable force that is deployable, both independently and as part of a coalition, to the likely range of operating environments.

“The project will improve operational efficiency and effectiveness across the frigates’ full range of tasks. It will maximise the efficient distribution of technical personnel on the ANZACs, with positive flow-on effects across the Navy,” Phil Goff said.

The upgrade programme is scheduled to begin in 2009 and the Ministry of Defence will now prepare the necessary tender documents for industry involvement, Mr Goff said.
