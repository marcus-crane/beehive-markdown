More New Zealanders can look forward to enjoying the benefits of healthier and more energy efficient homes, as the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority seeks partners to deliver interest free loans and grants to homeowners for energy efficiency and heating solutions.

EECA is expanding its successful ENERGYWISE™ programme to more New Zealanders, with $23 million in government funding over the next four years. It is expected that local authorities, power and lines companies, other businesses and community organisations may be interested.

EECA is today calling for applications from potential partner organisations to participate in the first stage of the programme, and will be seeking further partners next year.

Energy Minister David Parker and Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation Jeanette Fitzsimons say this is great news for homeowners.

"We look forward to forging new partnerships that will go towards improving the living standards and energy efficient qualities of Kiwi homes," says Jeanette Fitzsimons.

"We know that homeowners who take advantage of the new funding to have insulation and clean, efficient heating installed in their homes will not only reduce their energy consumption – and save on their power bills - but can expect to improve their health with less asthma and winter illness, and fewer days off school and work, simply by living in warmer, drier houses."

Already 39,000 low income families have seen their homes retrofitted with insulation and other energy efficiency measures as a result of home grants under the ENERGYWISE™ programme.

"The new funding will see grants and interest-free loans available to a wider audience, helping more middle-income New Zealand families," says David Parker.

This extra financial assistance is part of a package of Government action working towards warmer, drier, healthier homes with reduced energy costs for Kiwi families.

More information is set out in a Request for Proposal (RFP) document and is available at www.eeca.govt.nz and the government tendering service at www.gets.govt.nz. Applications close 21 December 2007.
