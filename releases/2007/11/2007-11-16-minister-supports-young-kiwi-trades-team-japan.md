Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today attended the WorldSkills Leaders Competition in Shizuoka, Japan to support the “Tool Blacks” – New Zealand’s young team of tradespeople.

The WorldSkills Competition is an international event that showcases global youth competing to be the world’s best in over 45 different skills. Competitors are aged between 18 – 22 and are working in a trade or undertaking an apprenticeship.

New Zealand’s 14 candidates cover a wide range of trades, including auto-body repair, bricklaying, electric installations, furniture making, joinery, printing, light fabrication and welding.

“These young people are not only ambassadors for their trades, but for New Zealand youth also,” said Mr O’Connor.

“It is great to see these young people starting a career in the trades where they will make a valuable contribution to the economy by easing skill shortages and improving business productivity.

“They play a very important leadership role in championing skills development in their industries. This can only have a positive effect on the number of young people choosing a career in the industrial trades and inspiring others to undertake training.

“If we are to transform New Zealand into a higher growth, higher skilled economy we need more young people like them.

“The Labour-led government is committed to improving achievement in education, building a skilled workforce and lifting business productivity. Our investment in programmes such as the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme and Industry Training highlights this commitment,” said Mr O’Connor.

The Government has committed to providing funding for 14,000 Modern Apprenticeships by December 2008, with an investment of approximately $50 million invested from the 2009/10 financial year.
