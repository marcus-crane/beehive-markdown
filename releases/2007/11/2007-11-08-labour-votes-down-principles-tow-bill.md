Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta has hit back at what she calls ‘half truths’ by the Maori Party after the Labour-led Government voted down the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill.

“We were clear from the outset that New Zealand had come too far to take a backward step and remove references in legislation to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “The Labour-led Government has today kept its word with Maaori voters who were sceptical because the Maori Party seemed intent on telling partial truths – without letting people know the whole picture.

“We have always said this was an issue that needed get a full hearing at select committee, which is why we supported Doug Woolerton’s bill on the first reading,” said Nanaia Mahuta. ”Now the Select Committee have returned the bill to the House we will not commit our support any further.

“The fact is Aotearoa/New Zealand continues to lead the world in partnership with Maaori in many areas and we have made significant advancements, especially with regards to Treaty of Waitangi issues.

Nanaia Mahuta said there were many examples showing the positive relationship between Crown and Maaori. This included;  
•Taking Maaori medium language education from early childhood to secondary schools  
•A greater involvement between the parties in the co-management opportunities of conservation land  
•The continuation of Treaty settlement processes to resolve historical issues  
•The creation of a Maaori Television service  
•An increased participation in resource-management decision-making  
•Greater partnerships with regards to Commercial fishing  
•Key community sector providers for social service, justice and health.

“Most people understand we need to find constructive ways of working together and improving the quality of life for our children and families,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “The Labour-led Government is committed to continuing this progress and I am pleased to be part of this effort. I would encourage whanau who were led down the garden path by the Maaori Party, to reject any ‘Tito’ on this matter.”
