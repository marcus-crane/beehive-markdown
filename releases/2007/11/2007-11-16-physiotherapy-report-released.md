ACC Minister Maryan Street today released the report into the “Review of the Way in Which Physiotherapy Services are Funded and Accredited by ACC”.

The review forms part of the Labour-led Government’s Confidence and Supply agreement with New Zealand First. The report makes recommendations regarding the funding and accreditation arrangements for physiotherapists, the relationship between ACC and the physiotherapy profession, and ACC processes relating to monitoring, audit and investigation activities.

“I endorse the emphasis the report places on the importance of ensuring those in need of physiotherapy following injury have affordable access to treatment,” Maryan Street said.

“The government will ensure the report’s recommendations relating to non-fiscal measures are addressed promptly. Other recommendations related to funding will be considered in conjunction with other budget priorities.

“The Labour-led government’s priorities for the ACC scheme are to maintain it as a fully public social insurance scheme which focuses on injury prevention, along with fair and effective treatment and rehabilitation provisions.

“I am grateful for the thorough job performed by the reviewer David Goddard Q.C, and for the willingness of all concerned parties, including New Zealand First deputy leader Peter Brown, to work together in good faith to produce this outcome,” Maryan Street said.

A formal government response to the report will now be developed and considered.

Written submissions, oral hearings and reports of David Goddard, QC are available on the Department of Labour website www.dol.govt.nz. The full report is available at http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/physiotherapy/index.asp,
