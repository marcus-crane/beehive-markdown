New Digital Advisory Body to be established

The government is setting a clear direction for a new digital and community sector representative body, Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe said today.

“To provide a stronger unified voice for the broader ICT sector, including community ICT interests, the government is looking to establish a new representative body in 2008.”

“The government is currently working on a refresh of the Digital Strategy by mid 2008.This month’s Digital Future Summit is part of that process. As the government undertakes this work, its timely to also review the governance of the strategy to ensure that broader government, business and community input into digital strategy issues is appropriate and adequately provided for going forward,“  
says Communication and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe.

“Building on the great work of Hi-Growth, ICTNZ and the Digital Strategy Advisory Group ,it is proposed this new advisory body will provide Ministerial advice , provide research and information to the large number of sector groups , and support new digital programmes.”

“I’m not proposing to replace current sector groups, but rather ensure that all sector and community interests are heard and are adequately resourced by  
an umbrella group .The advisory body would be supported by a well resourced executive Secretariat.”

Communication and Information Technology Minister, David Cunliffe says “I do not want to predetermine the outcome of this work nor does the government have a preference on how this body of work might work along existing sector bodies.”

“Instead the process ahead is one of consultation with stakeholders on the best proposal to represent industry, business, community and government interests in New Zealand’s digital future.”

“I encourage stakeholders to be engaged in determining and developing a proposal for a new representative advisory body. I will be announcing how we will be moving forward with this process at the Digital Future Summit,” said Mr Cunliffe.
