New Zealand and the Republic of Korea are embarking on a landmark research programme that will see joint projects carried out by scientists in both countries, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson.

The Korea-New Zealand Joint Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation selected two projects from six proposals during a competitive process, at their first meeting recently in Seoul. The projects are:

- Applications of frontier protein expression technologies, aiding drug discovery for infectious disease, to be undertaken by Professor Ted Baker of the University of Auckland and Professor Se-Won Suh of Seoul National University, and
- In-situ groundwater remediation towards improved non-point source pollution management, to be undertaken by Murray Close of the Institute of Environmental Science and Research in Christchurch, together with colleagues in Lincoln Ventures Ltd, AquaLinc Research Ltd and University of Auckland, and Professor Jae-Woo Park of Hanyang University, Seoul.

The parties have agreed to hold a second meeting of the committee in New Zealand no later than 2010 and to invite representatives and experts from the academic, research and industrial sectors to participate as observers. Approximately $2.2 million will be invested in the projects over the next three years, half being funded by New Zealand’s Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and the balance by Korea’s Ministry of Science and Technology.

“This work will bring equal benefits to both countries in terms of advancing knowledge and providing scientific solutions to address problems we face,” said Pete Hodgson.

“The interaction of scientists is an important way of developing scientific and technological links between New Zealand and Korea. I look forward to further progress being made.”
