State Services Minister David Parker says an independent report into public service recruitment and employment provides important lessons for public servants and state sector managers.

The report into the process surrounding the employment of Madeleine Setchell was carried out by former State Services Commissioner Don Hunn.

"Don Hunn’s investigation has been thorough," David Parker said.

"It’s clear from the report that some processes were not carried out as well as they could have been. I am comfortable that the State Services Commission has taken appropriate action and is committed to avoiding repetition of the mistakes disclosed in the report. I will continue to monitor its actions in this regard.

"Conflicts of interest are an unavoidable fact of life in Wellington, and they will continue to arise in the future. It is important that they are managed appropriately when they do arise.

"Chief Executive performance issues have been identified in this report, and the State Service Commissioner is responsible for dealing with them. He has imposed penalties as he considers appropriate.

"In terms of his own involvement, Dr Prebble is a long-serving and able public servant who has suffered the embarrassment of his own mistakes being laid bare. To his credit he has been willing to take full responsibility for what happened."

Mr Hunn’s report explicitly finds that Dr Prebble’s omissions did not affect the outcome for Ms Setchell, David Parker said.

"The Government considers the monetary penalty Dr Prebble has imposed upon himself to be appropriate, in recognition of his own mistakes and the need to maintain high standards expected of his position. It retains confidence in his ability to manage similar issues into the future."
