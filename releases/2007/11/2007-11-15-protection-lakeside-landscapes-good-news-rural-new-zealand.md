Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed new measures to provide some flexibility on key issues affecting high country Crown pastoral leaseholders.

The Minister was responding to [today’s announcement](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F31294) by Land Information Minister David Parker that lakeside landscapes in the South Island high country will be protected from inappropriate subdivision and development.

“It is imperative that the natural values around lakesides be protected. While that would normally be done by retaining Crown ownership, it is good to see recognition of other ways by which those values can be protected.

“The fact that two lakeside properties have been approved to complete the tenure review process shows that mutually acceptable agreements can be reached.

“Recent increases in land value have led to substantial increases in some rents. It is an excellent initiative to allow rent adjustments in recognition of lessees providing public access, or for carrying out enhanced pest and weed, erosion control or cultural heritage protection.

“I am especially pleased that negotiated access for the public to such areas has been included as a reason for allowing rent adjustment, as it is a tangible recognition of goodwill shown by farmers.

“The Labour-led government has recognised the financial challenges faced by some farmers by considering rent reductions on an individual basis until the next rent review, should a rent be clearly unaffordable.

“I expect that the measures announced today will go some way to allaying concerns on high country issues, and pave the way for common sense and negotiation in the future,” said Mr O’Connor.
