Increases in Lottery profits continue to benefit our communities. I’m very pleased to be able to announce the establishment of a new Lottery fund for significant projects. The Labour government’s Significant Community Based Projects Fund was fully allocated this year due to so many excellent applications. Now the Lottery Grant’s Board is stepping in to help continue to fund projects of national or regional significance.
