Government welcomes open debate on how to improve child health

Minister of Health David Cunliffe is welcoming open and honest discussions on improving children and young people’s health.

“Over the past 24 hours welfare organisations, child advocates and health organisations have all come out with positive suggestions for improving the health of some of the countries most vulnerable citizens,” Mr Cunliffe said.

He said since 1999 the Government had invested an additional $2.2 billion dollars into primary healthcare. This investment focuses on disease and illness prevention, health promotion and getting ahead of chronic disease.

“This Government has made a huge commitment to children through, Working for Families, child health programmes such as the B4 school checks that will roll out next year, is working to improve the health of young New Zealanders by strengthening child and adolescent oral health services, expanding Well Child checks and creating a universal newborn hearing screening and lowered GP fees but there is still a long way to go.”

“I am pleased this report has sparked such a wide ranging debate on the issue of child poverty and the impact it has.”

"We want to ensure that our children and young people, who make up a third of our population, can achieve their full potential and that is why the Government funded the reports, he said.
