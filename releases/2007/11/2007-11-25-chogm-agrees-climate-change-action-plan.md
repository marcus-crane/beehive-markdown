Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the climate change declaration agreed by Commonwealth Leaders at CHOGM makes a strong contribution to addressing the problem of global greenhouse gas emissions.

“The Lake Victoria Commonwealth Climate Change Action Plan makes it clear that all countries have a role to play in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark is attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kampala, Uganda.

“The Commonwealth brings together representatives of all major interests in the climate change debate – developed and developing, small and vulnerable, large and industrialised countries. This gives Commonwealth leaders a unique perspective.

“One of the agreed points for action is that the Commonwealth will take initiatives to help strengthen participation of Commonwealth developing countries in international negotiations on climate change.

“This will assist more vulnerable economies to ensure their perspectives and circumstances are appropriately reflected.

“I am also pleased that the Action Plan recognises that the issue of “food miles” affects all exporters of fresh produce and needs to be addressed on the basis of facts.

“This is the third major international meeting I have attended in the past three months that has had climate change as a central theme. Along with APEC in Sydney and the East Asia Summit in Singapore, CHOGM is building on the steady momentum towards the United Nations climate change meeting in Bali next month,” Helen Clark said
