The announcement today that InterCity and Newmans have joined the SuperGold Card programme offering a 20% discount is great news and represents the latest of several hundred new businesses which have joined the Card in the past two months, said Winston Peters.

The InterCity Group (NZ) Ltd operates New Zealand’s largest coach transport network with more than 600 destinations nationwide and 150 services each day.

"We welcome this significant business to the rapidly growing list of SuperGold Card business partners, and are pleased that they have made the commitment to improve the quality of life of our seniors.

"The SuperGold Card is going from strength to strength, as we said it would, since its launch in August this year. We now have over 550 businesses with more than 3,100 outlets on board offering SuperGold cardholders discounts nationwide.

"This is dramatic growth in just over two months, but it is still only the beginning. Work is ongoing to bring the card to its full potential.

"The addition of InterCity and Newmans to the SuperGold Card family is yet another endorsement of this most positive development which we encourage our seniors to make the most of," concluded Mr Peters.
