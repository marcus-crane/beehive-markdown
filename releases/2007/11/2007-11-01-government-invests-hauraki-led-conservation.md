“Hauraki is a great piece of New Zealand and the Labour-led government’s support of local community projects will go a long way to protect our native fauna,” said MP for Tainui Nanaia Mahuta.

She says over $360,000 in government grants going to Moehau Environment Group in Port Charles, Environment NZ Trust/Whenuakite Kiwi Care Group, and QEII National Trust.

“The newly announced government funding will go towards a range of initiatives and I am delighted that Hauraki will benefit from this initiative,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Moehau Environment Group is getting $174,373 for two three-year projects – engaging around 6000 landowners and iwi members, plus the wider community, in biodiversity conservation, and controlling rats and helping kiwi chicks gain weight. Environment NZ Trust and Whenuakite Kiwi Care Group are getting $75,252 to protect North Island brown kiwi through pest control. And QEII National Trust in Purangi gets $11,530 over three years to help control climbing asparagus.

"Across the country, kiwi, geckos, blue penguins and coastal seabirds are benefiting, along with the wetlands, coastal habitats and forests that are their homes," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"Coromandel community organisations, businesses, DoC workers and enthusiasts all play an vital role in pest management and biodiversity recovery programmes – it's a constant battle to ensure sustainability for New Zealand native forests and wildlife.

The grants are from the Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds, which aim to improve the prospects of native species and habitats living on private land. The local projects are amongst over a hundred around the country sharing in grants totalling $2.68 million, announced last week by Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Acting Environment Minister David Parker. Further support comes from around $3.2 million in funds and volunteer hours from landowners, local and regional government and others, bringing the total current investment to almost $6 million.

“I am pleased to endorse the work of my ministerial colleagues to work alongside the community and with landowners to make a difference for our natural landscape and native species. Aotearoa New Zealand is a great place to live and we want to continue that unique identity,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
