Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the reappointment of Ken Warren to his second five-year term on the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB), which is responsible for reviewing and approving New Zealand's financial reporting standards.

“Mr Warren's 28 years of experience in public sector accounting has provided a valuable perspective to the [ASRB](http://www.asrb.co.nz/) so I am pleased that he has agreed to continue to provide the board with the benefit of his expertise. His perspective will help ensure the board continues to consider the implications of financial reporting standards on the public sector,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Mr Warren is currently a Chief Accounting Advisor at the Treasury and prior to that, worked in the Audit Office for 11 years.

**Biographical Notes on Ken Warren**  
Mr Warren has worked at the Treasury since 1990. His first role was as Manager for Financial Management Operations where he and his team compiled the first set of Government financial statements to comply with generally accepted accounting practice. He has also been responsible for the Treasury’s quality assurance function over financial management in government departments.

During his time in the Audit Office, Mr Warren rose to Director level and had responsibility for the audits of the Public Accounts, the New Zealand Dairy Board and the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Boards.

Mr Warren has been a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand ([ICANZ](//www.nzica.com//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home1)) Public Sector Committee since 1994 and a member of the ICANZ Financial Reporting Standards Board (the body that prepares accounting standards) since 1998. He currently chairs that board’s Public Benefit Entity Working Group. He has been a member of the International Federation of Accountants’ Public Sector Steering Committee on accounting for non-reciprocal revenue. In 2000, he was recognised for his contribution to the profession by being named a Fellow of ICANZ.

**Background Notes on the ASRB**  
The Accounting Standards Review Board is an independent Crown entity which reviews and, when appropriate, approves the accounting standards that largely comprise New Zealand's generally accepted accounting practices. These practices underpin the financial reporting policy of all entities that have public accountability expectations.

The board is made up of between four and seven members who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Commerce Minister.

The board maintains a close liaison with international standard setters such as the International Accounting Standards Board and the International Public Sectors Accounting Standards Board. It also plays an active role in harmonising financial reporting frameworks in New Zealand and Australia through the ASRB Chair's participation in the [Australian Financial Reporting Council](http://www.frc.gov.au/about/) and the [Trans-Tasman Accounting and Auditing Standards Advisory Group](http://www.frc.gov.au/trans_tasman/).
