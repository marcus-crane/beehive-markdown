Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today welcomed the release of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s (MAF’s) discussion document on the Raw Milk Regulations.

"This is the first step in a comprehensive review to ensure that the Regulations are operating well," Jim Anderton said.

"The Regulations require Fonterra to sell a certain quantity of raw milk to other dairy processors, at a regulated price. This discussion document will give all dairy industry stakeholders the opportunity to give us their views and concerns about the Regulations."

The discussion document outlines the original intention of the Regulations and MAF’s current understanding of industry concerns about them. Industry stakeholders are being asked to provide feedback by 14 December.

In the second stage of the review MAF will develop options for addressing the concerns identified. Stakeholders will then be asked to comment on these options for improving the regulatory framework for raw milk. This second round of consultation is scheduled to take place in March 2008.

"I hope all interested parties will take the opportunity to read this document and provide feedback to officials," Jim Anderton said. "Their views are important, and it is also important that the Regulations are operating well and promoting a strong, vibrant dairy industry."
