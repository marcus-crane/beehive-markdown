October was an exciting month as Courts further improve the accessibility of justice to the New Zealand public. Decisions of the Tenancy Tribunal are now available online and this service will help both landlords and tenants make more informed decisions when leasing or renting a property.

Cabinet also has agreed to a programme of Tribunal Reform, which I see as being vital to streamline and improve the services that tribunals can provide to  
all users.
