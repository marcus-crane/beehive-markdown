Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today announced his decision on the total number of New Zealand sea lions that may be accidentally caught by fishing trawlers in the southern squid trawl fishery (SQU6T).

The maximum number of fishing related sea lion deaths for the 2008 fishing season will be 81. Should this limit be reached, the fishery will be closed.

This is 12 fewer than the limit of 93 that was set for the 2007 fishing season. Fifty six sea lions, of the 93 allowable, were estimated to have been captured during the 2007 season.

New Zealand sea lions eat squid which aggregate in large numbers in the deep waters surrounding the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. They are at risk of being accidentally caught and drowned when they follow squid into trawl nets. The SQU6T fishery operates from around February through to April-May or until the sea lion fishing related mortality limit is reached.

Jim Anderton said this was a difficult decision to make, balancing the need to protect sea lions with his obligation under the Fisheries Act to allow for the harvest of the squid resource.

“I have carefully considered the best scientific advice available to me as well as submissions received from industry and the public before making my decision. I believe that this limit will allow for squid fishing without compromising the long-term future of the sea lion population.”

The squid fishing industry voluntarily use sea lion exclusion devices (SLEDS), which allow sea lions to escape from the trawl nets.

Last fishing season, SLEDS were used by all vessels operating in the fishery.

Before the trawlers left port, the SLEDS were audited to ensure they were installed correctly and were as effective as possible in minimising accidental captures of sea lions. In addition, SLEDs were regularly checked by Ministry of Fisheries observers and Fishery Officers. All of the SLEDS checked were fully compliant with the agreed SLED specifications as set out in the sea lion operational plan.

Sea lion captures are estimated using a nominated ‘strike rate’ per 100 trawl tows. Jim Anderton set the strike rate at 5.65%, meaning that for every 100 trawl tows,  
5.65 sea lions are presumed killed. However squid fishing vessel operators who use an approved SLED and meet all the requirements of the sea lion operational plan are permitted a discount on this strike rate.

“As a result of improvements in SLED design and evidence, suggesting that SLEDs may be more effective in reducing sea lion deaths than previously thought, I have decided to agree to a 35% discount on the strike rate for the coming season,” Jim Anderton said.

He congratulated the squid fishing industry on the increased levels of performance against the operational plan shown in SQU6T last season.

“I look forward to this level of performance continuing and even improving,” Jim Anderton said.

Background notes  
The New Zealand sea lion is classified as threatened under the Marine Mammals Protection Act, meaning it is not immediately threatened with extinction but is potentially vulnerable to population decline due to a limited number of breeding sites.

The Department of Conservation is currently consulting on a population management plan for sea lions. This will put in place a long-term management regime for sea lions and remove the need for the Minister of Fisheries to set annual measures.

Arrow squid is one of New Zealand’s largest and most valuable fish exports. Arrow squid live for one year and die shortly after spawning. Their population varies widely from year to year, based on hatching success and the numbers of juvenile squid reaching maturity, which is in turn primarily influenced by natural conditions. As a result the catch can be highly variable from season to season.

For the coming season the Minister has set a ‘strike rate’ of 5.65%. This means that for every 100 trawl ‘tows’ carried out by a fishing vessel in the SQU6T fishery, where a SLED is not being used, 5.65 sea lions are presumed killed and counted against the sea lion limit.

Squid fishing vessel operators who use an approved SLED and meet all the requirements of the sea lion operational plan are permitted a discount on this strike rate. For the coming season the Minister has permitted a 35% discount on the strike rate. This means that for every 100 tows, when the vessel uses an approved SLED, 3.67 sea lions are presumed killed and counted against the limit.
