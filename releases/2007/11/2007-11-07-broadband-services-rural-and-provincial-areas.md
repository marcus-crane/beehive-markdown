The government is now seeking applications for radio spectrum licences for broadband wireless access services in rural and provincial areas, Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe announced today.

“The government has a further 77 lots of radio spectrum licences in the 3.5 GHz band to assign for commercial broadband wireless services,” said Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe.

“These licences have been created to facilitate the roll-out of more high-speed internet services to New Zealanders, and in particular to rural and provincial areas. In doing so they should promote greater competition for broadband services in these areas.”

The government has created two lots of licences in the 3.5 GHz spectrum band for each of the 74 territorial local authority areas, i.e., a total of 148 lots. Each lot comprises a pair of 7.5 MHz licences.

“A first round assignment of 71 lots was completed in 2006. Applications are now open for the second assignment round for the remaining 77 lots,” said Mr Cunliffe.

“Interested parties have four weeks, or until 4.00pm on Wednesday 5 December 2007 in which to make an application.“

“This allocation of spectrum is designed for those parties who may not have had the incentives or resources to acquire nationwide rights previously. I encourage all parties who have an interest in providing wireless broadband services in their local area to look at applying for these licences,” said Mr Cunliffe.

Full details of the second assignment round, including the allocation rules, prices and an application form, are available on the Ministry of Economic Development’s radio spectrum website at www.rsm.govt.nz.
