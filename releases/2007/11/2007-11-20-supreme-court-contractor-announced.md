Courts Minister, Rick Barker announced today that Mainzeal has been appointed as the contractor to carry out the construction of the Supreme Court complex.

"The Supreme Court complex is the pinnacle of the major investment in court facilities made by this government over the last eight years. I am pleased that construction of the complex can now go ahead full steam," Mr Barker said.

"A New Zealand-based Supreme Court is a major step in the evolution of the court system and should be housed in a building that matches the vital role the Court plays within the New Zealand Justice system.

"The new building and the restored historic Old High Court building on the Lambton Quay site will provide fitting accommodation for the Court for generations to come.

"The appointment of Mainzeal as contractor brings them together again with the leading architects Warren and Mahoney, reuniting the team that made such a magnificent job of restoring Parliament buildings," Mr Barker said.

The next step in the project is to commence work on the restoration of the Old High Court building, with the key task of cutting the building off its foundation and inserting base isolators which will provide seismic protection.

On the new site the main work will be the continuation of pile drilling to support the new building and the excavation of the basement area.
