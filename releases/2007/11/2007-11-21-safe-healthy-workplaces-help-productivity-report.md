Positive progress is being made towards lifting New Zealand's workplace health and safety performance according to a snapshot report released today by Labour Minister Trevor Mallard.

The 2006/07 snapshot reports on progress made in the second year of the Workplace Health and Safety Strategy to 2015 which aims to lift New Zealand’s workplace health and safety performance, with the ultimate goal of raising firm's productivity of New Zealand businesses and reducing New Zealand’s work toll.

"The Labour-led government is committed to supporting innovative and productive workplaces as part of our work to transform New Zealand into a high wage, high value economy. Improving workplace health and safety is an important part of this, with obvious benefits to both employers and workers.

Trevor Mallard says a review of international and New Zealand research produced by the Department of Labour during the last year shows that improved health and safety benefits workers by reducing injuries, and also benefits employers.

"Fewer injuries mean fewer hours of work lost, so productivity actually improves. Research also suggests that designing safety into businesses provides a source of increased innovation, improved staff recruitment and retention, and improved efficiencies through greater workplace collaboration.

"Partnership and collaboration are crucial if we are to be successful in achieving the strategy's main goal of healthy people in safe and productive workplaces. A significant development in the past year was the establishment of the tripartite Workplace Health and Safety Council, made up of employer, worker and government representatives.

"This council provides leadership, co-ordination, and advice on relevant legislation, standards and policies and it represents an important step towards forming a consensus on workplace health and safety issues.

"Much of the other progress over the past year relates to government work and leadership in promoting the importance of workplace health and safety, reflecting the need for a solid infrastructure to back up the strategy."

Trevor Mallard says examples include:

- The government’s Quality Regulation Review improved the interface between the Health and Safety in Employment Act, the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act, and the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act
- ACC and the Department of Labour developed a joint work programme to reduce harm arising from workplace noise
- The Ministry for the Environment, ERMA New Zealand and the Department of Labour developed a joint Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) compliance and enforcement strategy
- An inter-agency group has been established to improve the surveillance of occupational disease and injury in New Zealand
- Research is being undertaken into occupational health in New Zealand. Research projects have been called for on occupational asthma; occupational dermatitis; workplace stress and bullying; and workplace exposure to carcinogens
- Focussed work programmes were undertaken on airborne substances (including asbestos) and on the issue of vulnerable workers who may be at increased risk of work-related disease and injury. The latter work indicated older men, Maori and Pacific men in high risk industries, and children and youth workers may be at increased risk, and these groups will receive more focused interventions over the coming year.
