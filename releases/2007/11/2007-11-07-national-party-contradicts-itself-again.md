“Tony Ryall wants less bureaucrats; Jo Goodhew wants a few more. What I want is to listen to the aged-care sector rather than National’s silly self-contradictions,” Minister of Health David Cunliffe said.

“Jo Goodhew’s calls for more staff to measure health status within the aged-care sector, is just another demonstration of an opposition spokesperson tripping over themselves looking for a headline.

“Labour-led governments have been paying attention to our ageing population. In the last Budget we invested an unprecedented amount into services for older New Zealanders - $150 million over four years in residential care and another $81.2 million to support older people them stay in their own homes if they wish.”

The 65 years and older age group was one of the first age groups to get their GP fees lowered and pay $3 for most of their prescriptions, in July 2004.

“I can count those savings for Mrs Goodhew if she likes – in dollar terms and in quality of life as older Kiwis seek advice for health issues earlier. This is in stark contrast to National’s policy of letting market forces determine doctors’ fees, a policy which is in the public arena only because National was pushed by the media and got caught out.

“If I had any time to waste I would run a sweepstake for their next inter-colleague stumble in the opposition health camp. But I am busy with more constructive matters,” David Cunliffe said.
