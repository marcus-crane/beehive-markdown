Mr Gould brings a record of significant governance experience, strong and relevant connections to the research sector and an excellent understanding of government processes to the Foundation.

Under his leadership, the University of Waikato undertook several significant initiatives, including the construction of the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts, the establishment of the School of Maori and Pacific Development, and the creation of the Waikato Innovation Park.

I wish her well in all her future endeavours.” said Pete Hodgson.
