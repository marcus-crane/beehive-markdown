Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says the success of more people at this year’s Manukau City Council Industry Training Graduation again highlights the importance of the Labour-led government’s investment in industry training.

“We have seen some tremendous successes since the Industry training scheme began, and it’s fantastic to see more people going through these programmes and succeeding in their chosen field,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“What is evident is more mature people are taking the opportunity to upskill and gain further qualifications. They are great examples for to their families and young people thinking about their own future.

“As Youth Affairs Minister, I’m proud to acknowledge the achievements of the many people who have graduated this year.

“I’m especially heartened by the increase in the diverse number of people who have taken up industry training in the past few years. It shows the programme is a much needed one, and regardless of language barriers, provides another pathway to success.

Industry Training Organisations provide skill development and training in varying sectors, including building, construction and motor engineering for 180,000 people every year.

The government has allocated $34 million over four years to help the Modern Apprenticeships scheme, a work-based education initiative combining traditional apprenticeship approaches with the latest thinking in workplace learning.

The scheme has drawn nearly 9,500 students since its introduction in 2000

Counties-Manukau will gain from the increased number of skilled workers in their region. Congratulations and well done to all the graduates,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
