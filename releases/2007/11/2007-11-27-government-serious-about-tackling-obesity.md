Government serious about tackling obesity  
The Government is serious about tackling obesity which is why it has accepted 47 of the 55 recommendations made by the Health Select Committee on Obesity and Type 2 diabetes Minister of Health David Cunliffe said.

“This Government has made health promotion and disease prevention a priority,” Mr Cunliffe said.

As part of its commitment to tackling obesity the Government has already made Fruit in Schools available to 57,000 school children and launched the $67 million Mission on Campaign in September 2006 which included guidelines for food services in schools.

“A great deal of work has already taken place, but more is needed to ensure that messages about healthy living are having an impact and changing lives,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe said he was excited about what has already been done and about what is planned for the future.

A key component for future planning and co-ordination would be the establishment of a cross sectoral ministerial committee to provide leadership and ensure a comprehensive and cohesive approach to the issue was being applied.

Without intervention it has been estimated there could be up to 180,000 New Zealanders living with Type 2 Diabetes by 2011.

“The true test of a health system is that it not only delivers quality patient care, but also gives people access to information about how to stay healthy.

“What we want is for people to have access to the right information so that they can make the best decisions to keep themselves and their families healthy,” Mr Cunliffe.

He said the Government was committed to long term strategies to tackle obesity and he was looking forward to leading a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach that would make a difference to the health of New Zealanders.

Mr Cunliffe said while he was still relatively new to the role of Minister of Health he recognised the importance of working to ensure that health promotion and disease prevention were delivered in a co-ordinated manner and that information was accessible to people from all walks of life.

“Making health information accessible through lowered GP fees and social marketing campaigns has been and will continue to be a priority.”
