“The Labour-led Government, alongside the great work of the Waste management sector, are leading the way on minimising waste and contributing to a more sustainable nation,” said Associate Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta highlighted the government’s major initiatives to deal with waste issues, at the opening of the Waste Management Institute of New Zealand’s Annual Conference. “The initiatives are based on our aspirations to be the first carbon neutral and truly sustainable country. Sustainability should become a central part of our national identity in the 21st Century.

“That goal requires central, local government and community commitment and we should see the results in our homes, public spaces and with an emphasis on our tourist destinations and services.

“The government’s commitment has been highlighted by the new sustainability priorities announced by the Prime Minister early this year. We must ensure resources are used in the best way to better manage waste and make a difference to our quality of life, looking after the environment, reducing cost and creating new economic opportunities.

“Key issues like waste minimisation and management, a household sustainability programme, and better business partnerships on sustainability, will help Aotearoa/ New Zealand to be fully sustainable.” said Nanaia Mahuta.
