Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says he hopes the new emphasis on second language learning in the new curriculum will inspire more students to learn te reo Mâori.

Mr Horomia, also Associate Education Minister, said the new New Zealand Curriculum for English medium teaching launched today will also give schools greater flexibility to better involve whânau and communities in curriculum design and implementation, which is key to improving the education sector’s performance in regard to Mâori students.

“The new curriculum has added second language learning to the list of learning areas that are considered essential for a general education in recognition that it helps enable students to participate more actively in our diverse and multicultural society – and within the global community.”

“For the first time the curriculum also respects the status of te reo Mâori as an official language, along with New Zealand Sign Language, of this country. Learning a second language helps extend students’ understanding of different cultures and introduces them to new ways of thinking about the world.

“As part of the on-going development of our national identity, I’d like all students to acquire at least a basic understanding of te reo and its importance. For the same reason, I’m pleased the curriculum has given boards of trustees clear instructions on the need for recognition in the classroom of New Zealand’s bicultural foundations.”

Mr Horomia said he was pleased the new curriculum had recognised the call from Mâori educators and the wider community during the consultation process to more explicitly recognise the Treaty of Waitangi in the final document.

“The provision for greater whânau and community involvement will create a vehicle for building better relationships, which is what the Treaty is all about. And the need for more personalised learning for students emphasised in the new curriculum acknowledges there is more work to do to ensure schools are meeting the requirements of Mâori students.”

“Next week I will release the draft of the partner document for Mâori medium teaching and learning, Te Marautanga o Aotearoa, for consultation,” Mr Horomia said.
