Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons, is visiting Hamilton City Council today to congratulate them on their initiative to encourage solar water heating by waiving building consent fees.

“I am delighted that Hamilton City Council is taking this positive step to encourage its homeowners to install solar water heating,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

“Building consent fees for solar water heating vary significantly across councils and can be a price hurdle for homeowners considering installing a system.”

Hamilton City Council is the third council to commit to zero consent fees for solar water heating.

“I strongly encourage other councils to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability by following the example set by Hamilton City Council, Waitakare City Council and Westland District Council.”

Hamilton is also where solar water heating installers are trained with Wintec having developed the course that is now being rolled out across the country through other tertiary trainers.

Hot water accounts for around $800 of an average household energy bill. A well-designed and installed solar water heating system can save up to 75 percent of a household’s annual hot water bills. Solar water heating systems, including the cylinder, typically cost between $4000 and $8000 installed.

The Government is encouraging solar water heating as part of its broad approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. The programme includes a website where consumers can get independent information about how to assess whether solar is the right solution for their homes; and a $500 grant towards installing a complying system, Ms Fitzsimons says.
