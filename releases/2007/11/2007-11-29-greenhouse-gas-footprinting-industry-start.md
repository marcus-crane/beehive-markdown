A ground-breaking study of primary industries' greenhouse gas emissions will start this year, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He said the Government and industry groups are signing contracts for greenhouse gas (GHG) footprinting projects that include about 65% of all land-based primary exports.

“By July next year, we will have three sectors already completed: dairy, wine, and kiwifruit. Two others will be well on the way - forestry and lamb, with on-farm beef and venison also being done.”

Jim Anderton said the GHG footprinting studies would be done from the farm right through to the destination port and in some cases even further – to the supermarket shelf.

“For the forestry project, when combined with the work being done on building with wood, we will have a GHG footprint tool across the whole supply chain from the seedling through to building and on to demolition at the end of the building’s life. That’s an exciting development.”

He said these projects were world-firsts, which would put New Zealand in the forefront by having such comprehensive coverage of sectors at the level of detail the projects will be undertaking.

“It means that New Zealand exporters will be in a good position to be able to explain to their customers exactly what climate change impact their production systems have and the steps taken to mitigate these.”

Jim Anderton said the Government’s contribution would be matched by at least 25 per cent contributions by participating industry groups.

“This work is being done in partnership with the primary sector. We all have a stake in this work, not only particular industries, but also all New Zealanders. Primary industry exports are essential to retain New Zealand’s first-world standard of living, because they earn about two-thirds of our merchandise export earnings.

“When our primary industries do well, New Zealand does well.”

The Government is contributing $1 million to the current projects, with a further $500,000 for additional projects next year.

Jim Anderton said another $200,000 a year had been allocated through MAF’s Sustainable Farming Fund to ensure smaller sectors can do greenhouse gas footprinting work as well.

“This Government has a full strategy around GHG footprinting for the land-based primary industries with total funding of $6 million over the next five years.”
