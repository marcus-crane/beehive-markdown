Transport Minister Annette King has announced the appointment of Yvonne Sharp as the Chair of the Road Safety Trust Board and the reappointment of Tony Knight as the New Zealand Automobile Association Trustee on the Board.

The Trust funds community safety initiatives, research and study awards, training, education, private sector technological developments beneficial to road safety, and any other specific projects that the Trustees consider are likely to contribute to improved safety on roads.

“I am delighted Ms Sharp has agreed to serve as Chair. She brings an impressive range of skills and experience that will be invaluable as the Trust implements the outcome of a recent review of the Trust’s operations,” said Ms King.

From 1998 to this year, Ms Sharp was Mayor of the Far North District Council, one of New Zealand’s largest provincial districts with an extensive roading network. She has served on various trust boards including the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust Board and the Bay of Islands Cultural Centre Trust. She also worked as a Financial Adviser with Spicer’s Financial Services. Ms Sharp’s appointment is for three years from 1 December 2007.

“Mr Knight has been the representative of road users on the Road Safety Trust, as nominated by the New Zealand Automobile Association, since 2001. He has significant experience in the roading and road safety area,” said Ms King.

Mr Knight was an Automobile Association district councillor for 20 years, a national councillor for 12 years, and on the AA board for six years, serving the last three as President and Chairman. He has been reappointed from 1 December 2007 through to 30 April 2008.
