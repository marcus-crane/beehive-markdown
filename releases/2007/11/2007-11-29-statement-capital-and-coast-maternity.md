Statement on Capital and Coast Maternity

Minister of Health David Cunliffe has received an assurance from Capital and Coast DHB that no woman who needs to be in hospital after giving birth will be sent home.

Capital and Coast have also provided an assurance that they will actively work to accommodate women who wish to be admitted to hospital after giving birth that option.

The DHB have also confirmed to they are in the process of appointing more midwives and that they expect to be back to normal in February, Mr Cunliffe said.

“I have also sought urgent advice from the Ministry of Health regarding the underlying reasons for nationwide shortages of midwives.”
