“The new school curriculum will provide leadership for young people’s education in the 21st century,” said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The new school curriculum was launched by the Prime Minister Rt. Hon Helen Clark and the Minister for Education Hon. Chris Carter.

The Prime Minister said the new curriculum would replace seven curriculum documents with one, and noted it would give a clearer direction on what was important to learn at school, whether knowledge or skills based.

Nanaia Mahuta said the new curriculum will shape young people’s future.

"We know young people are full of talent in the classroom, and on sports fields around the country, in the workshop, in arts and culture and in the sciences,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “But we can always do more to help young people unlock their potential and grow their talent. A key goal of the new curriculum is to support personalised learning to lift student achievement, and encourage students to stay at school longer.

“In today's world, young people get a head start when they know how to be problem solvers, and they can read, write and understand how math applies in our everyday lives. Once more, they can get ahead when they are prepared to be risk takers," said Nanaia Mahuta

"I am encouraged that, along with the goal of lifting achievement, there continues to be a focus on providing other pathways to learning, through the recently announced youth apprenticeships, highlighting the importance of learning languages and the ongoing need to ensure young people have better financial literacy skills.”

Schools have two years to implement the new curriculum, with support through workshops, on-line resources and school-based support.
