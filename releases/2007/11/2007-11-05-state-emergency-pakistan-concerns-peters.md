Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed his deep concern at President Pervez Musharraf’s decision to impose emergency rule in Pakistan.

President Musharraf, who is also head of Pakistan’s military, has suspended the constitution, citing what he said were threats posed by Islamic extremism and judicial interference.

A number of political opposition figures and senior lawyers have been taken into custody or placed under house arrest.

The measures come as the Supreme Court is due to rule whether President Musharraf was legally entitled to run in last month’s Presidential elections while still chief of the military.

“President Musharraf’s actions are highly regrettable, and New Zealand calls on him to return Pakistan to constitutional rule as a matter of urgency,” Mr Peters said.

“It is critical at this time that all sides show restraint and ensure that human rights are protected. Pakistan faces serious challenges to its stability at present, including an alarming increase in suicide bombings during the past month.

“However dispensing with democracy is not a viable way forward. Peace and security in Pakistan will depend on policies of inclusion, the successful implementation of democracy, and respect for the rule of law,” Mr Peters said.
