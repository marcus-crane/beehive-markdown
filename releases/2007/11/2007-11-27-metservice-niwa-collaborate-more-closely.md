The MetService and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) have signed an official agreement to work more closely together on forecasting New Zealand’s weather, climate and associated environmental events.

Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson and State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard say the formal memorandum of understanding will strengthen links between the two organisations to help New Zealanders get more timely and accurate weather information.

“Accurate information about our weather and environment is vital to New Zealanders, especially given that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our generation”, says Pete Hodgson.

“NIWA has a very important global role in investigating climate change and its effects on future weather patterns. Greater collaboration with MetService will improve the sharing of knowledge from this research and the delivery of weather-related information.”

The agreement is the result of a working group that was established following a July 2006 review into the integration of weather, climate and environmental forecasting.

Trevor Mallard says the closer relationship will strengthen links between NIWA’s environmental research and data gathering resources, and the role of the MetService in weather forecasting.

“We’ve seen how severe weather, such as flooding or cyclones, can have major impacts on some parts of this country, and increased collaboration between these organisations will improve their ability to prepare communities for bad weather.”

The agreement also concludes that introducing legislation to ring-fence their activities would help the two companies deliver greater benefit to New Zealanders through improved forecasting information. The Ministers are currently considering this, and a final decision is due later.
