Welcome to the latest instalment of my monthly Civil Defence update about what’s happening in the portfolio.

Another successful Disaster Awareness Week was held in October with a theme of ‘Get Ready Now’. Regional CDEM Groups held events around the country to promote the message of resilience and encourage communities to be aware of the hazards they face and to prepare for these hazards.
