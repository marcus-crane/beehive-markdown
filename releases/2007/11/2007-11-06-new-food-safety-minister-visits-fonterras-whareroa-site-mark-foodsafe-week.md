Consumers at home and at work have a key role to play in improving New Zealand's high rate of foodborne illnesses, new Food Safety Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

Lianne Dalziel undertook her first official engagement in her new portfolio at Fonterra's Whareroa Dairy Factory in Hawera to mark Foodsafe week which starts on Monday. Food Safety shifted from Annette King to Lianne Dalziel under the Cabinet reshuffle announced last week.

"The core food safety messages of Clean, Cook, Cover and Chill apply whether you are at home or at work, and it's great to see a large company like [Fonterra](http://www.fonterra.com/wps/wcm/connect/fonterracom/fonterra.com/Home/) doing its bit to educate not just its staff, but also their families."

Lianne Dalziel selected Madison Pita, aged 8, of Palmerston North as the winner of a colouring competition run by Fonterra to highlight the food safety message amongst the children of its staff.

Whareroa is the world's largest dairy factory and has a great record in food safety, Lianne Dalziel said.

"That record isn't to be taken for granted. One food safety scare can have serious consequences both in terms of domestic consumer confidence and in overseas markets which see New Zealand as a trusted supplier of food. The government takes our excellent reputation in this regard seriously."

Fonterra is a key contributor to the [Foodsafe Partnership](http://www.foodsafe.org.nz/) which runs Foodsafe week to reinforce its core food safety messages of Clean, Cook, Cover and Chill. This year Foodsafe Week runs from November 12-18.
