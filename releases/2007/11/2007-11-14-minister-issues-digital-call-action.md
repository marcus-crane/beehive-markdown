Communications and Information Technology Minister, Hon David Cunliffe, has issued a call to action to all digital leaders, community groups and organisations with an interest in advancing New Zealand’s digital future.

“The Digital Futures Summit 2.0 on 28 and 29 November will provide the forum for an inclusive and interactive conversation about the current state of our digital world and the direction for New Zealand’s digital future.

“I am encouraging a wide range of stakeholders to be a part of the process and make a positive contribution to the Summit and the refresh of New Zealand’s Digital Strategy. This will be an important opportunity to help shape our shared digital future,” said Mr Cunliffe.

Individuals and businesses concerned about broadband speed and access, high-tech business growth, and the social and sustainability issues that technology brings, should seize the opportunity to attend and contribute to planning New Zealand’s digital future.

The five key themes for the Summit and Digital Strategy refresh are:  
•Affordable, fast broadband for all New Zealanders  
•ICT driving creativity, innovation, productivity and wealth creation  
•ICT skills and capability – education and lifelong learning  
•New Zealand community content – strengthening communities and celebrating our uniqueness  
•Sustainable New Zealand – ICT supporting a sustainable economy.

“Every aspect of our lives is now impacted by technology in some shape or form. ICT drives economic development and is key to our advancement in many fields.

“Places at the Summit are filling up fast. I encourage anyone with ideas about New Zealand’s digital future to get online and register now.”

To start a national conversation about ICT issues a blog has been set up to enable people to contribute ideas to the Digital Future Summit and refresh of the Digital Strategy.
