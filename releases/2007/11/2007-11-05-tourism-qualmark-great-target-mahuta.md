“Congratulations to YHA Gisborne in being awarded the 2000th Qualmark licence,” said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Her comments follow the Gisborne-based backpacker hostel receiving the Qualmark licence.

“It is a significant acknowledgement that more and more tourism operators see the advantage in contributing to lifting the bar in terms of the Aotearoa/ New Zealand Tourism experience.

Nanaia Mahuta, who is also Associate Minister of Tourism, said the potential benefits that come with receiving New Zealand tourism’s official mark of quality, is a healthy sign for the industry.

“For many travellers and tourists, their first time experience of Aotearoa New Zealand can leave a lasting impression. Many of those same visitor stay at youth hostels throughout the country,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“I know a lot of work goes into gaining the licence and it’s a key statement to an international visitor to expect a quality endorsed experience. I understand that last year, YHA Mt Cook achieved a five-star Qualmark rating, taking the total count up to six five-star hostels in the YHA network.

“All tourism operators contribute to the quality of the “visitor experience” and it’s great to see that bar being pushed high. Indeed we can all benefit from high-value tourism across the industry,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
