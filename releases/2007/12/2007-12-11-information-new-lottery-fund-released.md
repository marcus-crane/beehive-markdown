Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today released further information for community groups considering applying for funding through the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.

"Criteria and information about how to prepare an application are now available from the Grants Online website and will greatly assist organisations wanting to access the fund," Mr Barker said.

"The Lottery Significant Projects Fund will allocate money to complete projects worth over $1 million and there will be a total of $16 million to disburse next year.

"The fund will help complete large projects which have significance for local communities, the region, or the nation as a whole. The projects must be in the areas of arts, culture and heritage, sport and recreation, or conservation and the environment.

"In addition, projects should also provide tourism and economic development benefits.

"Community groups which wish to access the funding will need to show they have raised at least 60% of the money needed and that their project has strong community support."

Further to the release of information packs, community groups are now able to talk to a Funding Advisor about their project’s eligibility by calling 0800 824 824.

"I would like to encourage all interested community groups who are considering preparing an application or think they might have an eligible project to consult the Grants Online website and contact the Department of Internal Affairs,” Mr Barker said.

Applications will open on 1 February 2008, and close on 1 April 2008 for the 2008 funding year.
