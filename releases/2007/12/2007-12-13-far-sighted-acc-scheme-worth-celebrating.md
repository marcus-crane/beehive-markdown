ACC Minister Maryan Street today marked 40 years of the ACC scheme at a symposium in Auckland.

“ACC is an accident compensation scheme that is globally unique due to the breadth of cover offered to everyone in New Zealand. ACC is a ‘no-fault’ scheme that covers injuries, regardless of how, or where, they were sustained,” she said.

Despite the many societal changes in New Zealand over the past four decades, the original Woodhouse principles remained as powerful and as relevant as the day they were drafted and the Labour-led government remained committed to them, Maryan Street said.

“The ground-breaking scheme was the brainchild of Sir Owen Woodhouse who produced the 1967 Woodhouse Report resulting in the adoption of the compensation regime in 1974.

“The five principles are:community responsibility, comprehensive entitlement, complete rehabilitation, real compensation and administrative efficiency.

“The importance of ACC can not be overstated while New Zealand’s injury burden remains so significant. For example the economic and social, cost of road injuries alone is $3.7 billion a year – the same amount we earn from exports to our third largest market, Japan!”

ACC represents great value for levy payers and businesses in particular. Levy rates are very low by international standards and businesses are protected from being sued, said Maryan Street.

“ACC is well-positioned to meet the challenge of a changing world by continuing to reflect the values and circumstances of New Zealand society. ACC’s contribution to both economic transformation and the wellbeing of families centres on its primary goal of reducing the incidence of injuries, their severity and their cost, which correspondingly improves the country’s productivity and the status of families.”
