A move by the Department of Internal Affairs to a more environmentally-friendly choice of car will mean more savings for taxpayers over time, Climate Change Minister David Parker says.

"For the first time the Department is including whole-of-life costs and the impact on the environment in selecting cars for the VIP Transport Service fleet," David Parker said.

"That means a cleaner burning car, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and cheaper running costs, all of which are in the interests of the New Zealand public."

The Labour-led government has brought about this change as it walks the talk on sustainability, and moves the public sector towards carbon neutrality.

This means the government is making changes in the products and services it uses, David Parker said.

"Historically we’ve bought Australian-assembled cars but because they don’t meet our efficiency criteria, the Australians are now losing our business.

"That proves that as a country it’s important to lower emissions when we produce goods if we want to appeal to customers that are increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of what they buy."
