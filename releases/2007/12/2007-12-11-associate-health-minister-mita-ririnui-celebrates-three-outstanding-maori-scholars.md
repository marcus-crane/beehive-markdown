Associate Health Minister Hon Mita Ririnui congratulated the three Māori students who were awarded the prestigious John McLeod Scholarships at a ceremony held in Wellington on Friday 7 December 2007.

The three scholars are: Rauroha Clarke (Te Arawa, Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngā Puhi) Cathrine Waetford (Ngā Puhi) and Bryce Kihirini (Tapuika, Tuhourangi, Ngāti Whakaue).

A father of three girls, Auckland-based Bryce Kihirini said the award will help fund the cost of his studies toward a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Although with a masteral degree in business, pursuing medicine is the fulfilment of a childhood dream.

“I always wanted to be a doctor and I can’t wait to make those full-time ward runs next year,” said Bryce, who is in his final year of medical studies.

Encouraged by her Plunket colleagues to pursue a nursing degree, Rauroha Clarke is now in her second year at Waiariki Institute of Technology.

“A nursing degree will broaden my scope and give me more opportunities to work in broader areas of health, including the health portfolio I hold with my iwi,” she said.

For physiotherapist Cathrine Waetford, the award provides valuable financial support for her and her son while she completes a Master of Health Science in Māori Health.

“It’s hard making both ends meet if you are a full-time student. This scholarship means I will no longer feel anxious about basic things like turning the heater on during winter,” she explained.

Background

The John McLeod Scholarship began in 1996 in honour of the late Dr John McLeod, of Ngā Puhi. Dr McLeod had a distinguished medical, research and management career in New Zealand’s health sector. He was known internationally for his work in strategic public health planning and his significant contribution to improving Māori health status.

The John McLeod Scholarships are funded through the Ministry of Health’s Māori Provider Development Scheme.

The Ministry awards around 330 Māori health scholarships each year to fund the costs of pursuing studies in health and disability sector. Each year the John McLeod scholars (between two and five each year) are recognised as outstanding individuals who are chosen from the successful recipients of Māori health scholarships.
