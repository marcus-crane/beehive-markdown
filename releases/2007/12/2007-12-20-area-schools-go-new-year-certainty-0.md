Education Minister Chris Carter today announced the settlement of the Area School Teachers’ Collective Agreement.

Area (or composite) schools combine primary, intermediate and secondary schooling at one location.

"With this agreement Area Schools, their teachers, students and parents will go into the New Year with confidence that teachers will be well supported," Chris Carter said.

The agreement follows the settlement of the Primary Teachers’ Collective Agreement with the NZEI last week.

"A number of major settlements have been agreed so far this year and I am pleased another agreement has been reached, this time with area schools."

"The Labour-led government is committed to the ongoing support of the teaching workforce which is so vital to the future of all young New Zealanders."

"I congratulate all sides on coming to this agreement and I am particularly pleased that the settlement has been reached before the end of the year."

Area School staff will vote on the settlement in February, with details being released after it is ratified.
