Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today released a briefing paper detailing the Labour-led government's important work on building an environmentally sustainable New Zealand - part of a series of Briefings to Incoming Ministers released today.

"The Briefings to Incoming Ministers (BIMs) released today outline the comprehensive work programmes underway that demonstrate our clear commitment to celebrate, protect and build on what it means to be a kiwi, and our pride in New Zealand's place in the world.

"Our government firmly believes that all New Zealanders have the right to take pride in who and what we are, through our arts, culture, film, sports and music, our appreciation of our natural environment, our understanding of our history and our stance on international issues - it's what makes us New Zealanders.

"The briefing papers also summarise the huge amount of work that is being progressed as part of the government's commitment to develop a sustainable New Zealand that will deliver prosperity for New Zealanders and future generations of kiwis to come.

"The Labour-led government is of the firm belief that there will be no prosperity unless we all play our part and take responsibility for protecting our clean green image, and seizing the economic and social opportunities that will arise out of being sustainable.

"We need to do this not only for our country and the health and welfare of generations to come, but also because it is important for our economic development and our exporters and producers as world markets turn against climate unfriendly goods and services," Trevor Mallard said.
