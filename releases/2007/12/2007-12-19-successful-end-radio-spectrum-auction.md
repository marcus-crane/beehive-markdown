The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Hon David Cunliffe, welcomed the successful conclusion today of the auction for spectrum rights in the 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands.

“One of the government’s top priorities is to facilitate competitive infrastructure provision and access to broadband services in New Zealand. I am pleased to see the successful conclusion to this radio spectrum auction today. This is a further significant milestone along the government’s digital strategy highway,” said Mr Cunliffe

“It is also pleasing to see the number and range of successful bidders. This outcome provides the successful bidders with spectrum to implement broadband access services at an early date.

“While the spectrum rights actually commence in 2009 and 2010, once the settlement requirements are met, the successful bidders can select their technology and start planning a network deployment with certainty.”

The auction was a multiple round process and was completed in 30 rounds. There were six successful bidders, with the total value of successful bids being $4.37 million.

The spectrum rights carry requirements for the bidders to implement services or risk the rights not being extended in 2014.
