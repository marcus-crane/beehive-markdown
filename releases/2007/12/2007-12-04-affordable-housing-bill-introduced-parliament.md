Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Bill introduced to Parliament Housing Minister Maryan Street today introduced a Bill designed to stimulate the provision of more affordable housing for first-home buyers and modest-income families in the rental market.

“The Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Bill seeks to create more choice and opportunity for families by giving councils the flexibility to promote a wider variety of house sizes, ownership models and costs in the new home market,” Maryan Street said.

“Although we are building a large number of new homes each year in New Zealand, very few have been designed for, or targeted at, first-time buyers or modest-income families. Over the past 15 years, the size of new homes has increased by 50 per cent.”

There is rising demand among local councils for tools to tackle this issue and ensure an adequate housing supply for workers crucial to local economies. This Bill delivers those tools, the minister said.

“The Bill, which is based on tried-and-tested schemes in place in the United Kingdom and the United States, will enable local authorities to address imbalances in the supply of new homes through a combination of requirements and incentives for developers.”

It seeks to balance the need for continued housing development, with the need to address affordable housing issues. It provides developers with a consistent and predictable legislative framework, while still allowing scope for flexibility and negotiation, Maryan Street said.

“The Labour-led government believes homeownership is part of our national identity and an important stabilising influence in society. The government has a responsibility to do what it can to maintain this tradition and to ensure an evenness of opportunity between generations.”

Rapidly escalating property prices have seen the rate of homeownership fall from 74 per cent to 67 per cent between 1991 and 2006. If current trends continue this rate will fall to about 62 per cent by 2016, a scenario New Zealanders do not embrace, Maryan Street said.

“The Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Bill will prevent the use of title covenants which are used to exclude social or affordable housing from developments.

“The use of these covenants is growing, and they unfairly affect some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Ours is a country with an egalitarian culture and we want to avoid segregation in communities.”

“This Bill is part of broader work being undertaken by the government on housing issues. It provides a solution to one part of the affordability problem and other initiatives will follow,” Maryan Street said.

Key Elements of the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Bill:

 

- The Bill will enable councils to require developers to either: include affordable housing in their developments, make payments towards the cost of providing affordable housing elsewhere, or provide land for the construction of affordable housing.
- However, councils can only introduce these requirements if they have first established evidence of affordable housing need in their area and developed a plan to deal with it that has been appropriately consulted on.
- Councils will be able to offset the costs developers might incur in providing some affordable housing by offering incentives to developers. These incentives may include the waiving of development contributions, or permitting greater densities in developments than might otherwise be allowed.
- Councils can decide how to administer properties obtained for affordable housing through negotiations with developers. They can: retain the properties as part of the council’s own stock, vest them in a housing trust, enter into shared equity arrangements with first-homeowners, or sell properties on the open market with deed restrictions to ensure the housing remains affordable over the longer term.
- The Bill also prevents the use of any title covenant whose principal purpose is to exclude social or affordable housing, including supported accommodation.
