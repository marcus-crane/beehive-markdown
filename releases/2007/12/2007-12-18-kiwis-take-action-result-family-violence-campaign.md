New Zealanders are taking action as a result of the family violence ‘It’s Not OK’ campaign, Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

“There are early signs that the Campaign for Action on Family Violence has struck a chord with New Zealanders. Research shows that the campaign is prompting people to think about family violence, to discuss it and to take action,” said Ruth Dyson.

A survey of 901 randomly selected adults showed that 87% remembered the campaign - a very high proportion in comparison with other similar campaigns. More than half of those people (58%) said they had discussed the campaign with someone and one in five reported taking action. The research also shows that the campaign, which was launched in September this year, is having a strong impact on Maori and Pacific audiences.

Ruth Dyson says the campaign slogan ‘It’s Not OK’ has been adopted by New Zealanders in many different settings.

“We have set ourselves an ambitious task of connecting with all New Zealanders and making family violence everyone’s business. This campaign is about far more than TV ads; it’s about working with communities throughout New Zealand and providing people with the information and support they need.

“The survey results show we are making good progress, people are engaging with the campaign, and many have already taken action indicating they are no longer willing to tolerate family violence. After just three months, this is an excellent result,” said Ruth Dyson.

The Campaign for Action on Family Violence is a major initiative of the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, with campaign work being led by the Ministry of Social Development and the Families Commission.

The campaign uses mass media to get the message across, engages at community level with a community action fund that supports projects which change attitudes towards family violence, and builds partnerships with non-government and other community organisations. The campaign is supported with a website [www.areyouok.org.nz](http://www.areyouok.org.nz) and 0800 Family Violence Information Line, 0800 456 450. The campaign will continue through the summer with the information line operating every day from 9am-11pm.

“Christmas time is stressful for many people. The campaign information line and the website offer practical advice and I would encourage anyone to seek help if they need it,” said Ruth Dyson.

The second phase of the campaign will start early in 2008 and will include television ads portraying men’s positive stories of change.
