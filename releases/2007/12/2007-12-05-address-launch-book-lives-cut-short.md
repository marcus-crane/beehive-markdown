\[Distinguished guests, greetings to you gathered here for this purpose today. Greetings once, twice, three times to you all.]

Good evening everyone and thank you, Dr Cindy Kiro, for your introduction.

To our authors Mike Doolan and Dr Marie Connolly, thank you for your work on this book. "Lives Cut Short" is a thoughtful and reflective work on the challenges of keeping children safe.  
It gives us a stark reminder of the toll that child abuse takes on New Zealanders and provokes us all to ask ourselves what part we can play in reducing child abuse.

All children and young people have the right to grow up in families that are supportive and loving and free from violence, abuse and neglect.

"Lives Cut Short" serves as a reminder that for some children and young people this is unfortunately not their day-to-day reality.

The book gives readers a real sense of the complexity of child protection. As you say, the pathways to abuse are complex and varied. There is no single list of factors that can predict child homicide. Most people with what may appear on the surface to be "risk factors" will never harm their children, and intervention with these families may well be unwarranted and damaging. Further to this, many of these families may not be known to Child, Youth and Family.

What has been identified in the book, is that family violence is a key risk factor, and evidence is starting to show a link between intimate partner violence and violence against children. Evidence also shows that risk factors associated with killing children can accumulate from childhood. What this means is our government’s focus on early intervention, strong social service provision and linked up agencies is the correct one, as is the focus on changing societal attitudes to family violence.

Lives Cut Short reinforces the importance of providing the right intervention at the right time.

“Lives Cut Short” reflects on the role of child protection agencies, and the careful balance needed between ensuring safety and becoming risk adverse.  
As you will appreciate this is a very delicate balancing act. NGOs and Child, Youth and Family are exploring new ways of working together, through the differential response approach. This approach supports the early intervention that “Lives Cut Short” tells us provides the best protection for children, and offers a greater range of responses to address a family’s particular needs.

Early intervention also means that all New Zealand families are able to access services and support that begins before birth, with lead maternity carers and continues through the life of the child. Our government has introduced many initiatives focused improving outcomes for children by supporting struggling parents and helping to change attitudes and behaviours.

The Early Years initiative provides a central point of contact where families can access a range of services, from ante-natal care through to parenting support and education.

The Well Child/Tamariki Ora service provides free information, advice, health checks and immunization for children under 5 years.

The SKIP (Strategies for Kids, Information for Parents) provides free information for parents and funds local community-run parenting programmes.

For families requiring more intensive and specialised support we are able to offer programmes such as Family Start, Strengthening Families and Social Workers in Schools. We need to continue to build on these supports.

As the authors say, greater sharing of information between professionals has potential to "increase protective opportunities". This has been an area of increased focus for government and NGOs in recent years.

For families at risk there are initiatives such as the Family Violence Intervention Programme. It uses an intensive interagency case management approach with Work and Income identifying families at risk and working closely with Child, Youth and Family to put support services into place at an early stage to give families the skills and support they need.

Another practical example is the Family Safety Teams led by Police which have been established in some parts of the country. Their purpose is to ensure that agencies in a community are working together to respond to family violence through a systems approach.

I also know that Police, Women’s Refuge and Child, Youth and Family are working together to ensure that there is a speedy and appropriate engagement with families that are experiencing violence. By sharing information and their collective experience, they can ensure a swift and effective response.

We know that many children who are at risk do not come to the notice of government agencies. Families, neighbours and communities are often best placed to identify and help address the issues they face.

Lives Cut Short reinforces our commitment to policies that produce strong families and communities.

Mike and Marie identify a range of protective factors that can reduce risk. They also remind us that the loss of protective factors such as strong social ties and community support systems can put some populations at greater risk. There are some essential building blocks for creating strong families in which children and young people can be safe and can thrive.

The information in this book reinforces the importance of the Campaign for Action on Family Violence in raising national awareness and encouraging New Zealanders to act. We need families to encourage whanau members to seek help and support – as the adverts say, "it is OK to ask for help." The greater the network of people who are watching out for the safety of our children and young people, and providing the necessary support and guidance to their families, the better protected they will be.

I would like to close by saying thank you once again to Mike and Marie for writing this book. I also want to thank you all for being here tonight, and for the active contribution that you are making to the safety and wellbeing of our children and young people.

Yes, there are challenges ahead, but I am sure you will agree there are a multitude of positive things happening across New Zealand society championed by people who, through their passion and commitment, will never allow the focus to fall from this problem.

Thank you.
