International Volunteer Day is an opportunity to thank the many New Zealanders who contribute their time and skills to our communities, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Ruth Dyson.

"All New Zealanders benefit in some way from volunteers' work in one or more of New Zealand's 97,000 not-for-profit institutions. These organisations operate in all areas of our society from arts, sports, marae and emergency services, to health, faith, youth, housing and culture and heritage,” said Ruth Dyson.

"There are also many more people who volunteer informally by helping out a neighbour or visiting someone in hospital."

"Our Labour-led government acknowledges the valuable contribution volunteers and voluntary organisations make to society. In collaboration with Volunteering New Zealand and Philanthropy New Zealand, we are looking at ways to encourage individuals and businesses to participate in their communities by giving time, money, or in-kind donations. We are working to improve non-tax incentives for volunteering and philanthropic giving."

"International Volunteer Day is our day to say 'Thanks for doing such a great job'."

Organisations around the country are celebrating their volunteers today –Volunteering Hawkes Bay will have displays in local libraries, Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin will host a morning tea for the city's volunteers, and Volunteering NZ, COmVOices and Volunteer Wellington are hosting a Taikoza Japanese Festival Drum Call in the city centre.
