A major Australasian business conference on climate change will be held Auckland next year, supported by the New Zealand government, Climate Change Minister David Parker announced today.

"We are pleased to support this important event," the Minister said.

"The ***4th Australia-New Zealand Climate Change & Business Conference*** will bring together prominent business leaders and policy makers from the region and globally to focus on the new business opportunities arising from the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"The Labour-led government has announced the design for an emissions trading scheme, and this event will be a timely opportunity to explore linking opportunities between our scheme and others. Now that Australia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol there is a strong rationale for creating a joined-up market at least in our part of the world."

The conference started in Auckland in 2004 with subsequent events held in Adelaide in 2006 and Brisbane in 2007. The aim of the series is to stimulate business to participate fully in carbon trading and emission reduction activities.

Conference Convenor Elizabeth Edmonds welcomed the Minister’s announcement.

"We are delighted to be returning to New Zealand for the 2008 event and thank the Government for its support," Ms Edmonds said. "It is very appropriate to be holding the event in New Zealand given its firm commitment to an all-gases, all-sectors carbon trading system.

"We can expect fresh impetus too from the new Australian government to implement its own emissions trading scheme. A key role for the conference will be to foster business dialogue across the Tasman to ensure Australia and New Zealand work together to maximise the rapidly expanding opportunities for this region."

The 2008 conference will be held at Sky City in Auckland on 20-21 August 2008. See [www.climateandbusiness.com](http://www.climateandbusiness.com) for further details, or contact Elizabeth Edmonds (e.edmonds@climateandbusiness.com).
