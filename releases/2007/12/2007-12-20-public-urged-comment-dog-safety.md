“Dog safety requires good law, effective enforcement, community support for enforcement, and responsible dog ownership,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The options paper I have released today looks at ideas from dog owners, local authorities and government agencies. None of the suggestions are government policy at the moment. They were developed after discussion from councils and other organisations with an interest in dog control.

“I want to hear what people have to say, and what other ideas there are before looking again at dog control issues in the New Year,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The discussion document “Improving Public Safety Under the Dog Control Act 1996:” has been posted on the Department of Internal Affairs’ web site (www.dia.govt.nz/dogcontrol).

Copies are also being delivered to city and district councils, and key stakeholders. Submissions close at 5.00pm on Monday 31 March 2008.

A submission may be made by filling out a submission form available on the Department’s web site that you can download, fill out and email to the Department, or you can post your comments to:
