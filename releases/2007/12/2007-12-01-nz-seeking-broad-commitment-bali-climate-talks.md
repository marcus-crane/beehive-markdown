New Zealand wants to see more countries prepared to commit to action on climate change, as a result of United Nations negotiations due to start on Monday in Indonesia, says Climate Change Minister David Parker.

The Bali talks (3-14 December) will focus on what happens after the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012.

"The government is keen for New Zealand to take an active role in these negotiations. While the Bali meetings are not expected to come to a final conclusion on the way forward after 2012, they are an opportunity to decide on a ‘road map’ to proceed."

New Zealand is prepared to take on commitments to deal with climate change after 2012 within a broad international framework to do so, David Parker says.

"The Labour-led government’s move to introduce an emissions trading scheme and other measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions gives New Zealand credibility in the Bali negotiations, and more flexibility to take on future international commitments.

"We want to see all major greenhouse gas emitters included in an effective international agreement, which should aim to reduce emissions in both developed and developing countries. We also want to see deforestation tackled and a realistic approach to adapting to the effects of climate change.

"Climate change is real and it’s happening. We must all work together to act now.

"Wealthier countries can and should do more than developing countries. However, without developing countries making a contribution we won’t be successful in tackling climate change."

There is a negotiation underway on further commitments under the Kyoto Protocol for those developed countries that have ratified it. Discussions on enhancing implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for all countries will conclude at the Bali meetings.

"The challenge for those at the Bali meetings is to bring the two strands of discussion together into one comprehensive negotiation about dealing with climate change after 2012," said Mr Parker.
