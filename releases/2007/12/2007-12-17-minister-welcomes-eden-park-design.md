Rugby World Cup Minister Clayton Cosgrove has today welcomed the new design for the redevelopment of Eden Park, saying it means preparation for the 2011 Rugby World Cup can begin in earnest.

“The new Eden Park will deliver a world-class finals venue for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and a facility of ongoing value and benefit to Auckland and New Zealand,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Eden Park Redevelopment Board (EPRB), which is responsible for this redevelopment, proposed the enhanced design to ensure that the Eden Park project will be able to meet resource consent requirements within the necessary construction timeframe. Redevelopment is scheduled to begin in August 2008 with the demolition of the South Stand. Construction will be completed by December 2010 with the temporary seating to be erected in March/April 2011. This allows time for the stadium to be fully tested before it hosts its first Rugby World Cup match.

The new design has an estimated cost of $240.5 million and includes features sought by the Auckland City Council to mitigate noise and better manage foot traffic. The government is maintaining its commitment to underwrite the project up to $190 million and the EPRB is continuing negotiations with other parties to secure the remainder of the funding.

“This design will result in a Rugby World Cup finals stadium that all New Zealanders can be proud of. With Cabinet’s approval of the new design this morning, the EPRB now has the comfort it needs to proceed through the resource consenting process and to progress negotiations with its preferred contractor, Fletcher Construction,” Mr Cosgrove said.
