“In light of uncertainties raised by the recent Court of Appeal decision regarding the import health standard covering honey from Australia, the Government intends to legislate to provide clarity as soon as possible,” Jim Anderton, Minister of Biosecurity, said today.

“The Court of Appeal decision last week has raised uncertainties around the links between the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act administered by the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) and the Biosecurity Act administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), and could have some wide reaching practical impacts at the border, if not resolved.

“MAF is holding off issuing new import health standards or progressing amendments to existing standards until the issues can be resolved.

“In light of this, the Government has decided it needs to legislate to provide certainty in this area, and has asked officials to report back as soon as possible in the New Year on legislative options,” Jim Anderton said.
