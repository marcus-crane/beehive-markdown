Minister of Health David Cunliffe today underlined the seriousness of the Capital and Coast’s DHB situation and outlined the process he would follow to help stabilize and address it.

“As previously noted, I have sought urgent advice on the full range of options available to me in this regard.”

“I am advised that given the seriousness of the situation and of the potential responses, that this is a matter that I should place formally before my cabinet colleagues before finalising my decision,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“Accordingly Cabinet will consider the matter on Monday 10 December .I will finalise my decision immediately thereafter and set in train processes that will lead to a public announcement later next week.”

“Until then existing appointed board members will continue in office and the incoming board will take office on 10 December,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“I understand these are testing times for the clinicians and management at Capital Coast but any changes must be robust enough to stabilise and turnaround the current problems.”

“My priority is to ensure that the people of Wellington have first class safe, secure health services. This requires sound governance, effective management, secure resources and a commitment to collaboration between clinicians and management”, Mr Cunliffe said.

“I deplore recent comments by some MPs that have further undermined the public trust in the Capital Coast DHB and in so doing, denigrated the dedicated efforts of the many clinicians, staff and support workers”.

The Minister is aware of the speculation over the role of a commissioner but he says this still remains just one of the options open to him.

Mr Cunliffe said he would not be making any further statements regarding Capital and Coast DHB until he was ready to announce the changes.
