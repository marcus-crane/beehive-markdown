The income threshold at which New Zealand-based borrowers must begin to repay their student loans will rise from $17,784 to $18,148 on 1 April next year, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

The new threshold is based on the annual movement in the September Consumer Price Index of 1.79 percent.

The change was approved by Order in Council yesterday.
