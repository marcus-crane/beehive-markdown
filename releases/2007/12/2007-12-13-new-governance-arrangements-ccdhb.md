Minister of Health David Cunliffe today announced his decision to appoint a new Chair and Crown Monitor to Capital and Coast District Health Board.

The Crown Monitor, who will report directly to the Minister, is Dr Ian Brown an Obstetrician Gynaecologist, who was the Director of Medical Services at Northland DHB until November this year, he is also the former chair of the national Chief Medical Officers' Forum and has been a member of the National Medical Strategy Workforce Group.

The new Chair is Sir John Anderson the current Chairman of Television New Zealand and is one of New Zealand’s pre-eminent business leaders with a proven record in governance.

Ken Douglas will remain as Deputy Chair to provide continuity.

“I believe that Sir John Anderson and Dr Ian Brown have the experience and skills to provide stability and give clear direction to Capital and Coast DHB,” Mr Cunliffe said.

The first priority for the new board and Crown Monitor would include consulting with clinical staff on the creation of a forward plan for the DHB,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“It is my intention to appoint Peter Douglas and Selwyn Katene to the Board. Judith Aitken and other elected members will also remain on the Board.”

Mr Cunliffe thanked Dr Aitken for her contribution to the board and for her efforts to stabilise a difficult situation over recent months.

“My decisions took into account the need to usher in a new era of direction at Capital and Coast while also ensuring some continuity remained,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“The situation at Capital and Coast was serious and I have treated it accordingly. I sought advice from several sources including my Cabinet colleagues.”

As well as appointing the Crown Monitor discussion on providing deficit support to Capital and Coast DHB will continue.

“The discussions with the Board will focus on deficit support in order to relieve some of the financial pressure currently experienced by the Board.

“This does not mean they have an open cheque book. It means that this DHB is expected to resolve the issues it has and that the Government will be working with them to ensure that all solutions are sustainable.”
