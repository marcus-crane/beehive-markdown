Minister of Health announces further DHB appointments

Health Minister David Cunliffe today announced the names of deputy chairs and appointed members for most District Health Boards (DHBs).

Seven members were elected to each DHB in October and the Minister can appoint up to a further four members to each board.

Deputy chair appointments have been made to 16 DHBs however, Mr Cunliffe is still considering the deputy chair positions at Counties Manukau and Whanganui DHBs.

Decisions are also still being considered around all appointments to Hawke’s Bay and Capital & Coast DHBs.

Nearly all member appointments have been made to the 19 DHBs that the Minister announced chairs for last month, but a few vacancies remain (one on each of the Auckland, Tairawhiti, Whanganui, MidCentral, Canterbury, South Canterbury and Otago DHB boards and two on each of the Counties Manukau, Taranaki and Wairarapa DHB boards).

"The calibre of people who were nominated for the appointed board member positions was extremely high,” he said. “I am confident that through these appointments, boards now have an improved mix of skills and experience."

Mr Cunliffe has also appointed a joint deputy chair and member to the Otago and Southland DHB boards, and a joint member to Whanganui and MidCentral DHBs.

"These appointments will help further support collaboration and co-operation between these DHBs," Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe said appointments to remaining vacancies would be announced as soon as possible.

A list of appointed board members and deputy chairs is attached. Appointees take office alongside elected members on 10 December.
