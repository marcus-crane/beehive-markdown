Māori continue to make gains in the education system, an annual report on Māori achievement shows.

Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia today released the findings of Ngâ Haeata Mâtauranga – Annual Report on Mâori, 2006/07 which show a steady and tangible improvement in student attainment and education experience.

“This report gives the Government vital understanding of Mâori educational achievement and involvement in education from early years right through to adulthood,” Parekura Horomia said.

“This latest data shows a number of areas of success, giving us plenty to build on through the Mâori Education Strategy, Ka Hikitia over the next five years.

“The successes include the improving achievement among Māori pupils sitting NCEA, with 60 percent of students gaining literacy and numeracy credits last year – up from 52 percent in 2005. More Māori are also going onto complete NCEA levels one, two and three.”

Education Minister Chris Carter says the report findings are consistent with other reports on educational achievement showing that New Zealand has a mix of high- and low-achievers.

“The best performers in our education system are up with anyone in the world, but the challenge is to realise the potential of all our students.” 

Māori learners were still over-represented in less positive education statistics in 2006/07, which provides an opportunity to make further gains, Chris Carter said.

“The challenge for us isn’t one of just quality, it’s also one of equity; making sure the best is available to all our students. Everyone has to be able to come through the education system having experienced the best that it has to offer.”

Some of the key findings in Nga Haeata 2006/07 include:

- Māori whânau are getting involved in the education system in ways the evidence suggests are worthwhile – as candidates in the 2007 school board elections, participants in innovative education programmes such as Te Kauhua and at home as key supporters of their children’s success
- participation in early childhood education among Māori children starting school is up to 90 percent in 2006 from 86 percent in 2002
- Māori language education sector achievement data showed promising areas of success, with some students achieving NCEA qualifications at rates that surpassed those of their English language sector peers.
