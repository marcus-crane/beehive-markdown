The deadline for submissions on the Easter Trading and Holidays Legislation discussion document has been extended, Justice Minister Annette King and Labour Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The document considers the different legislation that affects Easter Trading and proposes a number of options for possible change.

"Due to the importance of the issue to many New Zealanders and the relatively short time to consider the contents of the document, we have decided to extend the deadline for submissions from 14 December 2007 to 25 January 2008," Annette King said.

"I thank those individuals and organisations who have put a lot of effort into putting together their submissions, and hope that they can use the extra time to carefully reflect on how they would like Easter trading restrictions to be handled in the future. I look forward to reading the report from the Department of Labour on the issue once submissions are in and have been analysed," Trevor Mallard said.
