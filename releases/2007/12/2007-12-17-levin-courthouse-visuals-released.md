Visuals for the new Levin District Courthouse were made public today by Courts Minister, Rick Barker. The new Courthouse in Levin will form part of the largest courts capital investment programme in New Zealand's recent history.

"The new Levin Courthouse will include two new courtrooms as well as judicial and administration facilities," Mr Barker said.

"The proposed Levin courthouse has been designed to meet the current and future needs of the community, and includes large waiting and jury assembly areas, secure witness rooms and hearing and mediation rooms."

The construction of the new courthouse will take place on the current Stanley Street site.

"As well as being bigger, the new courthouse will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology, including video conferencing and evidence recording services.

"Where possible, environmentally sustainable design practices will also be incorporated into the concept and building of the courthouse. By investing now we are better placed to provide long term savings and solutions to ongoing concerns for our environment in the future," Mr Barker said.

Otaki MP, Darren Hughes also welcomed the release of the visuals.

"This is a clear sign that we are making progress on a new court for the people of Horowhenua and Otaki.

"I am keen to show the community that a new court is on the way, and with government funding already approved, the planning visuals mean the court is getting closer," Mr Hughes said.

The construction phase in the redevelopment of the Levin Courthouse is scheduled to begin in late 2009 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2010. Work is also currently underway with the Horowhenua District Council regarding the relocation of the existing courthouse.

Over the last eight years five new courthouses have been built and 28 major courthouses refurbished around New Zealand. Two courthouses are currently being built and eight more major refurbishments are either planned or underway.
