New Zealand is uniquely placed to be a world leader on sustainability by developing and marketing environmentally-friendly goods and services, Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel, and Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“New Zealand is uniquely placed by our established competencies in the primary industries and life sciences and our remoteness from global markets to become a world-leading exponent of smart and innovative responses to environmental issues, particularly where goods and services are concerned," Pete Hodgson said.

In a speech for delivery tonight on advancing the government's economic transformation agenda, Pete Hodgson said New Zealand was well-placed to strengthen its reputation for eco-integrity by using internationally recognised eco-standards.

Lianne Dalziel said the [Enhanced Eco-verification programme](//www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainability/eco-verification.html), which was launched in February 2007 along with five other sustainability initiatives, will assist firms to be world leaders in sustainability through the development of environmentally-friendly goods and services that are verified as meeting established standards.

"The aim of the programme is to help New Zealand businesses’ reduce their environmental and carbon footprints through the development of practical and cost-effective tools for firms," Lianne Dalziel said.

Trevor Mallard said that the programme will build on New Zealand’s proven successes.

“We are well-regarded internationally for our response to sustainability issues and we can capitalise on our clean, green image. New Zealand is already leading the world in greenhouse gas measurement and the development of reduction methods in the primary sector. Look at Landcare’s successful programme [carboNZero](http://www.carbonzero.co.nz/), for example,” Trevor Mallard said.

By using eco-verification tools, firms can improve their environmental performance and gain a competitive edge, Lianne Dalziel said.

“New Zealand firms can increase their competitive advantage, and counteract issues like food miles, by developing environmental friendly, low emission products and services and using credible and well-regarded eco-labels to promote them."

Work under way on the Eco-verification initiative includes the following:

- The government is developing a directory of eco-labels and eco-standards to help consumers and suppliers to know what to look for when buying products that describe themselves as “sustainable” or “environmentally friendly”. The directory will be launched in 2008. This directory will also be a useful tool for manufacturers who need to know what eco-labels apply to their products and markets.
- Options are being explored for broadening the delivery of carbon footprint tools and environmental management systems.
- The government is increasing its international engagement to reduce the risk of new standards that undermine New Zealand’s ability to compete in key markets
- A steering group of officials and key external experts has been established to provide a network of expertise on progressing eco-verification initiatives.
