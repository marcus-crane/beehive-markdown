Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has welcomed plans by a third player to enter New Zealand’s mobile phone market.

NZ Communications plans to join Telecom and Vodafone in the near future, offering New Zealand consumers another choice in mobile phone services.

“Today Telecom announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell 5 MHz of paired cellular radio spectrum to NZ Communications that will be suitable for a wide range of cellular technologies.

“This follows on from a recent agreement between NZ Communications and Vodafone which allows NZ Communications to use Vodafone’s 2G network in areas where NZ Communications has no network coverage.

This is a sign that the government’s regulatory settings in telecommunications are working and that new players have the confidence to enter the New Zealand market.

“I am hopeful that similar deals can be struck between other telecommunications companies in the future. It is important to note that these three companies are working together to benefit consumers.

“The New Zealand government has a vision to deliver better, and more cost effective communications, technology and services to all New Zealanders. This vision is also shared by a number of operators in the New Zealand market, and considering new business relationships is one way of achieving this vision.”
