Minister of Conservation Steve Chadwick has welcomed the decision by Japan to suspend plans to catch humpbacks as part of its whaling programme in the Southern Ocean this year.

“We welcome the decision by Japan that it will suspend its decision to take humpback whales” says Steve Chadwick

“This is a very significant development, 50 whales saved is a good start. However we continue to urge Japan to re-examine its whole whaling programme.” says Chadwick.

New Zealand will be joining around thirty other countries to lodge a formal diplomatic protest, or demarche with Japan.

“I hope Japan understands the depth of sentiment in New Zealand, and I strongly encourage Japan to permanently end its plans to take humpbacks”.

“New Zealand rejects the need for lethal whaling as part of scientific research. We know adequate data for science and whale management purposes is already being gathered through non-lethal means.”

Japan’s JARPA II whaling programme in the Southern Ocean still includes plans to take up to 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales.
