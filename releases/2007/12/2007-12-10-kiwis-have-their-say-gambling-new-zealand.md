A benchmark report on New Zealanders’ knowledge, views and experiences of gambling and gambling-related harm was released today by Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor.

The 2006/07 Gaming and Betting Activities Survey, undertaken for the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC), is part of the Ministry of Health’s response to problem gambling.

The survey of almost 2,000 people provides a comprehensive snapshot of New Zealanders’ views on gambling and shows that the current climate of opinion supports New Zealand’s public health approach to addressing problem gambling and its wider impacts.

“New Zealanders believe that gambling harm is an issue to be addressed from an individual through to a community level. They can see a role for individuals, families and whanau, health and social services, Government, gambling operators and the whole community,” said Mr O’Connor.

“This kind of research is an important investment that will help inform future strategies and directions for public awareness campaigns, health services and community programmes around problem gambling.”

The Minister said the results of the survey have come at a time when the Ministry of Health has significantly revised the problem gambling services delivery framework.

The Ministry has introduced a new model for problem gambling services based on experience during the 2004-07 problem gambling levy period. The new model provides a more equitable basis on which to apply problem gambling levy funding, as well as providing improved service coverage.

An important feature of the new approach is an innovative monitoring and evaluation framework that focuses on the outcomes that problem gambling services achieve. The framework provides assurance of the quality and effectiveness of problem gambling services.

“The government is committed to providing quality services for problem gamblers and communities in general, to minimise the harms from problem gambling,” said Mr O’Connor.
