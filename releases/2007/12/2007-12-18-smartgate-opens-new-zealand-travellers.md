Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today announced New Zealanders travelling to Brisbane will now have the advantage of using SmartGate – the ePassport system that allows for quicker border processing.

New Zealanders will become the first non-Australians to be given the option of using the SmartGate automated system for ePassports which contain passengers’ photos on a microchip.

Nanaia Mahuta said it is a positive move for New Zealand travellers.

"This joint initiative is the most significant development for New Zealanders travelling to Australia since the adoption of single-lane processing for Australian and New Zealand passport holders," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"SmartGate has been available at Brisbane International Airport for Australian ePassport holders since August 2007, and the inclusion of New Zealanders is further evidence of the close cooperation between New Zealand and Australia.”

Rick Barker said SmartGate will provide great benefits for New Zealanders.

"There are just over 820,000 New Zealand ePassports in circulation, and about 11,000 New Zealanders travel through Brisbane International Airport in an average week. This system will make it more convenient for them," said Mr Barker.

SmartGate will be progressively introduced into Australia’s remaining international airports over the next 18 months.

To be eligible to use SmartGate, New Zealand travellers will need to be the holder of an ePassport and be aged 18 or over.
