It’s the time of year when many of us are going on holiday, and Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker would like to remind those heading overseas to check their passport is valid and travel fit.

“The most important thing to do before travelling abroad is to check that your passport has not expired. Some countries require six months validity and you should check with your travel agent or local embassy,” Mr Barker said.

“Travellers need to remember that they need a passport to travel to all countries, including Australia, and even though the New Zealand passport provides visa free access to over 50 countries you still need a visa to travel to some parts of the world.

If you find you need a passport in a hurry the Department of Internal Affairs offers a callout service in addition to the urgent and standard services. **Phone 0800 22 50 50.**

"While overseas your passport is the most valuable document you have. Always keep it secure, and store it safely away from view when it’s not in use. Make sure it’s kept in good condition as a damaged passport is not acceptable for travel.

"If the worst does happen and your passport has been lost or stolen you must report the incident to local police and contact the nearest New Zealand Passport office in New Zealand, Australia or the UK. If you are travelling outside those countries you will need to contact the nearest New Zealand Embassy, High Commission or Consulate for assistance. It is also a good idea to keep a copy of your passport stored somewhere else in your luggage, so you have details such as your passport number to hand, if it is lost or stolen.

It is strongly advised that people register their overseas travel details on the SafeTravel website at [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz) before they go so they can be contacted if necessary in an emergency.

“The website is managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and provides a lot of handy information for travellers. People have been looking forward to their holidays all year and we want to ensure they have a stress free time away,” Mr Barker said.
