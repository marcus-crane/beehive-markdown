Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia today announced settlement of the Primary Principals’ Collective Agreement.

The three year agreement caps several months of settlements with Secondary Principals, Primary and Secondary and Area School Teachers.

“It is extremely positive to be able to end the year with this agreement and I want to acknowledge the efforts of all parties,” said Parekura Horomia.

“Together, these agreements will provide a settled environment for the start of the new school year.”

“Primary Principals provide critical leadership in setting the highest standards in teaching and learning in New Zealand schools.” Minister Horomia said.

Primary Principals will vote on the settlement early next year.
