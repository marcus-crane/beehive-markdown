Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) Chief Executive Nick Hill has made a tremendous contribution to the sector since taking on the job almost six years ago, said the Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove.

Mr Cosgrove’s comments follow an announcement by Mr Hill today that he is resigning from his role, effective 28 March 2008, after signalling to the SPARC Board at the start of this year that he was planning a career change. Nick Hill is SPARC’s first and only Chief Executive.

Mr Cosgrove said SPARC can take credit for assisting with New Zealanders’ growing awareness of the importance of sport and recreation for a healthy lifestyle, as well as to our country’s competitive sporting success.

He says Mr Hill leaves SPARC in good health with a wide variety of successful programmes, and he wishes him all for the best for his future endeavours.

Mr Cosgrove said he looks forward to working with SPARC’s new chief executive once he or she is appointed in the New Year.
