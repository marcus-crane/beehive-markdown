Minister of Health David Cunliffe said today he is increasingly concerned at the state of the Capital Coast District Health Board.

A number of recent events and reports, including maternity, paediatric oncology and “sentinel” events (particular serious case based examples) have been brought to the incoming Minister’s attention over recent weeks.

Mr Cunliffe said it was clear from these reports and recent events that there are wide ranging systemic issues at this DHB.

On November 7 Mr Cunliffe informed Parliament that he had serious concerns about Capital and Coast and was considering what options would be appropriate, depending on progress on key issues.

“Since this time it has become increasingly clear that it is important for me to act, which is why I have asked for further urgent advice on the full range of options available,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“I accept there will be no quick fix. Any long-term solution will require all parties at the CCDHB : the Board, the clinicians and management to work together with appropriate support .”

Minister of Health David Cunliffe said he will be making an announcement on this matter as soon as possible.
