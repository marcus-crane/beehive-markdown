Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is inviting budding videographers to pick up their cameras and make the most of summer by entering the ID360 short film competition.

The ID360 short film competition is a Ministry of Youth Development initiative, and is open to all young Kiwis aged 12-24. Offering $10,000 worth of prizes, it will give young people the opportunity to tell their stories and let Aotearoa/New Zealand, and the world, know what identity and diversity means to them.

“Over the next 10 weeks, consider making a short film about what it means to be You, a young person from Aotearoa/New Zealand,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“Everyone has an identity. It could be your family, your culture, your favourite sport or pastime that gives meaning to your life. So make sure you pick up a camera and get filming!” said Nanaia Mahuta

The ID360 Short Film Competition opens on 10 December closes on 29 February 2008, taking advantage of leap year to give entrants one extra day to polish their work! Young people can enter individually or in teams. There are three age categories; 12-15 years, 16-18 years and 19-24 years. Entry is free.

The top 15 short listed films - five from each age category - will be displayed on the ID360 website www.id360.govt.nz from 17 March 2008. Online voting for the People’s Choice Award will be open until 11 April 2008, and the winners will be announced by Nanaia Mahuta at a ceremony at the New Zealand Film Archive on 21 April 2008.
