The Government will in the New Year appoint an expert panel to review outstanding electoral issues following passing of the Electoral Finance Act 2007, says Justice Minister Annette King.

Ms King says the panel will review electoral administration and political party funding, as announced by then Justice Minister Mark Burton in his first reading speech for the Bill.

Following discussions with the Green Party, the Government will also be asking the panel to include a citizens’ jury process as part of comprehensive public participation.

Ms King said the terms of reference and appointments to the panel will be announced in the New Year.

The two stages of the review, both the panel’s work and the public participation process, will be completed by the end of April 2009, she said. “In the first stage the panel of experts will consider issues such as the organisation and structure of electoral agencies, and will report back on options for reorganising the current system if needed,” she said.

“The expert panel will also provide guidelines for the stage two process that encourages the public to participate, and it will prepare background papers for the citizens’ jury process.”
