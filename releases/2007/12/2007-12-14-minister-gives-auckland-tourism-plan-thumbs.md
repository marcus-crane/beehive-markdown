A new plan to transform Auckland into a world-class visitor destination was welcomed today by Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

Bringing the World to Auckland highlights the need for the city to maximise on its opportunity to increase visitor expenditure in the region by $12 billion per year and transform itself from a gateway into a world-class tourist destination.

“The goals in the plan align with those of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, particularly in ensuring New Zealand is a world-class destination. We need to continue to offer consistently high quality services, value for money, and world-class visitor experiences. It is great to see Auckland has shown leadership in implementing a regional strategy aligning to the national strategy,” said Mr O’Connor.

“With 70 percent of all arrivals to New Zealand coming through Auckland it is vital that the first impression we make is a good one. Auckland has the potential to be much more than just a gateway. Ensuring it has excellent infrastructure, easy transport to attractions, and vision and coordination which extends beyond just marketing are vital to delivering on the goals of this plan and the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015.

“The plan also aligns with the Labour-led government’s goal for Auckland to be an internationally competitive, world-class city. For New Zealand to be prosperous our largest city must lead the way and this plan signals a bold and effective change which is necessary not only to increase visitor numbers, but also for large events to be hosted by the city in the future such as the Rugby World Cup 2011.

“I congratulate Auckland on taking leadership in this area and encourage other regions to follow in aligning with the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015,” said Mr O’Connor.
