Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has granted Telecom a brief extension to the timeframe for submitting its Amended Separation Plan to the government which had been due today.

“At Telecom’s request, I have agreed to issue an extension until noon Wednesday 19 December. The Telecommunications Act allows for an extension to be granted while discussions continue to progress complex issues that require additional time to work through the details.

“I am pleased with progress to date and while I recognise the need for rapid progress, many of the issues are complex and inter-related. I am satisfied that a brief extension is warranted under the circumstances,” said Mr Cunliffe.

The Minister will make a decision whether to accept or decline the Amended Plan as soon as is practicable after receiving it from Telecom.

#### Background

Telecom is required to prepare an Amended Separation Plan in consultation with the Minister 15 working days after the close of public submissions. Under section 69J(3) of the Telecommunications Act, the Minister is permitted to extend this deadline.

The Minister is required to decide whether to approve or decline to approve the Plan as soon as practicable after the Amended Separation Plan is submitted.

If the Minister decides not to approve the Amended Plan, he can then take steps (outlined in the Telecommunications Act 2001) to have the Plan finalised to his satisfaction.
