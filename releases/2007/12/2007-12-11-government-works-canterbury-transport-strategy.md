Transport Minister Annette King and Environment Canterbury Chair Sir Kerry Burke have announced that the Government and the Canterbury region are working together to implement a ten-year transport strategy for Canterbury.

Ms King said the process will confirm land transport priorities for the region and identify any funding gap in addressing priority projects.

“The Canterbury region’s key authorities have put a lot of effort and collaboration into developing integrated transport and land use strategies. The Regional Land Transport Strategy, the Canterbury Transport Regional Implementation Plan 2008-2038, district council transport plans and the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy all provide for an integrated approach. On-going collaboration, shared planning, and resourcing through central and regional government are critical to implementing these strategies successfully.”

Ms King said she welcomed Canterbury’s forward-looking approach to transport planning for the whole region.

ECan chair Sir Kerry says the Canterbury region is a significant contributor to New Zealand’s economy and home to the country’s second largest city. “If this region is to continue to grow and prosper it needs an efficient land transport system. Our vision for 2028 is to have ‘the best possible quality of life’. To achieve this we need to work closely with central government achieve our transport goals.”

Central, regional and local government officials will report to the Minister and the Canterbury region in February 2008 on the ten-year transport package and possible funding sources.
