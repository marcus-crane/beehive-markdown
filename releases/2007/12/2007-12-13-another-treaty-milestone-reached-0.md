The Crown and Port Nicholson Block Claims Team have signed an Agreement in Principle to settle all outstanding historical Te Tiriti o Waitangi claims of Taranaki Whânui (Wellington). This is a significant milestone for Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) and the Crown," Minister of Maori affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

“This step in the historical Treaty settlement process is the culmination of years of negotiation between the parties and is a fine testament to the persistence and fortitude of the negotiators. I wish them well in concluding the final stages of the negotiations,” Mr Horomia said.

Claims covered by the Agreement in Principle include those relating to the loss of land Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) suffered in the nineteenth century, the way the Crown administered reserves set aside for Taranaki Whânui, and the loss of their connection to the harbour, forests, waterways and natural resources within the Port Nicholson Block.

"The Agreement in Principle encompasses the transfer of properties of great cultural significance to Taranaki Whânui (Wellington). These include the three islands in the Wellington Harbour, the lakebeds of Kohangatera and Kohangapiripiri at Parangarahu, dendroglyphs and esplanade reserves at Pencarrow, and reserve lands such as Wi Tako Scenic Reserve. This will enhance the conservation management of these sites. Current public access and Crown and third party rights to these reserves will continue.

"The financial redress of the settlement will be $25 million. Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) will also receive the right to purchase a portfolio of up to $120 million worth of Crown-owned land around Wellington, including some land that will be leased back to the Crown. The Crown will also be making a contribution to the costs of settling the claims.

“This is the third Agreement in Principle in the last six months, and there are more to come over the next few weeks. These agreements collectively propose the transfer of over $60 million in settlement assets, settling historical grievances covering over 30,000 people. This is an exceptional rate of progress.”
