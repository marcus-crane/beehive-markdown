Prime Minister Helen Clark and Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced that the Queen has approved the institution of the New Zealand Customs Service Medal.

“The New Zealand Customs Service was established in 1840 and is one of New Zealand's oldest government departments.

“Over the years the challenges and risks facing Customs Officers have changed. Frontline officers are now involved in preventing activities such as drug smuggling, international organized crime, and people smuggling.

“The New Zealand Customs Service Medal recognizes the special nature and scope of the work of our Customs officers and the significant contribution they make to New Zealand’s border security,” Helen Clark said

Nanaia Mahuta said that the Customs medal aligns Customs officers, and the importance of their work, with other uniformed services such as Police, Fire and Defence, who all have similar medals.

“To have a specific New Zealand Customs Service Medal approved by the Queen is a great honour for the Service and is a significant event in the long and distinguished history of the New Zealand Customs Service”, Nanaia Mahuta said.

The New Zealand Customs Service Medal has been designed by the New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary, Mr Phillip O’Shea, CNZM, LVO.
