Courts Minister, Rick Barker today announced the consultation with court user groups around plans for the new Levin courthouse is close to being concluded, and plans for the new redevelopment will be made public in the next few weeks.

“Consultation has been very worthwhile and feedback has been factored into the finalised concept plans,” Mr Barker said.

“Once the consultation process is concluded, concept plans for the new Levin District Courthouse will be released. During the consultation process we have examined the feasibility and desirably of a wide range of options in conjunction with Court users.

“The new courthouse will be built on the current Stanley Street site and will be designed to meet the needs of the community now and in the future.

“The redevelopment of the Levin courthouse will form part of the largest courts capital investment programme in New Zealand’s recent history.”

Otaki MP, Darren Hughes also welcomed the news the consultation was nearly complete, as it is a project he has worked on and followed closely.

"Our community will eagerly await the concept pans, as we have been looking forward to a new Courthouse for some time. To have the money approved is great, and the release of the plans is the next step in modernising local Court services," Mr Hughes said.

Over the last eight years five new courthouses have been built and 28 major courthouses refurbished around New Zealand. Four courthouses are currently being built and eight more major refurbishments are either planned or underway.
