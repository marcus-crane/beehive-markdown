Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson today congratulated New Zealand technology company Right Hemisphere on their recognition as an emerging software vendor to watch, by Manufacturing Business Technology, an US based monthly trade IT and manufacturing publication.

Right Hemisphere's Product Graphics Management software enables manufacturers to globally source, sell, and service products more effectively by delivering the right 2D & 3D product graphics, in the right format.

Over 500 innovative manufacturers, including five of the top six automotive, and nine of the top 10 U.S. aerospace and defence contractors rely on Right Hemisphere to dramatically accelerate time to market, increase product and services revenues, and lower product communications.

“A little over a year ago the government signed a deal with Right Hemisphere to work together to boost the local 3D industry. Right Hemisphere retains the major part of its world-beating research and development in New Zealand in return for an interest-free US$8 million loan,” said Pete Hodgson.

"The Labour-led government is committed to increasing the number of firms that can compete offshore as part of our agenda to transform New Zealand into an export-led, innovative, and high wage economy - and this is part of that work.

“I celebrate their success and their Kiwi innovation. New Zealanders are increasingly involved in the ‘weightless’ area of business including design, marketing research and development,” Pete Hodgson said.

Founded in 1997, Right Hemisphere is a privately held, venture-funded  
corporation based in Silicon Valley and Auckland, New Zealand.
