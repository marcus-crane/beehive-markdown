“Wearing three hats on behalf of the Labour-led government is a logical and positive move to help coordinate work around New Zealand’s economic transformation,” Minister for Economic Development, for Research Science and Technology, and for Tertiary Education, Pete Hodgson said today.

He made his comments as he released a suite of the briefing papers to incoming ministers associated with economic transformation, after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.

The portfolios grouped together are: Economic Development, Research Science and Technology, Tertiary Education, Labour, Building Issues, and Small Business.

“The government, its agencies, and the business community have been incredibly busy, as the papers demonstrate.

“New Zealand like many other countries is looking into the future and planning now to be better placed to succeed economically in an increasingly globalised world,” said Pete Hodgson.
