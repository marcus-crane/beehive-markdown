Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has today called for public submissions on Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan.

“Telecom has made a number of improvements and other changes that will be of interest to industry stakeholders,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“While I am conscious of the need to complete the details of Telecom’s operational separation as quickly as possible, this is a matter of great significance to the telecommunications industry. It is appropriate that I seek their views on the changes Telecom has made before making my decision whether to accept this Plan.”

“The process is on track and progress is being made but given the scale of Telecom’s amendments I believe further public consultation is needed “

“I thank the Telecom team, and in particular the CEO Dr Paul Reynolds, for the continuing co-operation and good will they have shown through this process. I also welcome the commitments Telecom has made last week to improving broadband to rural New Zealand and to consult widely on their NGN programme through their Dialogue initiative.”

Mr Cunliffe has also updated his Determination of further requirements for Telecom’s Operational Separation. The Amending Determination addresses a number of matters designed to improve the workability of the separation regime, as well as modifying the requirements in respect of Wholesale staff incentives and IP interconnection.

All interested persons are invited to give written comments on the Amended Separation Plan to the Ministry of Economic Development.

 

 Submissions must be in writing and should be sent electronically to [operational.separation@med.govt.nz](mailto:operational.separation@med.govt.nz%20%20?subject=Telecom%20operational%20separation)  or by mail to:
