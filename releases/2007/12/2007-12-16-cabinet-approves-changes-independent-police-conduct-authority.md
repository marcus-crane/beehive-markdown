Six proposals to further enhance the independence and effectiveness of the Independent Police Conduct Authority were announced by Associate Justice Minister, Rick Barker today.

“The proposals, now agreed to by Cabinet, will provide a more credible and effective oversight system that will help ensure increased public confidence that Police misconduct will be identified and addressed,” Mr Barker said.

Cabinet has agreed to six proposals to enhance the role of the Authority, which will:

- Allow the Authority to undertake its own investigations of complaints about Police misconduct in defined circumstances.
- Allow the Authority to conduct own motion investigations into serious incidents or incidents of significant public interest.
- Amend the current secrecy and privilege provisions so that information gathered during the Authority’s investigations can be used in subsequent proceedings.
- Give Authority investigators the necessary powers to carry out their enhanced investigatory role.
- Enable the Authority to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prosecution, where it has investigated a matter itself, or directed and controlled a Police investigation; and,
- Allow the Official Information Act to apply to the Authority.

“The new measures will enhance public confidence in the Authority by giving the Authority more scope to act, by amending the secrecy and privilege provisions and by providing more transparency and accountability through the Official Information Act,” Mr Barker said.

The proposals are the latest in a series of amendments designed to enhance the role of the Authority.

The government has responded the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct through the passage of the Independent Police Conduct Authority Amendment Act 2007 in November, and will seek to introduce a Bill implementing the new measures next year.
