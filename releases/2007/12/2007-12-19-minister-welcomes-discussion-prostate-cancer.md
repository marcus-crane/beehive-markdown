Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed the public discussion around screening for prostate cancer.

The Minister was responding to recent media coverage on a review of research on prostate screening published by the recently formed Cancer Standards Institute.

“Prostate screening is a very difficult issue as we are discussing complicated evidence which is still inconclusive,” said Mr O’Connor.

“There is international research underway to provide robust answers to some of the outstanding questions but the results may not be available for another two years.

“This makes it all the more important that men and their families have access to good, straight forward information. At present they are not getting it in the form that they need to make informed decisions.

“We need to see progress in this area and the government will be asking the key players to come together early in the new year to move things forward,” he said.
