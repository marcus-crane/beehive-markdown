Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe advises that he has received Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan.

“I am now required to make a decision whether to accept the Amended Separation Plan, and I will do so as soon as practicable,” Mr Cunliffe said. “I will provide an update in due course.”

The Minister is required to decide whether to approve or decline to approve Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan as soon as practicable after it has been submitted.

If the Minister decides not to approve the Amended Separation Plan, he can then take steps (outlined in the Telecommunications Act 2001) to have the Plan finalised to his satisfaction.
