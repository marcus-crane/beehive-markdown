Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick is encouraging New Zealanders to get out and about to take advantage of the many new conservation highlights that are open for their first summer season.

“There’s a huge range of free outdoor fun and activities on conservation land, for anyone looking to relax and enjoy some fresh air and hopefully some good weather over Christmas. There are 1521 scenic reserves across the country, and 430 recreation reserves.

“Department of Conservation (DOC) staff have had a busy year, giving us even more choice about what to enjoy this summer, from new campsites at Canaan Downs in Takaka, in Kaweka Forest Park on the Napier-Taihape road and on D’Urville Island in the Marlborough Sounds.

“We have also opened the largest conservation park in decades this year. The Hakatere conservation park in the Ashburton Lakes area covers 68,000 hectares of high country, mountains, lakes, streams and tussock, and also includes the Mount Hutt skifield.

“As well as its stunning natural beauty, this park offers kiwi families almost endless recreation, from water skiing, sailing, trout fishing and tramping.”

There are 950 back country huts to stay in across the country, which along with DOC campgrounds provide basic accommodation beside beaches, lakes, forests and mountains.

Other new activities on conservation land include:

- The first ever mountain biking trail in a national park opened this month in the Poulter Valley in Arthur's Pass National Park (it was approved by the NZ Conservation Authority)
- New Waiotauru Bridge opened at Otaki Forks giving access to tracks, swimming, camping and picnicking. The original bridge was washed away in floods in January 2005
- New boardwalk opened at Nukuhou Salt Marsh on the shores of Ohiwa Harbour on the Bay of Plenty coast.

“Public conservation land belongs to everyone, and provides a wonderful playground for all of us to enjoy during the summer break."
