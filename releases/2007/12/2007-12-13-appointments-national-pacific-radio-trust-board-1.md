Fa'amatuainu Tino Pereira has been appointed as the new chair of the National Pacific Radio Trust Board, Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The trust board is the governing body for the Pacific radio network, Niu FM, and Auckland’s Pacific station, Radio 531pi.

The National Pacific Radio Trust is a charitable trust, established to deliver a national Pacific radio network which will contribute to the government’s goals for building the capacity of Pacific communities.

"Fa’amatuainu Tino Pereira has been vice-chair since 2004 and was an inaugural member of the Trust Board. He has over 20 years experience as a journalist and broadcaster and specialises in the provision of training courses for pacific people in broadcasting, health and leadership skills. He has considerable governance experience and is currently a board member of the Health Sponsorship Council, and the Pacific Cooperation Foundation."

Mr Pereira takes over from the outgoing Chair Satiu Simativa Perese, who has chaired the board since its inception in 2002.

"I would like to thank Mr Perese for all his hard work and for the valuable contribution he has made to Pacific Broadcasting. Not only has he seen the National Pacific Radio Trust though its early stages, he has successfully presided over the development of Niu FM and its merger last year with the Auckland Pacific radio station 531pi," said Trevor Mallard.

"Marilyn Kohlhase of Auckland is a new appointment to the board. Currently the co-director of Okaioceanikart Gallery, her recent two terms on the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand and as chair of the Pacific Arts Committee have developed her governance experience and networks in New Zealand’s Pacific communities.

"I am also pleased to announce the reappointments of James Prescott and Brian Chamberlain whose skills are a continuing asset to the trust board.

"These appointments will provide a solid basis for the trust board’s work in continuing to strengthen the structures and impact of Niu FM and Radio 531pi in their joint role of promoting pacific languages and culture throughout New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.
