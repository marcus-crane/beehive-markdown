“Clevedon Coast Oysters is a company that exemplifies the future of New Zealand agribusiness,” Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today, during his visit to the company’s processing facilities in Clevedon.

He said the company had taken a long-term strategic view of their product and market, and deliberately aimed high.

“This exemplifies the vision I presented last week to participants at the Primary Industry Summit in Christchurch.

“New Zealand cannot hope to compete against countries that rely on the exploitation of cheap labour or the exhaustion of their physical environment. We must position ourselves at the top of the value chain, as producers of high quality, environmentally sustainable foods.”

Jim Anderton said sustainability has been identified as New Zealand’s greatest marketing opportunity in the years leading up to 2020, and beyond. He said oyster culture is one of the best examples in New Zealand today of a sustainable industry.

“These farms have minimal impact on the natural environment and our oysters feed on a naturally-occurring and renewable food source – plankton,” he said.

This market positioning has been taken a step further by Clevedon Coast Oysters through their organic certification to the internationally recognised AgriQuality Organic Standard.

Jim Anderton said the high quality of our natural environment and clean waters makes New Zealand one of the most ideal countries in the world for growing seafoods. “

“Our isolation and pristine coastal waters provide New Zealand with a unique point of differentiation in global markets. To ensure New Zealand’s position at the top end of world markets, we must continue to maintain the high quality of our food products and the high quality of our natural environment.

“The government has a key role to play as a partner in this process.”

A recent industry report from Rabobank suggests New Zealand is well-placed for growing seafoods. The report says that aquaculture is the world’s fastest-growing supply of food protein.
