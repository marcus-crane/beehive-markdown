Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the appointment of David Caygill, Chair of the Electricity Commission, to the Commerce Commission as an associate member, effective from 1 January 2008.

“David Caygill returns to the Commerce Commission, having until recently been its Deputy Chair,” Lianne Dalziel said. “His appointment will continue the coordination and communication between the Commerce and Electricity Commissions, particularly with regard to electricity regulation.”

The Electricity Commission oversees the performance of the electricity industry while the Commerce Commission administers a targeted control regime that applies to electricity lines companies. Since 2004, the Chair of the Electricity Commission has been cross-appointed to the Commerce Commission to ensure a consistent approach between the two Crown entities.

The targeted control regime will be replaced under Government reforms planned for 2008. Electricity lines businesses will then be subject to an improved forward-looking incentive regulation under the general regulation provisions in Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986. The cross-appointment will remain just as important.

“I am pleased that David Caygill will be participating in the transition,” said Lianne Dalziel.

The Minister also thanked outgoing Associate Member, Peter Harris, for his contributions to the Commerce Commission.
