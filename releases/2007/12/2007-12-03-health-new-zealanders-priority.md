Investment in healthcare is resulting in more New Zealanders seeing their doctor and the highest rate of elective surgery since reliable reporting began, Minister of Health David Cunliffe said.

“Having a healthy population that can afford to access health care services is the priority of this government,” Mr Cunliffe said.

He said while National continued to trot out the same old line about bureaucracy increasing this government had got on with the real work of delivering an affordable accessible healthcare system.

“This year we have had studies show that elderly are seeing their doctor more often, more New Zealanders are accessing prescription medicines than ever and more than 112,000 people had elective surgery.”

“Yes, we have administrators and managers, because we need doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers to see patients, not answer telephones and make appointments.”

Since 1999 there have been an additional 4,000 nurses, an extra 1,239 medical personnel and an extra 675 allied health professionals employed in the New Zealand health service.

“Today’s press release from the National Party simply shows their desperation at trying to divert the public’s attention away from their market forces approach to health that would make health services unaffordable and inaccessible,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“This Government has increased doctor training places, significantly reduced the cost of seeing a doctor, instigated a major hospital building programme, provided thousands of children with fruit every day at school, reduced the cost of most prescriptions to just $3 and provided more elective surgeries than ever before.”

“Once again we have something from National on health that leaves key information out. How many people would National make redundant in the health sector? How much would they spend on health? How much would it cost to see a GP under National?”
