Foreign Minister Winston Peters said he was deeply shocked and saddened by the news earlier today of the assassination of Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto.

"This is a terrible and cowardly act and those responsible must be held accountable for what they have done.

Benazir Bhutto recently returned to Pakistan to stand in the forthcoming parliamentary elections and had emerged as a very strong candidate. Her death is an untimely and tragic loss to Pakistan at this important time in its political history.

"It will be important that Pakistan stay on the path of democracy: any other course could be seen as a victory for those responsible for this horrible crime.

"I extend my deepest sympathy to Benazir Bhutto's family and to all the people of Pakistan for their loss at this difficult time," Mr Peters said.
