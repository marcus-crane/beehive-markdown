Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick has opened a new campsite on the banks of the Ngaruroro River in Kaweka Forest Park.

She says the new camping facilities at Kuripapango are ideally located close to road, track and helipad access to the park, and will be used by a range of people over the summer months, from trampers to fishing, to tourists wanting an overnight rest.

“This new hidden jewel is one of 100 potential sites identified for campsites on public land by the Department of Conservation, as part of the Labour-led government’s mission to preserve the traditional kiwi camping holiday.

“The nearby Ngaruroro River provides fantastic opportunities for outdoor activities, from fishing, rafting, swimming, walking and other recreation for families, young and old.”

The new camping area will have space for up to 50 people at 20 tent sites and 10 campervan spots. There will also be secluded camping sites in parts of the park, where vehicles are not permitted.

Steve Chadwick says local people in Hawkes Bay were consulted last year and identified this site as ideal for public camping, and she is delighted it will be open in time for this summer season.

“It is about 60 kilometres from Napier on the Taihape road, which means travellers can use it as an overnight resting point to relax and enjoy the wonderful natural attractions of the area.”

New facilities built on the site include fencing, toilets and better access to the river.
