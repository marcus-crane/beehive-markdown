The Crown and Port Nicholson Block Claims Team have signed an Agreement in Principle to settle all outstanding historical Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi claims of Taranaki Whânui (Wellington), Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Michael Cullen announced today.

Claims covered by the Agreement in Principle include those relating to the loss of land Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) suffered in the nineteenth century, the way the Crown administered reserves set aside for Taranaki Whânui, and the loss of their connection to the harbour, forests, waterways and natural resources within the Port Nicholson Block.

"This Agreement in Principle is a significant milestone for Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) and the Crown," said Dr Cullen.

"Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) have a significant presence around Wellington Harbour. This settlement will both settle the historical grievances of this iwi grouping in the Wellington, Hutt and Upper Hutt region and recognise their importance in the development of these areas.

"The Agreement in Principle encompasses the transfer of properties of great cultural significance to Taranaki Whânui (Wellington). These include the three islands in the Wellington Harbour, the lakebeds of Kohangatera and Kohangapiripiri at Parangarahu, and reserve lands such as Wi Tako Scenic Reserve. This will enhance the conservation management of these sites.

"Current public access and Crown and third party rights to these reserves will continue.

"We have also agreed to explore the transfer of dendroglyphs and esplanade reserves at Pencarrow.

"The financial redress of the settlement will be $25 million. Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) will also receive the right to purchase a portfolio of up to $120 million worth of Crown-owned land around Wellington, including some land that will be leased back to the Crown.

"The Crown will also be making a contribution to the costs of settling the claims.

"The way in which we settle historical grievances in a peaceful and constructive way is something we should be proud of as a nation. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the weight of this grievance that has been borne by Taranaki Whânui (Wellington) for so many years.

“This is the third Agreement in Principle in the last six months, and there are more to come over the next few weeks. These agreements collectively propose the transfer of over $60 million in settlement assets, settling historical grievances covering over 30,000 people. This is an exceptional rate of progress.”
