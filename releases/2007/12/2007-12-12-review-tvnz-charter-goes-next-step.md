Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard is submitting a proposed redraft of Television New Zealand Ltd's (TVNZ's) Charter to the Commerce Select Committee for consideration as part of the next step in the normal five yearly Charter review process.

"Under TVNZ’s legislation, parliament must review the Charter at least every five years. In anticipation of the first review, due to begin by the end February 2008, TVNZ took the initiative of redrafting the document and making it available for public comment. Over 280 submissions were received and further changes were made to the draft after taking the submissions into account.

"I am now sending the new draft Charter to the select committee for it to undertake the next step in the review process," Trevor Mallard said.

The Television New Zealand Charter sets out in broad terms the kinds of services and programmes the public television broadcaster is to provide to New Zealand audiences, and the qualities it should display in doing so.

The proposed changes aim to retain the essential elements of the current Charter, while making it more concise and readable. New provisions relating to coverage of business and financial issues, providing for audience members with disabilities, and recognising TVNZ’s Pacific service have been added.

The draft is also arranged under thematic headings matching those that the broadcaster is to use in reporting on its performance against the Charter.

Trevor Mallard said it was up to the select committee to undertake the TVNZ Charter review as they see fit, including timing issues and the level of consultation.

The proposed redraft of the Charter may be viewed on TVNZ’s website at [www.tvnz.co.nz](http://www.tvnz.co.nz).
