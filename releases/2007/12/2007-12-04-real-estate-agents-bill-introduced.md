Legislation to overhaul real estate law has been introduced to Parliament, said the Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove today.

Mr Cosgrove said the Bill delivers on the government’s promise to bring accountability, transparency and openness to the real estate sector, and to establish an independent complaints system that protects consumers and supports honest real estate professionals.

"New Zealanders' greatest asset is often their home, so it is paramount that people have access to a transparent and effective disciplinary process should they feel they have been ripped off," he said.

"Given the high level of concern among members of the public on this issue, I have moved swiftly to introduce these reforms."

The Real Estate Agents Bill puts an end to self-regulation of the industry and introduces a range of new consumer protection measures, including compensation for consumers who have been ripped off.

Mr Cosgrove said the industry’s "closed shop" practices for dealing with complaints were a major factor behind the government’s decision to remove its privilege of self-regulation.

The Bill:

- **Removes regulatory functions from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ)**. There will no longer be a compulsory requirement for agents to be members of REINZ
- **Creates an independent Real Estate Agents Authority** to oversee licensing, complaints, disciplinary and enforcement processes and provide information for consumers. The Authority will have wide investigative powers and will be able to order a wide range of penalties and remedies
- **Creates an independent Disciplinary Tribunal** to deal with serious cases, which will have the ability to order the cancellation of licences and award compensation. Complainants will not be required to hire lawyers because the Authority - through its Complaints Assessment Committee (CAC) - will represent their case if it is referred to the Disciplinary Tribunal
- Establishes a **public register of real estate agents** and salespeople that records any breaches of the industry standards against the names of those involved
- Requires **licensees to undergo ongoing professional development** training
- Makes changes to the **conduct required in the day to day running of a real estate agency business**, including mandatory disclosure requirements (including possible conflict of interest), requirements to provide information to buyers and sellers in certain situations and new auction requirements

"Consumers will be better protected by an independent disciplinary process with effective redress for breaches of a new code of conduct and of the law. Honest real estate professionals will no longer be tarred by the same brush as the last land shark who rips someone off and brings the entire industry into disrepute," Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said the new structure would be funded by the industry, not taxpayers, and it will not cost consumers anything to lodge a complaint. Any cases referred to the Disciplinary Tribunal will be represented by the CAC, so complainants will not be required to use the services of lawyers.

The public and the industry will have a further opportunity to comment on the reforms once the Bill is referred to a Select Committee.
