Minister announces reappointment of Ron Paterson as Health and Disability Commissioner

Minister of Health David Cunliffe today confirmed that serving Health and Disability Commissioner Ron Paterson had been reappointed for a further five year term.

Mr Cunliffe praised Mr Paterson’s approach to openness and accountability within the health sector.

“Mr Paterson has demonstrated a strong commitment to furthering the rights of patients and recommending improvements to the health sector when needed, and I am delighted that he has accepted a further five year appointment.”

The Health and Disability Commission focuses on three key areas of work: resolution of complaints; protection of the public; and learning from complaints.

“The work of the Commission in giving consumers a voice and recommending changes to improve health and disability services in this country is vital and Mr Paterson and his team deserve thanks and congratulations for the work they have done and will continue to do.”

Mr Paterson was first appointed to the role of Commissioner in March 2000 for a five year term and was reappointed for a further three years in 2005.

He has had a leading role in health law, ethics and policy in New Zealand for the past decade, and also played a key role in the development of the Code of Rights in 1996.
