Prime Minister Helen Clark today extended her congratulations to the new Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Dr Derek Sikua, who was elected today.

“Solomon Islands is an important Pacific partner for New Zealand. I look forward to working closely with Dr Sikua to further strengthen the relationship,” Helen Clark said.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Solomon Islands has developed over many years of close association - including during the Solomon Islands campaign in World War II.

“The relationship has grown in recent years through New Zealand’s active participation in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. Solomon Islands is New Zealand’s largest bilateral aid programme and New Zealand is committed to a long term development partnership,” Helen Clark said.
