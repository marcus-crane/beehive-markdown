Government Ministers and the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs met today to celebrate the achievements of their partnership and joint commitment to ensuring all New Zealand youth are on a clear pathway to work.

Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson said the success of the partnership is reflected in new numbers showing there has been a 96 percent reduction since 2002 in the number of 18 and 19 year olds on Unemployment Benefit for more than 13 weeks.

“Five years ago, when the Mayors’ Taskforce and government established its joint focus on reducing unemployment, there was widespread concern about the number of young people receiving an Unemployment Benefit for long periods of time,” said Dale Williams, Mayor of Otorohanga and Chair of the Taskforce.

“These new figures show we have seen dramatic improvements in the lives of our young people,” said Ruth Dyson.

“When the partnership between Mayors and central government was formed, more than 6,000 young people had been on an Unemployment Benefit for longer than 13 weeks,” said Ruth Dyson.

“The number of 18 and 19 year olds on an Unemployment Benefit for longer than 13 weeks in December 2007 is fewer than 250, a drop of more than 96 percent since 2002. All of these young people are engaged in activities that will lead to their economic independence and wellbeing,” said Ruth Dyson.

Dale Williams said extensive development work is being carried out to prepare for future labour market needs. “The particular areas of interest to us as Mayors are the opportunities that can be created by investing in youth locally and through promoting Maori youth enterprise and entrepreneurship, as well as by identifying more opportunities for disabled young people as employees”, he said.

Ruth Dyson said these areas of focus complement the work that the Labour-led government is doing to keep young people actively engaged in their careers. “It is important we continue to develop services and programmes that encourage our young people to fulfill their potential.

“The Labour-led government and the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs remain committed to ensuring all New Zealand youth are on a clear pathway to long term economic independence and wellbeing. Early next year we will establish a new measurable target in which to evaluate the success of our continued partnership,” said Ruth Dyson.
