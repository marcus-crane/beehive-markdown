Minister of Māori Affairs, Parekura Horomia today announced the appointment of Mr Craig Coxhead and Mr Stephen Clark to the bench of the Māori Land Court.

"I am extremely pleased with these appointments, both are high-calibre with a notable history of work in Māori land law and Treaty of Waitangi issues.

"I am confident that the new judges will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the bench of the Māori Land Court.

"The Māori Land Court is of major importance to whanau, hapu, iwi and Māori development. Ensuring we are able to navigate through Māori land issues to better utilise and develop Māori owned land and work our way through the often unique processes that collective land ownership creates will be of benefit for all.

"The jurisdiction of the Māori Land Court has increased significantly through the enactment of recent legislation and additional judges, to be located in Hamilton and Wellington, will help in with the increased workload"

"The new judges have the skills, the ability and the courage to carry out this work while preserving the integrity of the Māori Land Court in today's environment.
