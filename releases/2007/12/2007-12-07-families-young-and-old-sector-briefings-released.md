Justice Minister Annette King says government departments and agencies are doing a huge amount of work to improve the quality of our public services and living standards for New Zealanders.

She made her comments today when releasing the range of briefings to incoming ministers (BIMs) in the families, young and old, sector following the recent cabinet reshuffle.

"The briefings outline a range of work going on to support families, to ensure that we live in safe and healthy communities, to lift standards in education and to protect the most vulnerable people in our society," Ms King said.

"The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring that all families, young and old, have the support and choices they need to be secure and to be able to reach their full potential within our knowledge-based economy.

"The briefings highlight the huge amount of progress that has been made. Policies such as the introduction of 20 hours of free early childhood education, increasing the number of teachers in classrooms, and providing additional support to families through Working for Families are all making a considerable difference.”

Ms King said the reports also highlight “a range of challenges we will face over coming years and we look forward to working to address those.

"Since 1999 our Government has been committed to giving all New Zealanders a stake in society, and to ensuring the benefits of economic transformation can be widely shared. Under Labour our families, young and old, are healthier, wealthier and more secure, and our Government will continue to build a fair society and a strong economy to improve prosperity for all."
