Housing Minister Maryan Street today announced the re-appointment of three members of the Housing New Zealand Corporation board.

“I’m pleased to announce board chair Pat Snedden and board member Greg Hinton have been re-appointed for a further term of three years and that Tony Paine has been re-appointed for a further 18 months.”

The re-appointments were approved on 17 December and the terms extend from that date, the minister said.

“All members considered for re-appointment were assessed against a range of criteria; with a particular focus on strong governance experience, property management, and institutional knowledge.

“The board steers the Crown’s second largest Crown entity and I wish them well in continuing their good work to date,” she said.

Pat Snedden was appointed to the board in August 2000 and as chair in 2004. He chairs the Counties Manukau District Health Board and is a director of Watercare Services Ltd. He is deputy chair of the ASB Trust and on the board of the Ngati Whatua-owned radio station Mai FM.

Greg Hinton was appointed to the board in July 2005 and has a background in accounting, property management and property development. He is an executive director of NSI Management Ltd, a director of A2 Corporation Ltd and Chalmers Properties Ltd as well as the director of a number of private companies.

Tony Paine was appointed to the board in November 2004 and has qualifications in social work and management. He has a background in not-for-profit management and social services and is the chief executive officer of the Christchurch Arts Centre. Tony was previously the chief executive of Comcare Charitable Trust and held a position with the New Zealand Aids Foundation.
