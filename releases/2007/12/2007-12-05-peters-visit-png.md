Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves tomorrow for a four-day visit to Papua New Guinea, where he will hold talks with his new counterpart Sam Abal, and with Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare.

Mr Peters will also travel to the Highlands provinces of Enga and Western Highlands, where he will meet with local authorities and community leaders.

“Papua New Guinea has a significant influence in the Pacific, and it plays a central role in developments shaping the future economic progress and stability of the region,” Mr Peters said.

“PNG has also shown leadership on regional challenges such as Fiji and RAMSI mission in the Solomon Islands, both of which will be on the agenda during our talks, along with a range of other economic, political and security issues.

“New Zealand and Papua New Guinea also share common views on a number of global interests, with PNG being a leading voice on international climate change initiatives, which New Zealand strongly supports.”

Mr Peters said he would be express New Zealand’s sympathies to Sir Michael over the recent floods in Oro province, which killed at least 160 people, and have affected over 100,000 others.

The government, through its international development agency NZAID, has already committed $100,000 to initial relief efforts, and provided generators, tarpaulins, blankets and water containers.
