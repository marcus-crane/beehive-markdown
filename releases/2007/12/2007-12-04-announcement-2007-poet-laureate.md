Minister responsible for the National Library Judith Tizard announced Michele Leggott as New Zealand’s Poet Laureate for 2007/08 at a function at Parliament this evening.

“Michele has made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand poetry and I’m thrilled to announce her role as the 2007/08 New Zealand Poet Laureate.”

Michele is a distinguished poet, highly regarded by her peers. She is an Associate Professor in the University of Auckland’s English Department and has published five books of poetry and edited five anthologies of poetry and criticism. Her volume of poetry, DIA, and was awarded the Best NZ Poetry Book Award in 1995.

Michele’s commitment to the New Zealand poetry scene is exemplified by her role in producing the Bluff 06 Poetry Symposium, and as a co-founder and director of the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre, an important international and national digital resource for poets, schools, universities and the reading public.

The Award was established earlier this year to recognise writers who have made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand poetry. Administered by the National Library of New Zealand, the Poet Laureate is selected biennially and receives an award of $50,000 per year.

“Poetry is an important part of New Zealand art and culture. In funding this new award, the Labour-led government is acknowledging the value that New Zealanders’ place on poetry and literature as a part of our national identity,” Judith Tizard said.

The Poet Laureate's working papers and published work will be preserved in the National Library’s National Digital Heritage Archive and in the collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library.

“Having the National Library collect the workings of the Poet Laureate as well as their published works will ensure future generations have a more complete understanding of our poetry today.”

The award complements existing literary awards by acknowledging the creative process as well as recognising specific work.

The New Zealand Poet Laureate Award is based on the Te Mata Poet Laureate scheme, which it will supersede.
