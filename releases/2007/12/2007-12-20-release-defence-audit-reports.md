Defence Minister Phil Goff has today made public 12 audit reports evaluating New Zealand Defence Force and Ministry of Defence functions and acquisition projects.

“The reports, prepared under the Defence Act 1990, cover the 2006/2007 financial year period. Section 24(2)(e) of the Defence Act authorises the Secretary of Defence to audit and assess, on behalf of the Minister, the Defence Force in relation to any function, duty or project, and the Ministry of Defence in relation to the acquisition of significant items of military equipment,” Phil Goff said.

“This statutory requirement is unique among public sector agencies. It is a very important check to ensure that the Government’s investment of $7.6 billion since 1999 in modernising and re-equipping the New Zealand Defence Force is being spent wisely.

“Most areas of activity receive very positive comments from the auditors. However, the reports also highlight areas where there is room for improvement in processes and outcomes and I need to be assured that appropriate remedial steps are being taken in these areas.

“As part of this assurance process I am also releasing a set of update reports which explain why each audit was undertaken, summarise the key findings, and the list of recommendations and the follow up actions that have been taken since the original reports were completed,” Mr Goff said.

The reports and the updates have been lodged for reference at the Defence Library in Defence House and the Parliamentary Library in Wellington.
