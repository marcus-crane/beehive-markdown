The Transport Accident Investigation Commission

The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent accident investigation body for aviation, rail and maritime accidents. Its principal purpose is to determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future rather than ascribing blame. The Commission consists of three to five members who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Transport is responsible for appointing one member as the Chief Commissioner and another member as the Deputy Chief Commissioner. Currently there are three Commissioners: Hon Bill Jeffries (Chief Commissioner), Ms Winter (Deputy Chief Commisisoner) and Mr Wyness. Further information on the work of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission is available on the Commission’s website http://www.taic.org.nz.
