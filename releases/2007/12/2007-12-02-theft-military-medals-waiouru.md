Defence Minister Phil Goff has described the theft of military medals including nine Victoria Crosses and two George Cross medals as a crime against the nation.

The medals were stolen from the Army Museum in Waiouru at around 1am today.

“These medals are national treasures. They were earned by men who served their country with courage and selflessness,” Phil Goff said.

“New Zealanders will be appalled and disgusted at the greed and self interest of those who have stolen the medals.

“Every effort possible will be made to recover the medals. They will be almost impossible to sell within New Zealand and we will be working with Interpol to make it as hard as possible to market them internationally.

“I would urge anyone with knowledge of the whereabouts of the medals or of who stole them to contact the police with that information,” Phil Goff said.
