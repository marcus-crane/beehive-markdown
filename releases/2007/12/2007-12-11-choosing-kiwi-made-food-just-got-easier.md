Buy Kiwi Made’s government spokesperson Sue Bradford is delighted Foodstuffs is joining the Buy New Zealand Made campaign.

The campaign’s highly recognisable kiwi in a triangle brand will soon be visible in Four Squares, PAK’nSAVEs and New World supermarkets around the country.

“Foodstuffs is one of the biggest companies to support the Buy New Zealand Made campaign. Its membership sends a signal that Buy Kiwi Made is a concept that is here to stay, for producers, retailers and consumers. Buy Kiwi Made offers New Zealanders a real choice of high quality locally made products that grow their community and economy. It’s good for our workers, our businesses and our communities.”

“Food is one of the sectors where New Zealanders most want to be able to choose New Zealand made and New Zealand grown and yet currently it is one of the hardest sectors to identify New Zealand products because there is so little accurate labelling. I applaud Food Stuffs’ and Buy New Zealand Made Ltd’s commitment empowering New Zealanders to make informed choices about what they are eating.”
