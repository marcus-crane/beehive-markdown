Bill returns the title of Mauao to tângata whenua

Minister of Mâori Affairs Parekura Horomia welcomes the first reading of the Mauao Historic Reserve Vesting Bill which gives effect to the agreement signed between Tauranga Moana Iwi, Waitaha and the Crown in August this year to return the title of Mauao to tângata whenua.

The legislative process to transfer ownership of the Mauao Historic Reserve (Mt Maunganui) to Tauranga Moana Iwi has begun in Parliament with the introduction of the Mauao Historic Reserve Vesting Bill last week.

“Ownership will be vested in Tauranga Moana Iwi (Ngâi Te Rangi, Ngâti Ranginui and Ngâti Pûkenga), but the legislation will also record Waitaha’s historical associations with Mauao,” Mr Horomia says.

While the fee simple title will be vested in the local iwi through a trust, public access and third-party use rights will remain unaffected. The Tauranga City Council will continue to administer the reserve.

The Minister says the Government intends that the Bill will become law by June next year.
