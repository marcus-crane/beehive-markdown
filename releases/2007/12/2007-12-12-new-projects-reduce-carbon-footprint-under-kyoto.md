The Department of Conservation has six new projects going out to tender this week, which will help reduce New Zealand’s carbon footprint by restoring native land and reducing pests.

Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick says the projects give the commercial sector the opportunity to earn carbon credits by investing in restoration or pest control on conservation land.

“This kind of partnership between the Labour-led government and the commercial sector is at the heart of our mission to effectively tackle climate change, and become a more sustainable nation.

“It’s a victory for both sides as the projects will reduce pests, encourage regeneration and increase biodiversity in New Zealand, as well as helping to reduce our carbon footprint and earn carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol.”

It supports the wider government strategy to reduce the impact of climate change; including the emissions trading scheme, increasing renewable electricity generation, improving energy efficiency, and initiatives for sustainable land management.

The six projects cover 4670 hectares of land for restoration, and 160,000 hectares for pest control. They include land in Buller, Wanganui, the east coast of the North Island, Canterbury, Nelson/Marlborough/West Coast region, and there are smaller coastal projects throughout the country from Canterbury to Northland.

Steve Chadwick says the projects will help us find out more about how much carbon indigenous forests can absorb, and each project will also have another conservation initiative going on simultaneously.

Information on the tendering of the six projects will be available on the Department of Conservation website from this Friday 14th December.

Applications for these projects will be accepted up to 31st March 2008, with successful tenders expected to be announced in April in time for next year’s planting season.
