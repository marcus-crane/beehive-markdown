Housing Minister Maryan Street today opened a $5m housing complex in Christchurch, a joint venture between Housing New Zealand Corporation and the Christchurch City Council.

The complex, called Whakahoa Village, comprises 20 one and two bedroom homes in Gowerton Place in Richmond, an area of high housing need near Christchurch’s central business district.

"These safe, secure homes have been built with energy efficiency and environmental design in mind.

They are a significant addition to Christchurch’s already impressive social housing portfolio, the largest of any local authority," Maryan Street said.

"There is a growing demand for more affordable housing and the Labour-led government believes partnerships between local and central government are critical to tackling the issue.

This project is a tangible example of what can be achieved.

"Yesterday I introduced the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Bill to parliament, which will give councils further tools with which to create more affordable housing."

A decent, affordable roof over a person’s head can make a significant difference to their social, health and economic outcomes. The homes in Whakahoa Village hold that promise. They will help make Christchurch a better place, the minister said.

"Housing New Zealand’s Housing Innovation Fund has put up 50 per cent of the cost of Whakahoa, some $2.4m.

The Council has provided the remaining 50 per cent and contributed the land.

By working together both organisations have made a development possible that each would have struggled to do on its own.

"In addition, both Housing New Zealand and the Council have worked very closely together to bring about greater alignment in policy and operations in their respective housing networks.

"The Council has worked hard to bring its housing criteria closer to Housing New Zealand’s needs-based Social Allocation System, and processes are now in place to share by consent social housing applicant information.

This provides applicants with increased housing options, and makes better use of the total social housing stock city-wide," Maryan Street said.
