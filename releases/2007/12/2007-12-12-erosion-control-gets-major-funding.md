Tackling the problem of erosion in high country areas of the Manawatu and Wanganui catchments has just received a significant funding boost.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today that he was pleased to announce that MAF has just approved a grant of $5.873 million to Horizons Regional Council as funding for the first four years of its Sustainable Land Use Initiative (SLUI).

“One hundred million cubic metres of silt came down rivers in those areas during the 2004 floods. River beds rose and wiped out flood protection measures that were in place, and the consequences for the region were devastating,” Jim Anderton said. “I want to congratulate the Horizons Regional Council for developing this plan to help protect this highly erodible land. And I want to congratulate those farmers who will actively engage in the scheme.”

Palmerston North MP Steve Maharey said that everyone in the region will welcome this funding. "I have seen for myself the devastating impact floods have had on our region. It is clear that both rural and urban communities are at risk if we do not address the issue of erosion. “

Steve Maharey said he wanted to congratulate Horizons on the strength of the case it put to Government. "Horizons made sure that everyone from the Prime Minister down was aware of the problem and the solution. I particularly want to thank Jim Anderton, who has done everything he can to assist our region.”  
Under the Government’s Sustainable Land Management (Hill Country Erosion) Framework, a total of $10 million spread over four years has been allocated for this kind of work. Horizon’s is the first application to be approved.

“The purpose of the Hill Country Erosion Fund is to support the protection of the land which is most prone to erosion, potentially posing risks to communities, homes, farms, businesses, roads and bridges,” Jim Anderton said.

“The Horizons scheme has a good fit with those aims, with 75 percent of the farms involved in the SLUI being in the five sub-catchments in the region with the greatest erosion problems.”

The funding will cover protection work which includes changed management systems for the farms, with an emphasis on making sure land use and management suit the soils and topography of each block on the farm. This could include spaced planting with willows and poplars, production forestry and allowing some land to revert to native bush. Further funding for afforestation is expected from the Government’s recently announced $50m Afforestation Grants Scheme, and from carbon credits derived from the Emissions Trading Scheme and Permanent Forest Sinks Initiative.

The MAF grant meets the entire funding request for the first three years of the SLUI and a proportion of the funding in year 4 (the Fund does not have the amount of money sought by Horizons in year 4).

“Horizons has developed a very ambitious programme, which is what is needed to treat a major soil management problem. They are to be congratulated, and I’m sure they will be able to offer useful advice to other regional councils with similar erosion problems,” Jim Anderton said.

Applications for further funding, open to the other Regional Councils in the North Island with a hill country erosion problem, close on Friday 8 February, 2008 with MAF. For further details see:
