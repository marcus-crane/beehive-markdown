Waikato-Tainui and the Crown have reached a major milestone towards the settlement of the tribe’s Waikato River claim.

An Agreement in Principle was signed today at a special meeting of the tribal Parliament for Waikato-Tainui, Te Kauhanganui o Waikato.

The late Sir Robert Mahuta once said “The River belongs to us just as we belong to the river. The Waikato tribe and the River are inseparable. It is a gift left to us by our ancestors and we believe we have a duty to protect that gift for future generations.”

"This settlement will give new strength to the way the river is managed on behalf of all New Zealanders while recognising the special relationship and significance of the river to Waikato-Tainui."

Waikato-Tainui will be joined by the other Waikato River iwi and representatives of the Waikato and wider communities to establish a vision and strategy as the foundation for a new integrated approach to managing the river.

The settlement will provide a new management structure for the river, including 'Guardians of the Waikato River' reflecting the full community of interest in the river and a statutory board to facilitate the participation of Waikato-Tainui in the co-management of the river within and affecting the area from Karapiro to the sea.

This agreement affirms the Crown’s commitment to its relationship with Waikato-Tainui and I would like to recognise the work of Co-Negotiators Tukuroirangi Morgan and Lady Raiha Mahuta, and their role in leading the negotiations on behalf of their people and I wish them well in concluding the final stages of the negotiations,” Mr Horomia said.
