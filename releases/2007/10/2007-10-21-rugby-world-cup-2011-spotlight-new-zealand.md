The next steps in New Zealand's four-year campaign build-up to hosting Rugby World Cup 2011 were announced by Rugby World Cup Minister Trevor Mallard, following the conclusion of the 2007 event in Paris today.

"Congratulations to the new World Cup champions South Africa – and congratulations to France for being superb hosts. It has been a thrilling tournament full of surprises and highs and lows – and France has done a fantastic job ensuring it was an event to remember for thousands of visiting spectators. This all bodes well for New Zealand in 2011," Rugby World Cup Minister Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealand will be in the international spotlight and we very much look forward to welcoming international guests in 2011 and showing New Zealand and all it has to offer to the world – as a great place to visit, to work in, to live in, and to do business with.

''The tournament will not just be a superb sporting event but it has significant economic upsides as well for communities around the country - and is estimated to inject more than $500 million into the economy, including an estimated $250 million into Auckland.

"Just as we did with the America's Cup, the government will be using this major event to profile New Zealand to the rest of the world - our innovation and technology, our fantastic scenery, our cities and our culture.

"With this in mind, I am pleased to announce that we will be launching a Rugby World Cup 2011 leveraging and legacy project in the next couple of months - aimed at ensuring that this tournament delivers lasting and tangible economic, environmental and social benefits to New Zealand.

"This new legacy project will be championed by a soon-to-be-appointed high profile business person - as we want business to get involved, engaged and thinking seriously about the benefits they can secure out of this very major event. This tournament presents an opportunity that New Zealand has never seen before.

"A Rugby World Cup government liaison office will also open in the near future, to work with Rugby New Zealand (RNZ) 2011 Ltd, the tournament organiser, and to be the single point of contact for the government leveraging and legacy and other cross government planning," Trevor Mallard said.

"RNZ 2011 and the government will engage with communities, local government and  
business groups in order to maximise the benefits to be gained from  
hosting the Rugby World Cup and also to help ensure that New Zealand hosts a  
tournament that we can all be proud of.

"I would encourage people to get involved in the activities that will be happening in their communities. As with other Rugby World Cup tournaments, we expect that teams will be hosted in towns and regions throughout the country - providing opportunities for all New Zealanders to really be a part of this tournament – and maybe even adopt a team. This is on top of the obvious economic spinoffs that the Rugby World Cup will provide."

Trevor Mallard said work had begun profiling RWC 2011 to rugby supporters at RWC 2007 – using a "NZ Inc" approach at the Rugby Ball Venue in front of the Eiffel Tower. More than 20,000 people have watched the audio visual presentation inside New Zealand's rugby ball, many thousands more being exposed to the brand outside the ball and the message has also gone out to more than 4000 media outlets.

**Background: Rugby World Cup 2011**  
The joint government-New Zealand Rugby Union company Rugby New Zealand (RNZ) 2011, headed by Martin Snedden, is responsible for the successful delivery of the tournament.

A government steering group is in charge of issues such as security, customs and immigration. This group is also coordinating planning around trade and tourism activities and will feed into the government liaison office once it opens.

The Rugby Ball Venue (more detail below) will be used at other locations over the next four years to continue to promote New Zealand as the host country for Rugby World Cup 2011 and as a trade and tourism destination.

Tourism NZ has set up a "virtual rugby club" fronted by Tana Umaga. This is a viral campaign aimed at building interest in New Zealand's hosting of Rugby World Cup 2011.

Local government coordinated working groups have been established in regions throughout New Zealand aimed at maximising the potential benefits from hosting the RWC. RNZ 2011 has been running a series of workshops aimed at engaging the regions and keeping them informed on tournament planning.  
An Eden Park Redevelopment Board with government-appointed representatives has been established to oversee the redevelopment of Eden Park in Auckland. The government has agreed to help fund the upgrade up to a cost of $190 million.  
New Zealand has participated in the RWC 2007 observation programme and some key agencies will be looking to debrief with French officials post the just-completed RWC in order to learn from the French experience - across a range of activities.

**Facts and figures: the Rugby World Cup**  
It is the third largest sporting event in the world (after the Olympics and FIFA World Cup).  
Expected worldwide audience in excess of three billion.  
Around 66,000 international visitors are expected, along with 2,500 international media, and 2,500 VIP or corporate guests.  
It has been estimated that it will inject over $500 million into economy, including $250 million into the Auckland region.

**The 2007 event: examples of NZ trade and tourism leveraging activity**  
The Rugby Ball Venue has been hosting between 1500 and 2000 visitors a day and has received strong interest from international media including ESPN, American Sports network, Channel Five Live, UK-TV news, BBC, CNN and all the key French television stations.  
Live site screen next to the ball at the semi-final has also given it good exposure to an audience of about 60,000.  
NZ Inc functions have been held at night in the ball venue.  
New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) hosted a cooking course for 45 international journalists and 45 trade contacts to promote NZ food and beverage ahead of the first All Blacks match in Marseilles.  
NZTE has held pre-match corporate hosting for NZ companies – ahead of the All s games – in Marseille, Edinburgh, Toulouse and Cardiff.
