The financial statements of the government for the year ending 30 June 2007 confirm the government’s responsible fiscal strategy is positioning New Zealand for a successful and sustainable future, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

“It is no accident that the government’s fiscal position is strong. It reflects many years of prudent economic and fiscal management, as well as the longest period of economic growth in over a generation”, said Dr Cullen.

The financial statements show an Operating Balance excluding Revaluations and Accounting Changes (OBERAC) surplus of $7.9 billion or 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with $8.6 billion (5.5 per cent) for the previous year.

After allowing for capital investment the cash surplus was $2.6 billion, down from $3.0 billion in the year ended 30 June 2006. Most of the cash surplus has already been built into spending and tax plans.

Gross sovereign-issued debt (GSID) increased by $0.7 billion in 2006/07 to $36.2 billion, but fell as a percentage of GDP to 21.7 per cent. Net core Crown debt was $3.4 billion (2.1 per cent of GDP). Including the $13 billion assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Crown was in a net financial asset position of $9.6 billion (5.7 per cent of GDP).

“When the Labour-led government took office in 1999, GSID was close to 35 per cent of GDP, and we have successfully cut back debt to prudent levels. Our challenge now is to maintain fiscal discipline and keep debt down around its current range,” said Dr Cullen.

“Progress against the government’s fiscal intentions was faster than expected as a result of delayed departmental spending, stronger economic activity and inflation over the latter part of the fiscal year. Allowing revenue to increase is consistent with our policy of letting automatic stabilisers operate and looking through the temporary effects of the economic cycle.

“The net result is that the government is removing significantly more demand from the economy than forecast at Budget time – it would be difficult to argue that the government is contributing to inflationary pressure.

“The Labour-led government’s stewardship is ensuring New Zealand’s fiscal position is strong and sustainable. We will maintain our responsible and disciplined fiscal strategy so that current and future generations of New Zealanders can continue to enjoy quality public services and higher living standards.”
