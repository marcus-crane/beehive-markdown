The electronic filing (e-filing) of unpaid infringements will mean a million fewer pieces of paper a year for Court staff to manage.

Courts Minister, Rick Barker, was photographed outside Parliament with 40 reams of paper, representing the amount of paper and processing that will be saved every week, 52 weeks a year, by shifting to electronic filing of infringement notices.

"This Labour-led government is committed to developing efficient and effective public sector models to promote sustainability and lead the way on this issue," Mr Barker said.

"The e-filing of unpaid infringements is the first step in a bid to cope with the mountains of paper that the Courts deal with and will have a positive impact on efficiency and the environment. It is a cost effective solution based on sustainable practice.

"Prosecuting Authorities such as councils and the Police are now able to file infringement notices in a standard electronic file format and submit them on-line through a Ministry of Justice web-site. To continue with a paper focused filing system would be inefficient and would not deliver on Labour's commitment to sustainable workplace practices.

"Nationally there are 94 Prosecuting Authorities that operate an infringement regime and were required to transition to e-filing. 97% of the infringement volume filed on an annual basis could now be e-filed and the agencies responsible for the remaining 3% will be transitioned as their systems become ready.

"Making the public sector carbon neutral is a key plank of the Labour-led Government's response to climate change and our drive to make New Zealand a sustainable, carbon neutral nation. The e-filing of unpaid infringements is a step in the right direction for Courts and is an example of sustainable behaviour also impacting positively on processes and efficiency," Mr Barker said.

Last year 1,060,059 infringements were filed by Prosecuting Authorities. On this basis 2120 reams of paper will be saved each year because of e-filing and 40 reams will be saved every week.
