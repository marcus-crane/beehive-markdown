Veterans' Affairs Minister, Ricker Barker today met with and welcomed the new Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association (RNZRSA) President, Air Vice Marshal (Rtd), Robin Klitscher CBE, DFC, AFC.

Delegates to the 91st National Council Meeting earlier this month voted in Mr Robin Klitscher to replace retiring President, Mr John Campbell.

"Himself a Viet Nam Veteran, Mr Klitscher brings a wealth of experience to the role of RNZRSA President and I look forward to working closely with him and the Association to continue to make progress in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio," Mr Barker said.

"I enjoyed an excellent working relationship with his predecessor John Campbell and we have achieved a lot in recent times.

"The memorandum of understanding signed between representatives of veterans of the Viet Nam War and the government, agreement to review the War Pensions Act and the ongoing review of Veterans' Affairs New Zealand are all examples of the RNZRSA and the government working together for the good of all veterans.

"The RNZRSA will continue to be an important voice for our current Veterans and those who are yet to serve. The organisation, under Mr Klitscher, is well positioned to influence future developments while ensuring that we all remember the sacrifices made by ex-servicemen and women and those who gave their lives in defence of their country." Mr Barker said.
