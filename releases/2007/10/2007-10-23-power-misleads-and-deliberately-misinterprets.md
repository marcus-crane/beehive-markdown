Once again the National Party’s Simon Power is misleading the public with his deliberate misinterpretation of details given in the House, said Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor.

“The government is not actively considering re-opening Dunedin Prison. The future of the facility is yet to be determined. However, this government certainly won’t be rushing to oversee the sale of an asset that could still be of practical use to the Department of Corrections,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Labour-led government is committed to addressing the issue of increasing prisoner numbers.

“This is more than can be said for the previous National government who neglected to address the fact that New Zealand’s prisons were within a few inmates of exceeding their capacity.

“As Mr Power knows we have spent close to $1 billion on building four new regional prisons under the Regional Prisons Development Programme. This has seen some 1,600 new beds added to the prison system.

“While these new prisons have been important, the expansion of cell capacity at existing sites has also been critical in meeting increasing prisoner numbers. A total of 773 beds have also been added to existing sites since 2004, meaning more than 2,300 new beds have been added to the prison system.

“This Labour-led government continues to be committed to a society where all families, young and old are safe and secure,” said Mr O’Connor.
