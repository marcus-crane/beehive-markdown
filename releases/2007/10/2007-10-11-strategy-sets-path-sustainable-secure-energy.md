Prime Minister Helen Clark and Energy Minister David Parker today launched the New Zealand Energy Strategy, which sets the country firmly on a path towards clean, renewable energy.

“The New Zealand Energy Strategy puts our country on an ambitious but achievable pathway towards greater sustainability, and a secure energy future,” Helen Clark said.

“It’s important that New Zealand plays its part in tackling climate change. We need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from energy use. This strategy, and its companion document, the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, help us do that.”

David Parker said that the New Zealand Energy Strategy sets out the government’s vision for a sustainable, low emissions energy system, and an action plan to make that vision a reality.

“It sets out how we will deliver secure energy at affordable prices to support economic development, while at the same time being environmentally responsible and reducing carbon emissions from our energy production and use,” David Parker said.

“We’ve already announced a target of generating 90 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025.

“The emissions trading scheme will help us achieve that. In addition, we’ll be considering regulatory options through the Electricity Act to limit new fossil fuel base-load generation over the next ten years.

“We are also preparing a national policy statement on renewable energy to provide guidance to local authorities when they’re considering renewable energy projects.”

David Parker said the NZES also includes the target of halving domestic transport emissions per capita by 2040. The use of renewable energy from biofuels will increase, and New Zealand aims to be a world leader in electrically powered vehicles. As well, major investments in public transport are being made.  
The Energy Strategy was launched alongside the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy. Work on that strategy has been led by Jeanette Fitzsimons, Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation.

Helen Clark and David Parker said that the measures outlined in the two energy strategies would support and complement the recently-announced emissions trading scheme.
