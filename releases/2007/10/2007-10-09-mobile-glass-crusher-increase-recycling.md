A new mobile glass crusher will help increase New Zealand’s ability to recycle glass, Environment Minister David Parker said today.

The crusher, an initiative of the Glass Packaging Forum, will predominantly tour the South Island to provide councils with an opportunity to crush recycled glass.

The crushed glass can be used in new products, such as a roading foundation material which includes up to five per cent recycled glass. This material has already been used in roadways, paths and building foundations at a number of sites.

"The Glass Packaging Forum is to be congratulated for its collaborative work with councils to find further uses for recovered glass. This industry sector is developing recycling operations onshore and building our capability as a nation to cost-effectively and sustainably recover materials and close the loop on waste," David Parker said.

"Government has recently released its preferred policy options for minimising waste and recovering resources. While this includes options for a range of regulatory tools, the government prefers industry-led partnerships such as this one to develop solutions for end-of-life products."

The Glass Packaging Forum was established in response to the surplus of recovered glass many regions face as a result of higher recovery rates. Glass recycling has reached a new high in New Zealand this year, with 53 per cent of glass consumed in New Zealand now being recycled.
