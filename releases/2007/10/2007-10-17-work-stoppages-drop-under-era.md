Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed Statistics New Zealand figures showing the number of work stoppages has dropped between June 2006 and June 2007.

Statistics New Zealand have released [figures](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/work-stoppages/work-stoppages-jun07-qtr-mr.htm) showing there were 35 stoppages ended in the June 2007 year, compared with 60 stoppages for the June 2006 year.

"This report reinforces Department of Labour statistics showing our government's Employment Relations Act compares much better than the Employment Contracts Act across all work stoppage indices," says Ruth Dyson.

Department of Labour figures show:

- the average rate of stoppages has dropped by 21 per cent under the ERA;
- the average rate of person days of work lost has reduced by a third;
- and wage losses have dropped by almost 50 per cent.

"These results have been achieved because the Employment Relations Act is fair and balanced, and good for employers and employees - unlike the National Party's Employment Contracts Act."
