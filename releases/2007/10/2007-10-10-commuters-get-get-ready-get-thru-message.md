Civil Defence Minister, Rick Barker helped hand out Civil Defence Information Packs to commuters at the Wellington Train Station this morning, as part of a Disaster Awareness Week event organised by the Wellington Region Emergency Management Group.

Events to mark Disaster Awareness Week and promote public understanding about what to do in an emergency will be run around the country by regional, district and city councils.

"It’s important to understand that we will all be affected by a disaster, including those we rely on to rescue us. Disaster Awareness Week and events like the one in Wellington today are about getting that message through and making sure people are prepared in the event of a Civil Defence emergency," Mr Barker said.

"Immediately after a disaster emergency services and civil defence emergency management staff will have to respond to the most critical demands. This means we all need to know how, and be prepared to, take care of ourselves for at least three days.

"In conjunction with local events, Disaster Awareness Week also sees the beginning of the next round of our national Get Ready Get Thru advertising campaign. The broadcast campaign is supported by the [www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz/) website, which was recently translated into 8 additional languages, and the What's the Plan Stan schools’ programme.

"Disaster Awareness week is about all New Zealanders ensuring they are ready should disaster strike. I urge everyone to take a few simple steps to get ready. Have a plan for your family or household and a stock of emergency supplies, Mr Barker said.
