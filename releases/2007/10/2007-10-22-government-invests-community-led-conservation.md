The Labour-led government continues to support and invest in community-led conservation groups working to protect a wide range of native species and habitat, Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Acting Environment Minister David Parker announced today.

Kiwi, geckos, blue penguins and coastal seabirds are among species benefiting from the latest round of 78 grants approved under the $2.68 million Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds. Wetlands, coastal habitats and lowland forests also feature in the projects via habitat restoration, pest management and fencing work.

“The role of communities in pest management and biodiversity recovery programmes is continuing to play a vital role in the battle to halt the decline in New Zealand’s native forests and wildlife,” Mr Carter said.

“This work would not be possible without the significant volunteer hours contributed by communities around the country.”

Mr Parker said the Ministers were impressed with the manner in which communities, local councils, the Animal Health Board and the Department of Conservation had joined forces to control pests in a range of projects.

He was pleased 51 of the 55 Condition Fund projects targeted at least one of four of the Government’s recently-announced National Priorities for Protecting Rare and Threatened Biodiversity on Private Land. The grants also meet the goals of the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy.

The grants are supported by a further $3.22 million contributed by landowners, local and regional government and other funding agencies in funds and volunteer hours, bringing total investment in this round to more than $5.9 million.

The grants are a way for the Government to acknowledge and assist landowners, recognising the important contribution they are making to protecting New Zealand’s biodiversity, the Ministers said.
