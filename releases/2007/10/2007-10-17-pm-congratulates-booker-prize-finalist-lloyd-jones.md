Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today congratulated New Zealand author Lloyd Jones on being a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker literary award.

Lloyd Jones’ novel, Mr Pip, was one of only six novels chosen for the short list, whittled down from an original 110 entries. The Gathering by Anne Enright won the top prize.

Helen Clark said Mr Jones’ success in reaching the shortlist was a tribute to his creative talent and writing ability.

“Lloyd Jones has a distinct voice and a unique perspective which are now recognised internationally. He can take great pride in joining the ranks of finalists of one of the literary world’s most celebrated awards,” Helen Clark said.

The prize, founded in 1969, rewards the best novel of the year written by a writer from Britain, Ireland, or a Commonwealth country. The short listing of Mr Pip has already given it international exposure and worldwide sales.

The only New Zealand author to win was Keri Hulme with The Bone People in 1985.

“As New Zealanders, we can all share in celebrating Lloyd Jones’ achievement. He has raised the profile of New Zealand literature offshore, and this can inspire other talented local authors,” Helen Clark said.

Creative New Zealand supported Lloyd Jones to write Mr Pip, which also won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize and the top fiction prize at the Montana Book Awards.

Lloyd Jones is currently working in Germany on a Creative New Zealand Berlin Writers Residency.
