More Vietnam War veterans are going to be entitled to further recognition for their service.

Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton told the Royal New Zealand Returned Services’ Association’s annual meeting in Wellington today that the government has agreed to extend the eligibility for the New Zealand General Service Medal 1992 (Warlike), with clasp “Vietnam” to those veterans who are currently eligible for the Vietnam Medal.

The government’s decision is a key part of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and representatives of Vietnam veterans, the RNZRSA and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association, signed in December last year.

The New Zealand General Service Media 1992 (Warlike) with clasp “Vietnam” will be awarded to New Zealand military personnel, accredited members of approved New Zealand philanthropic organizations, and accredited New Zealand war correspondents, who served in Vietnam between 1 December 1962 and 27 January 1973, and who have already been awarded the Vietnam Medal.

Jim Anderton told the RNZRSA that new regulations for the New Zealand General Service Medal 1992 are being prepared and they will give effect to the decision shortly.

“The Memorandum of Understanding the government signed with the RSA recognised that Vietnam veterans were exposed to a toxic environment. It also reflected public acknowledgement of the service performed by all New Zealand Vietnam veterans.

“So this decision is an important step in addressing Vietnam veterans' grievances as we move towards Tribute 08, to be held on Queens Birthday weekend next year. Tribute 08 will acknowledge the service of the veterans and the sacrifices of their families. “

The Government has also agreed to review certain historic forms of non-operational military service which may merit medallic recognition, but that has not otherwise received it.

“This review was prompted by the RNZRSA’s proposal for a new ‘Medal for Service’,” Jim Anderton told the National Council.
