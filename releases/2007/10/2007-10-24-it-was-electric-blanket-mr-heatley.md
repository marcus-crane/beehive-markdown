National’s housing spokesman Phil Heatley has displayed his prejudices towards Housing New Zealand tenants yet again by implying they are “vandals” for leaving an electric blanket on, Housing Minister Chris Carter says.

Mr Heatley has selectively chosen two examples of damage to allege all kinds of wrongdoing on the part of HNZC tenants.

He also insinuated HNZC tenants are avoiding debts for damage.

“The facts are that the two cases cited by Mr Heatley are the result of fire damage and both tenants are repaying the debt,” Mr Carter said.

“In one of the cases, the fire was accidentally started by a child and in the other, an electric blanket caught fire.

“It’s typical of the National Party to play on people’s prejudices and try and paint Housing New Zealand tenants as ‘vandals’ which is how he described them in Parliament today,” said Mr Carter.

The vast majority of damage done by HNZC tenants comes into the minor category, such as a broken window but this is not something Mr Heatley is interested in acknowledging, the Minister said.

“Of tenants who have caused damage, the average bill is $370 while of the corporation’s 66,942 properties, 9 percent have a damage debt.

“But to listen to Mr Heatley you would think Housing New Zealand tenants spent their time trashing their homes,” said Mr Carter.

“This is a typical attitude in a party that sold off 13,000 state houses when it was last in government and we have to hope for the sake of New Zealand’s needy families that that party never gets into government again.”
