Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor today expressed concern at the apparent campaign by the National Party to spread alarm in the rural community about the driving hours requirements that came into effect on 1 October.

Obviously cutting and pasting from the same draft piece, in recent columns David Carter (Straight Furrow) and Simon Power (Wanganui Chronicle) claimed that farmers were being bound up in red tape and that sowing and harvesting, and cutting and baling hay would be adversely affected by the new rules.

“Unfortunately some of the misinformation that these National Party spokespeople have been promoting has been picked up in the rural media, leading to headlines like “Farm work impossible with driving hour limits” (Ashburton Guardian),” Jim Anderton said.

“It would be good to see some facts getting in the way of these stories. First of all, the new regime is not greatly different from the old one. And the Government is fully aware of the needs of the agricultural sector. It is open to providing a degree of flexibility in recognition that the ability to cultivate land and harvest crops is reliant on the weather.”

Last week, at the instigation of the Minister for Transport Safety, Harry Duynhoven, transport officials held a very productive meeting with Agricultural Sector Associations, including Federated Farmers, Horticulture New Zealand and the Rural and Associated Contractors Federation.

Advice was given on how to access work time variations and logbook exemptions provided for under the Land Transport Act, so that the various sector associations will be able to help their members through the process.

Officials are also reporting back to Harry Duynhoven on measures to clarify that the work time exemption which currently applies to farmers also covers tractors and, possibly, other self-drive agricultural equipment operated by contractors.

Damien O’Connor pointed out that the Work Time and Logbooks Land Transport Rule was developed after stakeholder input, including the production of four separate consultation documents in 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2005. “Of course the Government recognises that one size does not fit all situations,” he said.

“And what is surprising about the National Party campaign is that the changes received unanimous support from the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee, which considered the public submissions on the proposals. The new system will continue the current logbook exemption for farmers.”

“The dangers of driver fatigue are well known and we are trying to protect the safety of the contractor or farmer and the public who drive on the roads,” Damien O’Connor said.

“David Carter may call this ‘PC nonsense’,” Jim Anderton said. “However, ACC statistics show that agriculture (including farming, horticulture, and agriculture contractors) accounted for nearly one third of Workplace fatalities investigated by OSH in the past decade. That is 184 people in the agricultural sector losing their lives. More than three-quarters of those deaths involved vehicles and machinery. In the past year alone, agriculture accounted for 38% of Workplace accidents investigated by OSH. That’s 21 people, and of those, 17 (81 per cent) involved vehicles and machinery.”

Jim Anderton said information was not available on how much of a factor driver fatigue was, but the Department of Labour had funded a research project on whether a statistical relationship could be identified between seasonal work trends and workplace fatalities. This study showed two daily peaks for fatal accidents during the day: one in late morning, just before lunch, and another around 3pm. But the rate drops dramatically in the early afternoon.

“While the reason for these patterns is a matter of further study, it is fair to assume that one reason for the drop in the early afternoon is that people have had a rest and a meal.

“I suggest the National Party should pay more attention to sensible people like West Otago agriculture contractor Athol Lawlor who was reported in the Southland Times as saying that his company already has a policy of building in breaks. “If it’s getting late in the day and performance is a bit ragged and you stop, performance will lift”, and he might have added ‘you will have a better chance of staying alive,’” Jim Anderton said.

Work Time and Logbooks Land Transport Rule

The number of hours that can be worked in a day has reduced from 14 to 13 hours per day, but the maximum number of hours spent driving has increased from 11 to 13 hours (after which a 10-hour continuous rest break must be taken).

The number of hours that can be spent driving and/or working (before a 24-hour continuous rest break must be taken) has also increased − from 66 to 70 hours.

Under the new regime a person is permitted to drive and/or work as much as 78 hours per calendar (7-day) week, provided no more than a total of 70 hours is spent driving and/or working before a continuous 24-hour rest is taken within that week.

A person is now able to drive/work 13 hours per day for 5 days, have a full day (24 hours) off, and then drive/work for another five days at 13 hours per day.
