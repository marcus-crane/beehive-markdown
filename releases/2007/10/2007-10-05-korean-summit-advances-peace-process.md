Foreign Minister Winston Peters today said the just-completed second inter-Korean Summit had made a valuable contribution towards the peace process on the Korean peninsula.

South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Chairman Kim Jong-Il met in Pyongyang from 2-4 October.

“In a historic agreement, the two Koreas have agreed to closely work together to put an end to military hostilities; to mitigate tensions, and to guarantee peace on the Korean peninsula,” Mr Peters said.

“That agreement gives a significant boost to the denuclearisation objectives of the Six Party Talks process. It also builds on the recent momentum of the Talks, and adds to an emerging atmosphere of reconciliation and open dialogue in the region.

“The fact that the leaders of North and South Korea can meet and discuss a range of concerns is significant progress in itself.

“The meeting has also provided an important platform for more detailed discussions on a range of important security and economic issues between the two Koreas.

“The security situation on the Korean Peninsula affects the entire region, including New Zealand. We are closely following the inter-Korean dialogue, in the hope that it will reinforce the beginnings of an environment of confidence and trust between North Korea and the international community,” Mr Peters said.
