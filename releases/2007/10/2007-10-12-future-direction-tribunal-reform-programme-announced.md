Courts Minister, Rick Barker today announced that Cabinet has agreed to the future direction of the tribunal reform programme being undertaken by the Ministry of Justice in conjunction with the Law Commission.

Tribunals play a vital role in the delivery of justice and account for a large amount of the contact the public has with the justice system.

"This Labour-led Government is committed to ensuring that the public has a tribunal system that it can have every confidence in. The Tribunal Reform Programme will ensure that they are fair and credible, accessible, administered efficiently and proportionate to the matters being decided. Tribunals need to be easier to access, quick as possible with credible outcomes and good value for money for the taxpayer," Mr Barker said.

"The Tribunal Reform Programme stems from the Law Commission review of the structure of the court system in 2004. The programme aims to recommend a coherent structure for tribunals and authorities and ensure consistency in the development of future tribunals.

"Recent decades have seen a proliferation of tribunals established to address specific needs in the absence of a clear framework. As a consequence existing tribunals differ widely from each other.

"The differing jurisdictions, types, procedures and powers lead to significant administrative and management challenges and complexities for agencies which administer tribunals.

"It can also lead to confusion for users, potentially discontented members and may reduce the economies of scale that can be gained. These challenges ultimately impact on the quality of services received by consumers.  
"We are on the way to developing structural and administrative options to address these issues. I value the involvement of the Law Commission and believe that their work is essential to the success of the programme", Mr Barker said.
