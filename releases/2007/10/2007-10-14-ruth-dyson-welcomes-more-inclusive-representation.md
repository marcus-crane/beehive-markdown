Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today congratulated Tunumafono Ava Fa’amoe on his election to the Otara Community Board and Lance Girling-Butcher on his election to the New Plymouth District Council.

Both Mr Fa'amoe and Mr Girling-Butcher are visually impaired. Mr Fa'amoe is a founding member of the Pacific Island Advisory Support Services Trust and Mr Girling-Butcher is former editor of the Daily News.

"I congratulate both men and all other successful and unsuccesful disabled candidates who stood in this year's local body elections. By electing disabled people to local government, New Zealanders benefit from a wider range of representatives with diverse life experience and government that more closely our communities.

"Since the Labour-led government took office in 1999, we’ve worked to improve support for disabled people and others by fostering a more inclusive society.

"However, we believe the wealth of experience disabled New Zealanders can offer is a discovery still largely waiting to be made by the governance  
level of many organisations."

The Office for Disability Issues runs a Nominations Service which aims to increase the number of appropriately skilled disabled people on government  
boards and committees. For more information visit:
