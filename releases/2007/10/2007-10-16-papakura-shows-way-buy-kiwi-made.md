Government Spokesperson for the Buy Kiwi Made programme, Sue Bradford, is excited to be attending the launch of New Zealand's first Kiwi Made Market in Papakura Town Centre on Friday, 19 October.

The Kiwi Made Market will, as its name suggests, only be selling New Zealand-made products and will be a showcase for upcoming and successful New Zealand manufacturers and producers. It will be held on the last Friday of every month from 3pm to 7pm.

“This market epitomises many of the values that underpin the Buy Kiwi Made programme,” said Ms Bradford. “It is about local people gathering together as a community, helping to create employment and increase our manufacturing capability.

“The people at this market, both the stall holders and the shoppers, are building brand loyalty for New Zealand-made products, helping to reduce New Zealand's trade deficit by reducing our imports, and even helping our environment by reducing the fuel consumption associated with imported products.

“The people of Papakura are creating a local solution that promotes employment, the economy and the environment.”

Ms Bradford will be available at the market for comment and photo opportunities between 4.00pm and 5.00pm

The Kiwi Made Market has also joined the Buy NZ Made Campaign Ltd, giving it the right to use the kiwi in a triangle logo. “It is an excellent move to link the market with the iconic brand that consumers instantly recognise as being New Zealand made,” said Ms Bradford.
