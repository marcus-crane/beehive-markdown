New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Tonga will be career diplomat Christine Bogle, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand and Tonga have a longstanding relationship, with strong personal links, church associations, and trade ties,” Mr Peters said.

“Tonga is experiencing a generational change after the death of its long-reigning King, and the major challenge of reconstruction following the November 2006 riots.

“New Zealand’s active political engagement with Tonga is underpinned by a significant aid partnership that focuses on education, good governance, health, community development, and the private sector,” Mr Peters said.

Ms Bogle is currently deputy director of Australia Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She has previously served as Ambassador in Madrid, and also been posted to Peru and Rome. She will take up her position in January, replacing Michael McBryde, who returns to Wellington.
