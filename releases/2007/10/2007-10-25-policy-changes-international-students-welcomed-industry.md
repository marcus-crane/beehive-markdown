The Minister of Immigration David Cunliffe says that National’s Pansy Wong is incorrect to suggest that International students “need a juicier carrot”.

“Contrary to what Pansy Wong has said the numbers of fee paying International students have already risen by over three and a half thousand in the past year.”

The Minister said “we agree that the industry is worth supporting and today’s policy announcement on International students will make sure New Zealand can compete in the Global marketplace.”

“This policy has already got the “thumbs up” from the country’s international education providers.”

Mr Cunliffe also made the point, that while it was important to nurture an industry that is worth over $2 billion dollars in foreign exchange that had to be balanced against the need to manage immigration risks.
