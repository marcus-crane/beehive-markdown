A new Child, Youth and Family charter explaining the rights of children and young people in care will provide with them a level of comfort about what to expect when they are in care, said Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services today.

"Foster families are like any other families with children," Ruth Dyson said. "But we must remember that children in our care are among the most vulnerable people in New Zealand.

"The charter is designed to help them understand what they can expect from life with their new families, and help make them feel safe and valued.

"It will also ensure they know who they can contact if they have concerns or need someone to talk to.

"The charter is available in two designs - an interactive version for children (over the age of five) that they can colour in and personalise and a 'teenage' version for young people. It was developed in consultation with a group of young people, who chose the designs and helped with the wording.

"The charter for children and young people in care aligns Child, Youth and Family with other Labour-led government funded social services, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child," said Ms Dyson.

**Note**  
Caregivers play a very important role in the promotion and protection of the rights of children and young people in care. The rights in the charter reflect the rights that all children and young people have, regardless of their family circumstances. It is not intended that upholding these rights will undermine the roles and responsibilities of families or caregivers.
