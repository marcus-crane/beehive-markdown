Today marks 50 years since the passing of the Archives Act 1957, a milestone for New Zealand history and government recordkeeping, said Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand Hon Judith Tizard.

“On 4 October 1957 our first archives legislation established the National Archives, now known as Archives New Zealand,” said Judith Tizard.

"The Act saw the appointment of a Chief Archivist, who was charged with the custody, care and control of all government archives and had sole responsibility for authorising the transfer of records of long-term value to the National Archives."

During Parliamentary debate on the Bill, then Minister of Internal Affairs Hon S.W. Smith stated that "Archives form the Government’s memory of the past, and are essential for historians and for scholars".

This foresight was a far cry from the 1800s when Sir Julius Vogel responded to an MP that suggested a Bill to protect public documents that the government did not intend to introduce a Bill to abolish waste paper baskets.

“The few records that were kept from the 19th and early 20th Centuries were often stored in damp, rat-infested basements. The damage to the Treaty of Waitangi, for example, was the result," said Judith Tizard.

“Attitudes changed last century, with the 1926 establishment of Guy Scholefield, Chief Librarian of the General Assembly Library, to the position of Controller of Dominion Archives.”

Today the terms of reference for managing and keeping records are set by the Public Records Act which came into force on 21 April 2005. This replaced the Archives Act 1957 and provisions in the Local Government Act 1974, and reflects recent changes in technology, legislation, and recordkeeping practices.

“Well kept records enable us to look back into the past to tell the stories of New Zealand and New Zealanders. They enhance and promote our historical and cultural heritage and help us build a stronger national identity both now and in the future,” Judith Tizard said.
