Generating energy from waves or tides around New Zealand comes a step closer today, with the Government offering funding to set up generating devices.

Energy Minister David Parker has called for applications from interested parties for funding from the Marine Energy Deployment Fund, which will be making grants of up to $2 million a year for the next four years.

"This is designed to get wave and tidal energy generating devices in the water, so we can get some practical experience of what works, and what the impact is, in the New Zealand marine environment," David Parker said.

"We’re pushing the development of this technology because marine energy is the next logical step in the development of new sustainable and renewable energy sources.

"We’ve seen how technological developments are making it more practical to harness solar and wind energy. I am confident that we will also find practical ways to harness marine energy."

Overseas experience to date indicates that there is very little impact on marine life, but that is one of the areas that will be closely monitored in the New Zealand trials.

Any projects seeking government support through the fund will have to obtain resource consents, and that process will provide an opportunity to consider any potential impacts on fishing, recreational activities or other community interests.

"There are quite a wide range of options for marine energy generation being developed internationally, and most are offshore and underwater. I’m confident there is room for energy generators to co-exist with other users of our marine environment.

"The Fund offers the potential for New Zealanders to develop new technologies, as well as testing how technology used overseas performs in our conditions," the Minister said.

The Marine Energy Deployment Fund is contestable, which means individuals or organisations will have to apply for funding. Applications will be assessed by an expert panel, with funding offered to projects that best meet a number of criteria. Applicants will be expected to match any grants with commercial investment.

Applications for the first funding round close in February 2008 and grants will be made in May 2008. The first devices are expected to be deployed and operating by 2010.
