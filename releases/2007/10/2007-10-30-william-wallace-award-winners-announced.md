Every year, Child Youth and Family Services honours remarkable young people who have defied the odds and achieved excellence with the William Wallace Awards.

"It's always a pleasure to celebrate the achievements of young New Zealanders, but especially when they are inspiring as these individuals many of whom have overcome huge barriers," says Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services.

"Among this year's winners are young people who have been in care, and with the love and support of their caregivers and social workers, are now pursuing their dreams of further education and travel."

"Some are going on to university, studying everything from science to early childhood. Other winners will be training for a career in hairdressing or sports performance, attending Outward Bound, or in one case, going to Gallipoli as part of Army Cadet training."

The ceremony is being held during Foster Care Awareness week.

"The achievements we are celebrating with these awards are also a reflection of the commitment of their caregivers. While our winners can be justifiably proud of overcoming the challenges in their lives so far, it's obvious that they have been enormously well supported and cared for by their caregivers," says Ruth Dyson.

The awards are given from a total of $20,000 and go towards supporting the young people in fulfilling their potential through leadership, vocational or tertiary training.
