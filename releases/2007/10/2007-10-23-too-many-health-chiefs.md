Tony Ryall and the National Party should hire a fact checker instead of letting every wannabe Opposition Health spokesperson send out another shonky statement on the health sector, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

“The list of their mistakes, misinformation and inaccuracies just keeps growing.” Pete Hodgson said.

In the last month National’s Health botch ups include:

•Not understanding figures relating to First Specialist Appointment – 7,000 more New Zealanders received elective surgery over the last financial year  
•The numbers of Midwives has risen slightly in the past year with 350 more waiting in the wings but National would have you believe there were in fact 600 less  
•Their covert higher GP fees policy will drive more Kiwis to Emergency Departments, which they flail their hands about  
•Their deliberate misquotes on public and private ownership of core public health services  
•Their declarations that patients are not receiving radiotherapy when they are.

"No matter how often their statements are proven to be wrong they still insist leaving them up on their website.” Pete Hodgson said.
