The Social Report 2007 reveals the economic standard of living, employment and education of people in the Manawatu-Wanganui region is improving consistently, says local MP and Acting Social Development Minister Steve Maharey.

“This report proves that central north island communities have more people employed, more school students achieving higher qualifications, and people are getting healthier. This demonstrates the region is doing very well under the Labour-led government’s drive to transform the local economy.”

The Social Report 2007 shows that three quarters of the local working age population is actively working in paid employment, with 74 per cent employed in 2006, up slightly from 73 per cent in 2005.

While more people are working, the unemployment rate has stayed roughly the same for the past three years. The unemployment rate was 4.4 per cent in 2006, up from 4.3 per cent in 2004 and 2005.

The standard of living has improved in the Manawatu-Wanganui region, with fewer than 23 per cent of people living in households that earn less than 60 per cent of the median national income.

The report also shows a rise in the number of students leaving school with qualifications. 59 per cent of local school leavers in 2006 had NCEA Level 2 (up from 55 per cent in 2005), and a third, or 33 per cent of students left school with NCEA Level 3 (up from 29 per cent in 2005).

Other key indicators from the Social Report 2007  
•More than two thirds (69 per cent) participate in physical activity  
•Less people are smoking, with 21 per cent of locals saying they smoke in 2005, compared to 26 per cent in 2004  
•Internet access has risen to 60 per cent of the population in 2006, up from 37 per cent in 2001

“The Social Report paints a picture of our country’s wellbeing and quality of life, and under the Labour-led government the picture for our region is a healthy one.”
