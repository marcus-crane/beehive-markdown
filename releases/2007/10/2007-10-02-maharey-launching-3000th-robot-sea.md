The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, will today demonstrate the launch of the final ‘robotic float’ of the Argo mission, which gathers information on changes to the world’s oceans and climate change.

Steve Maharey will launch the robot from the vessel, RV Kaharoa at Queens Wharf in Wellington harbour.

“This is a great example of world-leading international research by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) that feeds into the global quest to find out more about the drivers of climate change.

“This Argo project sends the robotic floats up to 2 kilometres below the surface to measure the movements of the sea, and this information is then passed on to scientists and climate and weather centres studying changes in the world’s oceans.

“NIWA has launched the greatest number of the robots in the world, and has spent more than a year on this mission. New Zealand has a significant role in this project because of our unique access to the Pacific Ocean.

“Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our generation, and projects like this highlight New Zealand’s key contribution to international research into this issue.

“The Labour-led government is investing nearly $50 million a year for the next five years into scientific research into climate change.

“This research includes $40 million of existing funding, $3 million from Budget 2007 and a contestible $6.7 million fund announced in August to promote sustainability and respond to climate change.

“This strong programme of research supports other government policies to improve sustainability, such as the emissions trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gases and new forestry and environmentally friendly land management initiatives.”
