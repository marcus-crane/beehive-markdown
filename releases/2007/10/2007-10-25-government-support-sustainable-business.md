Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced a $750,000 grant for the Sustainable Business Network, the organisation which encourages sustainable business practice.

The Prime Minister made the announcement at the Sustainable Business Awards in Auckland, where she presented the Sustainable Business of the Year Award.

Helen Clark said that the Labour-led Government is committed to working with New Zealand businesses to help them become more sustainable.

“The extra funding for the Network comes from the government’s new Business Partnerships for Sustainability initiative and runs over three years.

“The Government’s preference is to build on existing sustainable business support programmes. The Sustainable Business Network provides such programmes. It is a member-based forum, where businesses can learn about new ideas and share experiences.

“The Network’s track record in delivering practical advice on sustainability to business is excellent. About 600 businesses have signed up with it already, and its flagship programme, the Get Sustainable Challenge, is thriving.

“The funding I have announced tonight recognises the importance of the Network’s work in helping businesses become more sustainable,” Helen Clark said.
