*Speech notes for address to open the Christchurch Sustainability Forum*

Welcome to today’s government forum on sustainability.

It’s good to see a wide range of people here today – from across business, iwi and community organisations, local government and the academic community.

Your presence reflects the interest we New Zealanders have in sustainability – and the importance you place on getting the right policies in place.

It’s almost a year since I issued the challenge for New Zealand to work towards becoming a truly sustainable nation, and even to dare to become carbon neutral.

In that short time, a lot has changed and a lot has been achieved.

Sustainability is now the big issue challenging politicians, policy makers, business, and communities around the world. It has become the major theme of international meetings from Davos to APEC.

Last year New Zealand had to work hard to get a reference to climate change included in the APEC Leaders’ Summit communiqué. This year, climate change was the key theme for the Summit.

I believe that the sustainability challenge is a defining issue for the twenty-first century.

How nations grapple with that challenge will not only have a significant impact on the world’s environment, but it will also determine their prosperity, security and their citizen’s quality of life.

There will be no prosperity without sustainability, but a commitment to sustainability will help us lock in prosperity.

Sustainability is a term most commonly applied to the need for sound environmental policies, and my comments will focus on getting that balance right today.

But make no mistake – getting that right also has positive implications for our economy, our society, and our country’s identity.

Those are the four pillars of a sustainable nation – and they are mutually reinforcing.

We cannot build a sustainable economy if we plunder the natural environment for short term gain.

Without a strong economy, we can’t make the investments needed for a successful society – in education and skills, health and housing, support for families, and much else besides.

If we get things in balance – environmental, economic, and social, then we can also enjoy the non-material benefits of a confident society with a strong value system. And I do believe in the 21st century we will come to take as much pride in being a sustainable nation as we currently do in being nuclear free.

These are the reasons why our government is putting sustainability at the heart of its thinking and decision making.

We believe that this is very much in line with New Zealanders aspirations and values.

A recent Business Council for Sustainable Development [poll](http://www.nzbcsd.org.nz/story.asp?id=754) found that 89 per cent of New Zealanders would oppose any policy which suggests doing nothing about environmental issues – and 47 per cent were strongly opposed to the “do nothing” option.

A [poll](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30659) for TV One in September reported that 85 per cent of people supported the government taking action on climate change.

New Zealanders are prepared to take action themselves too. Another [survey](http://www.nzbcsd.org.nz/_attachments/Seeking_Environmental_Solutions_Report.pdf) in January found that 27 per cent of people say they have purposely avoided buying from companies because of their impact on society or the environment. That’s the equivalent of more than 1.1 million New Zealanders.

An even greater number of New Zealanders said they would pay a premium for products and services which have a positive social or environmental benefit.

These are trends that cannot be ignored, and they signal an increasing public expectation that business and government have a responsibility to address these issues. Worldwide, publics and consumers are demanding action.

The recognition that New Zealand is acting on these issues is vital to the promotion and protection of our international image.

New Zealand’s reputation as a country with a clean and green environment is priceless. Failure to protect it by inaction on sustainability, or dragging our feet on climate change as the climate change deniers insist, would pose a considerable economic risk to New Zealand, and that would be devastating to our reputation.

Earlier today, I visited Lincoln University and met with Dr Caroline Saunders and members of her team who have been working on the food miles issue.

The idea of measuring the distance food travels from producer to plate as an indicator of sustainability grabbed widespread public attention in the United Kingdom last year. The [criticism of New Zealand was wrong and misleading](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Media/0-Goff-Food-Miles.php), but we should not ignore the strong signal it sends us about the importance of showing that we are sustainable.

I’m pleased to say that many in business have already got the message loud and clear and are working for sustainability in their companies.

And whole sectors of the economy – like [tourism](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/sustainability/), the [wine industry](http://www.nzwine.com/swnz/), and [agriculture](http://www.maf.govt.nz/sff/) - are also developing long-term strategies based on achieving sustainability.

The wine industry organisation, New Zealand Winegrowers, has [set the goal](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0703/S00336.htm) of having one hundred per cent of their industry operating under independently audited sustainability schemes by 2012.

One winery, Grove Mill in Marlborough has reported a one hundred per cent rise in sales to UK supermarket giant Sainsburys after becoming the world’s first [CarboNZero](http://www.carbonzero.co.nz/) certified winery.

The tourism industry contributes close to nine per cent of GDP and just under one in every five export dollars we earn. Sustainability is at the heart of the Tourism Strategy 2015 which I will be launching in about ten days time.

Our stock exchange, NZX and others in business leadership have also identified opportunities arising from emissions trading activity for New Zealand.

The government’s task has been to develop over-arching strategies for sustainability and provide leadership. We have stepped up the pace of our work substantially, with a raft of new initiatives emerging this year.

- The framework for the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme was [announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=49) in September.
- The New Zealand Energy Strategy and the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy were [launched](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=50) this month.
- A [biofuels sales obligation](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28359) is being introduced, beginning next year.
- Investment in public transport has soared; and a commitment has been made to support rail electrification in Auckland as part of the drive to get cars off the roads there.
- Big changes are [being made to the Building Code](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/bcl-building-code-review) to get greater energy efficiency in homes and buildings.
- More than $72 million is being invested in a big retrofit programme for older homes, with a loan scheme being designed to complement it, and there are incentives to install solar water heating.
- The [public service is going carbon neutral](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28362), and has new guidelines for sustainable procurement and for meeting green building standards when it moves into new accommodation.
- Programmes to support households and businesses to become more sustainable are being developed and implemented. Just last evening I [announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F31101) that the Sustainable Business Network would be receiving $750,000 in government funding over the next three years to step up its support for business sustainability.

Introducing an emissions trading scheme is a big step forward, and has not been embarked on lightly.

There has been a lot of consultation with business and other stakeholders on the best mix of options to address climate change going forward.  
In our view, and that of most of those consulted, an emissions trading system is the most flexible, effective, fairest, and least-cost option for reducing New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.

In deciding the details of the proposal, we have been determined to be fair. That is why we opted for a scheme which will apply to all sectors of the economy and includes all greenhouse gases.

We also recognise that different sectors of the economy are at different stages in their ability and readiness to reduce emissions.

The decision to bring sectors into the scheme gradually from 2008 through to 2013 means there is time for ongoing consultation and engagement around the details for each sector.

The decision to adopt an emissions trading scheme puts New Zealand in the company of many other developed nations:

- An emissions trading system is already operating in the European Union;
- both Australia and Japan are working on proposals; and,
- in the United States, the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, and California, are all planning trading systems.

Our scheme is a world first in covering all sectors and all greenhouse gases. I understand that the European Union scheme currently covers only around thirty per cent of their emissions of these gases.

Being proactive on emissions trading and climate change mitigation more broadly is consistent with New Zealand’s overall clean and green reputation and gives us a valuable strategic advantage.

During my recent visit to Britain, Prime Minister Gordon Brown invited New Zealand to participate in talks to develop an international emissions trading market. Our government has accepted his invitation because we want New Zealand to be at the forefront of the development of this important new market. We will be formally signing up to this initiative next week.

The New Zealand Energy Strategy and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy released two weeks ago reinforce the Emissions Trading Scheme.

Our bold target is to generate ninety per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2025, and to be carbon neutral in our electricity by then.

That target is achievable using currently available technology and our own resources. It will deliver New Zealand a more diverse energy base, and one much less reliant on imported or locally sourced fossil fuels, - although locally sourced gas will continue to be important for our energy security.

The Energy Strategy gives a clear direction that for the foreseeable future:

- all new electricity generation should be renewable, except to the extent necessary to maintain security of supply, and
- that investment should occur in energy efficiency measures where that is cheaper than the long-term costs of building extra generation capacity, including the environmental costs.

It’s become clear as we have developed these strategies that achieving a sustainable economic and social future which is also environmentally sustainable, is mutually reinforcing.

By developing a secure energy system based on renewable, low-emission generation and greater energy efficiency and conservation, we can improve the quality of life for New Zealand families, drive the transformation of our economy, and cement in sustainability as a core part of New Zealand’s identity and value system.

The technology needed to achieve our goals, and the economic and environmental imperatives needed to drive investment are now in place.

Equally important, there is a developing social and political consensus, both here and internationally, that developing sustainable solutions is the smart thing to do.

New Zealand is uniquely positioned to become a sustainable nation. This is a huge strategic advantage for us, and one I believe we should grasp with enthusiasm.

Thank you.
