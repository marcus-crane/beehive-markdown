Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard praised Tauranga company Page Macrae Engineering today for its willingness to invest in new technologies and broaden its focus to produce sustainable, climate friendly products.

Trevor Mallard visited the company today to hear first hand about its work and its success locally and offshore through diversification.

"Page Macrae Engineering started out in the marine servicing field and, with the help of highly skilled staff, it has diversified into the design and manufacture of innovative products, which is paying dividends for the company in terms of its growth domestically and internationally.

"As well as supplying products and services across a range of sectors like shipping, forestry and energy, the company is involved in designing and making sustainable products in areas such as wastewater technology and low emission plants for turning wood waste into energy," Trevor Mallard said.

"Page Macrae Engineering shows how kiwi companies can seize on the commercial and economic opportunities that sustainable products and services offer. There is growing international awareness and demand for climate friendly products from consumers and customers around the world, and New Zealand companies need to think hard about what they can do to seize those opportunities," Trevor Mallard said.

The company is also developing expertise in the use of titanium alloy powders - it is involved with a cross-government initiative working on the affordable production of titanium for use in a range of high-tech industries.

"The government has supported Page Macrae Engineering with advice and funding from government agencies going to the company itself and associated companies involved with the titanium project.

"The Industry Capability Network, in which New Zealand Trade and Enterprise connects businesses into large project opportunities in New Zealand and Australia, has recently helped the company secure a contract with Japanese construction company Sumitomo for mechanical installation and pipe work at Mighty River Power’s Kawerau Geothermal Plant.

"Helping companies build such connections and to focus on innovative processes and products is where government agencies can really add value for New Zealand businesses. Page Macrae Engineering staff numbers are growing and about 40 per cent of its products are exported.

It’s great to see companies like Page Macrae reacting quickly and with purpose in terms of opportunities here and overseas, as improved business and export performance is critical to the future prosperity of all New Zealanders," Trevor Mallard said.
