Minister of Defence Phil Goff announced today that Cabinet has approved the start of contract negotiations with Agusta-Westland, the preferred tenderer for the supply of training-light utility helicopters to the New Zealand Defence Force.

“The negotiations for five Agusta-Westland A109LUHs and a flight simulator will commence shortly and I expect a contract to be signed in the first quarter of next year,” Phil Goff said.

“The helicopters should enter service with the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2010.

“The purchase represents a new generation capability for the New Zealand Defence Force and in technology and capability is a quantum leap forward from the old Sioux training helicopter.

“In common with the Seasprite helicopter already in service and the eight new NH-90s on order for the RNZAF, the A109 is wheeled and capable of deployment from our navy vessels.

“The helicopter has the advanced technology necessary for training pilots going on to the Seasprite and NH-90 which the Sioux simply does not have.

“It flies faster and further, carries more people and can do a wide range of tasks, including with the Navy.

“As well as training, the A109 has light utility capabilities including air transport, search and rescue, aero-medical evacuation, disaster response and surveillance and counter terrorism support.

“It can work alongside the NH-90 or carry out tasks for which its size makes it more suited and at less expense than using the NH-90.

“It will also provide operational support for other government agencies, including Police, Customs, Department of Conservation, and Ministry of Fisheries.

“The Royal New Zealand Air Force is delighted with the decision. It represents another milestone in modernising the New Zealand Defence Force and providing it with capabilities needed for the Twenty First Century,’ Phil Goff said.
