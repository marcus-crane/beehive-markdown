Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Irish President Mary McAleese will visit New Zealand next week.

“New Zealand has a very warm relationship with Ireland. It is estimated that around eighteen per cent of the New Zealand population claim some Irish ancestry, and the Irish community around our country will be very involved in the visit,” Helen Clark said.

“This visit provides the opportunity to strengthen our longstanding ties with Ireland and explore new areas of co-operation.

“Ireland is a likeminded country, and we have many common international interests which I look forward to discussing with the President.

“Both countries are keenly focused on issues of climate change and improving sustainability, particularly around the area of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Discussions between us have already been held at United Nations climate change meetings, and there is potential for more collaboration in climate change-related research and technology.

“New Zealand and Ireland also share the common goal of a world free of nuclear weapons, and are working together on non-proliferation initiatives. Our military co-operation has also strengthened in recent years. Like the New Zealand Defence Force, Irish forces can be found in many theatres around the world, upholding United Nations principles.

“A key area to explore during the visit will be co-operation on film and media. During the visit a film co-production agreement with Ireland will be signed.

“We will also be able to share with Ireland the experience in both our countries of support for indigenous languages. Ireland has a strong record of supporting the retention of the Gaelic language. It has recently launched a twenty-year strategy to become a fully bilingual country. The President will visit Maori Television during her time in New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

During her visit the President will attend a lunch for the Ireland Fund/Antarctic Heritage Trust to raise funds for the preservation of historic huts in Antarctica, an initiative the New Zealand government strongly supports.

The President will also travel to Dunedin, where she will be awarded an honorary degree by Otago University. The University has recently established a Chair in Irish studies.

The President will receive a formal state welcome at Government House, and hold formal talks with the Prime Minister.
