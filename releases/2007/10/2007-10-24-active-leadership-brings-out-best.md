Jim Anderton, Minister responsible for the Public Trust, last night paid tribute to the work of the outgoing Chair of the Trust, Peter Taylor.

“I want to thank Peter personally for steering Public Trust through the major changes it has had to make in the past six years. Every year since it was transformed from being ‘the Public Trust Office’ to being Public Trust, it has delivered an improvement in performance.”

Peter Taylor was appointed Chair when Public Trust became a crown entity. At a dinner held in his honour, Jim Anderton acknowledged that it hadn’t been the easiest of projects to take on.

“I could say Peter faced a number of ‘challenges’. But the difference leaders make is that they unlock the potential of an organisation and its people. And we are paying tribute especially to the difference Peter has influenced others to make.”

Public Trust now makes over 20-thousand wills a year. “That’s about one in five of New Zealanders’ wills,” Jim Anderton said.

“It looks after around five thousand estates each year, more than any other organisation. And it manages around four thousand family trusts and four hundred charitable trusts with a value of around $360 million.”

Jim Anderton said that Public Trust is fortunate to enjoy a depth of talent in its staff ranks and that, coupled with Peter Taylor’s active leadership, was the reason for its current success.

“Someone has to pull together the organisation’s vision and purpose, and the talent and knowledge it holds.

“On behalf of everyone here and all New Zealanders who are the shareholders in Public Trust, I thank Peter again for a job very well done,” Jim Anderton concluded.
