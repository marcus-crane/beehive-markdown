Minister of Justice, Mark Burton, and Green Party Justice spokesperson, Nandor Tanczos, today announced a proposal to significantly increase the role of the Office of the Ombudsmen in relation to prisons.

The proposal would see an Ombudsman with primary responsibility for the independent oversight of prison complaints and systemic issues.

"The Ombudsmen are Officers of Parliament, with the highest level of independence within New Zealand’s system of government," Mark Burton said.

"The designation of clear responsibility for prison-related matters will better ensure that there is an identified independent and impartial entity with responsibility for overseeing and investigating prison complaints and systemic issues."

The proposal will include the following:

- Enhancing the current role of the Ombudsmen and [Office of the Ombudsmen](http://www.ombudsmen.govt.nz/) in relation to the oversight of prisons by giving the Ombudsmen new responsibilities for:
  
  - conducting investigations of all deaths in custody and designated serious incidents;
  - undertaking more reviews of systemic issues identified during visits of prisons as a result of incidents or complaints.
- Designating an Ombudsman to have primary responsibility for prison investigations and inspections (this Ombudsman will continue to have appropriate responsibilities in the general jurisdiction of the Ombudsmen)
- Amending the Corrections Act 2004 to reflect the enhanced role of the Ombudsmen, including amendments to remove the current statutory role of the inspectors of corrections;
- Encouraging more public reporting of investigations (for example into systemic issues that may give rise to serious incidents) and regarding prison conditions and prisoner treatment more generally.

Currently, the investigation of deaths in custody and serious incidents are carried out by the inspectors of corrections. Under the proposal, the responsibility for these investigations would shift to the Office of the Ombudsmen, with a team of prison investigation staff reporting to an Ombudsman.

"The Government is committed to having a well-functioning and independent prison complaints and monitoring process, as it increases the ability for systemic issues to be identified and resolved in a more proactive manner," Mark Burton said.

"The proposal have resulted from work in consultation with the Green Party to ensure effective independent oversight of our prisons. I’d like to commend the Green Party, and in particular their Justice spokesperson Nandor Tanczos, for their input into these proposals.

"The Ombudsmen play an important role in providing an independent avenue for complaints and a transparent process for examining systematic issues in this area."

The Ombudsmen also have responsibilities under the Crimes of Torture Amendment Act 2006 as a National Preventive Mechanism for a number of institutions, including prisons.

"This role will be enhanced with the Office of the Ombudsmen assuming primary responsibility for the oversight and investigation of serious prison complaints and incidents."
