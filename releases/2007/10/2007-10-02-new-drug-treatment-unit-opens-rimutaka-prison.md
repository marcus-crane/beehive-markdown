Drug Treatment Units in prisons are the best chance some prisoners will have to turn their lives around, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The Minister was speaking at the official opening of Rimutaka Prison's Drug Treatment Unit this afternoon – the second of three new Drug Treatment Units established as part of the Labour-led government’s Effective Intervention Strategy.

"It will come as no surprise that many prisoners have substance abuse issues – in fact 60 percent of offenders are actually under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of their offending. It's now up to these prisoners to make use of the opportunities this government is presenting them with and join these programmes," said Mr O'Connor.

"Providing such intensive specialised units such as this one gives motivated prisoners the tools to treat their addictions meaning they will be able to leave prison and lead a drug and offence free lifestyle.

"The new unit at Rimutaka Prison will allow male prisoners from the Wellington region to have access to a proven and successful treatment programme while also allowing them to remain close to family, whanau and other support networks.

"This is New Zealand’s first Drug Treatment Unit to provide treatment to prisoners with a high-medium security classification, allowing a greater range of prisoners to have access to this successful programme," he said.

The addiction treatment programme at the unit will be run by Care NZ, which already provides similar programmes in the Drug Treatment Units at Arohata, Waikeria, Christchurch Men’s and Hawke’s Bay Prisons.

The 24-week programme will include one-to-one and group cognitive-behavioural therapy, education on addiction and change, along with education about building new skills – especially social skills.

Mr O’Connor said two evaluations undertaken by Corrections have shown that drug treatment units are proving successful in reducing the re-offending.

"The first evaluation shows that reconviction rates for those who have been through a Drug Treatment Unit are 13 percentage points lower over a 24-month period than those ‘untreated’ offenders. This is both value for money, and a valuable tool to make our communities safer.

"The second evaluation, which was carried out by the Corrections’ Psychological Service, focused on which kinds of participants benefit most from the drug treatment units. The findings suggest that people aged 30 and above and those whose offending was directly related to substance abuse, were most likely to benefit from the units. Maori and non-Maori participants were equally likely to benefit," said Mr O'Connor.

The Drug Treatment Unit at Rimutaka Prison is the fifth such unit in the prison system and will provide an additional 100 places each year for prisoners to address their drug addiction. With a further Drug Treatment Unit due to open at the new Spring Hill Corrections Facility in July 2008, facilities will soon be in place to provide treatment to approximately 500 prisoners per year.
