Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove has welcomed the passing of the Arbitration Amendment Bill by Parliament last night, saying its reforms will enhance arbitration as a means of private dispute resolution in New Zealand.

"The legislation will improve the workability of the Arbitration Act 1996, and strengthen parties control over the arbitral process. Having a more efficient arbitral process can also reduce the demand for judicial involvement in resolving civil disputes,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Arbitration Amendment Act implements the Law Commission’s 2003 report Improving the Arbitration Act 1996, which recommended a small number of technical changes.

Mr Cosgrove said the changes improve consumers' protection in their transactions with traders.

"In the past consumers signing consumer arbitration agreements when purchasing items could be locked into arbitration should a dispute arise. The Arbitration Amendment Act enables the consumer and trader to decide, after a dispute has arisen, whether arbitration is the most appropriate form of dispute resolution."

The Arbitration Amendment Act also clarifies the law around confidentiality of arbitral proceedings.

Mr Cosgrove said the timing of the legislation provided an opportune time to bring the Arbitration Act up-to-date with international best practice.

"The Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and on which the Arbitration Act is based, has recently been changed. These changes have been incorporated into the Arbitration Amendment Act, thereby ensuring New Zealand remains current with international best practice."

"Alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration is an increasingly popular choice for New Zealanders in resolving disputes, as it can be faster, and less formal than the courts process, and it also enables ongoing business relationships to be maintained," Mr Cosgrove said. "The improvements in the Arbitration Amendment Act will therefore be of great benefit to New Zealanders."

**Background Information**

The Arbitration Amendment Act 2007 will:  
•Improve the operation of the Arbitration Act 1996  
•Clarify the confidentiality rules relating to arbitral and subsequent court proceedings  
•Clarify how the Arbitration Act 1996 applies to consumer arbitration agreements  
•Introduce changes to keep the Arbitration Act 1996 in line with international best practice.

**What is Arbitration?**  
Arbitration is a consensual method of dispute resolution. It involves the settlement of a dispute by an independent person (the arbitrator), chosen by the parties and operating through an agreed process, to examine their respective claims and make a binding decision. This can be contrasted to litigation where a Judge determines a dispute through formal court proceedings.  
Although many arbitrators are lawyers, some arbitrators are not. Instead they have technical skills and qualifications in areas such as engineering, building or business management. Many arbitrators have also undertaken training in principles and practices of dispute resolution. Generally, a dispute that can be the subject of a civil proceeding can be referred to arbitration. Criminal proceedings cannot.

**Why was the Arbitration Act 1996 reviewed?**  
In 2003 the Law Commission reviewed the Arbitration Act 1996 to determine what, if any, problems had arisen during the first few years of the Act’s operation. The Law Commission concluded that it generally worked well but that addressing certain problems would significantly improve the operation of the Act. The Arbitration Amendment Act reflects the recommendations proposed by the Law Commission.

**Do the amendments apply to me?**  
Most arbitration is private commercial or contractual disputes – for example, between a builder and a house owner, or a farmer and a share-milker. However the Act also applies more broadly to consumers.  
The Arbitration Amendment Act enhances consumer rights. Currently when a consumer enters into a contract with a trader they may also sign an arbitration agreement, often without realising they have agreed to go to arbitration, should a dispute arise.  
The Arbitration Amendment Act enables the consumer and trader to decide, after a dispute has arisen, whether arbitration is the most appropriate form of dispute resolution. If both the consumer and trader agree on this course of action then arbitration of a consumer dispute may proceed.  
For example, when a consumer signs up to a power supplier, the contract will normally set out a dispute resolution process, which may include arbitration. Under the existing provisions, the consumer must sign a separate written agreement at the time of entering the contract for the arbitration clause to be enforceable. This separate agreement can often be overlooked by a consumer as it is thought to be a part of the contract. Under the Arbitration Amendment Act, however, the decision to enter arbitration is made after the dispute has arisen, not at the time the contract is signed.  
When deciding the most appropriate forum, parties will still have the option of considering whether to refer the dispute to the Disputes Tribunal. However, once the decision has been made to proceed to arbitration, parties no longer have the option of later referring the dispute to the Disputes Tribunal.

**How does the Arbitration Amendment Act amend the confidentiality provisions of the Arbitration Act 1996?**  
Confidentiality is an important component of arbitration. Under the 1996 Act arbitral proceedings were closed and confidential, except where the parties otherwise agreed, or the Act allowed. These exceptions were very narrow and did not permit disclosure of information to interested parties (i.e. a professional or other adviser of one of the parties), disclosures required by law or required by a competent regulatory body but not contemplated by the 1996 Act, (i.e. to the New Zealand Stock Exchange), and disclosures for other legitimate reasons (i.e. filing and prosecution of any application to a District Court or the High Court). The confidentially provisions did not extend to proceedings outside the arbitration process, in particular, subsequent court proceedings.  
The Arbitration Amendment Act provides greater clarification. It confirms that, as a general rule, arbitral proceedings are private and confidential, while court proceedings are generally conducted in public. The Arbitration Amendment Act also clarifies the exceptions to this general rule. A party may apply to the court for an order for the whole or part of the proceedings to be conducted in private. The Arbitration Amendment Act sets out the matters a court must consider when considering such an application.

**Why didn’t the Arbitration Amendment Act seek to make court proceedings, after arbitration, confidential?**  
The amendments to the confidentiality provisions balance the principles of party autonomy and open justice. First, parties are free to choose whether they will enable either party to appeal to the courts. Second, the Arbitrators and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand has developed an Arbitration Appeals Tribunal (known as the AMINZ Court of Arbitration), which provides a confidential alternative to the courts. Third, the role of the courts is to develop and clarify the law not only for the immediate parties involved but also for the wider public. Fourth, open justice is a cornerstone principle of the New Zealand court system.

**How does the Arbitration Amendment Act reflect international best practice?**  
The Arbitration Act 1996 is based on a Model Law developed by a United Nations Committee. The Committee regularly reviews the Model Law to ensure that it is still current and effective. The Model Law has recently been updated to reflect changes in international best practice. These changes were included in the Arbitration Amendment Act. New Zealand is one of the first countries to adopt the changes.
