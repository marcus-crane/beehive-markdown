Conservation Minister Chris Carter has expressed New Zealand’s grave concern over the resumption of live dolphin exports from the Solomon Islands when previous attempts have resulted in a high degree of mortality both during captivity and in transit.

“I think most New Zealanders would be appalled at the export of live dolphins, a trade that requires the animals to be rounded up, kept in pens and then loaded into aircraft,” Mr Carter said.

“For such a highly intelligent species, this would be incredibly stressful.”

About 28 dolphins were loaded onto two DC10 aircraft at Honiara around 4pm New Zealand time today. The planes are understood to be scheduled to leave at later tonight, bound for a coastal hotel resort development in Dubai.

An attempt by Solomon Islands conservationists to get a court injunction to stop the aircraft leaving appears to have failed.

The Minister has reminded the Solomon Islands government of its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITIES, which says any country exporting wild animals must be able to show it will not be detrimental to the survival of the species.

“The strength of any international agreement, as with other international law, lies in all members meeting their obligations.”

It is understood the animals exported today are a species of bottlenose dolphin and, as such, are listed under Appendix II of CITIES.

The Minister has conveyed his concerns in a letter to Solomon Islands Forests, Environment and Conservation Minister Mark Kemakeza. The letter was delivered in person by staff from the New Zealand High Commission in Honiara.

“Marine mammals around the world face enough serious threats, including fishing, the effects of climate change and marine pollution, without adding the live animal trade to the list,” Mr Carter said.
