Foresters and farmers will be able to hear more details about the recently announced Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and have their say at regional meetings which start on Wednesday 10 October, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“The role of forestry and farming in the ETS is highly significant, with the forestry industry being the first sector to enter the scheme from 1 January 2008,” Jim Anderton said. “Tree planting is a critical part of the response to climate change and will help New Zealand meet its international obligations for greenhouse gas emissions.

“Action on agriculture is also a critical part of New Zealand’s response. The agriculture sector will come into the ETS by 2013, and in the meantime it is expected to take significant steps to prepare for its inclusion.

“Like the workshops in the main centres, the regional meetings are designed to give land managers the chance to talk directly to officials working on the industry’s inclusion in the ETS and the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Plan of Action,” Jim Anderton said. “Feedback from these meetings will be considered before the government makes final decisions on details of the ETS.”

The seven meetings, which follow workshops in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, are part of a series of engagements and hui the government is holding around the country. These are to ensure the broadest possible understanding of the scheme and other climate change initiatives.

The meetings will also help the sector prepare for participation in the select committee process for the ETS legislation to be introduced later this year.
