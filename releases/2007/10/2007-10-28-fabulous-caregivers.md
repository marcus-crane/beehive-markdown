Foster Care Awareness week (29 October – 4 November) is a chance to acknowledge and celebrate the incredible job that our [caregivers](http://www.cyf.govt.nz/2232.htm) do, looking after some of the country’s most vulnerable children and young people, says Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson.

The theme of this year’s [Foster Care Awareness week](http://www.cyf.govt.nz/4699.htm) is 'Look after yourself'.

"Being a caregiver is a demanding role and calls for qualities like resilience, being non-judgmental, flexible, loving and offering a safe and stable home environment," says Ruth Dyson.

"Despite all the challenges and demands of caregiving, they are an enthusiastic and committed group of people.

"This is a group of people who may consider ‘looking after themselves’ to be indulgent given the needs of everyone around them.

"I want to encourage all caregivers to join caregiver support organisations such as the [New Zealand Foster and Family Care Federation](http://www.nzfostercare.org.nz/) and [Grandparents Raising Grandchildren](http://www.raisinggrandchildren.org.nz/). They provide great support and resources for caregivers, and Child, Youth and Family will pay the first year’s membership to join a local foster care association or support group.

"Free formal training is also available to them through Child, Youth and Family and the New Zealand Family and Foster Care Federation. Everyone can benefit from extra skills and knowledge and training is an opportunity to share stories and experiences, and to develop your support network.

"Child, Youth and Family make every effort to keep children with family, but sometimes that isn’t possible. We are very lucky to have caregivers who give unconditional love to some of the country’s most vulnerable children, bonding with them and knowing that one day the majority will be returning to their families."
