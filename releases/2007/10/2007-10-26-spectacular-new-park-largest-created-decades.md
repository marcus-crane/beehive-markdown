Snow-capped mountains, crystal clear lakes and a popular skifield are included within the boundary of the largest public park created in more than twenty years, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

The new Hakatere Conservation Park is more than 68,000ha in the beautiful Ashburton Lakes area. It not only brings together 19 separate areas of conservation land but just-concluded negotiations mean historic Hakatere Station, on the shores of Lake Clearwater, will now be added.

“This huge new park is a special place, a landscape of clear streams and red tussock, of braided rivers, wetlands and alpine habitat where a host of rare native species can be found,” Mr Carter said.

“The park’s creation demonstrates not only the commitment of the Labour-led government to securing some of New Zealand’s most precious landscapes for all New Zealanders to enjoy but also the hard work by Land Information New Zealand and the Department of Conservation over some years.”

The Green Party chose Ashburton Lakes and the upper Rangitata River as one of three sites to receive funding for restoration of wetlands.

Mr Carter said: “Hakatere Conservation Park offers a truly New Zealand experience with almost endless recreational opportunities including water skiing, sailing, trout fishing and tramping. It is also significant that so much lakeshore will now be preserved for the public for all time.”

Mt Hutt skifield is within the park’s boundary and the upper reaches of the Ashburton Lakes basin are a gateway for big game hunters, ski tour operators and mountain climbers.

“I particularly want to congratulate the owners of Hakatere Station for their foresight in recognising the conservation values of their land and choosing to sell it into public ownership,” Mr Carter said.

The public will have access to pastoral lease areas of Hakatere Station when settlement takes place in November 2007 but the freehold will remain in private ownership until July 2008. The Nature Heritage Fund paid $7.2 million to buy Hakatere Station.

**Background to Hakatere Conservation Park**  
Hakatere Conservation Park is more than 68,000ha hectares including:

- 10,000 hectares of the former Clent Hills pastoral lease that was purchased by the Nature Heritage Fund,
- the historic Hakatere Station also purchased by the Nature Heritage Fund,
- two areas transferred to the department through the Land Tenure Review process,
- several areas surrendered from pastoral leases and declared to be conservation areas and various other parcels that were allocated to the department in 1987.
  
  **Landscape**  
  The general area of the park is bounded by the Rangitata and Rakaia rivers. The upper Rangitata featured in the Lord of the Rings films.
  
  The Canterbury Conservation Management Strategy says:
  
  > *‘The overall character is one of space, remoteness and grandeur in an alpine setting of snow and ice, glacier and lakes, interspersed with remnants of upland forest, tussock grassland and several major wetlands.’*
  
  The Heron basin, Ashburton lakes, upper Rangitata and Hakatere Basin are all recognised as outstanding landscapes.
  
  **Natural values**  
  Wetlands in the park contain some of the best examples of red tussock (*Chionochloa rubra*) and *Carex secta*/pükio wetlands in Canterbury.
  
  The park’s kettlehole (water-filled holes created by receding glaciers) wetlands are very likely the best under protection in the country. Threatened turf-forming plants include pygmy clubrush (*Isolepis basilaris*) and dwarf woodrush (*Luzula celata*), both classified as in serious decline, and water brome (*Amphibromus fluitans*), a semi-aquatic grass presumed extinct in the South Island until last year.
  
  The riverbed of the Rangitata River is home to wrybill/ngutu parore, black-fronted tern/tarapirohe, banded dotterel/turiwhatu, Caspian tern/tarä nui, and black-billed gull. The wetlands and lakes are a stronghold for the threatened Australasian crested grebe/kämana, and scaup/papango. Other notable fauna includes the Mount Somers giant wētā *Deinacrida*, a spectacular and distinct wētā and the Mt Potts scree skink.
  
  The park includes over 4000 hectares of mountain beech forest and native birds include bellbird/makomako, tomtit/miromiro, rifleman/tïtitipounamu, wood pigeon/kererū and grey warbler/riroriro, while kea and pipits/pīhoihoi frequent the open country above the bushline.
  
  **Recreation**  
  The new park offers boating, swimming, tramping, climbing, skiing, hunting, mountain biking, picnicking, camping, horse riding, and fishing.
  
  The new Woolshed Creek Hut is on the popular Mt Somers Walkway. Mt Harper is also a popular climb. Skiing is centred on Mt Hutt Skifield within the park boundary while the Arrowsmith range is popular for ski-touring.
  
  Impressive volcanic formations, tussock grasslands, and a deep river canyon are features of the original 17km-long tramp linking the popular picnic stops of Woolshed Creek and Sharplin Falls in South Canterbury.
  
  Mt Somers is the ideal place for an introduction to New Zealand’s sub-alpine environment without venturing too far from civilisation. It’s perfect for beginners and families. The new route across the south face of Mt Somers offers a ‘round-the-mountain’ trip for more experienced trampers, thanks to the hard work of the Mt Somers Walkway Society.
  
  **Cultural and historic values**  
  The park was part of the seasonal trail of mahinga kai and resource gathering. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as taonga. Mahinga kai resources taken from the area include: tuna/eels, weka, käkä, kererū, tūi, pūkeko, aruhe / fern root, kiore, kōkopu, tikumu and ti köuka/ cabbage tree.
  
  A Statutory Acknowledgement and Deed of Recognition has been placed over the area through the Ngāi Tahu Settlement Act 1998, to formally acknowledge the association and values that Ō Tū Wharekai (Ashburton Lakes) holds for Ngāi Tahu.  
  The Māori names for Mt Hutt - Opuku and Te Tai Ta - reflect its character. Te Tai Ta means feathery cloak, its appearance when bathed in cloud. Opuku means “cover over”.
  
  Since European occupation more than 125 years ago, the Mount Somers region has been the site of a variety of enterprises. One of these was coal extraction and evidence of historic coal mines remains. Historic features in the area include the Mt Harper Ice Rink (1931-32), possibly the first purpose-built public skating rink in the Southern Hemisphere.
