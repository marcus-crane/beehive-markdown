Foreign Minister Winston Peters will travel to Europe next week for high-level talks in the Netherlands, Sweden and France. He is also scheduled to deliver speeches to three foreign policy institutes.

In The Hague, Mr Peters will meet his Dutch counterpart Maxime Verhagen, and also call on the Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the President of the International Criminal Court.

“New Zealand’s relationship with the Netherlands is warm, with our close cooperation in multilateral forums being a particular strength,” Mr Peters said.

“Considerable Dutch migration to New Zealand since the Second World War has created a special bond between the two counties, as have more recent exchanges in the areas of research, education and culture.

“New Zealand is also a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. We have great respect for its work in eliminating safe havens for the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.”

In Stockholm, Mr Peters will meet Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, International Development Cooperation Minister Gunilla Carlsson, and members of the Parliamentary Committee for Foreign Affairs.

“New Zealand and Sweden enjoy a friendly, cooperative relationship. Sweden is a respected, likeminded partner on the international stage, and our discussions will examine how the two countries can enhance cooperation on issues such as climate change, disarmament and development.”

In Paris, the Minister will meet the Vice President of the National Assembly, and the Senate’s France-New Zealand Friendship Group. He will speak at a tourism event in New Zealand’s inflated rugby ball pavilion by the Eiffel Tower, and attend the Rugby World Cup final as a guest of the French government.

“New Zealand’s relationship with France is strong and vibrant, with good high-level relations, flourishing cultural links. The Rugby Ball pavilion we currently have in Paris is also providing a wonderful opportunity to showcase New Zealand’s creativity, technological innovation,” Mr Peters said.
