Climate change Minister David Parker says under a Labour-led government, New Zealand will continue to honour its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.

Responding to a New Zealand Institute report which recommends trying to delay meeting our Kyoto commitment, David Parker says New Zealand is part of a group of developed nations leading the response to climate change, and its reputation is at stake.

"This New Zealand Institute report talks about the need to protect our brand image. New Zealand will have no brand image left to protect if we renege on the Kyoto Protocol.

"It is simply not credible to expect that New Zealand could renegotiate our commitment, even if the government thought it was wise to try to do so (which we don't)."

Speaking from international talks on climate change in Indonesia, the Minister said the present UN agenda was focused on doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, not less.

"It would be very strange for New Zealand to back away at the same time as Australia and the world generally is firming in resolve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

David Parker said the government has recently released an Infometrics report which examined the impact on the economy of meeting New Zealand’s Kyoto obligation with an emissions trading scheme.

The report found that the economic impact would be minor (between 0 and 0.3 percent of GDP).

"In other words, doing the right thing for the environment, maintaining our clean green image and adjusting to the emerging low-carbon economy is both feasible and affordable."
