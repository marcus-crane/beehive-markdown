Nanaia Mahuta says her new roles as Local Government Minister and Associate Tourism minister is an opportunity to build on the significant achievements of the Labour-led government.

“I welcome the new responsibilities, especially in the local government field. We have already done a considerable amount of work in local government and this is an opportunity to continue that work,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“There are some significant issues that are currently on the agenda, and I look forward to working through them.

“The role of Local government is important and affects the daily life of many New Zealanders. The Labour-led Government recognises the importance of central Local Government leadership and I certainly want to continue along that track.”

The Tainui MP, who adds Local Government to her Youth and Customs portfolios, has also been given the green light to take on the Associate Tourism portfolio, in addition to her current role as Associate Minister for Environment.

“I am excited to be appointed associate tourism minister and about contributing to the tourism portfolio alongside Minister Damien O’Connor,” said Nanaia Mahuta. “The Tourism industry is a vital window to our great country and we need to ensure we continue to make gains and deliver for the industry and our local economies.

“I want to acknowledge the contribution of former Ministers Mark Burton and Hon Dover Samuels and look forward to the work ahead,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
