The Ministry of Education is encouraging people in the Rolleston and Lincoln areas south of Christchurch to have their input into plans for new schools for the region, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

“The population in this area is likely to grow significantly in the coming years, creating increasing demand for more early childhood, primary and secondary schools.

“In Rolleston, there is already roll growth pressure at the local primary school, with seven new classrooms added in 2006/07 to cater for demand.

“This consultation offers people in Rolleston and Lincoln the chance to say what kind of schools and services they want for their children, and the Ministry will then draw up proposals.”

A wide range of education opportunities will be considered, including early childhood education, primary and secondary options and transitions, technology provision, Maori immersion, Pasifika education provision and special education.

A Ministry facilitator will manage and co-ordinate the consultation, which will include meetings, questionnaires and the opportunity to offer ideas and feedback on the internet.

It will take place later this year, and details of meeting times and venues will be advertised in local newspapers.

“This is an invaluable opportunity for these local communities south of Christchurch to tell us how they think the education needs of their children can be met, and how we should develop 21st century learning in the region.”
