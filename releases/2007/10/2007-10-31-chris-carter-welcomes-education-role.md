Chris Carter says his new role as Education Minister is an opportunity to build on the significant achievements of the past two Labour-led governments in education and he is very much looking forward to the job.

“Education is a vital and exciting sector and a key focus of this government,” Mr Carter said.

“With personal experience as a deputy principal and teacher, I recognise that education continues to be the best vehicle for personal achievement and economic and social opportunity.

“It is through education we can ensure our young people are able to take full advantage of opportunities and have the skills and knowledge they need for the 21st Century.”

Mr Carter said his personal approach was a collaborative one and he would work with all key players in the education sector to ensure parents had confidence in the system, teachers were supported and resourced, and the community continued to play a vital and valued role in the day to day running of schools.

“I am delighted I can now play a personal role in ensuring New Zealand’s education system continues to be world-class and provides the best pathway to achievement for all New Zealanders,” he said.
