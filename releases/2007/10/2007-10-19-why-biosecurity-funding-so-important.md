"Arrival and departure numbers released today by [Statistics New Zealand](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/external-migration/external-migration-sep07-mr.htm) are a good reminder of why spending on biosecurity is so important," Jim Anderton, Minister for Biosecurity, said.

New Zealanders are travelling out of the country more often and there has been an increase in the numbers of visitors coming here, with the result that arrivals and departures in the year ended September 2007 have topped the nine million mark for the first time.

Jim Anderton said that this amount of movement in and out of the country heightens the risk of new biosecurity threats.

"The opportunities for incursions are growing."

"The Labour-Progressive government is committed to New Zealand's biosecurity because it is crucial to our economy. That is why in the Budget this year biosecurity funding was increased. Over the next five years the Government will spend around $840 million on biosecurity.

"We recognise the challenges faced by MAF Biosecurity New Zealand, which is responsible for coordinating what we do to protect our biosecurity − at the border and before the border is reached − by surveillance, incursion responses, eradication programmes, and the transition to pest management.

"An effective biosecurity regime is particularly important in the face of climate change, which could increase the chances of exotic pests establishing themselves in a warmer climate," Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealand’s natural environment is vitally important to our biologically-based economy, as well as to tourism, so protecting the environment from exotic pests is critical. The Labour-Progressive Government has doubled the size of border capacity since 1999 and we remain committed to protecting New Zealand."
