Labour market outcomes for Mâori have been positive over the past year with the number of Mâori in the workforce hitting an all-time high, while the rate of unemployed Mâori is at a record low, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.  
The unemployment rate for Mâori fell to 7.6 per cent in the year to June 2007, the lowest since records began in 1986. The Mâori labour force participation rate reached nearly 68 per cent, the highest ever recorded in the Household Labour Force Survey.  
“This means the gap between Mâori and non-Mâori unemployment and participation rates has continued to narrow over the past year, which is great news. Improved employment outcomes for Mâori are crucial to ensuring increased opportunities and choices for our whânau and have been a key driver of the Labour-led government.”  
A Labour Department report released today shows growth in Mâori employment accounted for half the total growth in employment in the past year – of the 32,500 extra people employed than at the same time last year, 16,400 were Mâori. This is despite the fact Mâori make up only around 10 per cent of the total working age population.  
“Mâori employment growth has been spread across most occupation groups. However, relative to overall employment growth it has been strongest in the two middle-skilled occupation groups, skilled occupations and semi-skilled occupations,” Mr Horomia said.  
These include trades, service workers and machinery operators. Mâori employment growth has also been strong in the highly skilled occupation category, such as managers and professionals, though not quite as much as overall employment growth in that category.

“Mâori employment growth since 2002 has been helped by strong economic growth while Mâori have also benefited from growth in their working age population as well as having a relatively young age profile.”  
The Mâori wage growth of 4.2 percent over the past five years has not kept up with the 5.1 per cent overall average growth. This is partly attributed to Mâori having a relatively high number of new entrants in the workforce compared with non-Mâori, which means Mâori workers will be less experienced and so often lower paid.  
“The construction industry and skilled trades such as plumbing, building and bricklaying featured the strongest percentage employment growth over the past five years for Mâori (84.4 percent). This growth is also mirrored in industry training with 18 per cent of all industry trainees being Mâori.  
“While outcomes have in general been positive, challenges remain with unemployment rates and participation rates being less favourable than for non-Mâori.”  
A range of initiatives targeted at improving Mâori labour market outcomes aim to see such disparities reduced further in the future. These include engaging with Iwi to develop capability, better tailoring qualifications and training arrangements to meet Mâori needs, and focusing on skill levels and education more generally, Mr Horomia said.

I te noho tōrunga rawa atu ngā huanga kaupapa mahi Māori i te tau ki muri, i te mea kei ngā taumata teitei a ngāi Māori i roto i te rōpū mahi, me te auau o ngāi Māori kore mahi kei te iti rawa atu, e kī ana te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia.

Kua heke te auau kore mahi mō te Māori ki te 7.6 ōrau i te tau atu ki Pipiri 2007, koia nei te hekenga tino iti rawa mai i ngā tuhinga i te tau 1986. I piki atu te auau whaiwāhitanga ki te rōpū mahi Māori, kia tata atu ki te 68 ōrau, te taumata teitei rawa atu kua tuhia ki roto i te Rangahau Rōpū Mahi Whare Noho.

“ Ko te whakamāramatanga o tēnei, kua iti haere te wehenga, o te kore mahi me te auau whaiwāhitanga, i waenga i a ngāi Māori me tauiwi i te tau ki muri, he kōrero tino pai tēnei. He mea whakahirahira ngā huanga mahi pai ake mō te Māori hei whakapūmau i te maha ake o ngā huarahi wātea me ngā kōwhiritangamō ā tātou whānau, ā, koia nei hoki ngā take whakahaere nui tonu a tēnei Kāwanatanga ārahi- reipa.”

Kei te whakaatu e tētahi pūrongo i tukuna e te Tari Mahi i te rangi nei, ko te tiputanga o ngā kaupapa mahi Māori, kei te hāwhe o te tiputanga katoa mō ngā kaupapa mahi i te tau ki muri – o te 32,500 pikinga o ngā tāngata i whiwhi mahi, e 16,400 he Māori. I puta pēnei ahakoa e 10 ōrau noaiho a ngāi Māori o te taupori pakeketanga e mahi ana.

“ Kei runga i ngā momo rōopū mahi katoa te tipuranga o ngā āhuatanga kaupapa mahi. Heoi, i runga i te tiputanga whānui o ngā kaupapa mahi, i kaha ake i roto i ngā rōpū momo mahi pukenga waenga nui, e rua, ngā mahinga pukenga me ngā mahinga āhua whai pukenga, “ i kī a Horomia.

E tāpiri ana ki ēnei mahinga ko ngā mahi ā ringaringa, me ngā kaimahi ratonga, whakahaere mīhini. Kua kaha anō te tipuranga mahi Māori, i roto i ngā momo mahi pukenga kaha, pērā I ngā kaiwhakahaere, me ngā ahorangi, ahakoa kahore i rite ki te tiputanga whānui.

“ Ko te tiputanga kaha o ngā kaupapa ōhanga, koia nei i te āwhina I te tiputanga kaupapa mahi mai I te tau 2002, me ngā painga kua tau ki te Māori mai I te tiputanga o tā rātou taupori pakeketanga mahi, me a rātou kotaha āhua taiohi.”

Kahore I eke atu te tiputanga utu Māori, 4.2ōrau mō ngā tau e rima ki muri, ki tā te tiputanga tau toharite, e 5.1 ōrau.whānui. Me te take I penei ai, ko te maha ake o ngā Māori he kaimahi hou e uru atu ana ki te rōpū mahi, kahore e örite ana ki tauiwi, nā reira he iti iho ngā mātauranga, he iti iho anō ngā utu mō rātou.

“ Ko te tiputanga tino kaha rawa atu mō ngāi Māori mō ngā tau e rima ki muri, (84.4 ōrau) I roto I te ahumahi hanga whare, me ngā mahi ā-ringaringa whai pukenga, pērā i te mahi parama, hanga whare, me te tiri perēki. E whakaata ana tēnei tiputanga i roto i ngā kaupapa whakangungu ahumahi i te mea e 18 ōrau o ngā tauira whakangungu he Māori.

“Ahakoa te tōrunga o ngā huanga nei, kei te mau tono ngā wero o ngā auau kore mahi me ngā auau whaiwāhitanga kahore e rite te pai ki tā tauiwi.”

Kua oti ētahi momo kōkiri e hāngai ana ki te whakapai ake i ngā huanga hokohoko mahi Māori, kia kitea e whaiti ana ēnei wehenga i ngā wā kei mua. E tāpiri ki ēnei ko te honohono atu ki ngā iwi ki te hanga raukaha, te whakatika tohu pai ake, me ngā whakarite whakangungu, kia tutuki ai ngā hiahia a te Māori, me te arotahi atu ki ngā taumata pukenga, me ngā akoranga whānui ake, e kī ana a Horomia.
