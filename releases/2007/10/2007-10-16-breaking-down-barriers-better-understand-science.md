Constructive communication between science, business and society is essential to keep New Zealanders better informed of future developments in science that affect our daily lives, says Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey was speaking today in Wellington at the Royal Society of New Zealand Symposium, ‘Working Across Boundaries – Science Industry in Society’.

Mr Maharey says New Zealand will continue to face scientific and technical issues that the public needs to understand, such as climate change, or stem cell technology.

“In order to cope with these challenges, we need to make sure there is continued dialogue and understanding between scientists and the wider community of what they’re doing about them and why.

“Otago University has recently established New Zealand’s first centre for Science Communication. It aims to boost public understanding of the basic science behind such issues as global warming or developing alternative energy.

“The Labour-led government has also launched a number of initiatives to widen discussion and understanding between science and the rest of society.

“The Biotechnology Learning Hub, for example, links research and the biotechnology industry with school students. It teaches students how biotechnology impacts upon their daily lives, making science more interesting and relevant for them.

“We’ve also worked to improve dialogue between researchers and business. The Capitalising on Research and Development Action Group (CRAG) is a joint business and government group which aims to lift private sector investment in research.

“Scientists have a key role in talking to people about their research and listening to what the public have to say. Early and wide-ranging conversations are essential to building a consensus about the role of science and technology in our everyday lives.”
