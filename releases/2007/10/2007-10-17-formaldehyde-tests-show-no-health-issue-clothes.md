Test results released today show little cause for concern about levels of formaldehyde in clothing and textiles on sale in New Zealand.

“In response to concerns raised by television programme Target, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs tested 99 items of clothing and manchester,” says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

“97 of 99 items had no detectable or very low levels of formaldehyde.”

“Two items had above the acceptable level of 100 parts per million, but simple washing reduced formaldehyde to well below acceptable levels.”

Twenty parts per million is accepted internationally as the zero mark under which formaldehyde in fabric is not detectable.

Ms Tizard says the Ministry used the correct method of testing and its results were robust and credible.

“Target used the wrong testing method, which is why their results were so dramatically different.”

“In line with international best practice for testing clothing, the Ministry tested for free formaldehyde only. Target tested for combined free and bound formaldehyde. They then compared this with international standards for free formaldehyde.”

“It was like testing apples and oranges against a standard for apples only.”

The government is to issue a product safety policy statement setting acceptable levels of formaldehyde in clothing, a move that will provide greater certainty for New Zealand consumers.

“We are consulting on the appropriate levels, but expect they will be similar to those used as benchmarks in the Ministry’s testing, which were based on levels used by overseas regulators.”

Submissions on the proposed policy statement are due by 26 November.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs have been working closely with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, who are today also announcing a consistent approach to acceptable levels of formaldehyde in clothing.
