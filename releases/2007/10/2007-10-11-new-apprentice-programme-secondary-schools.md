A new Youth Apprentices pilot programme is being officially launched today, which will offer trades training and work experience so students can earn credits towards an apprenticeship while still at school.

Education Minister Steve Maharey launched the pilot with students from Aotea College at the Aquaheat engineering company in Tawa in Wellington.

Steve Maharey says the pilot will give secondary school students industry-based training, tertiary education and work experience in their chosen trade while still at school. This gives students a head start on an apprenticeship they can continue once they leave school.

“This programme is part of the Labour-led government’s strong commitment to restoring apprenticeships. It provides specialised trades training in the classroom and at tertiary providers, all of which can count towards trade qualifications.

“The young people taking part in this pilot will already be on the path to an apprenticeship and skilled employment by the time they leave school. They also have the option to choose more academic tertiary training in the area.

“The Youth Apprentices pilot builds on existing policies like the Gateway Programme, which offers secondary students hands-on work experience outside the classroom.

“This is a key priority in the Labour-led government’s commitment to realise youth potential and provide more highly skilled workers to transform the New Zealand economy.”

The pilot will run in 10 schools in the 2008 school year:

•Whangarei Boys’ High School  
•Howick College  
•Otahuhu College  
•Hamilton’s Fraser High School  
•Hauraki Plains College  
•Te Puke High School  
•Aotea College (Porirua)  
•Queen Charlotte College (Picton)  
•Ashburton High School  
•Queens High School (Dunedin).
