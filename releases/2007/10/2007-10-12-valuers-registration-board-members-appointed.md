Land Information Minister David Parker today announced the appointment of two new members to the Valuers Registration Board.

**Kenneth Ross Taylor** of Alexandra and **Phillip Allen Curnow** of Hamilton will join the Board for three years.

"The Valuers Registration Board performs a wide-ranging number of responsibilities that all aim to ensure New Zealanders receive competent and ethical service from the 1,300 registered valuers it oversees," the Minister said. "I am sure the Board will benefit from the skills and experience Ken Taylor and Phillip Curnow bring to this important body."

The Board operates under the Valuers Act 1948. Its role is to register valuers to conduct valuations of land and buildings. It also monitors the content of valuation degree courses and approves qualifications.

The Board maintains a register of qualified valuers and has certain disciplinary powers over their conduct.

Phillip Curnow is appointed on the nomination of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers. Ken Taylor is appointed on the recommendation of the Minister for Land Information.

The incumbent members of the Board are Hekiara James Puketapu of Auckland and Michael Evan Leigh Gamby of Auckland.

The fifth member of the Board is the Valuer-General, Mr Neill Sullivan of Wellington. Mr Sullivan is the ex-officio chair of the Board.
