New Zealand is to make a $1 million contribution towards an international emergency appeal aimed at providing basic humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

The announcement was made following a meeting between Helen Clark and Karen Koning AbuZayd, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

“Since the beginning of 2006, political, economic and social conditions have sharply deteriorated for Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories. Ordinary Palestinians have been the main victims of this crisis.

“New Zealand’s assistance will support UNRWA to provide food aid, job creation, health services, and address the impact of conflict and non-conflict related violence on the most vulnerable Palestine refugees,” Helen Clark said.

UNRWA launched an appeal this year for $339 million in emergency funding, the biggest appeal launch since 2000.

New Zealand’s $1 million humanitarian assistance contribution to UNRWA will come from the government’s aid and development agency, NZAID.

NZAID will also contribute $500,000 to UNICEF's programme in the occupied Palestinian Territories.
