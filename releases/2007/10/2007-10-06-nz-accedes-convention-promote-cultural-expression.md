New Zealand today acceded to a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) convention aimed to promote the diversity of cultural expression.

Prime Minister Helen Clark deposited New Zealand’s instrument of accession to the [Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions Convention](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31038&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html) at a meeting with UNESCO Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura in Paris today.

“This Convention complements and supports New Zealand’s existing policies around the freedom of cultural expression. It will provide valuable opportunities for regional and global leadership in this important area.

“Its intention is to create an environment where diversity of cultural expression can flourish. It also recognises the need for states to take appropriate measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions,” Helen Clark said.

“The Convention was adopted by UNESCO two years ago, and it came into force on 18 March this year.

“Approximately 67 countries have acceded to the convention so far, including most European states, Canada, China, India and several African, Asian and South American nations including Brazil, Chile, South Africa, and Mexico.

“Convention members are encouraged to develop voluntary provisions for national action and international co-operation,” Helen Clark said.
