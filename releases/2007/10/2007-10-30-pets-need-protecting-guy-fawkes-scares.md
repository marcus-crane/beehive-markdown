Pet owners need to consider how to protect their pets from fireworks and other activities around Guy Fawkes, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton, who has responsibility for animal welfare, said that many pets were terrified of fireworks, and could harm themselves trying to get away from them.

He said the SPCA had previously published advice for pet owners, and he encouraged people to follow it.

“People should:  
•close all doors and windows, and lock all cat doors, to stop outdoor access and escape routes;  
•close all curtains to block the sights of exploding fireworks - this also helps to muffle noise;  
•turn the radio, stereo or television on to a reasonable volume to block noise and distract the animal;  
•if your pet hides, let it be as it feels safe in its chosen spot; and  
•make sure that your pet's name and your phone number (preferably mobile) are attached in some form to its collar so that in the event of escape, you can be reunited.”

Jim Anderton said that if pets were particularly stressed by fireworks, owners should see their veterinarian to obtain recommended tranquilisers so they were on hand to administer.

He said that if anyone saw any act of deliberate cruelty towards an animal, particularly using fireworks, people should contact the police or local SPCA immediately.
