The National Party’s attempts to attack growing public service wages have resulted in an own goal as official figures show growth in core government salaries has actually fallen behind private sector wage growth in the past year, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

“Under the Labour-led government New Zealanders are earning more right across the economy,” Michael Cullen said. “I thank the National Party for their assistance in highlighting this success.”

Bill English has attacked an increase in Wellington incomes as evidence that central government is spending more on salaries. What he has failed to mention is that private sector wages are now rising at a faster rate.

According to the Labour Cost Index, salaries in the private sector and the public service have increased at almost the same rate since 2002. In the past year, private sector wages have in fact grown faster than in the public service.

“The government has been clear with state sector CEOs that we expect careful management of wage growth. That is still the case.

“It is also clear that this government’s investments in public services are delivering real dividends to New Zealanders. Not only are we paying nurses, doctors, and teachers more, our public servants are delivering more surgical procedures, higher achievement in our schools, and lower crime rates.

“On top of improved services, investments have led to dramatic falls in the cost of seeing the doctor – as yesterday’s Consumer Price Index showed clearly – an expansion of free early childhood education, and assistance with retirement savings and the cost of raising a family.

“New Zealanders are earning more and they are getting more from their government. As Bill English himself pointed out in the Sunday Star-Times this week, New Zealanders are much more economically secure than they were seven or eight years ago and radical change is not required.”
