Ruth Dyson says she welcomes the opportunity of assuming the full Social Development and Employment portfolio following the Prime Minister's [announcement of a new Cabinet lineup](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F31156).

"Our Labour-led government’s policies have produced record low unemployment rates and I’m committed to maintaining this focus on enabling as many New Zealanders as possible to gain employment."

"As Disability Issues and Senior Citizens Minister I will take a particular interest in the area of employment opportunities for those on sickness and invalids benefits, and continuing to build on Pathways to Inclusion."

"I am also looking forward to my role as Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector and to working with newly appointed Associate Minister Darren Hughes, as well as the three other Associate Ministers - Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, Parekura Horomia and Mahara Okeroa."
