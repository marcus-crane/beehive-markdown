Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed his deep disappointment that world soccer body FIFA had decided to cancel Saturday’s World Cup qualifying match between Fiji and New Zealand.

FIFA made the decision following a complaint by Fiji soccer authorities, after New Zealand immigration officials declined to issue a visa to a team member.

The player was denied a visa under sanctions currently in place as a result of last December’s coup, which bans all travel to New Zealand by members of the Fiji military and their families. The player’s father in law is in the military.

“FIFA’s decision to cancel the match is very disappointing, and is a complete u-turn by them. Football New Zealand was assured just a couple of days ago that the game would be played as scheduled,” Mr Peters said.

“No one has the right to a visa. Entry to another country is a privilege, and all countries retain the right to exclude individuals in accordance with their immigration policy. Sporting bodies do not determine those policies.

“New Zealand has processed this matter in accordance with existing immigration policy. It is Fiji which has chosen to make this matter political.

“I offered to explain New Zealand’s policy on Fiji directly to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. However my office was told that Blatter was unavailable.

“New Zealand initiated sanctions against Fiji in the wake of last December’s coup. They include a ban on sporting contact with teams representing Fiji.

“The government, however, recognises NZ Soccer’s obligations as host of a FIFA fixture, and Ministers agreed that an exemption should be made.

“One player was caught by the sanction that bans travel to New Zealand by Fiji military and members of their family. This sanction ban overrides the exemption granted to the team and renders him ineligible for a visa.

“The ban applies to entry to New Zealand for any purpose, including transit. Any suggestion that it was targeted at a particular individual is misleading.

“Fiji remains entitled to send its national team to engage in the World Cup qualifier. The composition of the team is its decision. Our only concern is that the team does not include anyone ineligible to enter New Zealand.

“The government is looking at what assistance it can offer New Zealand Football, which will be adversely affected by FIFA’s unjust decision,” Mr Peters said.
