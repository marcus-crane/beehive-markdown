Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed a new proposal to enhance the role of the Office of the Ombudsmen in relation to the oversight of prison complaints and systemic issues.

The changes, announced by Justice Minister Mark Burton and Green Party Justice spokesperson Nandor Tanczos, will see the Ombudsmen assuming primary responsibility for such issues within the prison system.

The proposals include giving the Office of the Ombudsmen new responsibilities for conducting investigations of all deaths in custody and designated serious incidents, and undertaking more reviews of systemic issues identified during prison visits as a result of incidents or complaints. An Ombudsman will also be designated to have primary responsibility for prison investigations and inspections.

“These new proposals further complement the work we are already doing inside prisons to eliminate any inappropriate or illegal behaviour,” said Mr O’Connor.

A central investigation unit has been created at Department of Corrections’ Head Office and new Crime Prevention Information Capability (CPIC) teams have been employed to rid prisons of crime-related activities.

CPIC is based on best-practice models of intelligence seen in justice sector agencies such as Police and Customs, as well as overseas corrections jurisdictions including Australia, Canada and United Kingdom.

There are five CPIC regional teams and three teams established for the four newest prisons. The teams are comprised of analysts, managers and support officers and drug dog handlers.

“There will always be complaints and systemic issues that need to be examined. These proposals will better ensure an independent, impartial entity is now able to provide oversight in the challenging prison environment,” said Mr O’Connor.
