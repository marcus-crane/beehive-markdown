Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Wellington is to host a new round the world yacht race which starts in 2009.

Helen Clark made the announcement in Paris during her visit this week to Europe. The [SolOceans yacht race](http://www.soloceans.com/en/news/21/The-SolOceans-stopover-will-be-Wellington-the-capital-of-New-Zealand.html) is the first solo round the world yacht race to use identical yachts and will be held every two years. Competitors will sail in sixteen metre, single hull yachts.

“New Zealand is a leading sailing nation with a proud history of achievement in other round the world yacht races, and the America’s Cup. It is therefore fitting that our capital city will host this new round the world race.

“The first leg starts from the Bassie-Normandy region on the west coast of France in October 2009. The course takes competitors via the Cape of Good Hope to Wellington. The second leg starts from Wellington in January 2010 and takes competitors back to France via Cape Horn.

“Hosting this race is a great opportunity for Wellington to build on its reputation as one of New Zealand’s premier venues for major events. Wellington has already hosted other major yacht races, such as the Volvo Ocean Race and the Global Challenge Yacht Race.

“The city is planning a number of events on its waterfront to coincide with the race including a waterfront festival, concerts, and a civic ceremony. Welcomes for each sailor as they arrive into port are also planned. I am sure Wellington will be a welcome respite for competitors after sailing solo halfway around the world.

“This race also has a strong environmental ethos. The competitors will be helping to monitor the effects of global warming in remote parts of the course where there is currently little scientific data. This information will feed back into the development of a system for forecasting ocean currents and climate change,” Helen Clark said.
