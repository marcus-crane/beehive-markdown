The KLRC World Junior Badminton Championships 2007 kicked off in Auckland today with the draw of teams for the tournament.

Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard was on hand to help draw the teams, and said that he was pleased to be able to welcome the championships to New Zealand for the first time.

"Hosting this event in New Zealand gives local athletes the opportunity to compete in their own country, and attracts competitors, coaches and visitors from at least 28 countries.

"The championships should provide exciting and spectacular competition in both the team and individual events. I encourage New Zealanders to come and watch the young talent from around the world - possibly future stars - who will be showcased during the eleven days of the tournament."

Badminton is one of the five most popular sports played around the world. Around 12,000 Kiwis play the game regularly and many more have had a go at some stage in their lives.

"Our badminton players are good role models for young people and send the message that being involved in sport is both good for you as well as fun.

"The Labour-led government is committed to investing in our elite athletes as well as funding projects aimed at lifting the physical activity levels of all New Zealanders.

"Our $67 million Mission-On campaign aims to give young New Zealanders and their families the tools they need to make healthy decisions about keeping active and eating well.

"I have no doubt that those attending these championships will experience the very best of what has to offer - and hope our visitors get the opportunity to spend some time away from the courts and have a good look around the Auckland region," Trevor Mallard said.

The KLRC World Junior Badminton Championships 2007 will take place between 25 October and 4 November, with teams from 28 countries taking part.
