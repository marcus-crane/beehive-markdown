The Charities Commission is making good progress registering charitable organisations, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“Unfortunately a media statement sent out today by the National Party contains basic errors which undermine the good work of the Commission and of charities.

“The Commission’s job is to promote public trust, transparency and confidence in our charitable sector. I am confident that the Commission is thorough when assessing applications, to ensure only genuine charities are registered,” said Laban.

Registration with the Commission is voluntary – groups are not forced to apply. Registration opened on 1 February 2007, and charitable organisations who wish to retain their tax-exempt status need to apply by 1 July 2008.

“The Commission has registered 1,338 charities as of today and have a further 3,000 applications at varying stages of analysis.

“Charitable organisations can rest assured that the Charities Act allows the Commission to back-date charitable status. Therefore charities can maintain their existing tax-exempt status as long as a properly completed application is received by 1 July 2008 and they are found to be charitable,” said Laban.

“Many non-profit organisations in New Zealand may choose not to apply for registration as they may not be charitable.

“The Commission has been bending over backwards to encourage groups to register early, including running over 120 workshops to explain and assist with the process.

“Although charitable organisations still have over 8 months to apply for registration, I encourage charitable groups to apply now and avoid the rush.

“It is a shame that the National Party are trying to detract from the positive work of the Charities Commission and of New Zealand’s many charities by spreading mis-information in order to score political points,” said Laban.
