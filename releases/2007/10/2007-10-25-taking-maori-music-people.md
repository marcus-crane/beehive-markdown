Maori music will take centre stage in Wellington next week with PAO PAO PAO The World of Maori Music – Te Ara Puoro showcasing some of Maoridom’s international musical performers.

Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Hon Mahara Okeroa is lending his support and encouraging people to see PAO PAO PAO a one off show at the Wellington Town Hall on Friday evening 2 November 2007.

Nine acts have been confirmed for the show and include Moana & the Tribe, Whirimako Black, Te Aratoi – Riki and Rewi, Toni Huata, Pacific Curls, Ngatai Huata, Zero t, 4 Corners and the dance crew Torotoro.

“Maori musicians like Moana & the Tribe are acclaimed around the world, but we seldom see them play at home so it’s a rare chance to see these groups perform here in Wellington”, said Mahara Okeroa.

Moana & the Tribe toured Russia earlier this year, 4 Corners played in Thailand and Pacific Curls have just come back from touring Australia. For profiles on all the artists performing at PAO PAO PAOgo to www.maoriart.org.nz

“Maori music has always been a strong element of Maori cultural Identity. As Maori we can take pride in our unique heritage, language and expressions of creativity. Its part of a much stronger sense of national identity that has emerged over the past few years,” said Mahara Okeroa.  
PAO PAO PAO was founded by the late Dr. Hirini Melbourne at Waikato University in 2002 who believed Maori music and Maori instruments should be celebrated in its widest possible scope. It has become a major part of New Zealand music calendar ever since.  
Since 2005, PAO PAO PAO has been hosted in Wellington – the city of the arts.

“It’s tremendous that the Wellington City Council and Government agencies are supporting this event and I hope it becomes a permanent fixture for the Wellington arts calendar, said Mahara Okeroa.

PAO PAO PAO is a whanau friendly event with limited seats available. You don’t want to miss out on this rare experience.
