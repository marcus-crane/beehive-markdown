The overwhelming majority of dairy farmers in Canterbury should be praised for their adherence to resource consent conditions, not condemned, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He said that figures provided by Environment Canterbury actually showed that almost 90 per cent of all resource consent conditions were fully complied with, and another 8 per cent had only minor non-compliance.

“So that’s more than 97 per cent of conditions complied with or very close to it, which is a good news story. Only one farmer out of the 623 in Canterbury had a major non-compliance issue.”

Jim Anderton said it was reasonable that society should expect near 100% compliance with resource consent conditions.

“I would urge all farmers with outstanding compliance issues to get a move on and address them.

“I have been told of farmers spending more than $40,000 to ensure they are compliant, and I commend them on their efforts. Water quality is an important issue, and farmers need to make sure they are not letting their industry down. But we also need to give credit where credit is due.

“Water is a precious and valuable commodity in Canterbury. All of us need to take care of our water resources, and farmers should especially do so, as they need access to water to maintain their livelihood.

“We in the primary sector need to demonstrate that we care for our water resources. The small, and shrinking, minority who continue to fall behind society’s expectations need to realise that times have changed. It is no longer acceptable to the rest of the industry to shirk environmental responsibilities.”
