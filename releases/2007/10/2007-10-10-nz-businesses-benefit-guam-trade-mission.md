Twenty-one New Zealand companies have opened up doors for new business opportunities in Guam after a successful trade mission, says Associate Economic Development and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban who led the delegation.

“The focus of the trade mission was for our companies to explore new opportunities in the construction, building materials, machinery supplies and consultancy sectors in the Pacific,” said Laban.

“New Zealand made a positive impression and the delegation received detailed briefings of new commercial opportunities expected to be created when around 25,000 United States military staff and dependents move from Okinawa to Guam.

“The expansion of naval and air force facilities on the island over the next decade is expected to have a budget of between US $14 and $18 billion. This presents some significant opportunities for New Zealand firms in the future.

“The New Zealand delegation was also able to learn first hand of the potential opportunities from ongoing infrastructure development in Micronesia and the American Pacific.

“One firm signed a deal for new business during the mission, while several more are now actively pursuing specific opportunities created by the visit.

“I am delighted that after a meeting with the US Assistant Deputy Secretary of the Interior David Cohen, and the Governors of Guam, Micronesia and American Samoa, all have expressed strong interest in coming to the New Zealand Pacific Business Council Pacific Trade Expo to be held in Auckland next year. They will bring business delegations with them to explore business opportunities with New Zealand.

“I am pleased that this trade mission has resulted in two-way trade opportunities with New Zealand for Guam and Micronesia,” said Laban.

The delegation attended the US Department of Interior’s annual Island Business Opportunities Conference, where leaders of Island nations with formal ties with the US presented upcoming business opportunities in the region.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban spoke to the Conference and stressed the importance of the Pacific region working together to enhance economic sustainability and two-way trade deals that bring mutual benefits to all parties.

“The Pacific region has close cultural and familial ties. New Zealand is seen as part of the wider Pacific family and region,” said Laban.

“This successful trade mission was a part of the ongoing private and public sector initiatives occurring through the Labour-led government’s Export Year 2007.

"The Labour-led government is committed to supporting our exporters to grow and be successful through initiatives like supporting this trade mission. This support is important if we are to transform New Zealand into a high-wage, innovative and export-led economy,” said Laban.

The trade mission was organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the New Zealand Pacific Business Council.
