Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton has rejected claims by the Business Roundtable, Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute that the Government is moving too quickly in its response to climate change.

"Climate change has been a widely known problem for over a decade and every time the Government has developed a response, the usual suspects get wheeled out of the business community to cry wolf.

"Business organisations spent the last two years bemoaning the lack of certainty in climate change policy. Now that certainty has been provided, they want to kick it for touch. We can only assume that this is another stalling tactic to duck responsibility for polluting activities.

"These so-called business 'leaders' have clearly failed to grasp the strategic importance of New Zealand taking action on climate change. As a biologically-based economy we have more to lose from a changing climate than any other developed country on earth.

"There are enormous opportunities for New Zealand exporters from being sustainable, and very real risks from not being so. We need business leaders with a vision for an economy that can prosper in a carbon-constrained future.

"The Government has proposed a very reasonable and pragmatic phasing in of different sectors of the economy into the [Emissions Trading Scheme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=49) over the next five years. This ensures that households don't get hit with all the costs in one go, and allows industry time to prepare.

"The Government is taking decisive action and we make no apologies for this. Climate change is a serious and urgent problem and the sooner we begin future-proofing our economy the better it will be in the long term.

"No one said that developing climate change policy was easy. We are talking about a major reorienting of the way the economy is fuelled, and this will take effort to change behaviour by all New Zealanders.

"It's disappointing that while ordinary New Zealanders are expressing enthusiasm for doing their bit to help, the people who profit the most from polluting are trying to duck and delay doing anything.

"As business commentator Rod Oram wrote this week, 'Business lobby groups are blowing their last vestige of credibility in their flat-earth rejection of the government's energy and climate change policies.' I couldn't agree more," Jim Anderton said.
