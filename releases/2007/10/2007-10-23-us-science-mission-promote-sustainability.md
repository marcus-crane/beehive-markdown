A mission of New Zealand scientists, business people and officials depart for the United States today to hold talks on sustainability and review formal agreements with US science institutions, says Minister of Research, Science and Technology Steve Maharey.

The NZ-US Science and Technology Cooperation (STC) Agreement will be reviewed for the first time in 16 years. Around 40 per cent of New Zealand researchers collaborate with US scientists – more than with any other country.

Steve Maharey says the United States is our most important bilateral research partner, and renewing the STC agreement aims to build on and expand that work.

“This nine-day mission will include visits to world leading US science institutions, like Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and government departments. It will be a great opportunity to profile New Zealand’s vision to become carbon neutral and the science behind our drive to become truly sustainable.

“New Zealand has a strong existing relationship with US researchers, so this trip will hopefully expand that relationship. This year marks 50 years of working together in Antarctica – the climate change-related ANDRILL project is a good example of our work together.”

This project has drilled 1000 metres into the sea floor below the McMurdo Ice Shelf to investigate how the ice shelf has advanced and retreated over the past 10 million years. This gives us a valuable insight into the effects of climate change in the past and future.

Steve Maharey says NZ-US scientists have also worked together on the depletion of the ozone layer, which also improves our understanding of climate change.

New Zealand researchers from Industrial Research Limited (IRL) have also worked with the Albert Enstein College of Medicine in New York to develop new targeted drugs for conditions including cancer – this project got a commercial deal for what they produced.

Steve Maharey says this US mission will discuss the development of energy solutions to climate change, highlighting how New Zealand plans to achieve its target of using 90 per cent renewable energy by 2025.
