Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister of Research, Science and Technology Steve Maharey announced today that all nine Crown Research Institutes and Canterbury and Victoria Universities are collaborating to establish the New Zealand Climate Change Centre.

“The Centre will enhance collaboration between researchers from the Crown research institutes and universities, and with other New Zealand and overseas organisations. It will also enhance liaison with government departments, local authorities, producer groups, and industry. This will ensure that New Zealand’s scientists are tackling key problems associated with climate change, and that the research organisations are developing the best science-based solutions for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” Helen Clark said.

“Climate change poses great challenges but there are also tremendous opportunities for us to create a truly sustainable future. This Centre will significantly contribute to New Zealand getting maximum benefit from the government’s investment in climate change research, by facilitating collaboration between the Crown research institutes and universities,” Helen Clark said.

The New Zealand Climate Change Centre will:  
•facilitate and co-ordinate collaborative research, addressing New Zealand’s needs  
•be an expert advisory group and link with ministries, local authorities and producer groups  
•be a centre for informed expert advice to industry  
•communicate climate change information to the media and the public  
•coordinate development of science-based tools for adaptation and mitigation  
•run conferences and workshops involving scientists, policymakers and advisors

Helen Clark said establishing the centre supports the Labour-led Government’s commitment to tackle climate change, including through an emissions trading scheme, increasing renewable electricity generation, improving energy efficiency, and initiatives for sustainable land management.

Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey said the centre will focus on research collaboration across organisations and disciplines, to develop science-based solutions for New Zealand to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“The centre will become a valuable resource for both central and local government, industries, educational institutions, media and for the public. It will offer expertise on what tools, information and technology can help New Zealanders become more sustainable,” Steve Maharey said.

“In the past, our organisations have addressed individual pieces of the climate change puzzle. This centre will bring this research together, and will provide a route for industry and the government to tap into this expertise.”
