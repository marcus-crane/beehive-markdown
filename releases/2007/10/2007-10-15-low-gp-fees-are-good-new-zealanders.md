The [latest Consumers Price Index](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/consumers-price-index/consumers-price-index-sep-07-qtr-hotp.htm) confirms that Labour-led policies have driven down the price of seeing your GP and the cost of picking up your prescription, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Health prices decreased 3.1 per cent in the September 2007 quarter, with the main contributions coming from price decreases for pharmaceutical products (down 16.2 per cent) and general practitioner fees (down 15.4 per cent).

"Labour has always said cost should never be a barrier to visiting the family doctor, and we are delivering on that aim," Pete Hodgson said.

"For a young family, the annual cost of going to a general practitioner has fallen from about $940 a year on average to around $440 while for an older couple who on average paid about $780 year, the cost is now around $340 a year,

"The lowered costs have certainly meant older New Zealanders are visiting their GPs and nurses more often. This is in stark contrast to Nationals’ policy of letting market forces determine doctor’s fees, a policy which is in the public arena only because National was pushed by the media and got caught out," Pete Hodgson said.
