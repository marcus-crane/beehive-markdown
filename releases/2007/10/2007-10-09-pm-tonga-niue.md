Prime Minister Helen Clark will next week attend the 38th Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga, before travelling to Niue to attend Constitution Day celebrations.

The Prime Minister will be in Tonga for the Forum – including the traditional one-day leaders’ retreat in Vava’u – from the evening of Monday 15 October, and will leave Tonga for Niue late on Thursday 18 October for the official Constitution Day celebrations the following day.

“New Zealand’s relations with its Pacific neighbours are of the highest importance. The annual meetings of the Forum are an excellent opportunity to contribute to the development of Pacific regionalism, and to meet with other leaders,” Helen Clark said.

“This year, I will also participate in the Post Forum Dialogue discussions with key partners, including the United States, the European Union, China, and Japan.

“Also on the agenda will be discussion on the Forum’s efforts to support the return of constitutional government to Fiji.

“The Forum responded swiftly to the challenges posed by the Fiji coup. A timeframe has been established for the return of democracy through elections in the first quarter of 2009. The Forum will want to encourage Fiji to adhere to this timetable.

“This year’s Forum will also consider a review of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Leaders agreed in Nadi last year that RAMSI should be reviewed, and the Mission has enjoyed good support from Forum members to date.”

Helen Clark said leaders would also consider proposed reforms of the Pacific’s regional organisations.

“There is a need to strengthen co-ordination between regional agencies so that Pacific Plan initiatives can be better co-ordinated.

“I am also looking forward to attending Niue’s 33rd Constitution Day celebrations the day following the Post Forum Dialogue. Our government has been working particularly closely with Niue on its ongoing recovery and viability since Cyclone Heta in January 2004.

“Niue and New Zealand share close historical and constitutional ties, and there are many family links between us,” Helen Clark said.
