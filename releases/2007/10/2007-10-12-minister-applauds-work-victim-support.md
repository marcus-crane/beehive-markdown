Justice Minister Mark Burton today opened the 2007 Victim Support Annual Conference taking place this weekend in Wellington and acknowledged the valuable work of Victim Support in often very difficult situations.

“Meeting the needs of victims of crime is central to the Government’s direction and objectives for the Justice Sector”, said Minister Burton in his opening address.” Mark Burton said.

The Government provided additional funding for Victim Support in Budget 2006. More than $10.8m was allocated over four years to complete the restructuring of Victim Support, which began in 2004.

“That funding is going toward ensuring that Victim Support’s structure and staff continue to effectively meet the needs of victims. It also includes the hiring of more practice specialists and other key staff.” He said.

“The theme of this year’s conference is ‘Better Together’. It is a theme that underpins the collaborative approach taken towards achieving what is now an agreed set of outcomes in the justice sector,” said Minister Burton.

Minister Burton said the Conference provided an excellent opportunity for sharing ideas, discussing issues, and looking at the challenges in the area of crime and victimisation.

“Those in the Justice sector are working to address the factors that lead to crime and support victims in vulnerable times. No one agency has sole responsibility for achieving this - collaboration across government and between government agencies and community organisations, such as Victim Support, is needed to make this possible.” He said.
