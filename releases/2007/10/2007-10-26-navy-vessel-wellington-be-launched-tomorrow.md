The second of the Royal New Zealand Navy’s two new offshore patrol vessels will be launched in Melbourne tomorrow, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced.

The 85 metre-long vessel, named WELLINGTON, is to be launched by Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias, in Williamstown, Melbourne.

Phil Goff said: “The event is another significant milestone for Project Protector – the Labour-led Government’s $500 million investment in the Navy – and an important day for New Zealand. The WELLINGTON’s sister ship OTAGO was launched in November 2006, and the Multi Role Vessel HMNZS CANTERBURY was commissioned into operational service in June this year.

“WELLINGTON and OTAGO have been specifically designed to undertake a range of tasks. They are three-quarters the length of an ANZAC frigate, with the same 6000-mile range, are helicopter capable, ice strengthened and are able to carry 30 troops.

“Tasks will include patrolling New Zealand’s Economic Exclusion Zone, including operations in the Southern Ocean, border protection, supporting counter terrorism missions and enhancing New Zealand’s presence in the Pacific. With periodic security issues arising in the Pacific region, HMNZS CANTERBURY and the two offshore vessels will be especially important assets.”

Phil Goff said Project Protector, which also includes four inshore patrol vessels being built in Whangarei, is one of the largest projects of the Labour-led Government’s Defence Long Term Development Plan to rebuild and re-equip the New Zealand Defence Force.

“The project also provides significant opportunities for New Zealand industry. Under the contract with Tenix Defence Pty Ltd, New Zealand companies will provide at least $110 million of work for these vessels.

“Tenix Shipbuilding New Zealand, in Whangarei, also constructed two sets of bridge and helicopter hanger modules, which were barged across the Tasman in June of this year, and are now fitted to WELLINGTON and OTAGO.”

WELLINGTON will remain in Williamstown for fitting out, trials and crew training with delivery and commissioning into service with the Royal New Zealand Navy in the latter half of 2008, Mr Goff said.
