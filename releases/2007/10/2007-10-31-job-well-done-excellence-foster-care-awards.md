Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services, today congratulated all foster parents for the amazing job they do caring for some of New Zealand's most vulnerable children.

"Foster parents play a huge part in building a better New Zealand, and making it a place where children are nurtured and cared for. They provide the most fundamental thing in a child or young person’s life – a safe, supportive and loving home," said Ruth Dyson.

"Today’s inaugural Excellence in Foster Care Awards recognises carers who are exceptional. In selecting the winners, the panel considered such things as their length of service, their team approach, their relationship with the child’s family of origin, and their role as a leader or mentor to other foster carers.

"This year's winners have over 100 years experience between them – their role and commitment go far beyond both ordinary parenting and volunteering. They take some of our most vulnerable and disadvantaged children into their own homes, often at short notice and for unspecified periods of time.

"They are an enthusiastic and committed group of people, who say that they enjoy the challenges and rewards that fostering brings, and feel that fostering makes their lives richer."

The types of prizes attached to the Awards are a well-deserved break in the form of an Air New Zealand Mystery weekend, or funding to attend a relevant conference.

The new awards have been organised by the New Zealand Family and Foster Care Federation. The Federation provides information, advice and support services to hundreds of people who foster children and young people in this country.
