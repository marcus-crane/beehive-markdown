New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Singapore will be career diplomat Martin Harvey, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Singapore is among our most substantial and fully developed in Southeast Asia,” Mr Peters said.

“The regular pattern of high-level visits and discussions between New Zealand and Singapore has created an atmosphere of trust and confidence, enabling us to have a frank exchange of views on bilateral issues and those of broader regional and international importance.

“New Zealand and Singapore have recently made good progress in developing programmes to facilitate joint research in life sciences. Several major projects are already underway, and we look forward to the emergence of other innovative initiatives as this relationship advances,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Harvey, who has previously been posted to Canberra and Geneva, is currently leading New Zealand’s trade negotiations with Malaysia, the ASEAN countries (in concert with Australia), and the Gulf Cooperation Council. He takes up his assignment in January, replacing Richard Grant, who is returning to Wellington to head the Asia:New Zealand Foundation.
