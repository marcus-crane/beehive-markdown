Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has congratulated Inland Revenue for winning two 'green' awards at the 2007 [Govt³ Awards](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/govt3/awards2007.html).

Co-ordinated by the Ministry for the Environment, the [Govt³ programme](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/govt3/index.html) helps central government agencies become more environmentally sustainable.

Prime Minister Helen Clark presented Inland Revenue with the Recycling and Staff Engagement awards at a ceremony in Wellington. Inland Revenue was also highly commended in the Office Consumables category.

Mr Dunne said he was delighted to see Inland Revenue receive kudos for its efforts.

"Inland Revenue is a large organisation, with more than 5,600 staff around New Zealand," he said.

"These awards recognise the commitment made by all staff across the organisation to introducing and implementing sustainable initiatives."

The department is working towards becoming carbon-neutral by 2012.

Inland Revenue’s Govt³ initiatives include

- staff education about sustainable practices
- a nationwide recycling programme which has reduced waste to landfill by 36 per cent
- energy audits and monitoring
- a commitment to purchasing sustainable goods and services wherever possible
- and a shuttle service between Wellington offices which has saved money
- increased staff networking and lowered carbon emissions.

Inland Revenue won three of the eight categories of the [Govt3Awards in 2006](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27338), when the department won awards for Transport, Behavioural Change, and Leadership (jointly with the Ministry of Fisheries).
