Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is urging Mâori to use their voting power in the local government elections, saying it crucial to ensuring councils and health boards take the views of Mâori voters on board.

Voters have until midday this Saturday to determine who should represent them for the next three years on their local and regional councils and on District Health Boards.

Postal voting forms have been sent out, but people without them can still enrol up until Friday by requesting special voting papers from their Electoral Officer and then casting a special vote.

Mr Horomia said Mâori had been under-represented on councils for some time. While nominations for candidates have closed, the greater the number of Mâori voters the greater their voice will be around council tables.

“My message to Mâori is clear: if you are concerned about local decisions being made that affect the life and well-being of your whânau, hapû, iwi and wider community then you should make sure you vote.”

“Councils must seek and consider community views, including those of Mâori, before they make important decisions. By the very act of casting a vote, people can help elect candidates who share their views and who they believe will advocate for the things they believe are important.”

“There are few potential voters who wholeheartedly endorse the actions of their city, district or regional councils – yet too few of them actually vote. So if you’ve got a raruraru, don’t just voice it – vote!”
