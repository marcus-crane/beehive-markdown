Public sector reports to Parliament are to be made simpler, clearer and more informative, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The move follows a review of accountability documents initiated by the Minister and carried out by the Treasury. The reports include Estimates, information provided in support of funding requests, statements of intent and annual reports.

“The review confirmed my view that some government departments’ accountability documents have become long, decorative, and less than succinct,” said Dr Cullen.

“These changes will allow Ministers, Parliament, and members of the public to shine a brighter light on government spending. The Finance and Expenditure Select Committee agrees that changes are needed to make the documents serve their purpose.”

The proposed improvements cover all stages of the accountability cycle, from strategy setting with Ministers through to better reporting to Parliament.

“Ministers expect to see a progressive improvement in the quality of performance information from departments. Ministerial and departmental priorities will be better matched, and there will be information available to measure progress,” said Dr Cullen.

Improvements include a plainer presentation style and removal of peripheral information, as well as changes of emphasis. Departments’ statements of intent will become solely strategic documents setting priorities at least three years ahead, while all the one-year performance information will be in the Estimates and supporting documents.

In future there will be a single volume of Estimates containing core appropriation information, with detailed performance information provided in supporting documents.

Structural changes to the accountability documents will be made next year, and the quality of accountability information will be improved progressively over several years.

“Accountability to Ministers and to Parliament for spending public money is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. I want to see departments and other agencies taking this responsibility much more seriously,” said Dr Cullen.
