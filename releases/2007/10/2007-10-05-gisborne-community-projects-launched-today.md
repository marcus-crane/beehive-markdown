The New Zealand Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (CAB) and Computers in Homes projects launched in Gisborne today illustrate the success of the Labour-led government’s Community Partnership Fund, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The CAB received $1.27 million from the fund to build a nationwide online database connecting local CABs and greatly improving their access to quality information for clients.

“This funding will revolutionise Citizens Advice Bureaux and will greatly assist local CAB volunteers in the valuable work they do for our communities,” said Laban.

Computers in Homes provides low income families with recycled computers, a free internet connection and technical support. Computers in Homes received $1.84 million from the fund to expand its programme into Gisborne, Wairoa and the East Coast region.

“Computers in Homes is a wonderful programme that gives families an opportunity to connect to their communities and to the world,” said Laban.

The $17.4 million Community Partnership Fund is part of the Labour-led government’s Digital Strategy, and supports national, regional, and community Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives.

“The Community Partnership Fund helps build the confidence of our communities in the use of ICT, while forging strong partnerships between communities, local and central government, and business,” said Laban.

“The Labour-led government is committed to building strong, sustainable and connected communities. Having access to technology and having the confidence to use it helps to bring communities closer together,” said Laban.
