Associate Economic Development and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban will lead a New Zealand Trade Mission to the Pacific Island of Guam from 6 to 11 October.

“The focus of this trade mission is for New Zealand companies to explore opportunities in the construction, building materials, machinery supplies and consultancy sectors in the Pacific.

“New opportunities are expected to be created when around 50,000 United States military forces move from Okinawa to Guam. This trade mission will be a perfect chance to learn more about these opportunities,” says Laban.

The trade mission has been organised by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) and the New Zealand Pacific Business Council (NZPBC) and will be made up of 27 people representing 22 New Zealand companies.

“The delegation will attend the United States Department of Interior’s annual Island Business Opportunities Conference, where leaders of Island nations which have formal ties with the United States present upcoming business opportunities in the region,’ said Laban.

“I look forward to supporting our business leaders to identify commercial opportunities for Kiwi firms and fostering stronger bilateral relations with the US Pacific territories.

“NZPBC and I also look forward to exploring two-way trade possibilities with Guam,” said Laban.

The event is a part of the ongoing suite of private and public sector initiatives occurring through the Labour-led government’s Export Year 2007.

Pacific Island nations with formal ties with the United States who will be represented at the conference are American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Marshall Islands, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Palau and Guam.
