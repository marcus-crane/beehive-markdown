Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove says a new Bill to improve the law relating to trusts will make the administration of trusts easier while also protecting the interests of trust beneficiaries.

The Trustee Amendment Bill - which had its First Reading in Parliament today - includes proposals made by the Law Commission in its 2002 report Some Problems in the Law of Trusts.

Mr Cosgrove said the reforms will benefit many New Zealanders, from those who have a home in family trust to those who act as trustees for charitable trusts working in the community and those for whom assets are held in a trust on their behalf.

“Administering trusts has become an increasingly complex task that involves specialised and technical knowledge. The Bill changes the powers and obligations of trustees to enable them to carry out their duties effectively, while ensuring that beneficiaries’ rights are protected,” he said.

Key elements of the Bill’s proposals include:  
•Expanding trustees’ collective power to delegate decision-making powers in order to better manage the affairs of the trust. The Bill, however, does not permit delegation of certain fundamental trustee powers such as appointing trustees or deciding how the capital or income of the trust is to be distributed.  
•Requiring trustees to seek direction from the High Court where the trustee considers that advice or direction from an advisory trustee or protector conflicts with the terms of the trust, any law, or exposes the trustee to any liability. This will make the trustee take action where they know advice or direction is wrong or objectionable and not in the best interests of all beneficiaries.  
•Widening the insurance powers of trustees with respect to trust property.  
•Requiring trustees to notify each beneficiary of their legal entitlements to end the trust and call for a transfer of the trust property.

The Bill also proposes a change to the Administration Act 1969 and related legislation clarifying that payments to administrators are remuneration for services and not a gift for estate purposes.

Mr Cosgrove said the new Bill does not radically change the law but rather modernises it. “The Bill implements simple improvements to the administration of trusts by modifying trustees’ powers and obligations.”

Mr Cosgrove extended his thanks to the Law Commission for its work, which seeks to improve the law for all New Zealanders.

**Background Information: Trustee Amendment Bill**

**Why are changes to the law necessary?**  
In its 2002 report Some Problems in the Law of Trusts, the Law Commission identified a number of areas where the law of trusts had fallen behind in dealing with challenges faced by trustees in the administration of trusts. The Bill recognises the increasingly specialised skills required for administering trusts and updates the Trustee Act to provide for the improved administration of trusts while protecting the legal entitlements of trust beneficiaries.

**How many trusts are operating in New Zealand?**  
While there are many trusts operating in New Zealand, there is no official register which records how many trusts are operating. However information from the 2006 Census shows that of the 1.45 million households in occupied private dwellings in New Zealand, 167,922 (12.3%) were held in a family trust, for example.  
Trusts can be set up for a wide variety of purposes. With family trusts, for example, the primary benefit is the protection of assets from creditors, in the event that family members get into financial strife.

**What changes are proposed to trustees’ decision making powers?**  
In New Zealand, trustees’ current powers to delegate discretionary functions are restricted and undermine the ability of trustees to effectively manage the affairs of the trust. The primary issue is the expertise required to carry out all those duties rather than the overall workload.  
The Bill proposes expanding trustees’ collective power to authorise their agents or attorneys to administer aspects of the trust, including powers of investment and management. Core powers, such as the power to appoint trustees or to decide how the capital or income of the trust is distributed, will continue to be non-delegable and vested in trustees.

**Why is it proposed to extend trustees’ powers of insurance?**  
At present, a trustee seeking to obtain insurance cover (on a replacement basis) for trust property needs the consent of the life tenant (who occupies the property), instead of the remainderman (the beneficiary who stands to inherit the property). If consent is withheld, this may result in a situation where a property is not adequately insured.  
The Bill removes the need for the trustee to obtain the consent of the life tenant and ensures that the property can be properly insured, for the benefit of both the life tenant and trust beneficiaries.

**Will the Bill affect my existing trust?**  
The proposals should not affect the terms of any trusts. What the proposals do is clarify the powers and responsibilities of trustees administering trusts and ensure that trusts are administered efficiently and that the rights of trust beneficiaries are upheld.
