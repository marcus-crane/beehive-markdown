Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard urged businesses today to see the challenges posed by climate change as an economic and commercial opportunity as global markets clamour for climate friendly products and services.

"We need to make sure that our productive base is environmentally sustainable, mainly because we owe it to our children and grandchildren, but also because we will be punished by an increasingly environmentally sensitive global market if we don’t," Trevor Mallard said in a speech to the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.

"Climate change is a massive challenge, but in challenges there are also opportunities, and while we have to do our bit internationally - as we always have - we must keep an eye on the commercial opportunities that innovative responses to climate change will create.

"The Labour-led government is taking leadership in this area through a range of initiatives including the emissions trading scheme announced recently, that in a world first, will cover all types of greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy.

"We have also focussed on public transport, renewable energy and the development of new Energy and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategies, the Transport Strategy, the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Plan of Action, as well as work on improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles, increasing the standards for insulation in buildings, and planting more forests.

"Crucial sectors of our economy are already under pressure from international customers. Presenting impeccable environmental credentials is hugely important to be able to continue to sell our products. The simplistic and erroneous "food miles" argument is just one example why such credentials are necessary."

More businesses were stepping up to the challenge, Trevor Mallard said.

For example, Air New Zealand recently announced it is buying aircraft that are up to 20 per cent more fuel-efficient, and Meridian Energy is certified carbon neutral for electricity generation. Sectors such as tourism and viticulture are already planning and investing based on sustainability. Agriculture is also starting to respond.

"Tomorrow I am visiting Tauranga engineering company Page Macrae Engineering - a local firm that knows the value of innovation. It started out in the marine servicing field but, with the help of highly skilled staff, it has diversified across a range of sectors like shipping, forestry and energy - and now the company is involved in designing and making sustainable products in areas such as wastewater technology and low emission plants for turning wood waste into energy," Trevor Mallard said.
