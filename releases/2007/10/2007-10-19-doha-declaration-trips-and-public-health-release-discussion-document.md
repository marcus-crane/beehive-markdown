Improving poorer countries' access to medicines is the aim of a discussion document being released by the Government today.

The document, released by Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard, proposes that New Zealand support a change to international agreements on pharmaceuticals and intellectual property rights by accepting a protocol amending the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) implementing the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health.

“This protocol is about ensuring that poorer countries can access the pharmaceuticals they need, in sufficient quantities, and at an affordable price, to meet their public health requirements,” Ms Tizard said.  
“The declaration recognises that some members of the World Trade Organisation have little or no capacity for manufacturing pharmaceuticals. These countries could face difficulties in making use of the compulsory licence provisions in the TRIPS Agreement if they can’t get sufficient quantities of patented pharmaceuticals from the patent owner to affordably meet their needs. The TRIPS Agreement currently forbids the issue of compulsory licences for the export of a patented invention.”  
A compulsory license allows the holder of the license to make or use a patented invention without the permission of the patent owner. Compulsory licenses can be issued where a patent owner is unable or unwilling to supply a patented invention in reasonable quantities at a reasonable price.

"The protocol would allow members with limited pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity to obtain patented pharmaceuticals made under compulsory license in other WTO member states," Ms Tizard said.  
Given the intention behind the protocol, the discussion document proposes that New Zealand should accept the protocol and also amend its patents legislation to allow New Zealand to export pharmaceuticals manufactured here under a compulsory license. Submissions on the options paper will close on 14 December 2007.
