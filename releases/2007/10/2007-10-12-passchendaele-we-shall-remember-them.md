Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker attended a special commemorative service to mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele at the National War Memorial in Wellington today.

The Battle of Passchendaele was New Zealand’s worst military disaster in terms of lives lost in a single day. During battles on 4 and 12 October 1917 more than 1300 young New Zealanders were killed and many more injured. On 12 October alone more than 800 New Zealanders were killed

"The service and wreath laying today is about remembering the sacrifice made by New Zealand soldiers on Flemish soil, the loss of life which occurred on such a massive scale, and the families of those who lost loved ones, Mr Barker said.

"The courage displayed by the New Zealand soldiers at Passchendaele was extraordinary, and made more so by the fact that they were ordinary men. New Zealanders from all walks fought and gave up their lives. Amongst them were farmers, lawyers, plumbers, even All Blacks.

"Earlier this year Archives New Zealand [presented me with digital copies of the Casualty Forms](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30091) of New Zealand servicemen killed in action during the Battle of Passchendaele.

"The Casualty Forms have been sent to the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 for use in their ‘Passchendaele Archives’ project. The Forms, which give details of service, next of kin, and place of burial, will be used in the database at the Museum’s visitor centre to assist the Museum in commemorating the New Zealanders who were killed in the Battle of Passchendaele. This is an important step towards ensuring the service of those who were killed or injured at Passchendaele is not forgotten.

"The digital information will help tell more about those who lie row on row, with their names carved in stone. Who travelled so far, never to return.

"Yesterday I submitted a Government Notice of Motion to Parliament which recognises the significance of today's anniversary. It is a small gesture compared to the immense, and in so many cases ultimate, sacrifice made by our soldiers at Passchendaele - but an important way of ensuring their deeds are not forgotten.

"Prime Minister, Helen Clark [attended commemorations in Passchendaele](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30876) earlier this month where she signed a [shared memories arrangement](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30872) with Flemish Foreign Policy Minister, Geert Bourgeois.

The shared memories arrangement will ensure the sacrifices made on the Western Front continue to be properly commemorated and will support educating younger generations about New Zealand's involvement.

While it may never be possible for us to fully comprehend the sheer scale of the loss of life and what our soldiers endured at Passchendaele, we must honour and remember them.

Lest we forget.
