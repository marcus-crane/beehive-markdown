The Prime Minister has presented awards recognising good sustainable practice in government.

"The Govt3 programme is all about the government walking the talk on sustainability, and it has been a trailblazer for the Prime Minister’s package of sustainability initiatives announced in February. These awards demonstrate that the government is truly leading the way towards a sustainable New Zealand," said David Parker, Acting Minister for the Environment.

The Govt3 Awards recognise achievements in eight categories ranging from transport and office consumables to staff participation and leadership.

Past award-winner, the Inland Revenue Department, was again successful, winning the Recycling/Waste Minimisation award for reducing waste sent to landfill over the last year by 76,000 kg. It also won the large-agency award for Engaging Staff in Govt3.

The Ministry for Science, Research and Technology (MoRST) won the small-agency staff engagement award for its innovative approach. MoRST was also successful in the Leadership in Govt3 category for the work of its "Govt3 Ninjas" in initiating a recycling system and a new energy policy.

Another big winner was the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Their success in achieving sustainable procurement outcomes took top honours in the Sustainable Procurement Practice category. They also won the Leadership in Govt3 award for large agencies for their systematic approach across many areas of sustainability.

The Ministry for the Environment and Victoria University were nominees for the first time, with the Ministry taking home the award for Office Consumables and Equipment. New Zealand Police was another first-time winner for the new Manukau Police Station, which was built using sustainable design principles.

Other winners were Housing New Zealand and the Department of Corrections. Antarctica New Zealand was one of 10 highly commended nominees for leadership on sustainability at Scott Base.

Fifty agencies are now members of the Govt3 programme, which started in 2003. The Govt3 programme is run by the Ministry for the Environment.
