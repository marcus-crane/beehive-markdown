Nick Smith’s attack today on the government’s vision for sustainable transport asserted wrongly that the New Zealand Energy Strategy plans for growth in electricity demand of 0.4 percent per annum, Energy Minister David Parker says.

"He’s wrong by a factor of three. The Energy Strategy projects electricity demand will grow by 1.3 percent per annum," the Minister said.

"Our advice is that powering a large fleet of vehicles from electricity is entirely feasible within projected electricity generation growth, particularly if they are recharged at off-peak times."

Nick Smith’s approach today shows that the National Party would rather sneer than come up with sensible solutions to climate change, David Parker said.

"It’s clear we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our transport sector, and electric cars are a realistic part of a long-term solution, that countries around the world are investigating," David Parker said.

"That’s why they will play an important role, alongside improved energy efficiency and use of biofuels, in Labour’s strategy to reduce per capita transport emissions by half by 2040.

"Switching to electric vehicles would led to cleaner air, and less reliance on overseas oil imports, which are currently hitting record high prices, well above $80 a barrel."

Making this transition will require leadership to happen, and that’s what this Labour-led government is providing, David Parker said.

National’s response today shows they are afraid of change, content to do nothing, and lacking both vision and courage, David Parker said.
