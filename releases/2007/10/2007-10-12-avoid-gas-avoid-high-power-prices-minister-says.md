Energy Minister David Parker says if New Zealand had continued on a path of building new gas-powered generation the country’s power prices might have soared.

The Labour-led government’s newly-announced Energy Strategy will see no more fossil fuel baseload generation being built for a decade, and a target of 90 percent renewable generation by 2025.

"Some critics are saying this will mean higher power prices," David Parker said. "In fact, the opposite is true. Sources of wind and geothermal are more affordable than gas. And if we needed to use imported gas it would mean exposing New Zealand to the high and volatile international price of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)."

Current international prices for LNG are well above current prices for wholesale gas supplies in New Zealand, the Minister said.

"With Maui running out, we don't have as many gas reserves as we did previously. Only a few years ago the government had to give Genesis a supporting guarantee related to gas supply to enable it to build the high efficiency gas fired combined cycle plant E3P.

"If we build a lot more gas-fired generation, we increase the risk having to import LNG to fuel that generation in the future."

Because of the way NZ's electricity market worked, electricity prices tend to be set by the highest cost source of generation. If that was LNG, our prices would be dictated by the international LNG market and the currency exchange rate, David Parker said.

"As with supplies of oil into New Zealand we would increasingly be exposed to high prices, price volatility and security of supply issues.

"Even apart from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, this is another good reason to pursue renewable energy and steer clear of investment in new gas generation, except where necessary to ensure security of supply.

"We may well need some gas peaking plant, but we are unlikely to need gas-fired baseload," the Minister concluded.
