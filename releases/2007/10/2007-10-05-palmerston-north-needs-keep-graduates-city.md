Palmerston North needs to retain more of its young students to keep their talents and skills in the local economy, local MP and Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

“Palmerston North is an education centre with large numbers of young people and we must retain our graduates if we are to secure the city’s future as a ‘smart centre’.”

Steve Maharey was speaking at a Vision Manawatu breakfast seminar attended by business people and students and staff from Massey University and UCOL.

“Palmerston North is already known as an education city and an important research hub – to succeed as a thriving, creative centre we need to build on this by creating a place where young people come to learn and develop their careers.

“We have around 30,000 people studying here – we must focus on keeping this talent which feeds our local businesses.

“Palmerston North needs to build more partnerships between our schools, tertiary institutes and businesses and make it easier for graduates to get jobs here.

“We can assist graduates to get employed in local companies or start their own, and follow in the footsteps of entrepreneurs such as Simon Barnett of OBO’s hockey gear and James Watts of Inspire Net internet provider.

“The Bio Commerce Centre in the old Dairy Factory Building, which houses fledgling technology companies like Pixelthis, is a great example of Palmerston North encouraging entrepreneurship.”

“The challenge for Palmerston North is to focus on becoming a ‘magnet’ for talented people, young and old, from around New Zealand and beyond.”
