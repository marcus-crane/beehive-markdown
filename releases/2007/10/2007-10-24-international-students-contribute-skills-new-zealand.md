A significant number of international students are choosing to keep their skills in New Zealand once they have finished their studies, Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said today.

“Research has found 27 per cent of all international students who began study between 1999 and 2001 gained residence or stayed in New Zealand to work,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“Notably, the majority of the people gaining residence did so through the skilled / Business immigration stream – which means they are filling those skill gaps in our labour market.

“We know that the international education sector is a major contributor to the economy – worth an estimated $2 billion every year in foreign exchange. But this is also about the skills we can benefit from once those students have completed their New Zealand qualifications.”

The research ‘International students: Studying and staying on in New Zealand’ looked at the study paths of students over a period of almost five years. It explored how many students made the move to New Zealand more permanent once studies were completed. It was jointly sponsored by the Department of Labour and Education New Zealand.

“The research looked at who makes these transitions and how, so that information can be used by education providers and policy makers. The findings of this report will be valuable in building our knowledge of this important market, and have already contributed to the international student policy, announced today” Mr Cunliffe said.

The changes are designed to improve the attractiveness of New Zealand as an education destination.
