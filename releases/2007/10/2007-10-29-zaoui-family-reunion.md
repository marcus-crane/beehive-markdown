The Minister of Immigration David Cunliffe said he was pleased that the reunion of Ahmed Zaoui with his family had been accomplished following the withdrawal last month of the security risk certificate on Mr Zaoui.

“As soon as the decisions were made on Mr Zaoui’s case,I asked the Department to ensure this family reunion happened as quickly as possible, and they have done so.”

Mr Cunliffe said that Mr Zaoui was granted refugee status in August 2003.
