New Zealand has formally signed up to an international Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War, Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“Explosive remnants of war – such as unexploded bombs, shells and cluster munitions – that are not cleared continue to damage communities after the conflict has ended. They present a significant ongoing threat to the health and safety of civilians. They prevent communities from rebuilding their economic livelihoods,” Mr Goff said.

“New Zealand supports and has become a party to this treaty to address this problem and to promote stronger application of humanitarian law.

“The primary obligation of the Protocol is for countries – as soon as is feasible – to mark and clear, remove or destroy explosive remnants of war present in territory they control after hostilities have ceased.

“This Protocol complements our efforts to develop stronger controls over cluster munitions”, Mr Goff said.

“New Zealand has extensive experience of the humanitarian threat posed by explosive remnants of war and landmines, in countries including Cambodia, Laos and Mozambique. A New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) team is currently deployed to clean up unexploded cluster munitions in Southern Lebanon.”

New Zealand’s Instrument of Acceptance to the Protocol was deposited with the United Nations on 2 October at a special treaty event in the UN General Assembly. Other countries that have accepted the Protocol include Australia, and Canada and the United Kingdom are also looking to ratify it.

The Protocol is one of five relating to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. New Zealand has now accepted all five of its protocols, and will be participating in the first  
conference of countries that have accepted the Protocol in November this year".
