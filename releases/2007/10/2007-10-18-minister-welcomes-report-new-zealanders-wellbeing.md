A government report showing New Zealanders’ general well-being continues to improve in a number of key areas has been welcomed by Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today.

The Social Report, published annually by the Ministry of Social Development, uses a set of indicators to monitor trends across a number of areas of people’s lives. Together these areas provide a picture of wellbeing and quality of life in New Zealand.

“What the report does is tell the story of how New Zealanders are living at a point in time. It looks at trends and identifies sectors where we’ve improved, as well as those where we can do more,” Mr Maharey said.

“The findings in the Social Report 2007 tell us that, in a number of key areas like early childhood education and employment, we have made further progress.

“This Labour-led government has made a focused and consistent effort to improve the well-being of all New Zealanders, and I believe this report shows these efforts have paid off.

“Among OECD countries, New Zealand has the third lowest unemployment rate. We also rank higher than the OECD median for participation in tertiary education, employment, and representation of women in Parliament,” said Mr Maharey.

This year’s report, the sixth in the series, contains detailed information on the regions for the first time.

“The research shows that regions that have in the past trailed others, are making great strides: more people are in work, they have better access to telephone and Internet services, and the number of low-income families is declining.”

The report shows that Maori are enjoying better education, employment and living standards than they did in the 1990s, but there is still a gap with non-Maori.

“We can do more to lift living standards for Maori and Pacific people. But we’re certainly heading in the right direction,” said Mr Maharey.
