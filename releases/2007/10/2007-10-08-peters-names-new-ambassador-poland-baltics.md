New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Poland will be career diplomat Penelope Ridings, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Dr Ridings will also be accredited to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

“New Zealand and Poland have strong historical links. We fought together in World War Two, and New Zealand’s decision to take the 730 “Polish Children of Pahiatua” in 1944 still resonates in Poland,” Mr Peters said.

“Poland’s growing economy offers scope for New Zealand to expand its trade links. Poland is also an important contact for us on European Union matters.

“Dr Ridings will also seek to strengthen New Zealand’s engagement with the Baltic states. As small, forward-thinking countries with important connections in Europe, they have much to offer New Zealand as partners,” Mr Peters said.

Dr Ridings is currently head of the Trade Law Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She will take up her appointment next May, replacing Philip Griffiths who will return to Wellington.
