The Minister for Small Business, Lianne Dalziel, has welcomed the release of the 5th Compliance Cost Survey, which indicates compliance costs are down for small business.

"This is great news, coming on the heels of the confirmation from the World Bank that New Zealand has held our second place ranking in the Doing Business survey, which provides an international benchmark for ease of doing business across 178 countries,” Lianne Dalziel said

Lianne Dalziel said that the Business New Zealand-KPMG Compliance Cost Survey had again highlighted the difference between perception and reality, with businesses reporting a higher level of compliance costs than the actual costs per fulltime equivalent.

“The Quality Regulation Review also identified instances where there was a mismatch between perception and reality, largely driven off anecdotal information, rather than actual experiences. At least the perception of the level of increase is also showing a downward trend in this survey, so everything is moving in the right direction,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Survey shows that for firms employing 5 or fewer staff compliance costs have fallen to $2,384 from $3,353 per full time employee (FTE) last year and $3,604 in 2005.

“This is a major advance for the businesses that feel the weight of compliance the most.

"As Commerce Minister, I am particularly proud that the Companies Office has been ranked as the most helpful government agency for the fifth year in a row with its 2007 value improving on last year. That reflects well on the staff, but also on the culture of an organisation which refuses to rest on its laurels and looks at ways of continuous quality improvement," Lianne Dalziel said.
