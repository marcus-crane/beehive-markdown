Following a review of New Zealand’s policy for exports of livestock (sheep, cattle, deer and goats) for slaughter, Cabinet has agreed it needs to control the trade more tightly.

“The review addressed concerns about the treatment and handling of livestock, and slaughter practices in importing countries. It also looked at the potential impact on New Zealand’s reputation as a responsible exporter of agricultural products,” Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“It concluded that the current policy did not adequately manage the risks of potential ill-treatment of animals and any economic consequences that might result from that.”

A process of consultation will now take place, proposing a Customs Export Prohibition Order as an interim measure. This would impose further controls on the exports of sheep, cattle, deer and goats for slaughter. It is proposed that the Director General of MAF would have the discretion to approve individual consignments on a case-by-case basis, where it can be shown that the risks will be satisfactorily managed.

Discussion will also be included on potential amendments to existing legislation.

The additional controls would not apply to exports of livestock for breeding or other purposes.

“The Government will be consulting with exporters, industry groups and other representatives of the farming industry on the interim Customs Export Prohibition Order and any subsequent changes to the legislation,” Jim Anderton said.

“Our trading partners will be advised of the proposed changes and be given the opportunity to comment.”

Cabinet will announce its decision on any new measures once the outcome of the consultation with affected parties is known. Comment is sought by 26 November 2007.

### Background

- New Zealand’s current policy for the export of livestock is reflected in the [Animal Products Act 1999](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=568925799&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B13BC%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) and the [Animal Welfare Act 1999](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=568925799&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B228C%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC). Neither Act provides for the ability to consider issues related to the treatment of livestock in the importing country after disembarkation.
- Currently, providing exporters meet the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act and satisfy the Director-General of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as to the conditions for international transport of livestock up to the point of disembarkation, the export may proceed.
