A board which will provide advice to the government on walking access in New Zealand was appointed by Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor today.

The Walking Access Advisory Board has eight members and will help advise the government on the following:

- the development of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Conservation (DOC) on the operational management of walkways on land administered by DOC
- the development of a New Zealand Access Strategy, including new access and priorities for funding
- the development of a voluntary code of responsible conduct
- the public’s likely requirements and priorities for walking access
- the development of an appropriate mapping database for walking access and
- the options for a new walking access organisation

“The Chair and members of the Board have been appointed on the basis of their experience and knowledge relevant to the functions of the Board, rather than as representatives of any particular interest group,” said Mr O’Connor.

The Members of the Board are:

- John Acland (Chair - Geraldine)
- Brian Stephenson (Auckland)
- John Aspinall (Wanaka)
- John Forbes (Opotiki)
- Peter Brown (Gisborne)
- Claire Mulcock (Christchurch)
- Dr Jenny Ross (Christchurch)
- Alan McMillan (Dunedin)

All appointees are new members, although five members were also members of the former Walking Access Consultation Panel which will ensure continuity of the previous effective approach.

The three new members all have a close association with recreational interests.  
Brian Stephenson is a barrister from Auckland with extensive experience in employment law and dispute resolution. As current President of Federated Mountain Clubs of NZ, he has knowledge and experience of outdoor recreation organisations.

Dr Jenny Ross is Associate Professor in recreation studies at Lincoln University. She is a former board member of SPARC, has health and life sciences research experience, along with governance and management experience in recreation, physical activity and sport.

Alan McMillan is Chair of Public Access New Zealand (PANZ). He is a former president of and a current executive member of the NZ Federation of Freshwater Anglers with extensive knowledge of recreational access issues.

“I am confident that this Advisory Board will continue with the pragmatic and common-sense approach of the Walking Access panel, and assist with the establishment of an entity which will ensure effective resolution of the many access issues, in line with the recommendations of the previous panel,” said Mr O’Connor.
