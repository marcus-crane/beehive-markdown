“I am extremely proud to be part of a Government that is showing leadership in addressing many of the difficult issues confronting New Zealand,” Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today. “Responsible climate change policy is challenging – we are fronting up to this challenge.”

He was speaking at the Prime Minister’s Sustainability Forum in Christchurch and made the point that climate change is not only a risk, it is also an opportunity. “Consumers are increasingly turning towards environmentally responsible production and prepared to pay premiums for it. This is a wave available to New Zealand to ride. But first, we have to measure up,” Jim Anderton said.

“The Emissions Trading Scheme is the cornerstone of New Zealand’s efforts to reduce our carbon emissions. But, on its own, it won’t do enough to reduce agricultural emissions significantly over the longer term, nor will it address how the land management sectors adapt to climate change or take advantage of the business opportunities available to them.

“The Government is committed to working through these issues in partnership with the industry. I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Government will invest $175 million over the next five years on a plan of action on land management and climate change.

“This is the largest package of sustainable land management measures ever developed by a New Zealand government.”

Jim Anderton said he was aware of concerns about the impact on water quality, particularly in Canterbury, from the intensification of dairying.

“Dairying will continue to be an important part of the New Zealand economy. Although I find that some of the more extreme comments regrettable, continued growth in the dairy industry is important to our future economic prosperity − but growth at any cost is not acceptable.

“The debate should not be about whether or not we need growth in the dairy sector, it should be about how we achieve growth in a way that meets the needs of all New Zealanders.

“New Zealanders expect our primary industries to play their part. Our markets expect us to play our part. We have to get started with a vision of a sustainable and carbon neutral New Zealand,” Jim Anderton said.

“The integrated approach outlined in the Emissions Trading Scheme, the Plan of Action for Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change, and the host of other related polices shows how and where we begin.”
