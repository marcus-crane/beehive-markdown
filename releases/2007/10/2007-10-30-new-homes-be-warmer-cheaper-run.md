The most significant improvements to the energy efficiency of new homes in 30 years come into effect from tomorrow, meaning warmer, dryer and healthier homes, says the Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove.

As well as increasing ceiling and wall insulation minimum requirements for all new homes and major extensions to existing houses, the new energy efficiency measures will mean most new homes are double glazed.

“New homes in the South Island and Central Plateau of the North Island are the first to meet the new requirements. From tomorrow (31 October 2007), all new homes and major extensions across these colder parts of the country will need to comply with the new provisions of the Building Code to gain code compliance from local authorities. The new provisions mean they will have to be built to use 30 percent less energy than was previously necessary to stay comfortably warm,” said Mr Cosgrove.

New homes in the rest of the North Island south of Auckland will need to meet the new requirements from July 2008 and from Auckland north from October 2008.

“These reforms will see New Zealanders living in good quality homes that are warmer, drier, healthier and cheaper to run. This will deliver a triple win for our health, our environment and lower gas and electricity bills,” said Mr Cosgrove.

The insulation changes, including use of double glazing in most new homes, are part of the biggest improvement to energy efficiency in buildings since the late 1970s.

“While this will add modest costs to new homes ($3,000 to $5,000 approximately), these will be recouped through lower gas and electricity bills in three to seven years.

"The benefits continue long after that investment has been repaid, with projected annual savings for households of between $1,800 (Dunedin) and $760 (Auckland).

“Those building new homes will also be boosting the capital value of their home and increasing its appeal to prospective purchasers or renters,” said Mr Cosgrove.

Mr Cosgrove said having more energy efficient homes will help achieve sustainability by reducing the demand for non-renewable electricity generation.

The government is also introducing changes which make it easier to get a building consent for solar heating systems and will require more energy-efficient lighting and heating/ventilation systems in commercial buildings.

Mr Cosgrove today also released Your Guide to $marter Insulation, a free booklet from the Department of Building and Housing, which outlines the new insulation requirements and other energy-saving initiatives. Copies can be obtained by ringing the Department on 0800 242 243.
