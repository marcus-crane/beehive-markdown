"Biosecurity is a vital membrane that has to facilitate trade, and at the same time protect our natural environment from a greater spread of risks," Jim Anderton, Minister responsible for Biosecurity said today.

He was launching the Biosecurity Science Strategy at the annual conference of MAF Biosecurity New Zealand in Auckland.

"Science is crucial to our need to be innovative in keeping pests and diseases out of New Zealand. Our trade partners demand − as we demand of them − biosecurity controls that are based only on evidence. And we are under pressure at the same time from climate change, and the emergence of new risks we haven’t even really begun to contemplate," Jim Anderton said.

Forty percent more containers arrived in New Zealand by sea this year than five years ago. And the volume of goods has grown even more, with twenty-foot containers being replaced by forty-foot ones.

"More trade produces higher biosecurity risks – ant pests from the Pacific Islands, mosquito species and their accompanying disease vectors from Asia, and who knows what from ballast water discharges. Our biosecurity system has to be capable of operating effectively in the sophisticated, globally integrated economy we are developing."

Jim Anderton went on to talk about what he termed 'cynical trade barriers.'

"One of the most insidious forms of protection we encounter is the presence of biosecurity barriers where they cannot be justified. We need to ensure our own hands are clean.

"We need to ensure our own biosecurity controls are evidence-based. The science has to be sound and the decision-making has to be best-practice. So science is crucial to the integrity of our biosecurity."

Over the next five years, New Zealand will spend around $840 million on biosecurity.  
"Every year we spend around $37 million dollars on biosecurity-related research. We need to get the best value for our bucks," Jim Anderton said.

"The Strategy identifies our research needs and the biosecurity science capability we need in the areas that we have identified as a priority. And it outlines the steps we need to take to ensure the uptake of science is timely and effective.

"The Biosecurity Science Strategy will strengthen the foundation of New Zealand’s biosecurity protection.

"This government is fully committed to a biosecurity system that defends our status as the most unique natural environment in the world."

Jim Anderton also presented the 2007 MAF Biosecurity New Zealand Awards. The first went to John Hellström, one of the pioneers of biosecurity in New Zealand, who set up the National Agricultural Security Service and introduced science-based risk assessment. The other award recipient was Stewart Milne, a former Secretary of Transport and Executive Director of New Zealand’s Board of Airline Representatives.

"The Biosecurity Strategy recognises a responsibility we all have to work to preserve our environment, natural resources, and our way of life," Jim Anderton said.

"This award specially recognises contributions to this goal. Both Stewart and John are great examples of New Zealanders who have made that commitment."
