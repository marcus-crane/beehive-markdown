Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard has announced the appointment of a new member to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Board.

Professor Judith Binney from Auckland is Emeritus Professor of History at Auckland University and one of New Zealand’s most respected historians, academics and writers.

Professor Binney has specialised in the history of Mâori and European engagement in New Zealand and has produced several acclaimed biographies and histories.

In 2003 she was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal and as a Guardian of the Alexander Turnbull Library.

Judith Tizard said she was delighted that Professor Binney had agreed to bring her academic skills and bicultural experience to the Trust Board.

“Professor Binney's governance experience on the Te Papa Board and the Waitangi Tribunal will add considerable value to the Board’s discussions,” she said.

The Historic Places Trust Board has six government appointees and three positions elected by Trust subscribing members. It promotes the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand.
