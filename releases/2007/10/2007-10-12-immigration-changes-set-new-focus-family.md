New immigration policies announced today by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe will make it easier for people to bring family members to New Zealand for visits.

"The changes recognise the importance of family support and make the immigration system more transparent," said Mr Cunliffe.

From November there will be a new multiple visit visa for parents and grandparents visiting family living in New Zealand. The new visa will allow parents or grandparents to make multiple visits over a three-year period without having to apply for a visa each time.

"Parents and grandparents play a key role in family life. The new policies will make it easier for family from offshore to visit," said Mr Cunliffe.

Mr Cunliffe also announced a number of other changes to sponsorship of parents, adult children and siblings in the family residence categories, including:

- Establishing quota places for the sponsorship of parents, adult children, and adult siblings to come to New Zealand as permanent residents
- The introduction of strengthened character criteria for people wishing to sponsor partners to come to New Zealand
- The introduction of a minimum income requirement of $29,897.92 for sponsors of parents
- The extension of the timeframe for sponsors to guarantee support for their parents from two years to five years (to come into effect with the passing and enactment of the Immigration Bill in 2008)
- The withdrawal of the existing Family Quota category.

There will be 3100 to 3400 places for parents, 250 to 350 places for adult children,  
1100 to 1250 places for adult siblings in 2007/08, based on the actual numbers from previous years.

"The largest part of our residence programme will continue to be for skilled migrants and their immediate families. There will be no change to the current distribution of places with 60 per cent of residence places for skilled migrants, 30 per cent for family related places and 10 per cent for our international and humanitarian obligations."

Mr Cunliffe said the changes making it easier for people to bring family members to visit New Zealand are being balanced by tighter requirements in some instances.

"The family package announced today recognises the important role extended families play in enhancing settlement outcomes for our valued migrants. While the existing share of the total residence programme has been preserved, enhanced character and sponsorship requirements ensure a transparent and sustainable family residence programme," said Mr Cunliffe.

The changes to family policy.reflect this government’s strong focus on achieving good settlement outcomes for migrants.
