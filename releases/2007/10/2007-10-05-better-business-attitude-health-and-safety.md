Businesses consider the costs of complying with health and safety legislation have improved dramatically over the past five years according to the latest Compliance Cost Survey from KPMG and Business NZ.

Businesses' concerns about the cost of complying with the Health and Safety in Employment Act have dropped from almost 65 per cent in 2003 to 33.5 per cent this year.

Attitudes to health and safety for New Zealand workers are likely to improve with business attitudes towards compliance costs, says Labour Minister Ruth Dyson.

"It is very good to see that businesses feel that complying with health and safety standards is not a burden and that health and safety in the workplace is becoming part of business as usual.”

"The move to four weeks annual leave had been signalled well in advance by the Labour-led government – the Holidays Act 2003 deliberately gave employers several years to prepare for the increase in the minimum annual holiday entitlement from three to four weeks."

The increase to four weeks brings New Zealand into line with Australia and many European countries.

The survey also found that overall, government helpfulness levels are improving.

"I'm pleased to note that the Department of Labour is ranked third most helpful government agency in this survey. This is a good reflection on the Department's efforts to improve its customer service and provide information via its call centre and website."
