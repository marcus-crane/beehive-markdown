Steve Maharey, MP for Palmerston North, said today that he had advised the Prime Minister that he will not be standing in the 2008 election.

Steve Maharey said that he will continue in his current Ministerial roles for now but expects to relinquish them at the time the Prime Minister reshuffles the Cabinet.

Steve Maharey said that his decision to leave politics would allow him to pursue other interests later next year.

“My six terms in politics, three in a variety of Ministerial roles, have been a privilege. I want to thank my family and friends, my staff, the Labour Party, the people of Palmerston North, the staff of the many Ministries I have worked with, and my Parliamentary colleagues for their support through both good and challenging times."
