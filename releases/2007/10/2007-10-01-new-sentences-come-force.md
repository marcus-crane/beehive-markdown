Justice Minister Mark Burton welcomed the addition of three new non-custodial sentences to the courts’ sentencing options that come into force today.

"New Zealand’s prison population is now approaching 8,500 and continued increases are not socially or economically sustainable. Today we take a significant step forward in confronting our rising prison population," said Mark Burton.

The Sentencing Amendment Act 2007 (formerly part of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill) creates three new sentences that can be imposed by the courts from today. The new sentences are:

- home detention – which becomes a sentence in its own right, rather than a way of serving a sentence of imprisonment;
- intensive supervision – a more comprehensive version of the supervision sentence; and
- community detention – an electronically monitored curfew.

“Improvements to the existing sentence of community work have also been made, such as the court being able to authorise up to 20 percent of the hours to be converted into training in basic work and living skills.

“Prison is not always the answer, and from today the courts will have more options to both issue penalties for offending and also to address the causes of an offender’s behaviour. Home detention in particular has high compliance rates, and low reconviction and re-imprisonment rates compared to prison sentences.

“However, let me be clear this Labour-led Government will not back down on its hard line on serious and hardened criminals. These offenders will continue to be sent to prison to protect the public,” said Mark Burton.

Other Criminal Justice Reform Bill changes also came into force today, including the Parole Amendment Act 2007 that;

- makes it clear that parole is a privilege, not a right;
- creates a new residential restrictions condition of parole, similar to home detention;
- gives the Parole Board the power to call witnesses;
- extends to Police the ability to apply for recall of an offender on the grounds that they pose an undue risk to the community;
- allows the Parole Board to receive confidential information where disclosure could prejudice the maintenance of the law or endanger any person’s safety.

“Together, these changes will improve the effectiveness, workability and transparency of our, sentencing and parole provisions. These changes complement the other work being undertaken as part of the Effective Interventions initiatives, such as work on early intervention and crime prevention. This Labour-led Government is committed to addressing crime, and its causes,” said Mark Burton
