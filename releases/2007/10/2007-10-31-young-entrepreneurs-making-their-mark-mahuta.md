“We have much to be proud of in our young people. They are paving the way to a brighter future for all New Zealanders.”

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is praising the skills of the young entrepreneurs who will be honoured in tonight’s Lion Foundation Young Enterprise Awards.

“I know the amount of time and effort that goes into completing a project, so reaching the finals is a fantastic achievement,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The success of the Young Enterprise Scheme (YES) is a result of a healthy partnership between government, through the education sector, and business.”

The secondary school-based initiative provides students with a chance to use their entrepreneurial skills running a business.

“The effort made by schools and the students highlights the importance of working together to create opportunities for young people,” said Nanaia Mahuta

“Our young people are the business leaders of the future so it is critical to ensure they are able to realise their full potential. If, by providing business-like opportunities to all young people, irrespective of their circumstances, makes business a valid career choice, then we are doing something positive.

Indeed our vision as a nation should be that we are the “Thinking Hub” of the Asia-Pacific region. In providing our young people with a chance to pick up business skills, we will go a long way towards achieving our vision.

“Once more, it also helps young people to pick up skills in a field where they may otherwise not have considered. I commend the YES programme, its supporters and students, for providing this opportunity.”
