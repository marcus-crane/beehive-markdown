The Minister Responsible for the National Library Judith Tizard is welcoming Library Week 2007, which kicks off tomorrow around the theme of 'Pass it on; Kia hiwa Ra'.

"Libraries are amazing places where New Zealanders can access an incredible range of printed and digital information. Library Week gives us the opportunity to spread that message and a great excuse for exclusive events to get even more New Zealanders into their local libraries," Judith Tizard said.

"The exchange of information is at the core of how libraries work. We're increasingly seeing fresh ideas emerging from that flow of knowledge."

"Library Week deservedly turns the spotlight on our libraries and librarians, those tireless champions of information and ideas. Public, school, and workplace libraries, along with the National Library, have a critical role to play in helping us all to shift New Zealand to a true knowledge society, a key part of the Labour-led government's transformation agenda."

Library Week is organised by LIANZA, and will be launched at an official function at the National Library at 5.30pm, 15 October.

Library week 2007 will include a dynamic events programme at libraries nationwide. For more information visit www.libraryweek.org.nz.
