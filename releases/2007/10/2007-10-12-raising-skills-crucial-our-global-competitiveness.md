New Zealand must increase its skill base if the country is to maintain its international reputation and enhance its global competitiveness, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Speaking at the Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics of New Zealand Annual Conference in Hamilton, Dr Cullen said “the issues we are facing now require new, more innovative ways of thinking if we are to tackle the challenges of ongoing skill shortages and productivity levels that are not rising quickly enough.

“The skills strategy being developed by the Skills New Zealand Forum – comprising government, Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand representatives – provides us with an excellent means to obtain a thorough understanding of all the challenges, and develop solutions that will result in real progress.

“A core goal of the skills strategy is to use skills development to enable our industries to shift to higher value business models. Eighty per cent of our workforce in 2020 is already in the workforce now. As a result, we must make better use of the current workforce by raising people’s skills and increasing the value of the work that they do, if we are to transform our economy.”

Dr Cullen said taken together, the skills strategy and tertiary education reforms provide a more effective way for institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs), industry training organisations (ITOs), employers and employees to better understand current and future skill needs as well as influence the supply of skills.

“What the new system does is enable ITPs to focus on what is important – student achievement and meeting stakeholder needs, rather than student numbers for the sake of them and the generation of short-term cash flow. Chairs and Councils have a crucial role to play in ensuring their institutions are fundamentally motivated by educational outcomes, and not just the bottom line.

“Another significant opportunity for ITPs is building a more complementary relationship with ITOs – as the voice of stakeholders alongside ITO’s industry leadership role. Both ITPs and ITOs have important roles to play in boosting the skills of people in the workforce and people soon to enter employment. Greater clarity around the respective roles and responsibilities of ITPs and ITOs is also critical to the success of the skills strategy.

“The new way of investing in tertiary education gives us the opportunity to develop a tertiary sector with the capability to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

“It will also ensure that we know just how good our tertiary sector is, and what contribution it is making to New Zealand’s economic transformation.”
