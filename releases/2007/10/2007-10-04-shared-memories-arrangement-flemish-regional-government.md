Prime Minister Helen Clark and Flemish Foreign Policy, Tourism, and Media Minister Geert Bourgeois today signed a shared memories arrangement to ensure the sacrifice made on the Western Front during World War One is properly commemorated.

The Prime Minister is today attending New Zealand’s commemorations for the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele, which is New Zealand’s worst military disaster in terms of lives lost in a single day.

“During battles on 4 and 12 October 1917 more than 1300 young New Zealanders were killed and many more injured. On 12 October alone more than 800 New Zealanders were killed. Loss on this scale is unimaginable today, and had a devastating effect on New Zealand, which at that time had a population of just one million,” Helen Clark said.

“In modern times, Passchendaele has had a lower profile than other important battles such as those at Gallipoli and on the Somme. It is important that this tragic loss of life at Passchendaele and indeed across the Western Front is remembered appropriately. This shared memories arrangement will help in this process.

“It will also support educating younger generations about the sacrifice made by New Zealand soldiers on Flemish soil. Given the scale of New Zealand’s losses in this region, Flanders has special significance for us. Links between our country and this region should be sustained.

“It is very moving to see at first hand how New Zealand’s participation in the Battle of Passchendaele is remembered and honoured with respect by the people of Flanders,” Helen Clark said.

Under the Belgian constitution, the Flemish regional government has the delegated authority to sign international agreements.

Helen Clark said the Shared Memories Arrangement will keep memories of wartime sacrifice alive, and provide a closer and official link between the New Zealand Government and the Flemish regional government.

The arrangement requires the parties to:  
•Increase understanding and recognition of the shared history of the wars of the twentieth century  
•Honour the dead and ensure the preservation of historic and commemorative sites  
•Conserve and maintain shared war heritage material.

This is the second shared memories arrangement New Zealand has signed, and follows a similar one signed with France in 2004.
