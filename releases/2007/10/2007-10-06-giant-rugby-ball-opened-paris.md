Prime Minister Helen Clark today opened the giant Rugby Ball Venue under the Eiffel Tower in Paris which will showcase New Zealand trade and tourism.

Helen Clark said that the initiative is one of many which will promote New Zealand as a place to live, work, visit, do business with, and invest in – in the lead up to New Zealand hosting the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

“This year’s Rugby World Cup is attracting strong international interest. In the lead up to the final in Paris in two weeks time, the giant Rugby Ball Venue will attract its share of attention for New Zealand. This initiative follows earlier successful offshore leveraging activities for New Zealand, such as those around the Lord of the Rings movies and this year’s America's Cup.

“In the day time, this New-Zealand themed venue will be open to the public, promoting New Zealand tourism, businesses, culture, lifestyle, food and wine, and technology.

"In the evenings, it will become the hub for New Zealand-hosted trade and industry events, exhibitions, big screen viewing, functions and meetings, taking the best of NZ Inc. to the world.

“It has been a coup to secure such a high profile spot in central Paris. We are very grateful for the help and support of the Parisian authorities, in particular the Mayor of Paris Mr Bertrand Delanoe.

“The 12 metre high and 25 metre long structure will stand on the Champs de Mars, close to the Eiffel Tower. Over 40,000 people are expected to experience a "virtual" New Zealand by visiting the venue while in Paris, but many more will pass by. Last year, 6.7 million people visited the Eiffel Tower.

"All the events held at the venue will be aimed at increasing trade and tourism revenues, and attracting new investment partners and highly skilled foreign migrants, while other activities will look to celebrate New Zealand culture and sporting success.

“The giant rugby ball venue will be available to travel to other events promoting New Zealand as host of the Rugby World Cup 2011,” Helen Clark said.
