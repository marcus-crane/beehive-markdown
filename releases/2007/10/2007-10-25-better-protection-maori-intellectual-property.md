A good understanding of intellectual property rights and responsibilities is essential for all New Zealanders, particularly to people in the creative and cultural sectors. The Government aims to see better education and resources on IP and is also seeking to ensure greater protection for traditional knowledge.

“All New Zealanders, especially Maori will benefit from this work programme,” Judith Tizard, Associate Minister of Commerce said today.

Ms Tizard was marking the release of Te Mana Taumaru Mâtauranga, a Ministry of Economic Development publication to assist Mâori organisations, communities and advisers to build their understanding of intellectual property rights and the implications of those rights for mâtauranga Mâori (Mâori traditional knowledge).

“Intellectual property rights are about fostering economic growth for all New Zealanders. They are economic assets that both protect and enable sharing of creative efforts, giving Mâori entrepreneurs, artists, and communities a means of realising the economic and cultural potential of their knowledge, innovations and practices,” Ms Tizard said.

“Intellectual property rights can have a role in protecting aspects of mâtauranga Mâori and Mâori cultural expressions from misuse, but it can also pose risks for mâtauranga Mâori and the holders of that knowledge. It’s important that Mâori understand how to use the system to their advantage and also understand its limitations.”

The Ministry of Economic Development's recent series of regional hui on intellectual property and traditional knowledge revealed that these issues are alive in New Zealand, where indigenous and local communities are seeking to preserve and promote their culture in ways that maintain respect and integrity.

“These issues also have a significant international dimension. Misuse of traditional knowledge and cultural expression, in particular of Mâori taonga, can occur overseas. We have recently seen the use of ta moko in overseas fashion shows, and a French security company branding its business by calling it Mâori Security,” Ms Tizard said.

The guide covers the full range of intellectual property rights from trade marks and patents, to performers’ rights and copyright, and forms a key part of the Government’s traditional knowledge work programme, being run by the Ministry of Economic Development.

“I hope this guide will be a valuable and practical tool for Mâori and will encourage all people to participate in the Ministry's ongoing work on the development of intellectual property rights and the protection of traditional knowledge” Ms Tizard said.
