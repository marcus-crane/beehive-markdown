The launch of the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (NZEECS) is great news for families, drivers, business and efforts to tackle climate change, says the Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons.

Highlights include:

- Up to 180,000 insulation, clean heat or solar hot water upgrades
- More work to improve the efficiency of appliances to realise cumulative savings worth $2.7 billion for Kiwi consumers by 2025
- Over $8 million for energy efficiency programmes to improve the competitiveness of business; including the primary production and tourism sectors, and to boost the uptake of wood for heating
- A new target to improve the fuel economy of vehicles entering the fleet by around 25 per cent, saving 441 million litres of fuel, by 2015
- Increased emphasis on transport demand management and clear priority given to public transport and walking and cycling

"This is an action plan to make a real difference to Kiwi families so that they can live in warmer, drier, healthier homes that cost less to heat; for business to become more competitive; and to save money and emissions in the transport sector,” says Jeanette Fitzsimons.

"The Strategy is set to deliver annual non-transport energy savings of 30 PetaJoules per year by 2025. That’s the same as the electricity used by 30 cities the size of Nelson in 2006 or 18 months of coal-fired production from Huntly, at 2006 levels. In transport, cumulative savings by 2025 will be around 4.8 billion litres of fuel.

"Energy efficiency and conservation programmes represent great value for money. Our commercial programmes demonstrate good business nous and between 2001 and 2005 delivered $88 million in energy savings. But the benefits also extend to health and air quality improvements and emissions savings. A recent study found a combined health and energy savings return of $2.20 for every dollar spent on home energy efficiency retrofits.

"But we must see this strategy as just the start. More investment and the involvement of all New Zealanders will be needed over time if we are to make the most of the potential savings on offer," Jeanette Fitzsimons says.
