The first part of a new government initiative to support increased capability and capacity among New Zealand’s Mâori Wardens took place in Wellington today.

In Budget 2007 the Labour-led Government announced a $2.5 million investment in Mâori Wardens to better support them in making a difference in their communities, especially with Mâori youth. The Government specifically highlighted establishing nationally-consistent training and support, said Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

As the first part of this, a group of 24 Mâori Wardens from Auckland, Hastings, Northland, Rotorua and Waikato gathered at the Police College in Porirua this morning for a specially developed intensive three-day training course.

The delivery of this module is the first part of a wider training initiative which will see non-Police providers delivering a further seven days training to each warden over the coming year, Mr Horomia said.

The participating wardens were joined at their official welcome and pôwhiri by Mr Horomia, New Zealand First MP Pita Paraone, whose party has been strongly supporting of the initiative and Te Puni Kôkiri (TPK) Chief Executive Leith Comer.

“Mâori Wardens are playing a hugely valuable role in our communities and this training is part of a comprehensive plan being implemented by TPK to better equip them for the challenges they face. TPK is being supported by an expert advisory group which includes members of the Mâori Council and the wardens’ association.

“Further training is being developed that targets other areas needed to support Mâori Wardens in their day to day work,” Mr Horomia said.

The government’s investment will also improve wardens’ resources, including vehicles, communications and uniforms; as well as working towards an improved governance structure for wardens.

“We think all of this will help attract new recruits to the Mâori Wardens. Bolstering the numbers of wardens is another goal of this project,” the Minister says.
