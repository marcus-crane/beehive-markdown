"As New Zealanders we can be proud that our workers were among the first in the world to claim this right back in 1840, through the efforts of  
Samuel Parnell in Wellington," says Labour Minister Ruth Dyson.

"Labour Day on 22 October is also a day for many New Zealanders to take time off work to be with their family and friends."

Ruth Dyson says the Labour-led government has introduced policies and initiatives designed to support working families and encourage flexible working environments that meet the needs of workers, unions and businesses.

"Our government has brought in 4 weeks annual leave as a minimum this year, we've extended Paid Parental Leave to 14 weeks and increased the  
maximum weekly amount payable. We've increased the Working For Families payments and introduced 20 hours free Early Childhood Education.

"In addition we are supporting Sue Kedgley's Flexible Working Arrangements Bill and the Department of Labour has been running work-life balance  
projects and conducting research into flexible working hours.

"The result of the Department’s research has been to find that a lot of employers are already offering flexible working hours and those that aren't, usually want to, but need some guidance or ideas about how to go about it. The Department of Labour is offering case studies on its website so that workplaces can see how others have gone about doing it."

The Department together with business groups and unions have also been running workplace productivity seminars and offer a Workplace Productivity Toolkit to help workplaces achieve their business goals more efficiently rather than working longer hours.
