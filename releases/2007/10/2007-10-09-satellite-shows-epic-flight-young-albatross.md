The epic journey of three northern royal albatross is well underway, with satellite tracking showing one of the young birds has already travelled more than 700km.

“Toroa”, a northern royal albatross chick named by Conservation Minister Chris Carter in a special ceremony earlier this year, is now 550km off the coast of New Zealand and heading east into the Pacific Ocean.

Toroa was the 500th chick to fledge at Taiaroa Head/Pukekura Nature Reserve in Otago Harbour during the past breeding season, the second most successful year in the reserve’s 70-year breeding history.

Toroa and the other two young albatross are fitted with lightweight transmitters which track their position by satellite every six hours. The PhD project by Massey University scientist Bindi Thomas will provide a fascinating insight into the first year of the young birds’ lives as they begin up to seven years at sea. It may also help identify the times and areas that pose a risk to the birds from activities such as longline fishing.

“This research will give us important information on what is one of the most solitary and amazing journeys in the animal kingdom,” Mr Carter said.

“Hopefully, all three young birds will eventually return to Taiaroa Head after their years of wandering and successfully raise their own chicks.”

All 23 albatross chicks hatched at the reserve this past season successfully fledged and the northern royals’ breeding cycle at Taiaroa Head continues. Another 28 adult birds have already arrived on the headland with between 20 and 25 breeding pairs expected this season.

Toroa flew up the coast of New Zealand as far as Oamaru before heading east into the Pacific. Toroa, who fledged late last month, got a head start on the other two birds and has flown 700km so far.
