The Department of Corrections is well prepared for new community sentences which come into effect today, said Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor.

The Minister was referring to the Sentencing Amendment Act 2007 (formerly part of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill) which will see three new sentences becoming available to the courts from today. The new sentences are part of the government's [Effective Interventions package](http://www.justice.govt.nz/effective_interventions/home.asp) introduced last year and include home detention as a stand alone sentence, community detention and intensive supervision.

The Department of Corrections is implementing and managing the new services.

"The Department’s Community Probation & Psychological Services (CPPS) is well through the process of recruiting 300 additional staff to implement the new sentences and to add extra support to its overall operations," said Mr O'Connor.

Training for staff who will manage the new sentences will continue until the end of October. Around 6500 days training will be delivered by the end of October.

Mr O'Connor said Effective Interventions was designed to make the community safer while ensuring a more sensible use of our prisons.

"Obviously for serious criminals and repeat offenders, prison will always be the only option, but the new sentences will give judges greater options to deal with those who have committed lower level offences," said Mr O'Connor.

Mr O'Connor said the Effective Interventions package also greatly increased resources for the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration back into the community.

"New resources include funding for two new drug and alcohol treatment units in prisons, one of which I will open tomorrow afternoon at Rimutaka Prison, plus two special treatment units to deliver a 300-hour rehabilitation programme for high risk offenders. These programmes are shown to improve community safety by reducing the chances of re-offending. By the middle of next year, 550 prisoners per year will have access to Corrections' six highly intensive six-month-long drug and alcohol treatment programmes.

"Over time the Effective Interventions package should lower the rate of offending, including recidivism, which will make the community safer. This Labour-led government is committed to a society where all families, young and old are safe and secure. These changes highlight this commitment," said Mr O'Connor.
