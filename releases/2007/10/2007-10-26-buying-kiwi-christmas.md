New Zealanders can make it a real Kiwi Christmas if they Buy Kiwi Made this holiday season, Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made says.

The Buy Kiwi Christmas message launches this Sunday with a revised television commercial that still features assembly of the robotic Oliver Driver.

“I know Christmas shopping may be the last thing on most people’s minds right now, but we know that retailers are already stocked up for Christmas,” Ms Bradford says.

“It’s important to remind people to think about their purchasing decisions from the Christmas turkey and chutneys to the jandals and frisbees they’ll be shopping for this summer and making sure they’re Kiwi made.”

The Buy Kiwi Made media campaign is already affecting manufacturers with the membership of the Buy NZ Made Campaign Ltd already jumping by a third to more than 800 members.

“We’ve been delighted to see so many more manufacturers labelling their goods as made in New Zealand,” she says. “This can only help consumers to identify these goods instore.”

Retailers are being encouraged to develop instore displays and Buy Kiwi Made promotions. “We want to see retailers get behind the idea of the Buy Kiwi Christmas and come up with some creative displays or promotions of their own,” Ms Bradford says.

Buy NZ Made has recently launched an online product locator at [www.buynz.org.nz](http://www.buynz.org.nz) where consumers can identify manufacturers of New Zealand made products who are members of Buy NZ Made and able to use the ‘kiwi in a triangle’ logo.
