The Ministry of Health and the Health Research Council of New Zealand have received results on the review of the Hauora Māori Scholarship Programme, which aimed to examine the programmes contribution to the development of the Māori health and disability workforce.

Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui is delighted with the results of the review.

“The Hauora Māori Scholarship Programme is a proven success. This report shows the programme makes a significant contribution to strengthening the Māori health and disability workforce, which contributes to improved health outcomes for Māori and for all other people in New Zealand,” he said.

"We know that trained Māori clinicians and other health professionals, managers, community, voluntary workers and researchers are crucial to the health and disability sector’s capacity to deliver effective services to whānau. The students receiving Hauora Māori scholarships epitomise the skilled and high calibre workforce we aim to build for New Zealand,” Hon Mita Ririnui said.

Recent statistics released by the Ministry of Health confirm more Māori are now working in most of the registered occupations, including medical practitioners, registered nurses, registered midwives, medical radiation technologists, dietitians and chiropractors.

However, under-representation of Māori in the workforce is evident in almost every domain of health. This situation could potentially limit the advances and improvements the Ministry seeks in the delivery of services to Māori as well as all other people in New Zealand.

The Hauora Māori Scholarship Programme has been proven to make a substantial contribution to the Māori health and disability workforce through growing capacity and capability by reducing financial barriers to tertiary study and improving entry, retention and completion rates.
