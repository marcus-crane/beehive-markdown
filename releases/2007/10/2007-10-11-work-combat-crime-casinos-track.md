Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today outlined the progress being made to combat undesired casino related activity and crime.

Internal Affairs has conducted a strategic assessment of the broader crime issues associated with casinos and set out a framework for limiting opportunities for crime and criminality in casinos.

"I am very pleased with the ongoing work in his area, across a number of departments, aimed at preventing casino related crime," Mr Barker said.

"We are involved in discussions with a number of organisations to create a more integrated approach to dealing with crime in casinos. This includes the NZ Police, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice, Commerce Commission, Gambling Commission and NGOs with an interest in the area.

"The Department is contributing to a policy process led by the Ministry of Justice relating to the development of anti-money laundering legislation that will meet the international standard set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), of which New Zealand is a member.

"An Organised Crime Agency (OCA) framework has been developed and Internal Affairs contributed information to ensure criminal activity in casinos is considered in the establishment of the OCA.

"I am encouraged by the amount of progress in this area and would like to acknowledge all the Departments involved and the casinos themselves for their co-operation.

"There is still work to be done but I am confident, given the good levels of co-operation from both the public and the private sector, that we are taking the right approach to ensure casinos are safer and free from criminal or undesirable activity," Mr Barker said.
