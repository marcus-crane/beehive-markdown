Transport Minister Annette King says the Land Transport Amendment Bill, tabled in Parliament today, provides tougher laws for people who drive under the influence of illegal drugs and greater protection of personal information held on the Motor Vehicle Register.

Ms King says there was considerable public concern expressed about drugged drivers in the See You There – Safe As consultation campaign last year, and the Bill introduces a compulsory roadside impairment test.

Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven says: “The penalties for this new offence have been aligned with the penalties for drink driving, sending a clear message to people who think that they can get away with drugged driving. The new compulsory roadside test will give the police greater powers to catch these people.”

Ms King said the Bill also aims to improve protection of personal information held on the Motor Vehicle Register. The Register is administered by Land Transport New Zealand and contains the names and addresses of all persons and organisations registered as owners of motor vehicles.

“In the past, the system has been open to abuse. For example, angry motorists in the aftermath of road rage incidents have used the register to trace and harass the other driver. Professional car thieves have also used the register to target high value cars. Owners of motor vehicles have also been subjected to unwanted approaches from direct marketers,” said Ms King.

“The Bill removes the current obligation of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles to release information to anyone who asks for it. Instead requests for information will be dealt with either under the Official Information Act or through an authorised-access procedure.”

Mr Duynhoven says the Bill also implements measures to improve the quality of owner information held on the Motor Vehicle Register by tightening up current requirements to register change of ownership and dealing with the problem of vehicles with no known owner.
