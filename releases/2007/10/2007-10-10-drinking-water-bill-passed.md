New Drinking Water Legislation

Every New Zealander has the right to clean, safe drinking water, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

A bill to protect and promote this right has been passed in Parliament today.

The Health (Drinking Water) Amendment Bill introduces a risk management approach to drinking-water supplies with the maximum acceptable level of contaminants prescribed by drinking water standards.

Until now drinking-water quality has been managed principally by testing compliance with drinking water standards.

This new approach emphasises the identification and management of risks throughout the water supply system.

“This Bill is essential to all our health, our economy and our reputation has a clean green country.”

“At the present time there are over 500,000 Kiwis receiving water from supplies that do not comply with the New Zealand Drinking Water Standards,” said Pete Hodgson.

“The new legislation, together with funding of over $150 million to assist drinking water suppliers and local government, seeks to ensure every New Zealander can access clean drinking water.”

The main duty in the legislation is a requirement for drinking water suppliers to take all practicable steps to comply with the drinking water standards.

“Many New Zealanders may be surprised to learn that that prior to this Bill drinking water standards were completely voluntary,” Pete Hodgson said.

The legislation brings New Zealand into line with other developed countries that have minimum safety standards in law.

“I encourage all suppliers to make use of the government’s free technical assistance programme to ensure that they make the best use of their existing resources and avoid expensive and unnecessary upgrades,” Pete Hodgson said.

Frequently asked questions:

Who is the legislation aimed at?

•The legislation is aimed at suppliers that supply water to other properties through pipes or water tankers. It does not affect self-suppliers, that is, people or properties that obtain their own water from bores, rain-water tanks, or other such sources. Self-suppliers will continue to be governed primarily by the Building Act.

Who will be affected?

•The legislation also will not affect suppliers that supply a permanent population of less than around 16 people.

How does it work?

•The legislation signifies a move away from focusing on compliance or non-compliance, towards a risk management approach. Suppliers are required to take all practicable steps to comply, and if the supplier is implementing a public health risk management plan, they are deemed to be taking all practicable steps to comply.

What about water supplies not meant for humans?

•Special provision is made for supplies that provide water for both agricultural and drinking water purposes, to ensure that they are not forced to make fit for humans water that is only going to animals or crops.

When does the legislation commence?

The legislation will commence on 1 July 2008.

Dates for compliance with legal duties are staggered depending on the size of the supplier, and give smaller and some rural supplies longer to comply.

Large supplies serving over 10,000 people need to start complying with the duties by 1 July 2009, and most of these supplies are largely in compliance already.

The smallest supplies (serving 16 – 100 people) have until 1 July 2013 to comply. Rural supplies that supply both drinking water and water for commercial agriculture also have until this later date to comply. There are intermediate dates set out in the legislation for those supplies falling in between these size ranges.

Is financial assistance available?

The Government has already approved over $2 million of capital assistance funding for drinking water suppliers. There will be further announcements the end of each 6 month funding round.
