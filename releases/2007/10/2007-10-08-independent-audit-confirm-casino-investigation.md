An independent, accredited testing company has been engaged to audit Christchurch Casino’s gaming machines monitoring system, Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker, announced today.

“Extensive investigations by the Department of Internal Affairs found no evidence of misappropriation or ‘skimming’ of gaming machine funds,” Mr Barker said.

“The Department is confident its investigations have been robust but I have also asked for a further independent audit to give the public absolute certainty and to confirm the integrity of the casino’s monitoring system.

BMM Testlabs of Melbourne will investigate whether the casino’s DACOM system or records have been tampered with. It is expected to report its findings by the end of the month.

Two former senior casino managers, Stephen Lyttelton and Peter Arbuckle, made a range of allegations against the casino including loan sharking, prize draw fixing, skimming of gaming machine funds, money laundering and illegal staff gambling.

“Despite making their allegations with a full fanfare of publicity these two men have declined to co-operate with the Department or make themselves available for the Police to interview and have not supplied any hard evidence to support their claims.

"Christchurch Casino on the other hand was very co-operative, providing the Department with information it was not obliged to supply," Mr Barker said.

The Department has completed its investigations and confirmed the findings of its original report that the allegations could not be substantiated. The original investigations found:

- Loan sharking generally occurs away from the casino but can be linked to casino gamblers. Money lending, however, is widespread especially amongst VIP patrons.
- No evidence to support allegations of prize draw fixing or misappropriation of gaming machine funds.
- Allegations of money laundering and illegal staff gambling required the informants to supply specific details to progress the investigation.
