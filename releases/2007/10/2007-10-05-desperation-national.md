Various statements from the National Party and their allies today show their growing desperation, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said.

Wayne Mapp, Heather Roy and Tony Ryall have today all put out various statements that conveniently leave out crucial information, Pete Hodgson said.

“As minister I am required to deal in facts and the fact is none of the statements put out today are anything more than a hapless attempt to divert attention from failed discussion document launches.”

So let’s take a look at some basic facts:

Heather Roy has missed the point of DHBNZ entirely, Pete Hodgson said.

“Having one organisation working on behalf of almost all DHBs actually reduces the amount of bureaucracy,” Pete Hodgson said.

“Similarly Mr Mapp’s press release about North Shore Hospital conveniently leaves out the fact that Waitemata DHB has stated there was no intention to close the emergency centre on the weekend,” Pete Hodgson said.

Mr Mapp has asked where the fix is.

“Well Mr Mapp the fix is having affordable primary health care that every New Zealander can access in order to help them maintain their health.”

“Clearly the National Party’s policy would allow GP fees to increase and that would simply send more people through the doors of already busy A and E departments.”

Meanwhile Tony Ryall has been telling half truths about cancer waiting times.

Cancer treatment wait times are prioritised to ensure that those with the most urgent needs are treated within four weeks and we know in June this year (the last month for which data is available) 100 percent of patients in the most urgent category received it within the four week timeframe.
