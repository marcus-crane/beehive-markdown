Kiwi families planning a camping holiday this summer will have new camping sites to choose from, says Conservation Minister Chris Carter.

After a review by the Department of Conservation last year found a decline in camping opportunities due to rising land prices, DoC has drawn up a list of 100 potential camping spots on land it administers.

Four will open this summer and a fifth by mid-year.

“Rises in land values in recent years has led to coastal land in particular being sold for residential development but the Labour-led government wants to ensure that the tradition of the kiwi camping holiday is preserved,” Mr Carter said.

One new site is at Canaan Downs at Takaka adjoining popular Abel Tasman National Park. It will accommodate around 50 people in an area popular with mountain bikers, trampers and cavers. Canaan Downs is the main accessway to the 176m marble shaft known as Harwood’s Hole.

“Canaan Downs is central to some of the South Island’s most popular holiday spots including the Abel Tasman, Kahurangi National Park and Golden Bay and is well worth a stopover for anyone just wanting a lovely spot to camp,” Mr Carter said.

A number of campgrounds have already been upgraded by DoC including Uretiti Beach near Whangarei, Mavora Lake in Southland and Purakaunui Bay in Otago.

Also opening by mid-year are:  
•Moawhitu on D’Urville Island in the Marlborough Sounds, a recent Nature Heritage Fund purchase and a coastal campsite opening in December  
•Moturua Island in the Bay of Islands, popular with kayakers with safe anchorage and safe swimming beaches. Campsite upgrade and picnic areas and tracks upgraded. Due to open in February next year  
•Ox Bow Kiripapango campsite on the banks of the Ngaruroro River in Kaweka Forest Park, about 100km from Napier or Hastings. Opening in December  
•On the edge of Lake Arapuni, 45km from Tokoroa. An area with few camping opportunities and popular with boaties and anglers. Due to open in the middle of next year  
•An extension to the campground at Port Jackson at the far tip of Coromandel Peninsula. The current 350 person capacity will be increased by around 100
