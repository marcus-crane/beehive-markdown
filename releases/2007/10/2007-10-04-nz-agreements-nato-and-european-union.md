Prime Minister Helen Clark today signed agreements for New Zealand to share classified information with NATO and to help train Afghanistan police officers.

The signing ceremonies took place during Helen Clark’s visit to Brussels.

The first agreement, signed by Helen Clark and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, formalises arrangements for New Zealand and NATO to share classified information.

“New Zealand and NATO have a shared interest in peace, security, and development. The ability to exchange information is critical to practical cooperation and for example, will help enhance the safety of our personnel deployed in Afghanistan.

”This agreement allows New Zealand and NATO personnel to share expertise and improve our ability to work alongside each other.

“We first worked with NATO in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. Cooperation has expanded since then. New Zealand and NATO are now both working together, assisting the Afghan government to build peace by improving security and facilitating development throughout Afghanistan,” Helen Clark said.

The second agreement sees New Zealand join the European Union’s police mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL) to improve the standard of the Afghan police force.  
“The security situation in Afghanistan remains of major concern. Improving the capacity and capability of Afghan police is crucial to the country’s long-term stability and development.

“In joining EUPOL, New Zealand will work in conjunction with the EU, United States, and other national policing missions to improve harmonisation and standardisation of police practice in Afghanistan,” Helen Clark said.

“New Zealand Police maintains a deployment of three officers in Afghanistan attached to the New Zealand provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Bamyan.

“The team provides one officer in a mentoring role for the provincial police chief and other senior Afghan police, and two to oversee training in the Bamyan regional training centre (RTC).

“New Zealand officers have worked in conjunction with both EUPOL’s predecessor mission, led by Germany, and with the US police programme. Transfer to the EUPOL operational control does not require any significant change to the New Zealand Police’s current roles, or any additional funding.

“New Zealand’s assistance to Afghanistan, both military and development, is more than NZ$160 million and our Defence Force deployments in Afghanistan total around 130 personnel.

“NZAID funds a mix of national and provincial assistance programmes, with a focus on human rights, women, alternative rural livelihoods, education and health care,” Helen Clark said.
