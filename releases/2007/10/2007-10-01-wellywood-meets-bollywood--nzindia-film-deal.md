Prime Minister and Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark, and Minister of Finance Michael Cullen today announced that New Zealand and India have agreed to negotiate a film co-production agreement.

Dr Cullen is currently visiting New Delhi.

"The aim of the proposed film co-production agreement is to expand and facilitate film co-production to benefit film makers in both countries, and to develop cultural and economic exchanges”, Helen Clark said.

“There is good potential for co-operation between the Indian and New Zealand industries. Many Indian screen productions have used New Zealand as a location in recent years. We now want to build on those connections to help make screen productions which are genuine partnerships between the two countries.

"Under the proposed treaty, filmmakers from both countries would be able to pool resources to create films which will benefit both countries financially and culturally," Michael Cullen said.

"Films made jointly by New Zealand and Indian producers would qualify as works with national status in both countries, making them eligible for government support and facilitation," Michael Cullen said.

“I hope that such an agreement will encourage film-makers to share their energies and resources for the benefit of both countries, and I look forward to seeing the results,” Helen Clark said.
