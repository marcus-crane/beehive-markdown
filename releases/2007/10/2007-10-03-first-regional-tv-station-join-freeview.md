Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today launched Triangle Stratos, the first regional television channel to become a national digital free-to-air channel on Freeview.

“This marks the second new digital TV channel to be officially launched on Freeview, and it’s also the second to start this week after TVNZ 6 was launched last Sunday.

“More than 41,000 households will be able to watch Stratos, after buying set-top boxes to watch free to air digital TV on Freeview. Freeview is a group of free-to-air broadcasters leading the move to digital, including Television New Zealand, CanWest, Maori TV, Radio New Zealand, and now Stratos.

“Stratos will have a range of programming, ranging from community and regional programmes from New Zealand, to coverage from international news sources, including Al Jazeera and Deutsche Welle.

"The Labour-led government has committed $25 million over the next five years to support the development of free-to-air digital television by Freeview. Broadcasters will also have access to free digital frequencies.

"The digital shift gives public and free-to-air broadcasting a secure future, making sure New Zealanders will always see their own stories and other local content on our screens. Building national identity through digital television is one of this government’s key priorities.”
