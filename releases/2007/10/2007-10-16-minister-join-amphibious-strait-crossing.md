Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard is to support kiwi company Sealegs International Ltd in its attempt to create a new record - crossing the Cook Strait in its new 7.1m amphibious boat.

"Sealegs is a fantastic example of an innovative kiwi exporter that is already grabbing international attention with its amphibious RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat). I am really excited to be part of its planned attempt to cross the Cook Strait on October 31," Trevor Mallard said.

"I've crossed the Cook Strait many times - either by ferry or by air. But the Sealegs experience will be unique. It’s not every day you get to drive down the beach into the sea and then drive up onto the beach at the other end without, so I’m assured, getting your feet wet."

The company has received co-funding from government economic development agency New Zealand Trade and Enterprise for the development and commercialisation of its craft, further market development and intellectual property protection.

"The Sealegs concept was originally met with a lot of disbelief, but the owners have shown how tenacity, commitment and a good deal of kiwi ingenuity and new thinking can turn a business into a successful international enterprise," Trevor Mallard said.

The crossing set down for a 7am start, will leave from Okukari bay on Arapawa Island and the Sealegs RIB is expected to drive up on the beach at Cable Bay, near Makara around 30 minutes later. For the record attempt, Sealegs will use its new-generation 7.1m Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB), which can comfortably seat up to 8 adults and has a payload of 700kg.

Back in 2005, a Sealegs 5.6m RIB driven by company founder Maurice Bryham staked its place in the Guinness Book of Records when it shattered the English Channel record mark for an amphibious vehicle completing the 21 nautical miles from Dover to Calais in 43mins 12secs. This halved the previous record of 1hr 40mins 6secs set a year earlier by UK entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson.
