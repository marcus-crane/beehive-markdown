John Key's short-term memory loss in regard to his comments on Iraq are assuming legendary proportions, Defence Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Mr Key’s comment today on BFM Breakfast that he had said on Morning Report yesterday that the invasion of Iraq – not the war – is over, is clearly contradicted by the transcript of what he actually said.

“On Morning Report, he responded to a question on why there was no mention of Iraq in National’s foreign affairs and defence policy document by saying: ‘frankly, the war in Iraq is over’. Yet, today he said: ‘Oh well I was never suggesting that there isn't a conflict and it's not ongoing. I was asked a question specifically about the invasion’.”

“His denials today are clearly inaccurate, just as his recollection that he never supported the war contradicts his position in 2003. Then he and the National Party voted in Parliament in favour of the war and he told his local newspaper that he supported sending troops to Iraq.

"John Key should simply acknowledge that he got it wrong rather than continually trying to deny what he is on record as saying.

"John Key aspires to be Prime Minister, yet within 24 hours he has not only contradicted himself but has denied what he is clearly on the record as saying.”
