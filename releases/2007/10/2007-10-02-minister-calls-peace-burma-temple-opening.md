Today’s opening of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist temple in Manukau was an appropriate occasion to express concern over human rights abuses in other parts of the world and in particular Burma, Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said.

“This remarkable temple, the largest of its kind in New Zealand, will be a place of peace and a centre where the promotion of Buddhist teachings will be available to everyone,” Mr Carter said.

“In contrast, the peaceful efforts of Buddhist monks in Burma to bring democracy to that country have been met with violence and repression.

“I have met with Burmese community leaders and given them an assurance that the New Zealand government is committed to doing everything we can to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in their country,” Mr Carter said.

Mr Carter also delivered a message from Prime Minister Helen Clark at the opening.

Helen Clark said the temple stood as a symbol of New Zealand’s emerging identity as a true multi-cultural and multi-ethnic country.

“I hope that this will be a place where our diverse communities are able to come together, exchange ideas and to learn from each other in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and respect.”

She had raised the situation in Burma during a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and would later this week discuss how the international community could respond.

Mr Carter said there were more than 200 Fo Guang Shan Temples in over 170 countries but the size and beauty of this temple had taken many years of hard work.

““It is a remarkable experience to see this temple in Auckland. Visiting it and taking part in some of the activities it offers is one way for New Zealanders to grow in understanding and respect for different cultures and learn more about the Buddhist faith with its messages of compassion, serving and caring for one’s community and going about one’s daily life peacefully.”
