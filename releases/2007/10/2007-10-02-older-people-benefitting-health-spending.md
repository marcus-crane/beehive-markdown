Cheaper GP visits have older people visiting their doctor more often, Minister of Health Pete Hodgson said.

An independent evaluation of the Primary Health Care Strategy released last week showed older people recorded a 24 percent increase consultation rates.

“What this shows is that cost is a huge barrier to accessing primary health care and by removing that barrier you improve people’s access to vital services,” Pete Hodgson said.

“It is very gratifying to see such an increase for older New Zealanders because they are arguably at greatest risk of having poor health.

“We know that if we can get more people to see a health professional more often, they are likely to have better health as a result.”

As a result of subsidies reducing the cost of visiting a doctor an older couple now pay approximately $360 a year to see a GP, a reduction of more than $400 per year.

“This government is committed to having a health service that is affordable in order to encourage people to use services proactively to stay well.”
