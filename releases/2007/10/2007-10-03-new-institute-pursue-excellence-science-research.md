A new research institute officially opened today at Massey University’s Albany campus will bring together elite scientists from across disciplines to foster world-leading research, says Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

“The New Zealand Institute for Advanced Study (NZIAS) joins a global network of such organisations and will involve scientists working across disciplines in maths, chemistry, physics, ecology and molecular biology.

“The institute will specialise in theoretical science, and will explore fundamental questions to expand our scientific knowledge.”

Theoretical scientists provide theories that explain phenomena; well known theories include the Big Bang theory, Newton’s gravitation theory and Einstein’s theory of relativity.

“New Zealand has a strong history of excellence in theoretical sciences, and this institute will make sure we stay at the cutting edge of this kind of research.

“In the past, New Zealand mathematicians have helped pave the way for the prediction of natural disasters and to model the spread of epidemics, and therefore the development of appropriate vaccination programmes.”

The NZIAS has secured five founding members, who are world-class scientists with international distinction for work in molecular biology, evolution, mathematics, physics, ecology and chemistry.

The founding members include two recipients of this year’s Marsden Fund, Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin and Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger, and also Distinguished Professor Dave Lambert, Professor Victor Flambaum and Professor Paul Rainey.

“The New Zealand Institute for Advanced Study will increase international linkages in our science community and will raise Massey University and New Zealand’s profile in theoretical science.”
