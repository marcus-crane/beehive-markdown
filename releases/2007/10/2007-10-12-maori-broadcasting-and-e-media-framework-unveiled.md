Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced the government’ policy settings for Mâori broadcasting have been expanded to recognise the importance of e-Media.  
The announcement of a new Mâori broadcasting and e-Media Outcomes Framework was made to stakeholders at a hui in Wellington and is part of the Labour-led government’s economic transformation agenda. It also continues the ongoing drive to enrich our national identity, Mr Horomia said.  
“The framework sets out clear outcomes for the sector to provide a consistent and coherent approach to developing Mâori broadcasting and other electronic media.”  
The term e-media has been adopted as it refers to both analogue and digital broadcasting and extends to electronic equipment such as television, radio, internet, telephone, desktop computer, game console and handheld devices.  
The expanded policy settings identify objectives, principles, long term and intermediate outcomes for Mâori broadcasting and other electronic media. They aim to ensure a continued presence of Mâori language and culture in the digital environment, and to support Mâori participation in the innovation economy, Mr Horomia said.  
The framework aligns to related work streams across government such as the Digital Strategy, the Public Broadcasting Programme of Action and, of course, the Mâori Language Strategy.  
“Te Reo Mâori and tikanga remain an important focus for government. We want to make Mâori language and culture accessible to all New Zealanders.”  
“We are doing our bit to facilitate the expansion of opportunities across Mâori broadcasting. That’s why we made such a significant new investment of $27.1 million in Budget 2007 into the sector.”  
Broadcasting and e-Media offers many opportunities for iwi as both information and educational tools to support language revitalisation across communities.  
“Broadcasting and e-Media will also become increasingly important in enabling access to information for decision-making among whânau and communities about the issues they face,” Mr Horomia said.  
“At the same time we want to support those working in the sector to continue to develop skills that place them at the leading edge of the innovation economy.”

Questions and Answers

1.What are the benefits of the Mâori Broadcasting and e-Media Outcomes Framework (Outcomes Framework)?

The Outcomes Framework sets out clear outcomes for the sector to provide a consistent and coherent approach to the development of Mâori broadcasting and other electronic media.

2.Why is electronic media included as part of the Outcomes Framework?

The policy settings for Mâori broadcasting have been expanded to include digital broadcasting and other electronic media to ensure a continued presence of Mâori language and culture in the digital environment, and to support Mâori participation in the innovation economy.

3.How will the Outcomes Framework contribute to Mâori language revitalisation?

One of the long term outcomes of the Outcomes Framework is to increase Mâori language use and proficiency, particularly in the home.

The focus of reversing language shift in New Zealand is to restore intergenerational transmission. Mâori broadcasting and e-Media is an important mechanism for supporting intergenerational language transmission.

Broadcasting and e-Media also contributes towards increased Mâori language skills by providing language learners with opportunities to build and use their language skills, particularly listening skills. The results of the 2006 Health of the Mâori Language Survey showed an increase in the number of people that can converse in Mâori and use Mâori in their homes and communities.

It is also important is that the language is seen to be a normal part of society. The third long term outcome of the Outcomes Framework provides that the Mâori language and culture be valued as an integral part of the New Zealand’s national identity.

Broadcasting and e-Media play a key role by portraying the Mâori language as a living language and therefore enhancing the status of the language. The pervasiveness of broadcasting and e-Media as forms of communication means that they can have a significant impact on individuals, communities, and on wider society.

4.What are the funding implications of the Outcomes Framework?

The Outcomes Framework identifies objectives, principles, long term outcomes and intermediate outcomes for Mâori broadcasting and other electronic Media. The second stage of this work will include the development of the operational aspects of the Outcomes Framework, including consideration of appropriate resource and allocations.

5.How were the high level goals of the Outcomes Framework developed?

The outcomes framework was informed by: a literature review of minority language broadcasting; analysis of existing and developing workstreams in public broadcasting and digital development; engagement with key stakeholders; and review of existing data about the health of the Mâori language and the impact of Mâori broadcasting.

6.What happens next?

The second stage of this work has already begun. A hui with a cross section of Mâori broadcasting, e-Media, and language revitalisation sector experts and practitioners is being held today (12 October meeting) with Te Puni Kôkiri officials. The purpose of this hui is to consider and discuss operational issues such as the role of Iwi in broadcasting and e-media, and the impact of converging technologies on language revitalisation.
