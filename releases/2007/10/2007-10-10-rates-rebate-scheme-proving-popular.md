Local Government Minister Mark Burton told Parliament today during question time the latest uptake figures of the rates rebate scheme show a promising increase on the figures for this time last year.

“By the end of this week, for the 2007/2008 financial year, around 65,439 rate paying Kiwi households will have been rebated almost $30 million.” Mark Burton said.

“That’s a promising increase over last year showing that the expanded scheme has become better known and is proving popular for tens of thousands of low-income New Zealand rate paying households, in particular for those on fixed incomes.” He said

“By the end of the last financial year the expanded rates rebate scheme had seen over 111,000 households receive a rebate. The total amount paid out to households in rebates was almost $50 million. That was a huge boost over previous years.” He said.

“This scheme expanded by this Labour-led government provides valuable relief for low income households – particularly those on fixed incomes.” He said.

“The lack of questioning from the National Party shows they couldn’t bring themselves to say anything positive and yet found nothing in the scheme to criticise.” He said.

“I encourage all ratepayers who think they may be eligible to contact their local council and fill out the application form.” He said.
