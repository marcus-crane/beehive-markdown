Five teachers have been awarded e-Learning Fellowships which recognise their innovative and creative approaches to improving students’ learning, Education Minister Steve Maharey said.

“The Fellowships enable teachers to be released from the classroom for up to a year to research and develop their use of information and communication technologies”.

Mr Maharey announced the recipients of the 2008 e-Learning Teacher Fellowships today in a speech to the third annual U-learn conference in Auckland.

“The Fellowships support teachers as researchers, and help build teacher capability, providing funding, laptop and computer equipment, and mentoring and academic support.

“This year’s projects include research into how mobile phones can support students with special learning needs, and combining virtual and face-to-face learning to improve students’ literacy and thinking skills.

“The Fellowships are a great example of the Labour-led government’s commitment to 21st century teaching. They encourage teachers from early childhood through to tertiary education to raise student achievement through technology, such as social communication tools and software.

“Technology is becoming more and more central to the way New Zealanders live and work. Technology is one of the eight learning areas in the new curriculum, and these teachers will be leaders in this area.

“Past fellowship recipients have become principals, curriculum, learning and teaching leaders, in-service e-learning advisers and professional development experts.”

Recipients are supported by industry partners or education providers, such as Massey University.
