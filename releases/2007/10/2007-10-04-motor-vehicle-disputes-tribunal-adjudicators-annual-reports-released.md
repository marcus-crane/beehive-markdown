The Annual Reports from the Adjudicators of the Auckland (Mr Chris Cornwell) and Wellington (Ms Nicola Wills) Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal have been released and are available on the \[url=http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz]Ministry of Consumer Affairs website \[/url]

These annual reports cover the period 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007.

The Adjudicators annual reports summarise the applications dealt with by the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal during the year. The reports detail any cases that, in the Adjudicator’s opinion, require special mention and make any recommendations for amendments to the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003 (if any) that the Adjudicator thinks desirable based on the experience of the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.

"Feedback from the Adjudicators has indicated that there is a need to reiterate that people buying cars from traders are protected by the Consumer Guarantees Act, regardless of any mechanical warranty," Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard said.

"I will be looking at how we can best ensure that message gets across, both to motor vehicle traders and buyers."

The reports are released by the Minister of Consumer Affairs under section 87 of the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003.
