Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff today announced new appointments to the New Zealand Public Advisory Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control (PACDAC).

“Five new appointments have been made to the committee and three of the existing members have been re-appointed,” Phil Goff said.  
“The new appointees are: academic and small arms proliferation expert David Capie, former Secretary of Defence and Disarmament Ambassador Graham Fortune, peace advocate and former MP Richard Northey, former Assistant Bishop of Auckland Richard Randerson, and disarmament advocate and researcher Mary Wareham.  
“Former government minister and longstanding landmines activist Deborah Morris-Travers, academic Jim Veitch and nuclear disarmament advocate Alyn Ware have been reappointed, and current committee member, peace advocate Pauline Tangiora’s term runs to December.”

“I welcome the new members and look forward to working with them. Each of the appointees brings wide ranging experience in fields which will be invaluable to the group and its work,” Phil Goff said

PACDAC was established 20 years ago by the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act 1987 and is chaired by the Disarmament and Arms Control Minister. The committee funds projects and scholarships advancing education and promoting peace, arms control and disarmament.

“The committee also makes grants to non-government organisations implementing the 2002 United Nations Study on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Education, considers reports from officials and others on disarmament and arms control issues and advises the Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control,” Phil Goff said.
