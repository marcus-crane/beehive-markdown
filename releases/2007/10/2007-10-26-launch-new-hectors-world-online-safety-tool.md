The launch today of a new [Hector’s World™](http://www.hectorsworld.com) online safety tool for kids is an innovative, easy tool which parents and kids can use to keep kids safe on the Net, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Hector’s World™ online safety tool is a friendly on-screen cartoon character which acts as a button kids can click if they see something upsetting while surfing the net. Clicking on the button immediately brings up a friendly Hector’s World™ screensaver and encourages the user to go and tell an adult.

Laban launched the safety button today at Parliament.

“We know that kids today are very capable at using the Internet. This tool is unique as it allows kids to regulate their own surfing in a positive and responsible way,” said Laban.

Hector’s World™ launched a series of educational cartoons in June focussing on basic web safety and identifying risk while surfing the Internet.

“I congratulate the Hector’s World™ team for helping our young children to understand the risks of surfing the Internet in an engaging, balanced and informative way.

Hector’s World™ has received funding from the Labour-led government’s [Community Partnership Fund](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____18.aspx) under the Digital Strategy to assist with the online safety project.

The Digital Strategy uses ICT to help unlock New Zealand’s economic, social and cultural aspirations.

“The Hector’s World™ project has been a successful joint venture between the community, business and government and reflects our commitment to building strong, sustainable and connected communities,” said Laban.
