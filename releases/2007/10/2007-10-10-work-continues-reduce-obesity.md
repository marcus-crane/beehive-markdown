Work continues to reduce obesity

Health Minister Pete Hodgson is pleased with progress being made by the food industry when it comes to the fight against obesity, but more is still needed to make real health gains.

“This week, Cookie Time in Christchurch has launched a range of ‘Smart Cookies’ which fit into the ‘sometimes’ category of the Ministry of Health’s Food and Beverage Classification System.”

Schools will be able to sell these new Smart Cookies, which are lower in saturated fat and salt than other Cookie Time products, whilst still providing and promoting healthy options.

The Food and Beverage Classification System encourages the food industry to reformulate and innovate their products so they can be classified as ‘everyday’ or ‘sometimes’ foods.

Pete Hodgson says a number of New Zealand food companies have been making changes to their products and practices to help work towards a healthier food environment.

“That’s great, and I’ve thanked the food industry for their contributions but I have asked them what’s next? The response to addressing this country’s most pressing public health challenge is not just a whole of government one, but a whole of society approach.”

Pete Hodgson says if dramatic changes are not made soon to improve the food environments for kiwis, the threat of regulating the food industry will become very real.

“The fact that New Zealanders are getting heavier is of great concern to me. It’s not going to go away in a hurry; neither am I and nor should the food industry.”
