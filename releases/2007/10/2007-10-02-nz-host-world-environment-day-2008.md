“As part of New Zealand’s drive for greater environmental sustainability, we’ve made a commitment to reduce our emissions. But to overcome the challenge of climate change, kicking the carbon habit must be a truly global goal. During next year’s World Environment Day events I look forward to learning about how other nations are addressing this challenge,” said Prime Minister Helen Clark.
