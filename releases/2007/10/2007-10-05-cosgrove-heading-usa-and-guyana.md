Associate Finance Minister Clayton Cosgrove will depart New Zealand this Sunday for the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in Georgetown, Guyana where he will be representing Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

The key issue at the three-day meeting starting Monday 15 October will be climate change. Mr Cosgrove will be discussing New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme and other sustainability initiatives.

En route Mr Cosgrove will visit New York and Washington DC to attend a series of meetings with senior US Government, Administration and Congressional leaders, World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials, and private sector leaders to discuss measures to combat international money laundering and terrorist financing, as part New Zealand’s obligations under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Mr Cosgrove will also be discussing energy efficiency and sustainability measures in the design and construction of buildings while in Washington DC, and with senior municipal officials and building industry leaders in New York.

He will visit the soon-to-be completed 55 storey Bank of America tower in New York which is being constructed using embodied energy principles and is said to be the “greenest high rise” in the United States.

Mr Cosgrove will return to New Zealand on Saturday 20 October 2007.
