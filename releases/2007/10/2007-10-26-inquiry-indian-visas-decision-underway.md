The Immigration Department was asked yesterday to look at the decision by New Delhi-based immigration officials to deny visas to some members of an Indian business delegation to New Zealand, Trade Minister Phil Goff said today.

Some members of the 30-strong group of business people were denied visas to come to New Zealand this week.

“I have discussed the question of denial of visas to some members of an Indian business delegation to New Zealand with Minister of Immigration David Cunliffe. He has undertaken an inquiry within his department to determine the reasons for the denial of visas,” Phil Goff said.

“Until we have received the facts from New Delhi, where the decision was made to deny the visas. it would be premature to reach any conclusions about whether the visas denials were or were not justified.

“The Indian Government was aware of the denials before the mission proceeded but has made no approach to New Zealand about the decisions.”
