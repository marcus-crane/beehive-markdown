Minister for Auckland Issues Judith Tizard has today congratulated Auckland's successful candidates in the 2007 local body elections.

"Despite a disappointingly low voter turnout, Auckland residents have clearly indicated that they want effective leadership and management of their city and region," Judith Tizard said.

"The Government's goals are to cement Auckland's status as a world-class city, and to deliver a better quality of life for Auckland residents."

"I look forward to working closely with both the new and incumbent mayors and councillors to meet those goals," the Minister said.
