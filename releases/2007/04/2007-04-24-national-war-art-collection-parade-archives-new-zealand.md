Archives Minister Judith Tizard today announced the digitisation of the National War Art Collection at the official opening of an exhibition of oil paintings from the collection.

“The opening of the War Art exhibition, on the eve of ANZAC Day, comes at a time when New Zealanders are remembering their family members, colleagues and friends who served during times of war”, Judith Tizard said.

“The National Collection of War Art is a lasting tribute to New Zealand men and women who saw active service in World War One and Two. Many of the war artists were servicemen who have captured on canvas their experiences and those of their comrades in battle, for future generations to see.

“The collection is significant to our national identity. Learning about and understanding the wartime role of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents, can help us to become a stronger, richer and more vibrant nation,” Judith Tizard said.

The exhibition includes paintings artists such as Peter McIntyre, Barns-Graham, Bowring, Butler, Wollen, Woolley, and others.

Archives New Zealand, as the Government Record Keeper, has already preserved many of the 1500 plus paintings in the collection for the long term. The digitising of the images in the collection will make it more readily available to a much wider range of people in our community. It will also allow ‘social tagging’, which allows people to add information to the details about the paintings in the collection, comment on the information from others, and tell their stories about the paintings in the collection.

Archives New Zealand is one of the first government agencies to use this technology in keeping with the government’s digital content strategy. The first batch of digitised images from the War Art Collection will be available online at the end of May.

The public can view War Art – the exhibition of oil paintings from the National Collection of War Art at Archives New Zealand’s Wellington office, Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm and Saturdays 9am to 1pm.
