Broadband wireless access (BWA) services will be boosted by the new allocation of 2.3GHz spectrum, Communications Minister David Cunliffe says.

"Management rights bands in the 2.3GHz spectrum band will be allocated as soon as practicable, enabling emerging wireless broadband technologies such as WiMAX," the minister said.

"BWA technology for this band is only just starting to become available. It is critical that we create the right conditions for its future deployment by giving a range of players the opportunity and the certainty they need to make a long-term investment.”

Details of the proposed auction [are now available for comment](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/auctions/auction09/) prior to final government decisions being taken on the auction arrangements.

The overall process of increasing spectrum availability for BWA services was [announced in December 2006](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/spp/bwa/index.html) with the publication of a series of Cabinet decisions.

"This announcement gives more details on the specific auction arrangements and timing for the 2.3 GHz band," Mr Cunliffe said.

“While some of the spectrum rights to be allocated may not commence until 2010, the early auction will allow purchasers to plan their implementation with certainty.

“We need advanced broadband services and wireless technologies are a part of the overall mix that can help us achieve this. This allocation of spectrum is an important step in allowing industry to plan and build the necessary infrastructure.”

The minister encouraged people with an interest in the area or companies that might provide such services to read the Auction Proposal and to submit comments.

Interested parties have until 27 April 2007 to comment. The auction is expected to be of the conventional “outcry” type and to be held in late May 2007.
