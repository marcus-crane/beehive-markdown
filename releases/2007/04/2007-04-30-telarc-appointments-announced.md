Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced three appointments to the Testing Laboratory Registration Council (TELARC).

[TELARC](http://www.telarcsai.co.nz/) is the body responsible for the accreditation of testing laboratories, radiology services, and inspection services.

Lianne Dalziel said she was pleased to appoint Dr Robin Pratt, Dr Richard Janes, and Jo Brosnahan to the Council.

“They complement each other’s strengths and together bring a good mix of strategic, leadership, governance and business skills, combined with experience and understanding of public sector policies and processes.”

Dr Robin Pratt succeeds the late Dr Geoff Page as council chair. Current council member Dr Richard Janes has been appointed as deputy chair, while Jo Brosnahan becomes a member of the council. All three have been appointed for three-year terms.

Lianne Dalziel also acknowledged the commitment and contributions of Richard Dimmock who became temporary deputy chair in August last year, and outgoing member Graeme Robertson who served on the council for the past six years. Mr Dimmock, who did not seek the position of chair, will continue to serve as a member of the council.
