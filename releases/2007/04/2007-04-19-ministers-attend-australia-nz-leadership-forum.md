Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel fly to Sydney this weekend to attend the fourth annual Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum.

"This is an important opportunity to meet with key stakeholders across business, government and academia from both sides of the Tasman and so assess how we can further develop this critical economic relationship," said the Ministers.

"The combined trans-Tasman market of 24 million people is vital to the success of our exporters," said Dr Cullen. "For many it is a spring board to opportunities further afield so hearing from the key players is a valuable part of the process of taking the Single Economic Market agenda forward."

The two-day closed-door forum will hear from 80 leaders in their field, including New Zealanders who head major companies in Australia, Ralph Norris (Commonwealth Bank) and David Kirk (Fairfax).

"This is an important opportunity for senior Australasian players to talk candidly about our common challenges and ways to work together so we can capitalise on global opportunities," said Ms Dalziel.

The forum will discuss progress under the [Single Economic Agenda](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/Australia/2-SEM/index.php) and other important business issues including climate change.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard will participate as a guest speaker at the forum dinner on Sunday night. Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will also attend the event.

The Leadership Forum was established in 2004, with the first meeting held at Government House in Wellington. The Forum is currently co-chaired by James Strong from Australia (who is chairman of Insurance Australia Group) and John Allen from New Zealand (CEO of NZ Post).
