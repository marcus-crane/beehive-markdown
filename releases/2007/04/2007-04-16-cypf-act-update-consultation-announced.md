Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson today launched a discussion document for consultation as part of the process to update the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act (CYPF) 1989.

"When it was introduced the [CYPF Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=272094&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BBAF4%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) placed New Zealand at the front of international legislative best practice", said Ms Dyson.

"The Act introduced principles that radically altered the way decisions were made about children and young people, insisting that family become partners in the decision-making process though [Family Group Conferences](http://www.courts.govt.nz/youth/fgc.html) and remain involved in the future of their children.

"Key drivers in developing the legislation were family empowerment, cultural responsiveness, due process and a need to offer effective diversionary procedures as an alternative to formal criminal procedures. These remain the driving principles behind the legislation today."

"Eighteen years after the introduction of the CYPF Act, it is timely to consider whether it needs updating or amending. I want to ensure the legislation actively promotes its key principles in a practical and workable manner."  
"The CYPF Act is a touchstone for how well we as a society care for and support our children and young people. I look forward to hearing people's views on how we can ensure it continues to be the best possible vehicle for promoting the well-being of children, young people and their families," said Ms Dyson.

The Ministry of Social Development has produced a discussion document identifying major themes and ideas which emerged from initial discussions with key stakeholders. The discussion document and online submission form will be available on the Ministry of Social Development website ([here](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/children-and-young-people/cypf-act-update/index.html)) or by emailing [cypfactupdate@msd.govt.nz](mailto:cypfactupdate@msd.govt.nz?subject=CYPF)
