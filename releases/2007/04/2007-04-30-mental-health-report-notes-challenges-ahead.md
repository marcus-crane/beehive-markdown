New Zealand can be proud of the progress made in the mental health and addiction sector over the past decade but there are challenges ahead, Health Minister Pete Hodgson says.

Launching the Mental Health Commission's report, Te Haererenga mo te Whakaoranga 1996-2006, the Journey of Recovery for the New Zealand Mental Health Sector, in Rotorua tonight, the Minister welcomed its finding that New Zealand has become a more socially inclusive society for people who experience mental illness.

He also acknowledged the work of the mental health workforce and non-government providers during a time of rapid change in the delivery of mental health services.

"There have been major initiatives launched to support the development of a more skilled, qualified and competent workforce and that workforce is to be commended for the role it has played in development of the sector," Pete Hodgson says.

Te Haererenga also sets out challenges on a range of issues that will need to be addressed as development of mental health services continues over the next decade.

"Te Haererenga raises some challenges around the rights of those with mental illness and the operation of the statutory framework for protecting their rights. These are issues that need to be debated," Pete Hodgson says.

Some people would take heart from some of the report's findings while others would take issue with some of its findings and wide discussion over the next few years was needed.

"As we collectively move forward, the challenge for the Commission and the sector is to ensure the debate Te Haererenga generates takes us forward on a path consistent with the goals established in the second national mental health plan, Te Tahuhu," Pete Hodgson says.
