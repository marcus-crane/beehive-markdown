Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today urged people to get their views heard on the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Amendment Bill before submissions close on 4 May 2007.

“Identity fraud is a growing problem and the proposals in this Bill form part of a range of actions the Labour –led Government has put in place to make it harder for fraudsters to succeed. Doing nothing has never been an option,” said Rick Barker.

“But as I have stated from the outset there needs to be a balance between the protection of private and personal information, and access to, and use of, that information. I am hopeful submissions to the Government Administration Select Committee will help achieve this balance.

“I want to encourage submitters from across the board to inform the development of the Bill. This is a Government that listens and I am particularly interested in opinions around the definition of historical records and immediate family.

“The submissions received will help guide us as we seek to strike a balance between maintaining legitimate access to registers and protecting New Zealanders from identity fraud,” said Rick Barker

Anyone can make a submission on the Bill up to 4 May 2007. For information about how to make a submission, or to download the legislation, go to
