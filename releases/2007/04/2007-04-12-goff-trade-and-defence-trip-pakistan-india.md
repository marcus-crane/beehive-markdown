Trade and Defence Minister Phil Goff heads to Pakistan and India tomorrow to pursue New Zealand's trade interests and strengthen defence ties.

"In Pakistan I will be attending the annual ministerial meeting of the Cairns Group of agricultural exporters and meeting with WTO Director General, Pascal Lamy. The Cairns Group meeting comes at a crucial time in the WTO Doha Round. There have been intensive contacts among some of the major WTO players, but there has not been a breakthrough yet. Cairns Group Ministers want to take stock and prepare ourselves for the road ahead", said Mr Goff.

"In my bilateral visit to Pakistan, I will meet Ministerial counterparts including the Trade, Agriculture and Defence Ministers, Minister for Disarmament and the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission.

"New Zealand's bilateral relationship with Pakistan is growing, New Zealand exports grew by over 65 percent last year and the first group of Pakistan-government funded PhD students started study in New Zealand universities this year. Agricultural reform in Pakistan opens possible markets for New Zealand expertise. I will be meeting with the Pakistan Dairy Corporation to discuss the scope for expanding our cooperation in the agricultural sector.

"From Pakistan, I will travel to New Delhi for meetings with Indian counterparts including Ministers responsible for Agriculture, Defence, External Affairs and Commerce. While in New Delhi I will also meet with senior Indian business leaders and trade specialists and make a presentation to the United Service Institution on New Zealand's strategic situation and defence policy.

"India's rapidly expanding economy and increasing international influence - including on trade and defence issues - make it important that we focus on building our relationship. India is a priority relationship for us, particularly in terms of our trade and economic interests. India is now our second fastest growing export market, and is growing in importance in the agriculture, tourism, education and creative sectors", said Mr Goff

At the end of his visits to Pakistan and India, Phil Goff will fly to Kabul and Bamian to meet Afghan leaders and spend time with New Zealand Defence Force personnel deployed to Afghanistan.
