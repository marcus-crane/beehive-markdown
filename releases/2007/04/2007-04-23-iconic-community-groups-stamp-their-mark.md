[Postage stamps](http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/Cultures/en-NZ/Stamps/NewZealandCurrentIssues/2007Centenaries/IssueInformation.htm) featuring four iconic community groups are a fitting tribute to their contribution to New Zealand communities, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Plunket Society, Home of Compassion, Scouts New Zealand and New Zealand Rugby League celebrate their centenaries this year, and feature on a special series of New Zealand Post stamps released tomorrow.

"Community-based groups such as Plunket have played a large part in our lives as Kiwis for 100 years. It is important to acknowledge this,” said Laban during a recent visit to Plunket's national office in Wellington with New Zealand Post chief executive John Allen.

Plunket’s New Zealand President Kaye Crowther says "This is a wonderful birthday present and a fantastic opportunity to recognise the work of Plunket Nurses and volunteers across New Zealand.

"Plunket was born on 14 May 1907 when Sir Truby King founded a society that would 'help mothers and save the babies'. It is great to have his legacy and the Plunket Society recognised on a postage stamp.

"We are looking forward to the next 100 years of working in, and for New Zealand communities to achieve our vision of working together to get the best start for every child - Mâ te mahi ngâtahi, e puâwai ai â tâtou tamariki," said Crowther.

John Allen says Plunket, and the other organisations included in the centenary stamp issue, have touched the lives of countless New Zealanders over the last 100 years.

"These stamps recognise the important role these organisations have played over the last century, and into the new one, in helping shape New Zealand's social and sporting development. We are very pleased to be able to offer them," said Allen.

New Zealand Post also recognises the importance of community and voluntary organisations through their Community Post initiative, offering one million envelopes with free postage to around 4000 community groups each year. Over 25,000 community projects have benefited from free postage since the scheme began.
