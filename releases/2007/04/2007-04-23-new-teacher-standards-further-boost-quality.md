The Education Minister, Steve Maharey, is welcoming the introduction of national standards for students graduating as teachers.

"The Teachers Council's 'Graduating Teacher Standards' builds on Ministry of Education work to further lift the standard and quality of our teachers, making sure all New Zealanders can access a world class education system.

"The standards set out clearly what student teachers need to achieve to qualify as teachers, and to apply for provisional registration. They will operate from January next year.

"This important initiative by the Teachers Council will feed into current work by the government to make sure newly qualified teachers are effectively prepared and supported in their early years. It is vital that all agencies work together to achieve this.

"The Ministry of Education is currently leading an initial teacher education review, looking at how students are taught to be teachers at tertiary level, how they are inducted to schools and how the system can better produce quality teachers."

As part of this review, the Ministry will release a consultation document called 'Becoming a Teacher' next month.

"The Tertiary Education Commission is also working on tertiary education reforms, which will have a considerable impact on how initial teacher education is provided.

"We're all working together to lift the standard of the teaching profession in our schools, by making sure teachers are properly prepared to make a difference for every one of the learners they will work with."
