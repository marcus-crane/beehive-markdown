Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven says he's pleased at the level of interest in the Great South Basin, after receiving bids for petroleum exploration permits in the area.

Mr Duynhoven announced the opening of the much-anticipated Great South Basin blocks offer on 31 July 2006. The blocks offer saw 40 blocks, located off the south-eastern coast of Otago and Southland and each approximately 9,000km2 in size, being offered for competitive bidding.

The blocks offer bidding round closed on Monday 2 April.

"I am pleased with the number and variety of bids received by the Government, including substantial interest from international exploration companies. They indicate a very positive attitude towards the prospectivity of the Great South Basin.

"Officials in the Crown Minerals Group of the Ministry of Economic Development have now started the process of evaluating the bids, and I expect to be in a position to announce the results of the blocks offer in July," Harry Duynhoven said.

The need to ensure the confidentiality of the bid evaluation process and need to protect commercially sensitive information concerning bids and bidding parties means that the Government can not comment on how many bids have been received, or who the bidding parties are.

Further information on the Great South Basin, including location maps, can be obtained at the [Crown Minerals website](http://www.crownminerals.govt.nz).
