Education Minister Steve Maharey today congratulated the thousands of parents across the country who have been elected as school trustees.

"The school board of trustees plays an important part in providing the strategic direction for the school and makes decisions that influence and support educational opportunities for every child in their school," Steve Maharey said.

"They also play a key role in working with principals, staff, students, parents and the community to lead their schools.

"The school board system is one of the great strengths of our education system.

“Children’s success in education is much more likely when schools, parents and the wider community work together. The skills, energies and experiences of people in the community are important to support, encourage and enhance the learning of children.

"Around 13,000 parent representatives were needed to fill the positions on boards of trustees at 2,500 schools throughout the country this year.

"There has been a fantastic response from parents in the community with many boards reporting between eight and 21 nominations,” Steve Maharey said. “The standard number of parent representative positions on a board is five.

“We also know that there are schools that previously haven't had enough nominations to hold elections for some time, reporting this year that they have had more nominations than vacancies."

The school trustee elections are New Zealand's biggest democratic event and this is the seventh election since the introduction of self-managed schools in 1989.

The majority of schools held their election on March 29, results were declared on April 4 and new trustees take office today.

Approximately 50 schools are holding their elections on May 8, with results to be announced to their communities on 14 May.
