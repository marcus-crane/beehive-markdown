The people of Bamyan know well the Kiwi emblem worn by New Zealand Defence Force personnel.

To them, it represents a country that has come in friendship, to help secure peace and stability, Defence Minister Phil Goff said at the ANZAC Day Service in Bamyan today.

Mr Goff said that the 4:30am service was a moving occasion for nearly 100 New Zealand personnel present.

“On the memorial at Chunuk Bair in Gallipoli, the inscription describes New Zealanders as having come from “the uttermost ends of the earth”, he said.

“In Bamyan, as the dawn rose over a beautiful but harsh landscape, we all felt a long way from home.

“But we also felt that what we as New Zealanders are doing here is making a difference and is welcomed by the local people.

“You see that in the friendly waves and smiles of the school children, many of whom are now studying in classrooms built by the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team.

“We heard it directly from the Governor of the province Dr Habiba Sarabi, who attended our Dawn Service.

“And you could feel it from the reaction of the local people who welcome, rather than resent the presence of armed New Zealand soldiers in their town, and in their countryside.

“Memories of the Hazara people of the mass execution of their leaders by the Taliban in 2001, and the destruction of the 1,500 year old Buddha statues – part of their cultural heritage – are still raw.

“There are signs of tangible social, political and economic progress in Kabul and Bamyan.

“But the struggle against the Taliban is still real, with regular bombings in Kabul, though the situation is much calmer in Bamyan.

“As Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations said last year, ‘there can be no security without development, no development without security and neither without respect for human rights.’

“New Zealand is endeavouring, in Bamyan, to provide both security and development assistance as part of the critical path to a better future for Afghanistan,” Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff is spending three days with the New Zealand men and women serving in Bamyan. Before that, he had discussions in Kabul with President Karzai, Vice President Massoud, Interior Minister Moqbel, Defence Minister Wardak, the UNSG Special Representative Tom Koenigs and the Commander of ISAF General Dan MacNeill.
