New Zealand’s response to the Solomon Islands' earthquake and tsunami has been well received, and the focus is now shifting towards recovery and reconstruction, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Mr Peters said an RNZAF Hercules would fly to the Solomons on Sunday, with a final cargo of emergency supplies including tents, tarpaulins, and generators. The tents will be used to house part of Gizo's damaged hospital.

“To date, New Zealand's emergency aid contribution of $500,000 has been spent on getting supplies such as tents, tarpaulins and water storage containers to some of the worst hit areas," Mr Peters said.

“The remaining funds will be allocated to reconstruction and other forms of support as soon as long-term needs have been assessed.

“Over 9000 people have been affected by the disaster, and reports indicate as many as 50 schools have been damaged as well as other essential buildings such as hospitals and health clinics.

“The government’s international aid and development agency, NZAID, has been co-ordinating New Zealand’s response in concert with France, Australia, the Red Cross and other NGOs.

“The work of New Zealand Defence Force personnel, especially the Air Loading Team, in the affected area has been greatly appreciated and highly effective in rapidly distributing aid.

"New Zealanders have responded generously to this disaster, and NZAID has received over 30 offers of assistance from private companies and individuals.

“NZAID is also working closely with New Zealand-based NGOs who are active in the Solomons, including Rotary, ADRA, Caritas, Save the Children, CWS, Oxfam, UNICEF and World Vision. A number of them have appeals underway which are being generously supported,” Mr Peters said.
