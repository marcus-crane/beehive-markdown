Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the appointment of the new Workplace Health and Safety Council.

"The Workplace Health and Safety Council will provide leadership and co-ordination, and advice to government on relevant legislation, standards and policies and I am very pleased with the calibre of members," said Ruth Dyson.

Four members have been appointed: Carol Beaumont, secretary of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU), Andrew Casidy, general secretary of the finance sector union Finsec, Paul Jarvie, occupational health and safety manager at the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) and Panu Raea, barrister, director of a consultancy and 2003 Pacific Business Leader of the Year.

Ex officio members of the Council are Ruth Dyson, Minister of Labour and Minister for ACC; Ross Wilson, president of NZCTU and Phil O'Reilly, chief executive of Business New Zealand.

"Council members are expected to have experience in health and safety matters and to ensure collectively that they adequately represent the workplace health and safety issues facing small to medium enterprises, women, Maori and Pacific peoples. I am confident the Council membership does this," said Ms Dyson.

Nominated members are appointed to the Council for an initial term of three years. The Council will be chaired on a rotating basis by the Minister of Labour, chief executive of Business New Zealand and president of the NZCTU. The Council will provide advice on ways to progress the implementation of the Workplace Health and Safety Strategy and advice on workplace health and safety matters of national and international significance.

"The Workplace Health and Safety Strategy will contribute to New Zealand's economic success by keeping workers productive and on the job. It will also help improve workplace cultures where attitudes often dictate employee behaviour about health and safety," said Ms Dyson.

"We have already had extensive input from many organisations including the NZCTU and Business New Zealand. Their co-operation means the Strategy, its action plan and now the Council are relevant to industry and the realities of New Zealand workplaces. By working together, government, business, unions and communities can all play their part in making workplaces healthier and safer."
