A new initiative to meet labour supply needs for horticulture and viticulture has been launched by Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope and Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"The [Recognised Seasonal Employer](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/rse/) policy  
demonstrates a strong commitment by the Labour-led government, Pacific states and industry to ensuring the policy’s success," Mr Benson-Pope said.

“The horticulture and viticulture industries make a significant contribution to our economy and promote New Zealand on the world stage. However, as international demand for our product increases, so too do labour requirements.

“The RSE policy supports industry to employ New Zealanders first before looking overseas. If no New Zealanders are available, employers are now able to apply to recruit from Pacific states.

“This policy is an industry-led initiative. However, Pacific states, industry and government will all have a vital role to play in assuring its success,” Mr Benson Pope said.

Mr Cunliffe said the policy was backed by stringent rules to protect both Pacific workers and New Zealand’s immigration framework.

" [Employers](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/community/stream/employ/employmentprocesses/employingtemporaryworkers/whatisrequired/seasonalwkrs/) can only recruit from the Pacific if they provide robust evidence of good workplace practices, the ability to pay market rates and a commitment to providing pastoral care for workers,” Mr Cunliffe said. "It is recognised that appropriate pastoral care will be an important component of making the scheme successful.

“There will be zero tolerance of overstaying and Department of Labour immigration staff will enforce this. Pacific nations will also be playing a part in ensuring that their participation is not threatened by overstaying.

“This policy is welcomed by Pacific countries. It is an opportunity for Pacific peoples to increase their incomes and their knowledge transfer through work experience," Mr Cunliffe said. "We have had significant, ongoing discussions with Pacific governments on this policy and each state is putting its own measures in place to make it work."
