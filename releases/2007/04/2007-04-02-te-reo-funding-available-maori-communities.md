Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is urging Mâori communities to continue strengthening their reo Mâori and encouraging them to apply for grants from the Mâori language development fund Mâ Te Reo.

The Mâ Te Reo funding round for 2007 opens today. Mr Horomia set up the fund in 2001 specifically to support Mâori groups and individuals already working to develop reo Mâori at a community level.

"We have always known that there are lots of great reo Mâori initiatives going on in communities around Aotearoa and, over the last six years, Mâ Te Reo has supported about 600 completed projects and many more still underway. "

About $1.8 million is distributed through Mâ Te Reo each year, for eight funding categories. Over the years projects have included: the development of Mâori language software, tours to promote reo Mâori song albums, preschool playgroups for families who want to speak reo Mâori, production of reo Mâori newsletters and reo wânanga and classes at a national and regional level.

"I also want to encourage iwi, whänau and häpu to develop long term Mâori language strategies and plans to ensure a co-ordinated and sustainable approach for reo Mâori within their regions, and more importantly, for their people. Once the strategy is established then all other projects within the region can align with it, thus doubling the benefit of the work."

"Mâori language is no longer on the brink of extinction, but it is not safe yet. Mâori language will only flourish if it is spoken. We hope to encourage that through Mâ Te Reo," Mr Horomia said.
