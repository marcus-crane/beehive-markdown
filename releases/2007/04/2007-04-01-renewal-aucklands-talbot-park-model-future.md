The successful renewal of Tamaki's Talbot Park is a model of how troubled urban areas can be transformed in to stronger, healthier, more sustainable communities, Housing Minister Chris Carter said today.

"The new Talbot Park is a model for the future, one everyone concerned with tackling zones of entrenched social deprivation should play close attention to," Mr Carter said at a function marking the completion of the suburb's reconstruction by Housing New Zealand.

"Five years ago, Talbot Park was marred by crime, and soaring tenant turnover as people sought to move out of the community. Today all that has changed. Tenant turnover is down to 5 per cent a year, and there are strong indications graffiti, vandalism and petty crime are all down as well.

"There is a new sense of community in Talbot Park, and this has been achieved despite the more intensive use of land, and a significant increase in the number of dwellings and residents," Mr Carter said.

"The smart urban design techniques, and the principles of tenant participation applied in Talbot Park have the potential to be used in larger socially deprived urban areas, and in ways that help meet some of our future housing needs in Auckland. To use them effectively though, we must be prepared to be bold."

Mr Carter said Housing New Zealand had worked closely with Auckland City Council’s Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Team to implement deceptively simple design features at Talbot Park that contributed to community safety.

"We have, for example, created two new parks that we have surrounded with kitchen windows. Why kitchen windows? Because kitchen windows mean community eyes are watching. And eyes deter crime."

"It is the people that live in a community that help maintain it," Mr Carter said.

"For this reason, the renewal of Talbot Park has involved tenants at every step of the way. Tenants helped plan house features, contributed to park design, named new streets and chose street vegetation.

"These initiatives have been as important as the numerous innovations introduced in the area, such as specially designed large homes, special homes for the elderly and disabled, rain water collection tanks, solar panels, street design and lighting.

"I would urge the people of Auckland to visit Talbot Park, and see for themselves what can be achieved when urban intensification and renewal is well planned, and embraces the people that live there," Mr Carter said.
