The government has welcomed input from thousands of businesses, groups and individuals, on New Zealand's energy and climate change future.

"At one level tackling climate change is simple," Energy and Climate Change Minister David Parker said. "We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

"The broad message we're getting is that all sectors should do their fair share, bearing in mind it will be easier for some sectors to take action than for others.

"We're also hearing that businesses and industries don't want to get punished for decisions they've taken in the past, but they want to make sure people get rewards for good behaviour in the future.

"I'd like to thank all those who took the time to make submissions either in writing, or verbally through the dozens of public meetings and hui held around country. I'd also like to thank officials who have been working hard to garner as wide a range of opinion as possible."

Consultation ended on Friday on proposals to increase sustainability in the energy sector, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, transport, agriculture and forestry.

More than 3000 written submissions have been received, in addition to feedback from over 4000 people at meetings and hui.  
The documents consulted on were:

- The draft New Zealand Energy Strategy
- New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy
- Transitional Measures
- Discussion paper on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand post 2012
- Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change

David Parker said he was pleased with the level of feedback. "It shows New Zealanders take energy sustainability and climate change seriously, and are keen to be part of the solution."

Submissions will be available online by the end of the month.
