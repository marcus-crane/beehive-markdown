Young people in Auckland City will get extra help when transitioning from school to work with the launch of a new Youth Transition Service, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The Auckland City Youth Transition Service, delivered by Youthline Trust, will provide a customised service that will support and guide young people onto a positive pathway, and will help young people to participate fully in the social and economic life of their community.

Youthline currently delivers a range of integrated responses to meet youth, family and community needs and are known for their youth telephone advice/counselling service.

“Youthline has an excellent reputation with young people in Auckland City. They have been supporting young people since 1970 and with their experience and local knowledge, they will do a fantastic job in helping Auckland City’s young people successfully transition from school to further education, training or employment,” Mr Benson-Pope said at the launch of the service today.

The Auckland City Youth Transition Service (YTS) is funded through the Ministry of Social Development and is supported by Auckland City Council. The aim of the service aligns with Government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs’ shared goal of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education, training or other activities that will contribute to their long-term economic independence and well-being.

The establishment of this YTS is in recognition of the needs of young people in Auckland City. It is estimated that more than 500 young people leave school each year without gaining level 1 NCEA qualifications. A significant number of these students need extra help to transition onto a positive pathway.

“The Auckland City YTS will work with young people to ensure that they receive the right assistance at the right time, so they can achieve better life outcomes,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

YTS already operates in 10 centres around the country and is set to be rolled out at another three sites after Auckland City.

Since the opening of the first YTS in December 2004, some 10,000 young people have accessed YTS services.

The Government announced this week that the number of unemployed fell to 28,845 – the lowest figure in 27 years. Of this figure, youth unemployment dropped to 1,565.
