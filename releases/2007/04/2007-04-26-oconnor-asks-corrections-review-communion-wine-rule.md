Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor has asked the Corrections Department to reassess its decision banning communion wine in prisons.

Wine is a banned drug under the 2004 Corrections Act, and effectively means prisoners cannot celebrate mass, which involves tiny quantities of wine for ceremonial purposes.

Mr O'Connor said he was concerned when informed about the implications of the decision and this week asked the department to reassess its interpretation of the rule.

"The ban is clearly an unintended consequence of the Act. I understand a legislative change is not required and I hope we can continue to accommodate the invaluable services of the church through the prison system.

"My commitment is to run a system that encourages prisoner rehabilitation and facilitates the involvement of the community, including churches, which assist in the goal of rehabilitation."
