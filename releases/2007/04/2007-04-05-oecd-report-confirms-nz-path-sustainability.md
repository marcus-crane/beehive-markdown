An independent international report indicates that New Zealand is on the way to become a sustainable nation, says Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Environmental Performance Review for New Zealand was released today.

The Review finds that the Government's efforts to limit pollution, to protect nature and biodiversity, and to make economic development more environmentally sustainable have resulted in clear improvements.

“The launch of this review is timely and provides additional impetus to this government’s aspiration to be the first country to be fully sustainable," said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The OECD says more work needs to be done and I am pleased to say that work to fulfil many of the Review's 38 recommendations is already underway, and where we are unlikely to fulfil the OECD recommendations, alternative actions are in place."

The environmental strengths identified by the OECD include New Zealand’s management of water resources and the value placed on its protected areas and conservation lands. Over 32 per cent of New Zealand’s land area and 7.5 per cent of territorial sea is protected – more than twice the OECD average.

"I am also pleased that the Review has identified our partnership approach to environmental management, linking local and central government, industry, business and communities, as being key to our significant achievements.

"Key initiatives like the [Clean Streams Accord](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/land/rural/dairying-accord-may03.pdf), the Business Partnerships for Sustainability programme and the Household Sustainability Campaign are based on a co-ordinated, partnership approach to improving our overall sustainability.

"The Review is very encouraging but Government acknowledges that much more needs to be done before we can lay claim to being the first country to be sustainable across the four pillars of environment, economy, society and nationhood.

"In particular we are already focussing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving recycling and cutting waste, and strengthening environmental monitoring and the national reporting of key environmental indicators, such as the state of the environment report to be released later this year."
