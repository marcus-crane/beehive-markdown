Foreign Minister Winston Peters is to represent the government at ANZAC Day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey.

Mr Peters' first engagement is on Tuesday morning (local time) when he will speak at the Turkish International Service at the Mehmetcik Memorial, before attending separate French and British services.

ANZAC Day begins with a speech at the Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove, followed by the Australian Service at Lone Pine, the Turkish National Service, and the New Zealand Service at Chunuk Bair.

"As the resting place for so many of our war-dead, Gallipoli has become a sacred place for New Zealanders," Mr Peters said. "It is widely regarded as a milestone in our passage to nationhood, and the bravery and the losses suffered there have become an indelible part of our history and our psyche.

"The battle for Chunuk Bair, on August 6-10, encapsulates the heroism and courage shown by our soldiers in the face of overwhelming odds.

"Although it was captured and held at great cost by New Zealand forces, British reinforcements were driven back by a massive counterattack, which effectively ended the Allies' ambitions of success.

"Few communities in our small country were untouched by the losses sustained at Gallipoli, yet it has also come to represent more positive developments.

"The forging of the ANZAC camaraderie remains a fundamental tenet of New Zealand-Australian relationship today, while a spirit of reconciliation and shared grief has grown into a warm and constructive relationship with the government and people of Turkey.

"The best way we can honour our dead this ANZAC Day will be to reflect upon those bonds, and by ensuring that future disagreements between nations are settled by diplomacy, rather than warfare," Mr Peters said.
