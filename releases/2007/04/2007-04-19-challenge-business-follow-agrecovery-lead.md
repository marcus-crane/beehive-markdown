A new recycling scheme is leading the way in making New Zealand the first sustainable country in the world, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The Minister was speaking in Nelson at the launch of AgRecovery, a national recycling scheme for containers of agricultural chemicals.

"I challenge and encourage other industries to look hard at the AgRecovery scheme to learn how they could effectively take responsibility for their products. Those which don’t, need to consider what part they will play in a sustainable New Zealand," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Minister congratulated the scheme developers for providing growers, farmers, foresters, and other primary industry chemical users with an environmentally safe way of disposing of their unwanted plastic containers.

“I am a firm believer in the role product stewardship schemes such as this play in minimising and managing waste in New Zealand,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

"This government plans to encourage more such schemes which share the responsibility for the disposal of a product throughout its life cycle - from the designers to the end users."

The AgRecovery Foundation members include Horticulture New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Agcarm, Fonterra and Environment Waikato. The scheme received initial funding from the government’s Sustainable Management Fund.

The Waste Minimisation (Solids) Bill, currently before the Select Committee, includes regulations that will support product stewardship schemes and ensure that those producers who won’t willingly accept their environmental responsibilities are not able to undercut others on price or freeload.

"Those industries that play their part will continue to be supported and appreciated by this government. Those who don’t will find themselves dealing with a government that is prepared to take a stronger hand to ensure we become a sustainable nation.

"With the launch of the container recovery programme, it is now time for the agrichemical industry to take over the collection of unwanted agrichemicals. A service currently provided by local and central government.

"I look forward to a day in the near future when we have comprehensive agrichemical and agrichemical packaging product stewardship in New Zealand," Mr Benson-Pope said.
