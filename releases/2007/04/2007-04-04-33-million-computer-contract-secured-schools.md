The government has secured a multi million dollar computer contract to provide software and licensing to all state and state integrated schools, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The total cost of the agreement is $32.9 million over four financial years, to make sure schools get a range of the latest software products at no cost to them.

"The contract covers the supply of Apple and Kid Pix software, anti-virus and anti-spyware software from IBM and negotiations have also been held with Microsoft and Novell to renew their contracts for another three years.

"The combination of Microsoft software, CA anti-virus software, Novell licensing and Apple software and licensing will provide assurances about the quality, performance and reliability of school computers.

"As computer software is always evolving, it is important our schools are able to keep ahead of the game and have access to the most up-to-date software.

"The packages we have purchased for schools are robust and compatible with a wide range of applications."

The deal follows the renegotiation and renewal of a number of contracts from 2004, which have provided schools with Microsoft, Apple OSX, Novell and CA eTrust anti-virus software licences.
