A programme aimed at helping Sickness and Invalid’s Benefits recipients’ in Nelson and Marlborough back into work was launched today by Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope.

The package, Providing Access to Health Solutions (PATHS), brings together employment, training and health services to help people receiving Sickness and Invalid’s Benefit back into the workforce by removing, reducing or managing the health problems that prevent them from working.

“It’s about assisting those on the Sickness and Invalid’s Benefit to move towards their employment goals by providing medical, community and employment services that look at the person’s needs and responds to them. With the complexity of the health needs of individuals, there is no single solution,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“With the help of PATHS, disabled people or those with ill-health are transforming their lives. They are participating more fully in their communities and building better lives for themselves and their families. The Government already provides a range of support through training, employment and social services, and now through PATHS there are health interventions that support a person to shift to a level of work that is appropriate,” he said.

PATHS has already made a significant impact on the lives of an increasing number of New Zealanders. In December 2006, 1,007 people on the Sickness and Invalid’s Benefits had gained from PATHS, through a wide range of health interventions, from surgery to counselling.

“By the end of December 2006, the service had helped 345 people remove or reduce their health barriers and move off benefit. In addition, 228 people declared income, reducing their dependence on the benefit since participating in PATHS.

“Many of these services already exist in the health sector but PATHS integrates clinical, employment and support services and brings people with real needs to the attention of the DHB and other health providers,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

The launch of the Nelson and Marlborough PATHS programme is the sixth service in the country. PATHS already operates successfully in the District Health Boards (DHBs) in regions of Counties Manukau, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Capital and Coast and Canterbury. It is also set to be rolled out in Whanganui, Mid Central, Hutt Valley and Otago DHB regions.
