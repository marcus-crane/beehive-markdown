170 schools are to receive $12 million to develop high standards and share their experience of best practice with other schools, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The Extending High Standards initiative is designed to promote excellence across schools by identifying highly effective schools and allowing them to pass on their tips to others," Steve Maharey said.

"The initiative will drive improvement in areas including numeracy, literacy, effective teaching, and making use of new technology to improve student achievement. More than 70,000 students at 169 schools will benefit.

"By working together, rather than in isolation, schools can share their most successful teaching practices with other schools – leading to an overall improvement in student learning.

"This is the second round of funding for the Extending High Standards initiative. The first has been operating since April 2006.

"Examples of the [Extending High Standards Across Schools](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=10278&data=l) initiative include schools working together to ensure the effective transition to secondary school, and improving student engagement.

"Other schools have used the funding to further develop effective teaching practices to improve student's literacy and numeracy skills."

There are now more than 60,000 students and 350 schools benefiting from the funding provided by the EHSAS initiative.

The government approved funding of $28.5 million over four years through the 2005 Budget for the Extending High Standards Across Schools programme.
