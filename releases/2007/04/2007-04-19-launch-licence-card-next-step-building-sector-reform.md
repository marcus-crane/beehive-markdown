Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove today released the Licence Card that will be issued to Licensed Building Practitioners from November this year, an important next step in the reform of the building and construction sector.

"Builders are practical, down-to-earth people, and after all of the months of consultation with the industry about how the licensing regime will work, the release of the Licence Card is another tangible step showing that licensing is actually on the way," Mr Cosgrove said.

Addressing the Registered Master Builders Federation Annual Conference in New Plymouth, Mr Cosgrove told delegates that the voluntary phase for licensing for designers, site leads and carpenters will start from November this year, with other trades to follow, and licensing becoming compulsory after that.

"Licensing will lift skills and professionalism, and enhance accountability in the industry, and raise consumer protection, while at the same time, protect every Kiwi's do-it-yourself (DIY) right to have a go. As a first step, it is intended to help ensure that people doing core work in the building sector are competent. That is our bottom line," Mr Cosgrove said.

"In the longer term, it will raise skill levels across the sector. It will promote, recognise and support professional skills. Over time, we will see increased emphasis on education and training, along with better career pathways. I envisage that in years to come, once the licensing system is up and running, eventually new entrants to licensing may be required to have completed apprenticeships or trade training."

"Licence holders will quickly gain a marketing advantage in terms of enhanced credibility with customers, clients or employers. It would be a brave person indeed who would undervalue the credibility and professional standing that will come with being a licensed builder."

Mr Cosgrove also reminded builders of the government's position on do-it-yourself builders. "Let me make our position crystal clear; we have absolutely no intention of undermining the Kiwi DIY tradition of having a go. I have given the public a commitment that DIY will be protected, and I will honour that commitment."

Mr Cosgrove said the licensing regime is part of the Government's suite of reforms to transform the building sector. Other reforms include the top-to-bottom review of the Building Code, accreditation and registration of Building Consent Authorities, the revamp of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service, the introduction of a financial assistance pilot for eligible owners of leaky homes, a voluntary product certification scheme, energy efficiency proposals for homes and workplaces, and investigating a home warranty insurance scheme.
