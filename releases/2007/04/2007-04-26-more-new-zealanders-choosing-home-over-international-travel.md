New Zealanders are making more domestic journeys and are spending significantly more money on overnight trips, Tourism minister Damien O'Connor says.

Spending on overnight trips increased by 15.5 per cent to $4.8b in the year to December 2006, compared with the 2005 calendar year, data released by the Ministry of Tourism shows. Spending by domestic travelers overall increased by 9.3 per cent to $7.5b in the same period.

Mr O'Connor said the figures were a positive result for the tourism industry and New Zealand businesses in general, and highlight how tourism directly benefits local communities by providing jobs and income.

"It's great news. New Zealand is a special place, and I'm delighted increasing numbers of us are taking the opportunity to see more of it."

Mr O'Connor said the main reason for the lift in spending is a switch from day trips to overnight trips, which generate higher expenditure overall as accommodation is usually purchased.

The number of overnight trips increased by 3.3 per cent over the 2005 calendar year.

The overall result comes as outbound travel by New Zealand residents declined by 0.4 per cent over the period, which highlight a significant shift in travel patterns.

He congratulated organisations such as the AA for its '101 Must-Dos for Kiwis' domestic travel marketing campaign, which started in the second half of last year, and effective promotional activity by Regional Tourism Organisations.

"These campaigns capture the imagination and help remind Kiwis of New Zealand's special qualities and the great things to see and do here at home."

The Domestic Travel Survey is a telephone survey of 15,000 New Zealand residents undertaken throughout the year. A range of data and reports from the survey are available on the Ministry of Tourism’s research website – www.tourismresearch.govt.nz
