New Zealand will provide $209,000 ($F240,000) to support families struggling to recover after serious flooding in Fiji, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“The recent floods on the main island of Vanua Levu caused an estimated $F15 million in damage," Mr Peters said.

"Many affected families are still struggling to regain a semblance of normal life, with their children and local schools having borne the brunt of the disaster.

“Our grant to Save the Children is the most substantial financial contribution to date from any donor. It will support Save the Children Fiji’s feeding programme for children from affected families.

“Save the Children works through local primary schools to provide nutritious lunch packs for children whose families lost their homes and livelihoods in the floods.

“New Zealand has taken a strong stand against Commodore Bainimarama and others involved in the overthrow of the Fijian government, including aid programme sanctions.

"However we remain committed to helping ordinary Fijians in times of need, and the assistance announced today is a further demonstration of that.

"The assistance will be directed via the government’s international aid and development agency, NZAID, to New Zealand Save the Children, which directly supports Save the Children Fiji," Mr Peters said.

New Zealand gave $35,000 to Fiji Red Cross to assist with relief efforts immediately after the floods.
