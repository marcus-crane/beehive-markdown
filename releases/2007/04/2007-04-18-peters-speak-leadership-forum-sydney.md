Foreign Minister Winston Peters will be making an opening address at the fourth annual Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum in Sydney on Sunday.

“The relationship with Australia is New Zealand’s most important and extensive," Mr Peters said.

"We continue to work very closely together on a broad range of foreign, trade and security policy issues, to promote our shared interests and to maximise our impact regionally and internationally.

“The Leadership Forum plays a vital role in bringing together key stakeholders from business, government and academia on both sides of the Tasman, with the intention of sustaining and invigorating the relationship, and to explore possible options for its ongoing development.

"This year, discussions will include development of the Single Economic Market and other areas of interest to the trans-Tasman business community; the environmental challenges facing both countries, and how we can further increase our cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region."

The Leadership Forum was established in 2004, with the first meeting held at Government House in Wellington. The Forum is currently co-chaired by James Strong from Australia (who is chairman of Insurance Australia Group) and John Allen from New Zealand (CEO of NZ Post).

Prior to the Forum, Mr Peters will join his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer at an ANZAC ceremony on Sunday morning, where he will lay a wreath and make a short speech.

On Sunday night, Mr Peters will fly to Turkey, where he will attend Gallipoli commemorations and hold talks in Istanbul. He then flies to Italy for a range of meetings, and on to Berlin for bilateral talks and the latest round of six-monthly consultations with the EU Presidency, currently held by Germany.

Mr Peters returns to New Zealand via Jakarta, where he will hold official consultations with his Indonesian counterpart Hassan Wirajuda.
