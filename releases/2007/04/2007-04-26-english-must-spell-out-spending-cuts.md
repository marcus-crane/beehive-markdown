National Party finance spokesman Bill English is again misleading the electorate in yet another sweeping attack on government spending, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The public should remember when Bill English was last a Cabinet Minister, a National government;

"Cruelly cut New Zealand Superannuation.

"Introduced user pays in public hospitals.

"Ran down the country's road network and sold the rail system.

"Introduced market related rentals for state house tenants.

"Charged all students interest on student loans.

"Mr English says he will not cut doctors, nurses or close hospitals. What does he intend to do?

"When he talks about "getting good value out of every taxpayer dollar", what does he really mean?

"The reason National is now issuing daily statements warning of future  
cuts to essential services under a National-led government, is that it wants to later say people were warned.

"But voters can only be fully forewarned if National's agenda is very  
clearly spelt out. National should treat voters with respect and spell out  
how much New Zealand Superannuation will be cut by, how much it will cost us to go to a public hospital and which road construction projects will be cancelled.

"Spell it out Mr English. Treat voters with respect," Dr Cullen said.
