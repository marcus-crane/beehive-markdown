Reform of the building sector takes another step forward with the opening today of consultation on registration standards and criteria for Building Consent Authorities.

City, district and regional councils wanting to undertake building control work are required by the Building Act 2004 to be accredited and registered as building consent authorities (BCAs) by 30 November this year.

Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove said councils have known since last December what the requirements for accreditation are, and are currently either working on getting their systems up to scratch, or are being audited to see if they meet the new standards.

"We are now asking for feedback on the proposed registration standards and criteria, which is the next step in the new BCA scheme. The consultation paper, Building Consent Authority Registration Standards and Criteria Proposals, invites submissions on the proposed registration requirements."

“We are keen to hear what councils and other interest groups think, and I urge them to have their say,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The focus in considering accredited organisations for registration will be on whether they are "fit and proper" and operate their businesses in ways that provide a high standard of consumer protection. Applicants other than territorial and regional authorities that wish to become registered, are required by the Building Act to demonstrate adequate means to meet civil liabilities.

“Councils have a statutory requirement to provide or arrange for building control services on a non-profit basis. They have building controls experience and electoral accountability and therefore no registration fees are proposed for councils, the cost of which will be absorbed by the government. The proposed fee for other applicants seeking registration is $5570 (GST exclusive), which reflects a full cost recovery approach," Mr Cosgrove said.

The government has provided $3 million to help councils achieve accreditation. The fund covers the provision of case advisors who are working one-to-one with councils, nationwide workshops on the accreditation requirements, and direct funding to councils to bring in outside experts to help them prepare for accreditation. The Department has also been providing guidance material and other support for the past three years.

The accreditation programme is part of the government's suite of reforms to transform the building sector. Other reforms include the Building Code review, the introduction of occupational licensing while protecting the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) tradition, the revamp of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service, the introduction of a financial assistance pilot for eligible owners of leaky homes, product certification, energy efficiency proposals for homes and workplaces, and the investigation of a home warranty insurance scheme.

“The overarching aim is to give people confidence and appropriate protections in all aspects of the building sector, so that homes are designed and built right first time,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The consultation paper is available at http://www.dbh.govt.nz/pub-bca-accreditation. Copies will be distributed to all councils and other interest groups. Submissions close on 18 May 2007.
