“I’m willing to work on the fine print,” said Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today in response to rising interest in the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Amendment Bill.

“I am hopeful submissions to me and to the Government Administration Select Committee provide useful guidance about how we strike a balance between the protection of private and personal information and access to, and use of, that information,” said Rick Barker.

“I have recently met with leading genealogists and expressed to them my willingness to consider options that form a compromise around my intention to prevent fraudsters’ inappropriate use of this kind of information and for the need to ensure that legitimate purposes for using the information are not prevented.

“Of highest concern to some is that the Bill proposes a complete stop on access to the information. This is not the case. There are some proposed restrictions, but these reflect 21st Century security concerns. There will still be open access to older records and there is provision for access to information for legitimate purposes. This has often been misrepresented or ignored.

“The media has a right to seek information; historians and genealogists contribute greatly to our understanding of New Zealand. They need access to information to make this contribution. But the threat posed by those seeking to steal the identities of New Zealanders is real. This Bill needs to strike a balance.

“There is strong support for the principle of the Bill and I welcome submissions on it. In terms of working out the finer detail to ensure we maintain a balance between the protection of private and personal information and access to it for legitimate purposes, my door has been and will continue to be open,” said Rick Barker.
