Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today underlined the importance of groups working in partnership to care for animals when there is extreme weather. "The need for co-ordinated work has been highlighted by dramatic weather events. Few of us from Canterbury have forgotten last year's snow. Back then we saw the critical relationship between climate, feed and animal welfare."

Jim Anderton was speaking in Wellington at a meeting of the National Animal Welfare Emergency Management Group. Members of the group represent the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Civil Defence and Emergency Management, Federated Farmers, the SPCA, the World Society of the Protection of Animals, and the New Zealand Veterinary Association.

The aim of the meeting was to share knowledge about planning for animal welfare during adverse events like storms and disease outbreaks. "In a country as dependent as ours on animals and weather, the welfare of our animals and their care is more than an academic or marginal issue," Jim Anderton said. "There are a lot of groups with a concern for animal welfare in New Zealand - and the benefits of working together in partnership are so clear that it is surprising that the national group is a recent initiative."

He urged all those with a stake in the animal industries to ensure they have high standards of care and are prepared for 'the inevitable'."Our community expects a well co-ordinated and efficient response to animal welfare issues during adverse events like storms. We are vulnerable, too, to international trade repercussions, unless we can demonstrate the highest standards of animal care. Consumers in our export markets increasingly want to know that products have been farmed ethically, and they will react to poor animal welfare stories. Negative stories in international media can badly damage our reputation," Jim Anderton said.

"The more knowledge we have, the better we can co-ordinate our responses and secure the viability of both individual farmers and the wider animal-based industries."
