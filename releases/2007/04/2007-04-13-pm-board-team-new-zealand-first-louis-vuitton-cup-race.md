Prime Minister Helen Clark will be onboard Emirates Team New Zealand for the first race of the Louis Vuitton Cup next Monday April 16.

The Prime Minister said she considered it an enormous privilege to be on the Emirates Team New Zealand boat for the first race of the challenger series off Valencia in Spain.

"What better way to show your support for the team than to join it," Helen Clark said.

"Emirates Team New Zealand has the goodwill of New Zealand as a country behind it.

"The government showed early support for this challenge, and that was critical to enable Emirates Team New Zealand to assemble the big sponsors necessary to mount the challenge.

"I am pleased to be able to support it," Helen Clark said.

Emirates Team New Zealand head, Grant Dalton, said the team was honoured.

“Having the Prime Minister on board for our first race against Mascalzone Latino is a great way to kick off the challenger series.”

The team will also have the rousing support of 18 Maori warriors paddling a waka (war canoe) alongside their yacht as they leave the port for the race course on Monday.

Tourism New Zealand and Toi Maori (New Zealand’s premier Maori arts organisation) have assembled four days of cultural activity in Valencia, including performances by the waka crew and renowned singer Hinewehi Mohi.

Tourism New Zealand CEO, George Hickton, said the number of international media assembled in Valencia right now presented a great opportunity to showcase Kiwi culture.

“More than 20 countries are broadcasting this event and about 100 media will attend a special cultural evening at the Emirates Team New Zealand base on Friday night, so it’s a great chance to promote our people and our country.”

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) is also making the most of the opportunity by hosting more than 400 influential business and investment decision makers throughout the campaign.

NZTE’s Commissioner General for the America’s Cup, Jane Cunliffe, said “Bringing key contacts to witness the America’s Cup in association with Emirates Team New Zealand is a unique and exciting relationship building opportunity for our exporters.

“We anticipate the deepening of business relationships leading to increased exports and investment for New Zealand.”

The Prime Minister will also open an art exhibition at Casa Museo Benlliure on Saturday April 14 featuring New Zealand artists including Gretchen Albrecht, Tony Lane, James Ross and Fiona Pardington.

An exhibition of New Zealand photos by Valencia photographer Jaume Fuster is also on show at the Valencia Botanical Gardens for the next month.
