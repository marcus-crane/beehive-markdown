Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced a new medal to recognise New Zealanders' service in the current deployment to Timor-Leste.

Helen Clark said that the New Zealand General Service Medal (Timor-Leste) is to be awarded to New Zealand Defence Force and New Zealand Police personnel who have served in Timor-Leste to provide stability and security since the outbreak of violence last April and May.

"New Zealanders were first deployed to East Timor in 1999 to help establish the stable conditions which enabled the nation of Timor-Leste to be built. This service was recognised with the award of the East Timor Medal. The end date eligibility for that medal will now be 27 April 2006.

"New Zealanders currently serving in Timor-Leste are on a different mission and as such, it is appropriate that this service is recognised with a different medal.

"New Zealand personnel have encountered many challenges in trying conditions over the past year. They have met these challenges and have played an important role in Timor-Leste's journey towards peace and stability. This medal will be a fitting recognition of these efforts.

"Eligibility criteria for the medal are being finalised and will require the assent of the Governor-General before awards can be made. It is anticipated that the first awards of the New Zealand General Service Medal (Timor-Leste) will be made in the second half of this year," Helen Clark said.

Phil Goff said that the New Zealand General Service Medal was instituted in 2002 and is awarded for operational service commenced since 1 January 2000.

"Each award consists of a standard medal suspended from a specially-designed ribbon which denotes the specific operation for which the award has been made. The General Service Medal is currently awarded for service in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Solomon Islands.

"The ribbon for the new medal incorporates the national colours of both Timor-Leste and New Zealand in a pattern of red, yellow, black, and white stripes," Phil Goff said.
