Prime Minister Helen Clark and associate Ministers in Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard and Mahara Okeroa today expressed sorrow at the news of the death of Don Selwyn ONZM, and extended their condolences and sympathy to his family.

“His death leaves an enormous gap in our drama and film communities, and in the hearts and lives of the many who knew, loved and respected him and his work. I extend my deepest sympathy to Don’s family, friends, and to the New Zealand film industry. His presence is irreplaceable and his legacy is invaluable,” Helen Clark said.

Judith Tizard said his contribution to stage and screen in New Zealand is unparalleled.

“There would be few people in this country who have not seen and enjoyed his work. From his early days treading the boards in Nola Miller’s Shakespeare Company; to his roles in iconic New Zealand movies such as Sleeping Dogs and Goodbye Pork Pie; and through to his extraordinary production of Shakespeare's Te Tangata Whai Rawa O Weneti; Don Selwyn’s work has inspired, thrilled and moved us all.

“As a mentor, supporter, educator and advocate he challenged us.”

Mahara Okeroa said Don made a huge contribution to promoting a Maori presence on and off screen in the film industry.

“Don’s gift was not limited to the roles and the productions he brought to us, but in his tireless commitment to promoting a Maori view and a Maori presence on our screens and stages.

“His gifts were his passion and dedication; his strength and his devotion - to his craft and to his people. Don’s unshakeable belief in the talent, the potential and the future of Maori in the industry he loved has been the benchmark for others in the industry. I know that there are many Maori actors, technicians; and creative stage and screen practitioners who will gratefully acknowledge the role that Don played in their careers,” he said.
