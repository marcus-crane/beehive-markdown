It's now up to National Party leader John Key to prove that he and his party are serious about addressing family violence in New Zealand, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"John Key's comments in his speech today are confusing and vague but do appear to show that his position now mirrors that of the Government," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"He talks about smacking not being the most effective way of disciplining children and acknowledges that the government does not want to criminalise good parents.

"This has always been the Government's position and is why Sue Bradford's Bill, as recommended by the Select Committee, is a useful tool to protect our children from family violence.

"So far John Key and the National Party have been polarising the debate and deliberately scaremongering rather than debating the Bill on its merits.

"I want to assure John Key that the government would not support any measure that would criminalise good parents.

"It's now up to John Key to put his money where his mouth is and prove to the country that he and his party are serious about addressing child abuse in New Zealand and that it's not just another case of him shifting his position to suit the audience and trying to get back into the news," said Mr Benson-Pope.
