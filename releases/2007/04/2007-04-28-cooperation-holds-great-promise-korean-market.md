Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today stressed the importance of New Zealand's trading relationship with Korea and the prospects for even greater partnership through agricultural cooperation. "Total two-way trade between New Zealand and Korea was worth over NZ$2.2 billion last year. There is much scope to grow this relationship on both sides."

Speaking to an audience of 100 in Seoul, he drew attention to the complementary strengths New Zealand and Korea have with respect to agriculture. "We are not a producer of rice. Nor are we an exporter of other items of sensitivity for Korea such as garlic, sesame, chilli, or ginger – and our growing cycles are counter-seasonal, so we can help to ensure a steady supply of high quality agricultural produce year-round."

Jim Anderton is on the second phase of a trade mission that has also included Japan. He had been asked to speak about the changing face of New Zealand agriculture. "For the early part of New Zealand’s economic history our exports were mainly to Europe. Today, the wider North Asia region is by far our single-most important trading region," he said. "Our partnership with Korea and with dynamic North Asian economies is the most important change in our agriculture-based industries in our modern history."

During his visit to Korea Jim Anderton signed an Agricultural Cooperation Arrangement with the Korean Agriculture Minister, Park Hong-soo, the first such agreement between Korea and a developed nation. Jim Anderton also attended the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding formalising a strategic partnership between Zespri and the Korean Kiwifruit Marketing Cooperative. "Both our countries have much to gain from these collaborative agreements between New Zealand and Korea."

He also spoke of the developing relationship with Korea in the area of science and innovation. "This is a very important relationship for New Zealand and I hope to see it grow. Science, research and technology will become even more important to our agricultural sector as we look towards the challenges both of our countries face. We can share our expertise with markets such as Korea, which in return can offer us millions of new affluent customers. Together we can grow the market for safe, healthy food, to the benefit of both Korean and New Zealand farmers," Jim Anderton said.
