Two important global treaties safeguarding cultural property, come into force in New Zealand tomorrow, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today.

New Zealand has signed up to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects.

Helen Clark said the final provisions of the Protected Objects Act 1975 passed by Parliament in 2006, also come into effect on 1 May. The provisions will enable New Zealand to meet its obligations to other parties to the Conventions.

“These Conventions are the two key international instruments dealing with cross-border trafficking of cultural property,” she said.

“A total 112 nations are party to the UNESCO Convention, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and France. A further 28 nations have ratified the UNIDROIT Convention, and this number is steadily growing.

“Signing up to these Conventions provides us with the legal teeth to seek the return of important cultural objects. In the past we have been the victim of unfortunate instances where valuable property has been removed illicitly from this country.

“The most famous example is the case of the Motunui Pataka panels in the ‘Ortiz’ case. If similar situations arise in the future, New Zealand will be able to seek redress from other signatory states to the Convention.”

The conventions will see the Ministry for Culture and Heritage work with the New Zealand Customs Service, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Interpol to secure the return of important cultural heritage items that have been illegally taken from New Zealand. The conventions are not retrospective in effect.

“As part of the agreement, New Zealand also commits to assisting other countries seeking the repatriation of cultural heritage objects illicitly imported here,” she said.

“The Customs Service has powers to seize protected foreign objects upon entry to New Zealand, when we have prior warning. In other cases, states and owners of such property will be able to seek redress through New Zealand courts.

“New Zealand’s participation in this international system demonstrates our continuing willingness to be a good global citizen,” Helen Clark said.
