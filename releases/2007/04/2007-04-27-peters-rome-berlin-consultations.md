Foreign Minister Winston Peters, who has been attending commemorations at Gallipoli, travels to Europe next week for talks with the European Union, Germany and Italy.

In Rome, Mr Peters' main meetings are with his Italian counterpart, Massimo D’Alema, and with senior United Nations officials of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP).

“Discussions in Italy will provide a chance to examine New Zealand’s place as a like-minded partner for Italy and for the European Union,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand and Italy work well together on a range of international issues, including Antarctica, and we both have troops in Afghanistan. Talks with the FAO and the WFP will also be important, as the government's aid and development agency NZAID works closely with both organisations.”

In Berlin, Mr Peters will take part in the latest round of consultations with the European Union Presidency, currently held by Germany. The European side will be led by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

“New Zealand and Europe are natural partners. We share a commitment to the same values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, and to a sense of international citizenship.

“These consultations are an invaluable opportunity to build on our longstanding ties with Europe and to find ways to develop an even greater level of engagement with them on a range of bilateral and multilateral affairs.

“Discussions will cover a range of political issues that have an impact on New Zealand's relationship with Europe.

"We will also exchange views on major international issues such as Iran, the Middle East and North Korea, and talk about developments in the Pacific, where we are delighted to see the EU playing a greater role,” Mr Peters said.
