Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope has today announced Enhanced Taskforce Green funding to help with the clean-up of flood damage in Northland.

“The funding will allow for the employment of workers, supervisors and associated costs," said Mr Benson-Pope.

“The workers will be recruited from local people on benefits, students, and workers who’ve been displaced from their jobs because of the flooding. 'Enhanced' means the full cost of workers' wages will be met by the Government.

“Work delivered through the taskforce can include fencing, building repairs, clean-up, re-sowing crops and clearing trees and debris."

Mr Benson-Pope said the funding package also includes start-up grants for the Far North and the Whangarei District Councils. This funding may include light equipment and safety gear, vehicle hire and other necessary tools.

A rural coordinator, employed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will manage the taskforce work on the ground.

“Individuals or groups needing help to clean up after the flooding can contact Work and Income on 0800 559 009 or approach their local Work and Income office," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Work and Income is also offering emergency assistance to people affected by the flooding. Recoverable assistance payments and Special Needs Grants are available to meet peoples’ immediate and essential needs.

This assistance is available for things like repair of septic tanks, the replacement of bedding and furniture, and help with accommodation or food costs.

“As we continue to assess the impact on communities, government services will evolve to meet those needs," said Mr Benson-Pope. "The Government is committed to helping the people of Northland get back to normal.”
