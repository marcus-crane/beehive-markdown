Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today announced that the government will be working with the Carers Alliance to develop a national Carers Strategy by 2008.

Speaking at the Carers New Zealand national summit in Wellington, Ruth Dyson acknowledged that carers devote large parts of their lives to others and need to be supported.

"Our government values the contribution made by carers and recognises that support for family and other informal carers needs to be assessed and a national strategy put in place," Ms Dyson said.

"The Ministry of Social Development, Carers New Zealand and the Carers Alliance, a network of 40 non-profit organisations, will work together with other government agencies over the coming year to build a strategy that will survey services and policies, as well as identify and address any policy or service gaps, over a five-year period.

"Widespread public consultation will be held later this year to seek the views of carers, those they care for, employers and wider society," Ms Dyson said.

Particular issues identified by New Zealand carers include improving support for carers, improving information about caring and helping carers to combine employment and caring responsibilities, or to make the transition to paid employment once their family circumstances allow.

The Strategy will be launched in 2008 and will set the strategic direction for the development of policies and service towards carers for the next decade. There will be a five-year action plan to support implementation.
