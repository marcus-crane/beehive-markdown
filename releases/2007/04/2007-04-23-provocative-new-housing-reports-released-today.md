Two new reports examining Auckland's housing market released today will help inform a comprehensive government response to affordable housing issues, Housing Minister Chris Carter says.

The two reports issued this morning by the Centre for Housing Research are:

·Housing Supply in the Auckland Region 2000- 2005, prepared by Motu Economic and Public Policy Research; and  
·The Future of Home Ownership and the Role of the Private Rental Market in the Auckland Region, prepared by DTZ New Zealand.

"The Labour-led government together with the Auckland Regional Council commissioned these reports to explore some of the factors behind Auckland's growing housing affordability problems," Mr Carter said.

"The findings will provoke debate. For instance, the number of working households in Auckland who can no longer afford to buy at the lower quartile house price has grown 169 per cent in the past decade to an estimated 54,900 households.

"Improved housing supply is identified as one way of helping these households, but achieving it will require compromise and new thinking," Mr Carter said.

"The government is currently working on a range of policy ideas to improve affordable housing supply. These will form the basis of a consultation document to be circulated among key stakeholders this year, with the possibility of legislation next year if needed."

Likely issues of discussion are:

·How to ensure there is the flexibility to create an ongoing supply of affordable housing where it is needed in new developments?  
·How to ensure land released for development is actually developed instead on sat on by speculators?  
·How to prevent covenants being placed on developments requiring houses that are far in excess of what a first-home buyer could afford? (House sizes have grown by 50 per cent in the past decade.)  
·How to improve consent processing by councils to minimise delays in land development?  
·How to further enhance housing intensification in urban areas?

"The government recognises that home ownership has been a big part of New Zealand's national identity. We believe we have a responsibility to do what we can to maintain this tradition, and ensure an evenness of opportunity between generations," Mr Carter said.
