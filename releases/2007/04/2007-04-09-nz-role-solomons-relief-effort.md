Defence Minister Phil Goff, today praised the role of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF), High Commission, NZAID and New Zealand NGO workers who are contributing to the emergency relief effort in the Solomons.

Mr Goff took the opportunity to accompany an Air Force C-130 Hercules flight delivering aid and NZDF personnel on a 24 hour visit to the Solomons on Easter Sunday and Monday.

"New Zealand has made an impressive and timely response to the relief effort here following last Monday's earthquake and tsunami," Mr Goff said.

"Two Air Force C-130 flights have delivered relief supplies and equipment, with yesterday's flight carrying a forklift and NZDF freight handling personnel. This will ensure the fast and effective movement of relief and reconstruction supplies from Honiara to the outlying districts affected by the disaster.

"The C-130 this morning transferred mosquito nets, tarpaulins, ground sheets and cotton blankets to Munda, to assist the estimated 5000 people who have lost their homes.

"The New Zealand platoon of 44 personnel attached to [RAMSI](http://www.ramsi.org/) is now predominantly deployed to the devastated areas in support of the assessment and relief team. Those remaining in Honiara this morning loaded supplies on to a Solomon Islands patrol boat for distribution to more remote areas.

"New Zealand Aid and the High Commission are working hard to coordinate New Zealand assistance including the $500,000 emergency grant announced earlier by Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

"I was particularly impressed by the sheer number of New Zealanders working here through NGOs including the Red Cross, Oxfam and World Vision. The New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management has also provided a planner Sarah Stuart-Black, to work with the United Nations Development Assessment and Coordination team," Mr Goff said.

"Current casualty levels are set at 37 confirmed dead, over 30 people medivaced with serious injuries, 916 homes destroyed and over 5000 people homeless.

"Sanitation and health needs are a key challenge at this stage, with strenuous efforts being made to prevent outbreaks of dysentery, malaria and other diseases.

"People are still frightened to come back to the coastal areas because of the aftershocks and fear that there may be another tsunami. However, for most their livelihoods depend on fishing and coastal gardens.

"There is also concern about trauma suffered especially by children and the need for psycho social counselling.

"Work being done will shortly move from a focus on emergency relief to rehabilitation and reconstruction.

"Currently the effort being made by the international community and agencies appears to be well coordinated and effective. New Zealand will continue to give assistance as required.

"In my meetings with the Minister of Home Affairs and the National Disaster Management Office, the Solomon Islands Government expressed their profound gratitude for the assistance given by New Zealand and New Zealanders," Phil Goff said.
