The Government is committed to maintaining and enhancing the water quality of New Zealand’s iconic lakes, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

A memorandum of understanding was signed today representing a joint long-term commitment to restore Rotorua (Te Arawa) lakes between the Crown and the Rotorua Lakes Strategy Trust consisting of the Te Arawa Lakes Trust, Rotorua District Council and Environment Bay of Plenty.

"Today’s memorandum is significant because all parties are agreeing to an ongoing working relationship to maintain and enhance the water quality of these treasured lakes," said Mr Benson-Pope, who signed the memorandum on behalf of the Crown.

"Managing water quality is one key to sustainability. This means taking a long term approach and thinking about what we do now and how that impacts on future generations," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Government is funding several projects tackling lake water quality issues around Rotorua. It has contributed $4 million towards the Ohau Channel diversion structure to provide short term remedial works for Lake Rotoiti. It has also provided $645,000 for land-user initiatives through the Ministry for the Environment’s Sustainable Management Fund, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Sustainable Farming Fund.

Other schemes include $4.48 million for sewerage reticulation upgrades funded through the Ministry of Health’s Sanitary Works Subsidy Scheme. Also, a $10 million science and research programme is being funded over 10 years through the Foundation for Research Science and Technology.

“This funding is an example of Government matching its long-term policy work with action on the ground,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

"We are providing clear direction and establishing relationships around the country in order to have a joint approach to tackling water quality and demand. Councils maintain primary responsible for managing water and water itself remains a public resource.”
