New legislation awaiting the outcome of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct will now progress with amendments implementing a number of the report's recommendations, Justice Minister Mark Burton said today.

The Commission's recommendations relating to the Police Complaints Authority fall within two main areas: recommendations relating to the handling of complaints by the Authority and those that require legislative change.

"All recommendations relating to the Police Complaints Authority in the Commission of Inquiry report will be implemented," Mark Burton said.

"As regards those recommendations requiring legislative change, these will be progressed through amendments to the Independent Police Complaints Authority Amendment Bill, which was put on hold until the outcome of the Inquiry was known for this very reason.

"Keeping this new legislation 'ready in the wings' means that we can now move quickly on the recommendations. The Bill provides an appropriate vehicle for implementing these changes and I have already instructed Justice officials to develop the appropriate amendments.

"In terms of those recommendations with an operational focus, I have spoken to Justice Goddard and she has indicated her intention to action those and that work is already underway on a number of them."

In addition to the Independent Police Complaints Authority Amendment Bill other steps have been taken to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the Authority. A team of four investigating officers was established to enable the PCA to independently investigate major matters. As part of Budget 2006 the Police Complaints Authority received an additional funding allocation of $550k.

"We also already have mechanisms in place to address some of the specific issues raised in the Inquiry report. The Commission recommends changes to the way sexual assault complaints are investigated and for the resourcing of groups involved in supporting complainants. The recently established Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence will take a leading role on recommendations in this area. The Taskforce supports the work of the Sexual Violence Ministerial Group, which I chair as Justice Minister and also comprises the Ministers of Women's Affairs, ACC and Police.

"Today Parliament will consider recommending that the Governor-General appoint Acting District Court Judge Michael Lance as Deputy Police Complaints Authority, which will further contribute to the Authority's effectiveness."
