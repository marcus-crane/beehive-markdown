By Housing Minister Chris Carter

A new report commissioned by the government has confirmed it: there are now an estimated 55,000 households in Auckland who can no longer afford to buy even the cheapest houses in the region.  
Thanks to soaring property prices, the number of these families has grown by 169 per cent since 1996.  
If this keeps up, the homeownership rate in Auckland will have sunk to 58 per cent by 2016, down from 72 per cent in 1991.  
For a Labour-led government that believes homeownership is a cornerstone of a healthy and stable society, the situation demands attention.  
Over the past year, officials and I have been exploring how the government can help in a market in which 95 per cent of houses are privately owned. We have looked at how the UK, the US and Australia handle similar problems, and we have identified three sets of initiatives that could sensibly be applied in New Zealand to boost homeownership.  
The first set of initiatives essentially comprises lending schemes to directly assist young people into homes. A good example is the Welcome Home Loan Scheme, which is already in place. It underwrites a particular subset of households who are on the margins of traditional bank lending criteria. Some 2000 families have already used the scheme to buy homes in rural and provincial areas, and on urban fringes. A Shared Equity scheme to help young families living in higher priced metropolitan centres is also under development.  
The second set of initiatives involves the use of Crown land in particular metropolitan markets, such as Auckland, to develop more affordable housing for first-time buyers. The flagship of this concept is Housing New Zealand's development of the old army base land at Hobsonville where some 3000 houses are to be built, 15 percent of which will comprise affordable housing and first homes.  
In many respects, these initiatives are natural precursors to the third, and most complex area of work the government is undertaking – how to stimulate a greater supply of affordable housing in the private property market, over which the government doesn't have direct control.  
In recent years a combination of market factors, demand and zoning rules have biased newly constructed housing in favour of larger homes on larger sections. House sizes nationally have increased by 50 per cent, and the larger the home the larger the price.  
We now have the perverse situation where some new developments on scarce land around our metropolitan centres have covenants over them effectively requiring the construction of expensive homes far in excess of anything a first-time buyer could afford.  
New housing comprises only about a fifth of the total housing market. Nevertheless, in the past new 'nappy valley' subdivisions played an important role in providing first homes. Not any more.  
There have been some controversial proposals put forward to tackle this problem.  
One, such as abolishing or moving Auckland's Metropolitan Urban Limit to increase land supply, was canvassed in a second government-funded research paper published this week. It is an idea popular with developers, but one that, understandably, will meet with significant resistance in Auckland.  
I believe there is room to improve land supply in some areas around the country. Processes already exist for adjustments to the Metropolitan Urban Limit in Auckland. In fact Housing New Zealand is seeking an extension of it for its Hobsonville development.  
There is also room to improve the processing times for resource consents by some councils to speed up decision-making on developments, but I don't believe these measures will ease housing affordability problems on their own.  
There is absolutely no point in releasing more land if only large, expensive houses continue to be built on it. Similarly, there is no point in releasing more land if it is not developed, and in Auckland large tracks of already available land haven't been.  
Speculators have been buying it up and sitting on it until prices rise through the roof. This is inhibiting supply and eventually hitting first-time buyers, and it is a problem that needs to be confronted.  
The government is preparing a discussion paper about how to deal with exactly these kinds of issues, and specifically, whether incentives used overseas to promote the construction of mixed developments comprising a proportion of affordable housing, will help.  
If legislation is necessary we will consider it. Homeownership is simply too important to allow it to fall by the wayside.
