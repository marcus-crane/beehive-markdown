Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today announced the government is seeking public feedback on the definition of "serious harm" as stated in Schedule 1 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.

"The current definition of serious harm has not been amended since the Act came into force in 1993. A review is timely and I welcome the public's input on this," said Ruth Dyson.

"I need to make sure it is clear and relevant to today’s workplaces, so I would like to hear from as many people as possible."

"The definition of serious harm is central to the Act. It helps employers manage hazards and outlines what their notification requirements are. It also gives employees direction in terms of their rights to refuse to do dangerous work, and defines inspectors’ powers to issue prohibition notices."

As a basis for the consultation, the Department of Labour has released a discussion paper that contains a draft revised definition. The draft addresses areas of improvement that arose from initial consultation with businesses and stakeholder groups.

The document includes a summary of questions for consultation and provides some of the background and context to the existing legislation.

After submissions close, the feedback will be reviewed and any amendments to alter the existing definition will be developed.

The discussion paper and more information can be found at the Department of Labour website:

The public has until **15 June 2007** to make a submission.
