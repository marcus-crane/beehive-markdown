Government officials have been asked to look at ways to come up with further options for dog control, following the fatal dog attack on a Murupara woman, says Associate Local Government Minister, Nanaia Mahuta.

"Like the rest of the country, I am appalled by this attack and my sympathy goes out to the family of Virginia Ohlson," said Ms Mahuta.

"I have asked officials to look at whether a more comprehensive approach should be taken to the designation of dogs as dangerous and menacing, under the law.

"The government has strengthened the law around dog control in 2003 to provide local authorities with a number of mechanisms to allow stronger enforcement on dogs.

"One of the major issues is confirmation of dog breeds and types and microchipping allows us to verify this, because either a vet or the dog control officer needs to physically sight the dog.

"Microchipping is part of a broader package of dog control measures already available, however this terrible event signals the need for a fresh look both at enforcement and the provisions of the law as it stands."
