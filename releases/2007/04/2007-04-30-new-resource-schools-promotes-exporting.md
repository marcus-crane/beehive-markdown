An Export Year initiative focused on the teaching of global trade-related concepts in the social sciences curriculum is being launched at Wadestown School in Wellington by Trade Minister Phil Goff and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today.

"Thinking Globally is a teaching aide containing information and resources to support a series of learning activities that promote the importance of a global economy to New Zealand’s future at both primary and secondary school level," said Phil Goff and Trevor Mallard.

"This programme aims to develop students' awareness of the place of New Zealand in the global economy and the importance of this for our successful economic performance. Exporting doesn’t just benefit the businesses exporting; it benefits all New Zealanders.

"Thinking Globally forms part of a wider strategy by the Ministry of Education called Education for Enterprise - which focuses on students learning about enterprise, innovation and business. It enables schools to design lessons that use local enterprise, local contexts and resources and opportunities relevant to students and their communities.

"Initial feedback from teachers and the business community on Thinking Globally has been very supportive. It has been presented to various business groups via the Export Year Business Reference Group which, we hope, will encourage a proactive response from the business community to support these resources.

"Thinking Globally includes elements on global trade, economic sustainability and the importance of exporting. A key element of the programme will be profiling and championing successful New Zealand exporters by encouraging teachers to look into their local communities to use enterprising and innovative local exporters as case studies," said Phil Goff and Trevor Mallard.
