Transport Minister Annette King today opened a new consulate office Guangzhou, China.

"New Zealand is continually working to develop governmental, and cultural relations with China,” Ms King said in Guangzhou today.

“It is my great pleasure to announce in Guangzhou, the opening of New Zealand’s new Consulate General in China, and to confirm that the first New Zealand Consul-General in Guangzhou will be Alan Young.”

“It is 16 years since New Zealand opened its last consulate in China, in Shanghai. It is appropriate that this significant expansion of New Zealand representation in Guangzhou takes place during celebrations of the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China, and during a period of rapid growth in our bilateral ties,” Ms King said.

Guangzhou is a major centre of commerce and tourism for New Zealanders in southern China. The Guangzhou consulate will provide consular services in five provinces and autonomous regions in China: Guangdong province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Hainan Province, Hunan Province and Fujian Province.

Guangzhou has a sister city relationship with Auckland City, New Zealand’s largest city.

With the opening of the Guangzhou consulate, New Zealand has four offices with diplomatic status in China and Hong Kong, the Embassy in Beijing, and Consulate-Generals in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
