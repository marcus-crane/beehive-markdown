International education consulting agency New Zealand Polytechnics International New Zealand (PINZ) has won a landmark multi-million dollar contract in Bahrain, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

PINZ - which is owned by government tertiary institutions across New Zealand - will lead the development and implementation of the new Polytechnic of Bahrain - in what is the largest education contract won by New Zealand to-date in the Middle East.

"This significant contract reflects New Zealand’s strong reputation as a high-quality education service provider in Bahrain. It is a huge fillip to the kiwi international education industry, and demonstrates that New Zealand is regarded as having world-leading services in the field of technical and vocational education and training," Trevor Mallard said.

"It is also great to see that work by our government has paid off. PINZ was part of the delegation of education service providers that I took to the Middle East, including Bahrain in 2005. Bahraini officials came here the following year, and were hosted by PINZ and NZTE early this year, as they undertook due diligence for the polytechnic contract."

"In addition to support from NZTE, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education have also helped pave the way for this contract. Winning the project highlights how a number of institutions and agencies in the international education sector can work together to take our education expertise to the world," Dr Cullen said.

"This is an excellent example of one of the four key outcomes identified in the government’s International Education Agenda, which is to strengthen domestic education providers, academically and financially, through international linkages.

"The agenda, which will be released for discussion on 18 April, supports a strategic approach by all parties involved in international education. The Gulf states are a region the government has focused its education diplomacy activities on, including the location of an education attache in the region," Dr Cullen said.

The Bahraini project - the creation of a new Polytecnic
