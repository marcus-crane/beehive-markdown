The lead Minister for Families Young and Old, Steve Maharey, says non-government organisations (NGOs) have a crucial role in working with government to deliver social services, and it intends to step up that relationship.

Steve Maharey is today addressing the Salvation Army 'Just Action 07' conference in Christchurch, highlighting new plans to build stronger relations between the government and the NGO sector.

"The Labour-led government will shortly be announcing details of a new approach to working with the child and family services sector, called a 'Pathway to Partnership'.

"This will involve a whole new attitude to funding that supports collaboration with central government, and between those delivering services to children and families.

"The new approach will stress the importance of delivering outcomes, with the primary focus on the multiple needs of a child or a family.

"Working closely with NGOs such as the Salvation Army boosts both their capacity and the ability of government agencies to progress the priority areas under the governments theme of Families Young and Old (FY&O).

Families Young & Old is one of three themes that set the governments agenda to support the transformation and sustainability of New Zealand. The other two are Economic Transformation and National Identity.

"The Ministers involved in FY&O will meet shortly to examine this new approach and to discuss a range of issues the government will discuss with the NGO sector.

More details will be announced in the budget.
