Pacific Island Affairs Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the drop in unemployment for Pacific Island people.

"Latest figures show a drop to 2568 Pacific people on the Unemployment Benefit, less than a quarter of the more than 12,300 unemployed in December 1999", Mr Goff said.

"Most important is the dramatic drop in the number of unemployed Pacific young people.

"There are now just 194, 18 and 19 year old Pacific people receiving an Unemployment Benefit. This is an 87 percent reduction from the 1544 unemployed Pacific young people when this Government took office in 1999.

"The [latest Department of Labour figures](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/lmr-pacific-outcomes.asp) show employment growth for Pacific peoples rose by 3.8 per cent annum over the period 2001 to 2006. The economy-wide average for the same period was 2.7 per cent per annum.

"Behind these figures are real people for whom having a job is making a real difference in their lives and aspirations.

"A strong economy and good economic management have been major contributing factors. Government employment initiatives have also made a tangible difference over the years. In particular Work and Income's Pacific Wave strategy, which focuses on getting Pacific Island people into work in Auckland, has been effective.

"The Government's [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz) package and [increasing the minimum wage](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28842) from $7 in 1999 to $11.25 an hour from 1 April this year have also boosted the incentives for people to get into the work force by making work pay.

"[Norman Kirk](http://www.primeminister.govt.nz/oldpms/1972kirk.html) once said that among the most important things in life was having a job and something to hope for. As a former Labour Prime Minister, he would be proud of the track record of this Labour-led Government", Mr Goff said.
