Foreign Minister Winston Peters is urging Fiji to abide by the commitments it has made to the European Union over the holding of democratic elections, the respect for human rights and the rule of law.

"During consultations over the possible suspension of EU development assistance as a result of the coup, Fiji undertook to hold elections by 1 March 2009," Mr Peters said.

"This is a good outcome, which we welcome. Fiji has possibly averted the suspension of EU aid, but the EU will be expecting to see the interim administration in Fiji take concrete steps that prove they will live up to the commitments made in Brussels this week.

"The outcome of the EU consultation is consistent with the recent Pacific Forum Foreign Ministers meeting in Vanuatu, and the Eminent Persons Group report, which both believed elections could be held sooner than the three-to-five years' timetable nominated by Commodore Frank Bainimarama.

"Many countries, including New Zealand, attach a great deal of importance to an election timetable of 18 months to two years. It is pleasing to see the EU reaffirm the credibility of such a time frame.

"As a friend of Fiji, New Zealand wants to see the earliest possible return to democracy, and we are happy to discuss the logistics of that process," Mr Peters said.
