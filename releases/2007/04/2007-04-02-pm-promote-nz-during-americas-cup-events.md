Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that she is to take part in trade, cultural, tourism, and sports promotional activities during Americas Cup events in Valencia, while on an official visit to Spain starting next week.

Helen Clark departs 9 April for Portugal, Spain and Singapore, returning to New Zealand on 19 April.

In Spain, the Prime Minister will have official talks in Madrid, and participate in trade and tourism promotions associated with [New Zealand’s America’s Cup challenge](http://www.emiratesteamnz.com/).

"The staging of the [America’s Cup](http://www.americascup.com/en/) in Valencia provides a unique opportunity to promote New Zealand in Spain. I am looking forward to supporting Team New Zealand as racing in the Louis Vuitton Cup gets under way,” Helen Clark said.

"The visit to Madrid will be only the second visit by a New Zealand Prime Minister, after Jim Bolger visited following the Seville Expo in 1992. Spain’s development as a major international force both economically and politically, makes this a timely visit. The opening of the Spanish embassy in Wellington this year indicates that the bilateral relationship is growing.

"A key focus of discussions will be the [United Nations Alliance of Civilisations](http://www.unaoc.org/) initiative, which is co-sponsored by Spain. The Alliance of Civilisations is part of international efforts to foster a better understanding between Western and Islamic cultures, particularly to combat religious radicalisation, and rebuild relations with the Muslim world.

"New Zealand, which co-sponsors the [Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith Dialogue](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/1-Global-Issues/Security/Interfaith-Dialogue.php), is preparing to host a high-level symposium to discuss the implications for the Asia Pacific region of the Alliance of Civilisations report."

Helen Clark will hold talks with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will call on King Juan Carlos and a range of Spanish Ministers.

In Portugal the Prime Minister will hold talks with Prime Minister Jose Socrates, the Speaker of Parliament, and a Minister with a special interest in Timor-Leste.

"This is the first ever visit at prime ministerial level between the two countries, in either direction. We have had limited engagement in the past with Portugal, but we now share a real interest in the stability and development of Timor-Leste. Portugal was one of four countries, including New Zealand, to send forces to Timor Leste following riots in Dili last year.

"My discussions will also focus on New Zealand’s relationship with the European Union, one of our most important bilateral relationships, given that Portugal will take over the EU presidency for the second half of this year."

The final leg of the visit will be to Singapore, one of New Zealand’s closest friends in the South East Asian region.

"Prime Minister Lee [visited New Zealand last year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26112). My visit to Singapore is an opportunity to continue our high level of engagement, particularly as Singapore will be hosting the East Asia Summit later this year."

"On the economic side, the newly negotiated [Trans Pacific Economic Partnership Areement](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-agreements/Trans-Pacific/0-implementation.php) (P4) sits alongside our [bilateral CEP with Singapore](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/0--Trade-agreements/Singapore/0-cep-jointstatement.php) as an indication of both governments' wish to develop greater economic depth in the relationship.

"Two-way trade with Singapore is already worth some NZ$2.3 billion. These economic connections are now leveraging into stronger ties in research and development, particularly in the creative media and in life sciences and bio-medical research. The visit will be an opportunity to highlight recent joint research and commercial ventures in these new and exciting areas," Helen Clark said.
