Judith Collins has once again got it wrong. Her latest statement regarding vulnerable families is based solely on misinformation, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"Contrary to her press statement, Ms Collins is well aware that [the Vulnerable Families initiative was announced on 22 September last year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27200) in response to the Kahui tragedy and widespread concern about inter-generational benefit dependency," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The initiative targets our most vulnerable families who have complex problems that can become overwhelming. These families haven’t necessarily accessed all the support they need from social service agencies.

"The initiative began at the end of September and identifies families through a combination of Work and Income and local agency knowledge. It is currently  
supporting 52 families with 199 children.

"There’s a range of possible indicators of a family needing more support than they're currently getting such as intergenerational benefit use, a high truancy rate, or transience," he said.

A Work and Income Service Co-ordinator is assigned to each family and provides intensive case management, drawing together the services and expertise of all the relevant government and non-government agencies.

As an example, one family supported under this initiative - a sole parent with five children - was living in overcrowded accommodation and had care and protection concerns with the children. The older children had also been involved with Police over issues of wilful damage, theft and violent behaviour. Through the vulnerable families initiative the children are now attending school regularly with the youngest child enrolled in pre-school. They are now settled in appropriate accommodation in an environment in which the children are thriving.

"Vulnerable Families lets us use the knowledge we already have, and extend the work we already do, to provide more intensive, co-ordinated support to families that need it most," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The initiative has been widely reported by media and the Social Services Select Committee, of which Ms Collins is a member, was briefed on it late last year.

"Judith Collins should stop using these vulnerable families as a political football and at least acknowledge that the government has taken decisive action on the matter, instead of pretending otherwise," said Mr Benson-Pope.
