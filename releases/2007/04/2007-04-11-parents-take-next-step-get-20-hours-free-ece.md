The Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, has today launched the latest phase of the roll out of the 20 Hours Free Early Childhood Education (ECE) policy, which will allow parents to start signing their children up.

"Attestation forms and a new Parent Information Booklet will be available to parents of three and four year olds from ECE centres from this week onwards. Up to 92,000 three and four year olds will be eligible for 20 Hours Free ECE from 1 July.

"This policy is designed to make ECE more affordable for parents, and boost participation levels in ECE. It gives parents more choices about laying a quality foundation for their child's lifelong learning."

The Minister has today presented the owners of the Wilton branch of Childspace Early Learning Centre with the form and booklet. The owner of the centre, Toni Christie, says this policy is going to make a huge difference to parents, saving them up to $80 a week.

"All ECE services can now start ordering the attestation forms and offering them to parents. The Parent Information booklet will also be available from ECE services to explain how 20 Hours Free will work, and the rules and responsibilities of parents and services.

"The 20 Hours Free information line has received more than 3300 calls since it was launched in March, from parents wanting to know more about how they can benefit from 20 Hours Free ECE.

"Ministry of Education officials are still travelling the country doing face-to-face training workshops with providers. Phase two of that training will begin on 17 April, providing budgeting tips and advice on the documents and forms needed for centres to make their first funding claim from next month.

"Now that the enrolment form and booklet for 20 Hours Free are available to parents, we are another step closer to the government's goal of increasing participation in ECE."
