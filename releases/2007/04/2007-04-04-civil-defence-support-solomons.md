Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today that New Zealand is sending civil defence expertise to help in the aftermath of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the Solomon Islands.

“Following a request from the Solomon Islands Government, a United Nations Disaster and Assessment Coordination (UNDAC) team comprising disaster management professionals is being deployed to the Solomon Islands”, said Rick Barker.

“I am pleased that as part of New Zealand’s contribution to recovery efforts in the Solomon’s, an employee of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management is part in this UNDAC deployment.

“The UNDAC team will also have representatives from Australia’s AusAID and Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board, and various UN agencies. The deployment is expected to last three weeks,” said Rick Barker.

The New Zealand Government has already announced that it is making an initial $500,000 contribution to the Solomon Islands and is providing humanitarian supplies.
