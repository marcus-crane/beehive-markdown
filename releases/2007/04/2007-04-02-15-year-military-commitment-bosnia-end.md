New Zealand Defence Force personnel are to be withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina after a 15-year contribution to peace and stability to that country, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"Our current deployment comprises an eight person liaison and observation team which will be withdrawn this month and three staff officers who will leave Bosnia-Herzegovina in July", Mr Goff said.

"The decision to withdraw our personnel was made in consultation with the British forces to which we have been attached and the European Union-led Stabilisation Force (EUFOR) which controls the international deployment.

"It follows the United Kingdom's announcement that the bulk of its forces will pull out of Bosnia by the end of this month. At the same time the European Union is reducing its military presence from 6000 to 2000 this year.

"New Zealand has relied on the larger United Kingdom force to support its deployment in areas like logistics. It makes sense for us to withdraw our personnel in conjunction with the British wind-down.

"The role of EUFOR has evolved to the point where its forces are presently limited to reassuring the Bosnian population rather than deterring armed forces. The focus of peace support operations has now shifted to political and civil institution building. As a result the requirement for a military presence is reducing.

"We have come a long way from the appalling conflict and genocide which Bosnia-Herzegovina was victim to in the early 1990s.

"New Zealand can be proud of the role it has played in helping bring peace to the region. At the peak of the deployment, the New Zealand Defence Force contributed a 250 strong infantry company to Bosnia-Herzegovina.

"Our contribution demonstrated our commitment to UN-led and subsequent multinational operations there in support of peace and stabilisation, and was much appreciated by the European Union and the wider international community", Phil Goff said.
