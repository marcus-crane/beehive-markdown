A new youth residential home, which provides young people at risk of reoffending with an opportunity to turn their lives around and avoid a life of crime, was opened by Justice Minister Mark Burton in Hamilton today.

The completion of Te Hurihanga residence at Te Ara Hou Village brings to fruition three years of work. The residence provides an intensive programme for young male offenders between the ages of 14 and 17 years.

Te Hurihanga loosely translates as the "turning point" and is an intensive programme tailored to meet the specific needs of each of the eight young people who will be resident in the programme at any given time.

"Young offenders must always understand that there are consequences for their actions, but there must also be support for those young people who choose to take a more positive path.

"The Te Hurihanga programme itself is unique to New Zealand. It is highly innovative, drawing on best practice approaches from around the world that are aimed at preventing and reducing re-offending by youth.

"The programme is tailored to suit each young person and is delivered by highly skilled staff, who will provide a graduated, intensively supervised, reintegration to the young person’s home and community. It will curb reoffending and contribute to making Hamilton a safer place," Mark Burton said.

The programme is delivered by Youth Horizons, which provides youth programmes around the country, and offers a mix of education and life skills training as well as healthcare.

"There has been support in the community for this initiative, there have also been those who have opposed its location. Now, with the opening of the residence I hope that we can put the debate behind us and focus on creating a positive environment in which young people, their families, and their community can be supported."

Te Hurihanga is located in the Te Ara Hou Village on Morrinsville Road alongside other community and social services offered within the village.
