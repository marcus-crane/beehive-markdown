Minister Responsible for the Law Commission Mark Burton welcomed the [Law Commission report](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/ProjectPressReleases.aspx), Reforming the Law of Sedition, which was tabled in Parliament today.

"I commend and thank the Law Commission for its comprehensive report. The report sets out the history of the common law relating to sedition; examines New Zealand sedition law; discusses sedition in other jurisdictions; and considers whether New Zealand still needs a law of sedition", Mark Burton said.

The Law Commission’s recommendation is that the seditious offences set out in sections [81](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=233008&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1961-043%2Fs.81&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1961-043/s.81) to [85](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=233008&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1961-043%2Fs.85&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1961-043/s.85) of the Crimes Act 1961 be repealed and not replaced.

"The recommendation made in the report will require a considered response from the Government".

The Government's response to the report will be presented to Parliament by October 2007.
