Associate Minister of Justice Clayton Cosgrove today welcomed the passing of the Justices of the Peace Amendment Bill by Parliament, saying its reforms would help Justices in their work and enhance public confidence in the office.

“The legislation modernises the law governing an important community voluntary institution for the first time in 50 years,” Mr Cosgrove said. "The Bill amends the Justices of the Peace Act 1957 in three key areas - training, discipline and retirement."

“The already high quality and consistency of the work carried out by Justices of the Peace (JPs) will be improved through the introduction of compulsory training prior to appointment, robust new disciplinary rules and retirement provisions,” he said.

The new Justices of the Peace Amendment Act 2007 sets out:  
·Training requirements, including specialised training for Justices who wish to exercise a judicial function.  
·A disciplinary regime that provides the grounds for the removal or suspension of a JP, as well as less severe measures including censure or additional training or counselling where required. Previously the only disciplinary option was removal from office, without specifying the grounds for this.

"Specifying the disciplinary regime in legislation will provide consistent and transparent procedures in decision-making, as well as indicate the high standard of behaviour that is expected of JPs as respected members of the community," Mr Cosgrove said.

The Act also recognises long service by allowing former JPs who have served for at least 10 years to apply to use the title “JP (Retired)”.

Mr Cosgrove thanked the Royal Federation of New Zealand Justices’ Associations for its support and advice throughout the Bill’s development.

“Justices of the Peace have a proud history of service to the community, providing many hours of voluntary time and effort in the performance of their duties,” he said.

"This Act will assure the New Zealand public can continue to have confidence in the office of Justices of the Peace, and give the hardworking men and women who serve their communities as JPs a modern framework to work within."
