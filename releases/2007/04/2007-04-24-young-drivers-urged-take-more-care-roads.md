"Drivers between the age of 15 and 19 are seven times more likely to crash than drivers in the 45 to 49 age group," Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

"The facts are sobering. Young people in New Zealand continue to be over represented in the road toll.

"Inexperience, coupled with immaturity, are the main reasons for the number of young people dying on our roads. Most young people are responsible, but there are some who do not realise the limitations of their experience or the implications of the risks they take," said Mr Duynhoven, speaking at a seminar to mark the first United Nations Global Road Safety Week (23 – 29 April).

In an effort to address some of these issues, the Government initiated a nationwide series of workshops to hear the public's views about road safety last year. Feedback from the workshops contributed to the development of the Government's Road Safety Policy Statement, released in December. This document sets out the road safety problems that New Zealand is facing, including young and novice drivers, and offers a range of possible ways forward which are now being evaluated.

"This may include changes to New Zealand's graduated driver licensing system. Our system is undoubtedly effective and over time it has been shown to contribute to a marked reduction in crashes. However, there is a high level of non-compliance and the current system of fining young people $400 per offence is not providing sufficient incentives to ensure compliance with the conditions.

"They often ignore the high fines because they cannot pay them. The government is currently looking at ways to better encourage young people to respect the conditions. This will yield further safety gains.

"We are also looking at changing the demerit points system to make greater use of driver suspension as a deterrent. Loss of licence is a real inconvenience. I expect to receive advice on a range of policy options in the next couple of months,” said Harry Duynhoven today.
