A new way to manage fire risk and strengthen rescue services in New Zealand is outlined in a public discussion document [released today](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F29007) by Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker.

“Under the proposals there will be a new national fire and rescue service, based on delivery of services by local brigades with strong central support,” Rick Barker said.

“The new national fire and rescue service would have a pivotal leadership role. Around eighty-six management systems are currently in place for fire services and the proposed new structure will ensure resources are allocated more efficiency.

“A key strength of our fire service is that it is highly responsive to community needs. The proposed ‘local delivery-central support’ structure builds on this strength by ensuring local communities remain engaged in their own protection.

“The proposed structure provides a great opportunity for fire and rescue services to work with local Civil Defence and Emergency Management groups to both improve readiness and help recover from emergencies.

“Rural fire authorities would continue to look after some important aspects of fire risk management but could opt to transfer responsibilities to the new service. The Department of Conservation and the New Zealand Defence Force would continue to manage fire risk in conservation and defence areas. Forest owners current arrangements are largely unaffected, as they wished.

“A new funding system is also proposed to ensure the national service is supported from a fair and sustainable base.

“At the moment our fire and rescue services are funded through fire-insured property. This fails to reflect the mandate of today’s fire services, which includes attendance at floods, hazardous substance incidents and car crashes.

“Under the proposals contributions would come from an expanded base of insured property and from a larger pool of motor vehicles.

“The proposals represent a new way forward that will meet New Zealand’s needs for the next 30 years and beyond,” said Rick Barker.

Main benefits of the proposal would be:

- A stronger national organisation to lead regional planning and coordinate fire services, developing minimum national standards for all providers
- A wide mandate for rescue and legal protection for fire and rescue workers
- Standardised brigade system and support for all volunteers
- Flow on benefits to civil defence emergency management
- More equitable funding system

The proposal document is available [here](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Legislative-Reviews-Review-of-Fire-Legislation-Discussion-Documents?OpenDocument) and submissions close on Saturday 30 June.
