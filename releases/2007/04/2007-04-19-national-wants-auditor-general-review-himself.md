The National Party's "call" for the Auditor-General to review the Government's 2006 Financial Statements is a sad attempt at a publicity stunt, Climate Change Minister David Parker says.

"The Auditor-General has already reviewed the accounts relating to New Zealand's Kyoto deficit so Nick Smith's grandstanding is meaningless."

"The figures used in the accounts for deforestation are based on the Government's clearly expressed policy since October 2002 that taxpayer liability for deforestation will be capped at 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide," David Parker said.

"The figures adopted by Dr Smith are based on an unrealistic, theoretical scenario which assume no Government policy in place to control greenhouse gas emissions."

"All of Treasury's figures, including the international price of carbon used in the calculations, have been audited, and the background and assumptions used are freely available on government websites."

"If Nick Smith has a problem with Treasury or the Auditor-General he should go and talk to them, instead of trying to create dramas where there are none."

"More importantly, National should come clean. Will they support effective measures to control the greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change, or will they refuse to support them and try to blame others for increases in emissions?"
