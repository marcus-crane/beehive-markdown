The new leader of the National Party, Bill English, has laid out a clear case for electoral spending reform if the public is to understand the confusing leadership structure of the National Party, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today

"Mr English's first press release since resuming the leadership criticises the proposed plans to clean up the rules around election funding," said Dr Cullen.

"National clearly needs some help if the electorate is going to understand who really is the leader of the party.

"It is ironic the very party whose reliance on secret funding and a third party parallel campaign is rejecting the need for reform.

"If there was any doubt about the need for reform of election spending rules, this was dispelled by Nicky Hager's book, the Hollow Men. I would have thought that Mr English of all people would be endorsing reform as his party tries to put this disgraceful period behind it.

"The proposals being put forward by my colleague Justice Minister Mark Burton involve a clear choice – an open transparent system or the continuation of the current system which, as Mr Hager's book proved, is open to secret trusts and secret influence," Dr Cullen concluded.
