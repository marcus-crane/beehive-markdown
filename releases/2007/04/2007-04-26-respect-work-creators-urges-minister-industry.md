Creativity is encouraged when the ownership rights of those that create music, art, and other endeavours are respected, Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard and creative industry representatives said today.

April 26 is World Intellectual Property Day, a day when countries that are members of the World Intellectual Property Organisation celebrate creativity. Ms Tizard, who is the minister responsible for intellectual property issues in New Zealand, said World Intellectual Property Day was an excellent opportunity to honour those who created artistic works.

“These people work hard to create, and their success depends very much on the level of respect we as consumers have for their intellectual property rights. New Zealand has good intellectual property rules, and this makes it a good place for creators and people who use creative works in their businesses.”

As part of the New Zealand activities celebrating World Intellectual Property Day, three prominent New Zealand artists have been interviewed on copyright issues. The filmclips were launched today (10.30am) at the headquarters of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in Auckland. (Unit 113, Zone 23, 21-23 Edwin St, Mt Eden)

Today’s launch is the first of a series of activities in a campaign to raise awareness about intellectual property and copyright issues.

Recording Industry Association of New Zealand spokesman Campbell Smith said advances in technology have provided the copyright creator and the copyright consumer with terrific opportunities.

“The music industry must provide consumers with access to music as the consumer wants, how he wants, when he wants and in return the consumer must pay a fair price for that consumption.

“The big winners in the era of digital music are consumers. They have effectively been given access to 24 hour music stores and services with unlimited shelf space. The consumer is king. But only for as long as there is something to consume. In order for good music to continue to be recorded, produced and distributed, it must be paid for. People need to understand that respect for copyright is crucial if we are to continue to be able to make and provide great music for their enjoyment.”

APRA spokesman Anthony Healey said creative and innovative talents were important to New Zealand and our future in the world.

“Sometimes it’s easy to forget that someone actually wrote that great song, painted that painting or spent years developing that amazing novel. These people deserve our respect, encouragement and fair reward for their work."

Copyright Licensing Ltd chief executive Kathy Sheat said World Intellectual Property Day was a wonderful opportunity to celebrate intellectual property and its rich and diverse creations.

“As technologies develop, there are more and more opportunities to create new works, new products, new medicines, new ways of doing things ... all of which stimulate further growth and development. We need to respect IP and protect creators' ability to get a fair return for their endeavours, if we want to benefit from their innovation and creation.”

New Zealand Federation Against Copyright Theft executive director Tony Eaton said World Intellectual Property Day was a timely reminder of the need to protect our creative industries from copyright infringement.

“It’s just one initiative that we’re supporting to help safeguard our $2.6 billion screen industry from movie piracy. Already this year we’ve launched a ‘Buy Original – See Original’ cinema campaign as well as a hotline number, 0800 COPYRIGHT, and a piracy reporting website, www.stopmoviepiracy.co.nz.

“We see World Intellectual Property Day as part of an ongoing education campaign that extends beyond cinemas to the classroom and the community so no one can be left in any doubt that copyright infringement is a crime that hurts everyone.”
