New Zealand companies, trade and tourism will be promoted internationally through a series of America's Cup-related events starting tomorrow at the Emirates Team New Zealand base in Valencia, Spain, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard and Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The fleet racing starts tomorrow and so does the first New Zealand event in Valencia, aimed at the telecommunications sector. It will see nine New Zealand companies mix with some of the telecommunication industry’s biggest players in Europe and the Middle East. Other events are based around industries such as wine, marine, information technology, and biotechnology.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and Tourism New Zealand have worked with Emirates Team New Zealand to create a hospitality centre at the team’s base where kiwi companies and industry sectors will host influential business contacts from Europe and the Middle East - VIPs, potential investment partners and customers.

"International attention will be focussing on the Louis Vuitton and America's Cup regattas in Valencia, Spain over the next three months. Emirates Team New Zealand participation in this global event provides a not-to-be missed opportunity for New Zealand to leverage off the team’s established profile and build up our country’s reputation as a high value trade, investment and tourism destination," Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealand has some great business stories to tell the world, but that requires our companies to get in front of the right people. This America’s Cup opportunity makes it easier for them to spend time with important decision makers that they might otherwise not get close to," Trevor Mallard said.

Damien O'Connor said: "The regatta is a perfect opportunity for New Zealand to reinforce to the world that it is a truly special destination, and provides the latest backdrop for our hugely influential 100% Pure brand. Tourism New Zealand activities will highlight our unique culture, and portray our country in a contemporary and sophisticated way."

A range of New Zealand companies will be hosting guests during race days at the regatta, while others are attending themed events based on some of New Zealand’s high-growth sectors. More than forty New Zealand companies are taking part in NZTE’s America’s Cup Programme and at least 400 people are expected to attend the various events and hosting days being organised through it.  
Tourism New Zealand activities planned for the Louis Vuitton Cup opening weekend include a 100% Pure New Zealand evening function which will be attended by Prime Minister Helen Clark. A waka crewed by 18 Maori warriors will also lead Emirates Team New Zealand’s NZL 92 out to its first Louis Vuitton Cup race.
