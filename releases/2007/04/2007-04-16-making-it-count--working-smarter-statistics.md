Statistics Minister Clayton Cosgrove today said good progress is being made in reducing the amount of time taken by New Zealanders filling in Statistics New Zealand surveys, and he is confident that further efficiencies will be gained.

During his opening address at the 23rd Population Census Conference of the Association of National Census and Statistical Directors of America, Asia and the Pacific in Christchurch today, Mr Cosgrove spoke about the challenges facing all countries in collecting data – both from individuals and businesses. He emphasised understanding the value of statistics and reducing survey time.

"Official statistics provide vital information about the economic and social make-up of our country, and are a strategic planning and research resource for businesses, the government and the wider community," Mr Cosgrove said. "However I recognise that obtaining this data does take time, and I appreciate the effort put in by respondents."

Mr Cosgrove said one of his main priorities has been to reduce the respondent burden while also making statistics more accessible for New Zealanders.

"I am pleased to announce that progress is being made. The Agricultural Production Census now contains fewer questions for poultry farmers, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will use this census to replace a separate survey to forestry companies called the National Exotic Forest Description Survey."

Mr Cosgrove said he also recently approved the discontinuation of the Statistics New Zealand quarterly survey of the activity of Local Authority Trading Enterprises, as users of this data can get the same information from other sources, such as the Annual Enterprise Survey or local authority annual reports.

Mr Cosgrove said further compliance load reductions are being investigated.

"Statistics New Zealand is working with other government departments to find ways to better co-ordinate surveys and to reduce the number of surveys. The government has also approved the establishment of the Survey Notification System, part of the Official Statistics programme run by Statistics New Zealand, which measures surveying from all government departments and therefore reduces duplication."

Mr Cosgrove noted that New Zealand statistical survey response rates remained high, reflecting strong business and household support. "I was pleased to see the 2006 Census of population and dwellings had only a two per cent undercount but this support relies on respondents seeing value in filling in surveys. Forms need to acknowledge the time involved, and communicate the benefits, both economic and social, of government surveys," he said.

Last year Mr Cosgrove launched a pilot called Go Stats aimed at improving the uptake of statistics by small-to-medium sized enterprises in order to assist in growing their businesses.
