"The Maori Media Awards are a testament to Maori succeeding as Maori," says Acting Maori Affairs Minister, Nanaia Mahuta.

The awards, held in Gisborne this evening, celebrated the success of New Zealand's top Maori broadcasters.

Ms Mahuta, who attended the awards, expressed her warm congratulations to all of the winners.

"They should be proud of the important contribution they have made to promote Maori language and tikanga in the media, " said Ms Mahuta.

The minister presented Henare Kingi with the Takoha nui o te Tau Award (most significant contribution to the industry).

Ms Mahuta said it was not an easy decision for judges to single out just one person for this award, as there were many who had made a significant contribution to Maori broadcasting.

"Mr Kingi has been devoted to not only working in Maori broadcasting but also passing his skills and knowledge onto others," said Ms Mahuta.

Twelve awards were presented across a range of categories in television and radio broadcasting.

Ms Mahuta said all of the finalists had succeeded in telling Maori stories in a distinctly Maori way – for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

"The Labour-led government understands the importance of promoting the use of te reo in the media, so all New Zealanders have the opportunity to access it, " said Ms Mahuta.
