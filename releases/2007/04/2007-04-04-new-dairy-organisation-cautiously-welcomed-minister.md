A dairy industry review group’s recommendation to merge industry-good organisation, Dairy Insight, and research provider, Dexcel, has been cautiously welcomed by Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton.

“Any moves to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of industry-good activities in the dairy sector are to be welcomed. A strong, well-funded and independent farmer organisation is absolutely essential to the prosperity of New Zealand’s most important industry.”

“The New Zealand dairy industry faces a major challenge ahead to remain internationally competitive in the face of increasing scale and efficiency of dairy production in South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. The industry is also facing immediate challenges to reduce impacts on water quality and find ways to minimise greenhouse gas emissions. Science and innovation hold the key to meeting these challenges.”

“However, the Government believes it is vital that any industry-good organisation that arises from such a merger must be farmer controlled and accountable to farmers. For this reason I am concerned about any suggestion that the new entity be established by the milk processors of the Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand. I am sure the majority of dairy farmers will share this concern with me,” Jim Anderton said.

“I am also hesitant at this time to lend any support to a proposal that biosecurity levies for funding tuberculosis control should become voluntary and paid for by producers, rather than farmers. No consultation has taken place with Biosecurity New Zealand on this proposal. On farm Tb control is vital for maintaining market access for New Zealand’s export products and is of considerable importance to farmers. I have asked my officials to examine the implications of this proposal very carefully,” Jim Anderton said.
