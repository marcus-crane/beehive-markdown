Foreign Minister Winston Peters is hoping Dili will remain calm once official results of the first round of Timor-Leste's presidential elections are announced tomorrow.

Provisional results released by the National Elections Commission have Francisco "Lu-Olo" Guterres and Jose Ramos-Horta as the two leading candidates in a field of eight.

As it appears that no candidate will win a majority of the vote, a run-off between the top two will be required. It is scheduled for 9 May.

"We hope that the peaceful and orderly atmosphere that prevailed during this first round of elections will be maintained for the rest of the electoral process," Mr Peters said.

"International monitoring teams were largely satisfied with the conduct of the elections, although concerns have been expressed about some irregularities.

"Several candidates have also expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of the vote, and they will have the chance to challenge the outcome through the Court of Appeal once the final results have been released.

"In the interests of peace and reconciliation, it is critical that the people of Timor-Leste continue to respect the electoral process through to its conclusion.

"That includes the outcome of any appeals that may be lodged, the result of the second round of presidential elections and, importantly, the parliamentary elections to be held later this year."

Mr Peters said New Zealand Embassy officials had observed the electoral process, and Defence Force personnel and Police have played a vital role in ensuring stability during the election period.
