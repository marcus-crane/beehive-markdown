Acting Maori Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed sadness at news of the passing of Maori actor and director, Don Selwyn last night.

"Don was a pioneer in both film and theatre in New Zealand and made a significant contribution to growing new talent in the industry.

"His passing leaves a huge gap in the film and theatre communities," said Ms Mahuta.

In paying tribute to Don's distinguished career, Ms Mahuta said that Don was a role model for many young Maori and Pacific people who aspired to have film and television careers.

"Many graduates of his film and television training course are grateful to Don for the way he pioneered opportunities for Maori in arts and drama," said Ms Mahuta.

Ms Mahuta extended her condolences to the family and friends of Don.

"He touched the lives of many New Zealanders and he will be sadly missed," said Ms Mahuta.
