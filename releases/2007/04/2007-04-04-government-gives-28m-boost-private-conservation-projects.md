The government is to give $2.8m in grants to 92 conservation projects around the country run by private landowners and community groups, Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Minister for the Environment David Benson-Pope announced today.

About $1.6m has been given to 68 projects from the Biodiversity Condition Fund, which seeks to improve and maintain native species and habitats on private land. Another $1.2m will assist 24 projects under the Biodiversity Advice Fund, which supports the provision of advice and information to assist with the management of native biodiversity.

"Kiwi, yellow-eyed penguins, kakariki, blue duck, wetlands, coastal habitat and lowland forest will all benefit from these projects, which complement the work the Department of Conservation does on public land," Chris Carter said.

"By working with the community, the Labour-led government is able to significantly increase the scope of conservation activity. For instance, for the $2.8m announced today, conservation projects worth a total of $6.2m are able to proceed using additional money and time from landowners, charitable trusts, local and regional government and other funding agencies."

David Benson-Pope said the latest grants recognised a growing expertise among private landowners and groups that the Biodiversity Funds had helped stimulate over the past five years.

"We were impressed by the coordinated approach of communities for the protection of biodiversity on private land. Many of the groups funded are working over large areas of land for the protection of at-risk-species and their habitats. This work would not be possible without the significant volunteer hours contributed by these communities."

Mr Benson-Pope said it was pleasing to see 18 projects involving coastal habitat protection in this funding round.

“The work of the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust and West Coast Blue Penguin Trust with private landowners is enabling extensive lengths of coastal habitat to be protected and thereby the target species involved."
