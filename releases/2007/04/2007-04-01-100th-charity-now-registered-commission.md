The registration of it's 100th charity means the Charities Commission is on the way to helping charities build even more public trust, confidence and transparency in their sector, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said today.

"I congratulate Riding for the Disabled on the North Shore for becoming the 100th charity to register," said Laban.

"I trust that registration will benefit and support Riding for the Disabled on the North Shore in the incredible work they do for their communities.

The organisation provides special horse riding facilities for the therapy, education, recreation and rehabilitation for people with disabilities in the North Harbour and Rodney District.

"The Charities Commission has a robust, thorough process for registering charities and is making solid progress in doing so," said Laban.

"The aim of registration is to protect genuine charities and build trust, confidence and transparency in their sector by improving the accessibility and quality of information available to the public.

"We know that Kiwis are very generous people. Registration means New Zealanders can now make well-informed decisions about the charities they wish to support.

"The benefits of registering for charitable organisations include income tax and gift duty exemptions, greater public trust in their organisation and extra visibility to potential donors and supporters.

"The Charities Commission is a part of this Labour-led government's commitment to supporting a strong, independent and well-resourced charitable sector.

"A strong sector helps to build the social cohesion our communities need to thrive.

"I encourage all organisations with a charitable purpose to consider applying to the Charities Commission for registration. Charities wishing to remain tax exempt have until 1July 2008 to register," said Laban.
