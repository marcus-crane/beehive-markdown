Acting Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven has released the Review of Value for Money in the Land Transport Sector, one of a cluster of reviews commissioned as part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to continuously strengthen and improve public services for New Zealanders.

Mr Duynhoven says the value for money review consists of four land transport reports. The first, the Ministerial Advisory Group on Roading Costs (MAG) report, was [released by Transport Minister Annette King on February 9 this year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28324), and at the same time she asked the State Services Commission (SSC) to [undertake a "Next Steps" review of the Government land transport sector](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?DocID=5707). The SSC will report back to Ms King by the end of this month.

The other three reports, being released today, focus on:

- passenger transport,
- Land Transport New Zealand’s Land Transport Programme (safety), and
- the National Land Transport Programme (strategic).

“The Review of Value for Money in the Land Transport Sector identifies three key areas requiring attention, and work is already underway in each of them - to ensure there is a clearer action plan to achieve the objectives of the [New Zealand Transport Strategy (NZTS)](http://www.transport.govt.nz/new-zealand-transport-strategy-2/), to ensure better role clarity among land transport sector agencies and to improve performance measures and monitoring.

“The Government’s overall cluster of reviews has not been aimed at cost-cutting, but is intended to ensure agency resources are placed where they can be most effective. For example, the Government is committing around $2.4 billion to land transport each year, and that amount of money makes it absolutely essential that we get the best value possible for our investment.

“The Cabinet has already agreed to a number of key activities and projects to implement the findings of this review, including the Ministerial Advisory Group on Roading Costs,” says Harry Duynhoven.

Harry Duynhoven says work on one of those initiatives is already underway – a detailed implementation plan for the NZTS that will link the NZTS better to investment and strategic decisions made by transport agencies and local government, and which will set the scene for all modes of transport for the medium term.
