Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove today announced the release of a report that highlights local variations in how Justices of the Peace Associations carry out their services, and identifies best practices to work towards.

The “Justice of the Peace Custom and Practice by Local Associations: A Stocktake Report” is the result of survey work and research carried out by the Ministry of Justice and the Royal Federation of New Zealand Justices' Associations.

"Its release follows the passing of the Justices of the Peace Amendment Bill by Parliament last week and represents a further step towards achieving consistent best practice across the country," Mr Cosgrove said.

The stocktake report covers Associations' processes for training, monitoring and communicating with Justices of the Peace (JPs). The purpose of the stocktake was to highlight local variations in customs and practices with a view to identifying best practice and, where appropriate, proposals for the development of national standards.

Mr Cosgrove said the report reveals inconsistencies in some process, such as the training sessions that are run by JP Associations vary in length, frequency and material covered.

He says the report contains a number of proposals, including the development of a consistent practice for ongoing training of JPs in their ministerial and judicial duties, a standard appointment process for all JPs nationally, and a consistent standard of training for search warrant duties.

The report is being sent to all Members of Parliament, JP Associations, the Royal Federation executive, and District Courts staff, as well as being placed on the Ministry of Justice website – www.justice.govt.nz

Submissions on the report are sought by Friday 1 June 2007.

Mr Cosgrove thanked the Ministry of Justice and the Royal Federation of New Zealand Justices' Associations for their efforts on this report.

"Justices of the Peace already provide an outstanding service for their communities around the country, and all New Zealanders stand to benefit from this stocktake report that will raise standards even higher."
