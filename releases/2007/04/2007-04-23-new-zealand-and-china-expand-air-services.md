New code-share arrangements between New Zealand and Chinese airlines will bring about future growth in tourism and business travel between the two countries, Transport Minister Annette King announced in Beijing today.

The Minister’s announcement follows a meeting with the Minister of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC), Yang Yuanyuan.

“Minister Yang and I agreed that China and New Zealand will implement from this month a change to our 1993 air services agreement that will facilitate code share arrangements, and which will benefit airlines and travellers in both countries”.

Ms King says the implementation of an amendment to the New Zealand/China Air Services agreement has permitted New Zealand and Chinese airlines to establish the commercial code-share arrangements.

“In the year to March, New Zealand received 114,000 visitor arrivals from China, 26 percent growth on 2006. This growth is extremely positive for tourism, business and people-to-people contacts and I want to see it continue," Ms King said.

Air New Zealand’s Greater China general manager, Peter Elmsly, said that the official announcement would allow the airline to explore new commercial connections in cooperation with Chinese carriers.

Air New Zealand launched direct Auckland-Shanghai services in November 2006. This was a milestone for the airline and for direct travel between New Zealand and China. Air New Zealand plans to increase Auckland-Shanghai from three services a week to five services a week from November 2007. Air New Zealand also flies direct to Auckland from Hong Kong.
