The 2005/06 Resource Management Act (RMA) survey of local authorities has found that while many councils appear to operate consent processes efficiently and effectively, there are a number who do not.

In response, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope has directed the Ministry for the Environment to investigate up to 20 councils who do not appear to be processing consents within the statutory times.

"I congratulate those councils which are doing well or improving. Some have performed excellently, processing 100 per cent of consents in time. This shows that using best practice, councils can have high performance.

"Others, however, must lift their performance. I have asked for an investigation of councils that are performing poorly compared to others.

The RMA survey contains core questions about resource consent processing statistics such as: number, type, time, and costs. It also covers matters such as iwi participation in RMA processes, and changes made to regional and district plans. The survey is a useful tool to monitor RMA implementation, and allows direct comparison of performance across local government.

The Ministry for the Environment offers guidance and a number of training programmes to help local government with their planning and consenting processes. This includes targeted, one-on-one assistance for selected councils.

However, not all councils appear to be taking advantage of best practice guidance.

"The investigation being undertaken will identify why some councils are performing badly and what further assistance is needed. I am confident that the reasons for delays in consent processing can be addressed," said Mr Benson-Pope.

“I would like to see this year’s survey stimulate discussion among local authorities about good practice in RMA consent processing. Such co-operation will help poorer performing councils lift their performance and will lead to improved overall performance," he said.
