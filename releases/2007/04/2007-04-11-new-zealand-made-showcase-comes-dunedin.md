Local Businesses on Show

Whittaker's Peanut Slabs, Norsewear Farm Fleck Socks, Resene Paint and McKinlays Shoes have one thing in common – they’re all Kiwi Made. These well-known national brands are featured as part of the Dunedin New Zealand Made Showcase which will be held in the Dunedin Centre tomorrow, Thursday 12 April.

“The New Zealand Made Showcase in Dunedin, is part of a wider government programme to celebrate and promote New Zealand made products and manufacturing success. New Zealanders will have the opportunity to explore these and other iconic kiwi products at the showcase,” Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made said today.

“The $11.5 million campaign also aims to increase consumer recognition of branding that identifies products as New Zealand made and promote voluntary branding and labelling for that purpose,” said Ms Bradford.

The New Zealand Made Showcase, developed in close co-operation with Business New Zealand's Buy New Zealand Made programme, is one of six regional showcases with the Dunedin showcase being the first.

“We’re delighted to see so many local and national businesses wanting to participate in the Showcase and I am pleased to say 22 companies that are already members of the Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd have been selected to be a part of today’s celebrations,” said Business New Zealand Chief Executive, Phil O’Reilly, on behalf of the Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd.

The Showcase is being held at the Dunedin Centre in Harrop Street from 10am until 4pm tomorrow, Thursday. Another showcase will be held in Christchurch on Friday.
