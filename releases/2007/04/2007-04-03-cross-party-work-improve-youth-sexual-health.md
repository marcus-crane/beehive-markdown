Minister of Health Pete Hodgson received the NZ Parliamentarians' Group on Population and Development NZPPD report "Youth Sexual Health: Our Health, Our Issue" from Steve Chadwick, the Chair of the all-party group, at a function this evening.

"A cross-government approach is required if we are to achieve any significant reduction in the current high levels of sexually transmissible infections and high level of unplanned teenage pregnancies seen amongst our youth population, " said Pete Hodgson

The report will provide helpful information in relation to future policy considerations to improve the sexual and reproductive health of New Zealanders, especially for young people.

The key messages and recommendations in this report reflect many of the concerns raised by providers and health care professionals in the sexual and reproductive health sector.

"The NZ Parliamentarians' Group on Population and Development has representation from the five major political parties and I am very pleased that we can deliver this report in the spirit of that cooperation.

"Ultimately we all hope to improve the sexual health of our young people," said Steve Chadwick.

By the middle of this year, the Ministry of Health will have completed an analysis of sexual and reproductive health issues and services funded by District Health Boards.

The New Zealand Parliamentarians' Group on Population and Development (NZPPD) was established in 1998 in response to the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and its Programme of Action (1995-2015), to which 179 countries subscribed. Funded by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the group is modelled on United Kingdom and Australian groups, and is part of an international network.
