Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today that it was sad National MPs Phil Heatley and John Carter had to resort to making things up in the vain hope of looking effective.

“Contrary to what Phil Heatley and John Carter said in the House today, I never said the Government would pay for all roads in the aftermath of the Northland floods. I said we would pay for all Transit roads. This is what I said on National Radio:

*"Transit will pay the full cost of restoring its roads in full, no question about that. What*  
*we normally do is where it's a council-owned road, there is a proportion which is paid by the local council and a proportion which is paid by Transit".*

“Overall, so far we have committed to covering 56% of roading costs in the Far North and 52% in Whangarei.

“I never mentioned suspensory loans. If one reads the transcript, and I am happy to read it slowly and out loud to Phil Heatley and John Carter, then one will see that the only person who mentions suspensory loans is the interviewer.

“In response to the question I said that I had talked to Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton about the need to look into the best long term land use in the Hikurangi area.

“I did say that the Government would reimburse local councils for any welfare and public safety costs. In responding to the floods our first priority was to ensure that people were safe, and were given the assistance necessary to return to their homes. In cases where people’s homes were uninhabitable, we provided accommodation and support.

“I am at a lost as to why Phil Heatley and John Carter are criticising me for the Government’s promise to meet welfare and safety costs. The only explanation is that these costs wouldn’t be met by a National Government.

“While I was regularly contacted by Dover Samuels and Shane Jones, and spoke regularly with local Mayors, I heard nothing from John Carter and Phil Heatley – not one call.

“Maybe that explains these belated and rather sad efforts from John Carter and Phil Heatley to look like they are effective, when obviously they are not,” said Rick Barker.
