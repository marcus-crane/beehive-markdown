Courts Minister Rick Barker has warned people planning to travel overseas that they may be stopped at airports if they have not paid their fines.

“People with unpaid fines who plan to travel overseas or come to New Zealand during Easter risk being stopped at the airport if they have not paid their fines,” Rick Barker said.

"In some cases they could be stopped from leaving or entering the country. I would hate to see anyone's Easter holiday plans spoilt like that and I urge everyone with unpaid fines to deal with them.

“Already over a million dollars worth of fines ($1,124,916) has either been collected or put on arrangement as a result of the Pay or Stay initiative which enables us to catch people with unpaid reparation or fines if they are travelling overseas.

“There are indications that the initiative is catching people with long term debt. For instance, one defaulter, returning to New Zealand after living overseas for almost 20 years, was intercepted attempting to enter and visit his mother. The defaulter had left around $3500 of outstanding reparation unpaid, and, in order to enter New Zealand, made a payment in full,” said Rick Barker.

Rick Barker said a total of 46 fines defaulters had been intercepted by the end of February. Of this number, 10 fine defaulters had been intercepted on departure and 36 on arrival. They had been stopped at the international airports at Auckland (34), Wellington (3), Hamilton (1), Christchurch (7) and Dunedin (1).

“Collections staff have received calls from people as far afield as Dubai and the United Kingdom asking about the initiative,” said Rick Barker.

“And it’s not just those heading overseas that are getting the message to pay their fines. A concerted campaign began a month ago which is seeing Bailiffs moving systematically through the country and tracking down people with unpaid fines.

“The people targeted by this campaign have already paid or made arrangements to pay over $4.7million, and bailiffs have seized 185 cars.

“The Pay and Stay initiative and our enforcement campaign are sending a clear message that the only way of making fines go away is to pay them,” said Mr Barker.
