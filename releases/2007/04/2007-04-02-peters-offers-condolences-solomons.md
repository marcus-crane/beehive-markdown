Foreign Minister Winston Peters has offered his condolences to Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in the wake of today's earthquake and tsunami.

"Although we don't yet have a picture of the full scale of the destruction, several deaths have already been confirmed, and more are expected as a number of people are missing, and others have been seriously injured," Mr Peters said.

"There has also been widespread damage to towns and villages on islands close to the epicentre of the earthquake in western Solomon Islands, and it appears several thousand people have been left homeless.

"This is a tragedy for the government and people of the Solomon Islands. New Zealand offers its condolences to them, and we stand ready to offer what assistance we can.

"The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has sent a helicopter to assess the destruction. Once we have a clearer picture, we will be in a better position to decide exactly what help is needed," Mr Peters said.
