Environment Minister David Benson-Pope has announced the appointment of Anne McDermott and Mark Peychers to the Fiordland Marine Guardians advisory committee.

“Anne McDermott and Mark Peychers will add a combined 48 years of experience as local fishers and recreational users to Fiordland Marine Guardians," Mr Benson-Pope said.

“Anne McDermott has 20 years of diving, fishing and boating experience in Fiordland. She will use her established relationships with the Southland recreational fishing, boating and diving sectors to offer valuable advice.

“Mark Peychers basically lives and breathes the Fiordland environment. As an original member of the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries, he brings experience, passion and knowledge," Mr Benson-Pope said.

“"As an advisory group to management agencies and Ministers, Fiordland Marine Guardians provide invaluable knowledge of the Fiordland marine environment and the needs of the many different users of Fiordland.

"With one member nominated by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, the eight-member team reflects a balanced mix of knowledge and experience. The two new appointees will enhance this balance.”

The Fiordland Marine Guardians advise management agencies and Ministers on the management of the Fiordland Marine Area, and help ensure that the spirit of goodwill and co-operation that exists among Fiordland stakeholders is retained.

In 2003, the Guardians presented the Minister of Fisheries and the Minister for the Environment with their community and stakeholder-based strategy for managing impacts on the marine environment. The Government subsequently passed the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Management Act 2005 to give effect to the Guardians’ strategy.
