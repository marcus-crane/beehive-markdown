The swearing in of Fiji’s military commander as that nation’s "interim prime minister" inspires no confidence that Fiji is moving quickly back to democratic rule, Duty Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

"The removal of the democratically elected government of Fiji a month ago was a tragedy for the people of Fiji, and widely condemned by the region and the international community."

Commodore Bainimarama was sworn in as interim prime minister in Suva this morning by President Ratu Josefa Iloillo.

Ruth Dyson said Commodore Bainimarama’s appointment came as little surprise, was an attempt to validate the coup and obtain immunity for the perpetrators, and it was hard to see how it would ensure a swift return to democracy.

Ruth Dyson said New Zealand remained deeply concerned at the situation in Fiji and would be considering the full political and legal implications of what had occurred.

"In the meantime New Zealand's current range of sanctions against Fiji will remain in place, and we will continue to watch further developments very closely.

"It is imperative for the best interests of the country and people of Fiji that the President and Commodore Bainimarama begin work immediately to restore democracy and the rule of law", said Ruth Dyson.
