Motorists returning home from their summer holidays over the next few days are being advised to take special care on the roads, Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven said today.

"At this time of year, many drivers and their families are returning home from holiday. There are often high volumes of traffic on the roads and as always, drivers need to be on the alert.

“I am very concerned that many people drive for long hours or drive when they have not had enough sleep. Driver fatigue is the cause of many accidents. I advise anyone who is feeling tired to pull over safely and take a power nap for 20 minutes or so. Also, keep an eye out for special driver fatigue stops and take advantage of these.

“Drivers and their passengers also need to be aware of the dangers of engaging in distracting activity while driving. Drivers must focus on the road and try to minimise distractions in the car," Mr Duynhoven said.

There are a few simple steps drivers should take to increase their safety and the safety of their passengers and other road users:

Drive to the conditions;

Ensure everyone is wearing a seatbelt;

Make sure your vehicle is road worthy;

Keep your attention on the job at hand;

Minimise distractions in the car;

Don't drink and drive or speed; and

If you are feeling tired, pull over and have a short power nap.  
"Last year's annual road toll was the lowest since 1960. Although this is encouraging, most of the deaths on our roads in 2006 were avoidable.

"This Government remains very committed to further reducing the road toll and our goal of no more than 300 road deaths a year by 2010. With continuing education and awareness of road safety, together with police enforcement on our roads, we can achieve this goal," said Mr Duynhoven today.
