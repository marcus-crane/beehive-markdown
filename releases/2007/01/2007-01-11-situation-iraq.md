Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the situation in Iraq is of great concern to New Zealand, as it is to the whole international community.

President Bush today announced a revised US strategy for Iraq based on several major elements. They include the Iraqi Government taking the lead in confronting the insurgency; improving internal political dialogue and economic progress in Iraq, encouraging Arab state support for the Iraqi Government; and increasing the number of US troops deployed.

The Prime Minister said that attempts to bring peace to Iraq have foundered in the face of a bitter insurgency, marked by sectarian violence. The current situation in Iraq is also destabilising within the region.

“The challenges for Iraq are enormous. Its survival as a nation relies on its communities rising above their differences and working towards a common goal. Iraq’s neighbours and the broader international community have a role to play in supporting reconciliation between Iraq’s communities,” the Prime Minister said.
