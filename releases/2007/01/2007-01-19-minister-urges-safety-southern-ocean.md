Conservation Minister, Chris Carter said "Japan's whaling fleet is not welcome in New Zealand ports".

Speaking at a reception onboard the Greenpeace vessel – Esperanza in Auckland today, the Minister also urged all parties involved in this year's whaling protests to exercise restraint.

Before entering a New Zealand port any ship carrying whale products would need to apply, under the provisions of the [Marine Mammals Protection Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2582186996&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1978-080&softpage=DOC), for a permit from the Minister of Conservation.

Chris Carter said he would not grant such a permit and reiterated the New Zealand Government's strong opposition to Japan's whaling programme in the Southern Ocean.

Japan plans to kill up to 935 Antarctic minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary over the next few months.

Chris Carter said he was worried about the possibility of violence in the Southern Ocean as Greenpeace, the radical President and Founder of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society Captain Paul Watson and the Japanese whaling fleet square off over the controversial 'research whaling' programme.

"I am very concerned by recent statements made by Captain Watson and the battle modifications made to his ships" said Chris Carter.

"Captain Watson seems intent on having a violent confrontation with the Japanese whaling fleet."

Chris Carter also said the powerful water cannons used last year by the Japanese put lives at risk. He called on the Japanese ships to use restraint when facing protesters.

Chris Carter said the Antarctic is one of the most dangerous and isolated places on the planet. Although New Zealand has the responsibility for maritime rescue operations in the [Ross Sea region](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/1-Global-Issues/Antarctica/Ross-Sea-Strategy/index.php), the isolation and extreme conditions mean that our search and rescue capacity in this area is very limited.

The New Zealand Government has contacted Greenpeace, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and the Government of Japan to express concerns about safety in Antarctic waters.

"I urge all parties to refrain from any acts that may be a risk to human life" said Chris Carter.

"The best way of solving this issue would be for Japan to abandon whaling and join other nations in respecting and conserving marine species that could be facing extinction ".

“New Zealand led a formal diplomatic protest on Japan in December to express concerns about this whaling and called on Japan to immediately cease its lethal whaling programme” said Chris Carter.

“Twenty seven countries supported the protest, signalling once again that significant world opinion is firmly opposed to Japan's methods” said Chris Carter.
