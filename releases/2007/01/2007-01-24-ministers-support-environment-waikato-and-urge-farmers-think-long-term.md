Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Environment Minister David Benson-Pope expressed support today for Environment Waikato's decision to lay charges against farmers who are allegedly breaching consent conditions and polluting waterways.

Mr Anderton urged the farmers to recognise that New Zealand's clean, green image needs to also be a reality to ensure long-term market access and the viability of our farming systems.

"While I understand some of the farmers will feel aggrieved and think they are too busy to worry about effluent discharges, they need to look to the future. Environmental management is core business for the modern farmer. More and more consumers want their goods to come from environmentally sustainable sources, which is something we are in a position to capitalise on if we follow best New Zealand farming practice," said Jim Anderton.

"The dairy industry has shown a real commitment with the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, and the Dairy Industry Strategy for Sustainable Environmental Management and it is to be congratulated on that. Nevertheless, these prosecutions show that there is still a minority who are giving the industry a bad name. We are talking about a handful of more than 4000 dairy farms in the Waikato. Environment Waikato is right to take action, both for the environment and for the good of the industry," Jim Anderton said.

Mr Benson-Pope said he wrote to local authorities late last year supporting legal action where necessary, after monitoring showed a significant level of non-compliance. "I also stated publicly that those who weren't complying could face very stiff penalties," he said.

"Regional Plans set clear rules concerning the discharge of dairy effluent. Environment Waikato's decision to prosecute sends a very strong message to farmers who think the rules don't apply to them,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

Companies and individuals connected to 15 Waikato farms are facing prosecution by Environment Waikato.

"This government is committed to sustaining and protecting New Zealand's precious waterways, and if legal action is needed to get the message across, so be it. Water is not a resource of infinite purity and supply, and all New Zealanders need to take its quality and conservation seriously,” said Mr Benson-Pope.
