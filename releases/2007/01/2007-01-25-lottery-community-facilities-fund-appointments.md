Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today announced five appointments to the Lottery Community Facilities Fund’s distribution committee.

"In 2002 falling lottery profits resulted in the Lottery Community Facilities Fund being discontinued. However an increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits over the last few years has allowed us to reintroduce the fund," said Rick Barker.

“Over $8 million has been set aside for 2007-08 to provide much sought after funding to build or improve community facilities.

“I am delighted at the calibre of those appointed to the committee. All five possess a wealth of knowledge and have considerable management and governance skills,” said Rick Barker.

The newly appointed committee members include:

- Hon Margaret Shields (Porirua) has been appointed as Presiding Member. Margaret was the Presiding Member of Lottery Community Facilities before it became inactive in 2002. Margaret has substantial leadership skills and has experience in governance and local government.
- Basil Morrison (Paeroa) was also previously a member of Lottery Community Facilities. Basil has vast knowledge and experience in local government and is President of Local Government New Zealand. He brings extensive technical expertise in facility funding and considerable experience in fund distribution.
- Colin Dale (Auckland) has 50 years experience in the local government sector, and has been involved with various community projects in the South Auckland region.
- Enid Leighton (Whakatane) has business management experience in the social and health sectors, and knowledge of Mäori economic and community development.
- Frana Cardno (Te Anau) is Mayor of the Southland District Council, and has substantial experience in local government and community development.

The Lottery Community Facilities Fund will support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. To be considered for funding, projects need to have a total cost over $30,000. Projects that will be considered by the fund include:

- the development, upgrade or extension of new and existing buildings (including the addition of meeting rooms or changes to spaces to make them more useable);
- assistance in land purchase as part of wider development projects; and
- the undertaking of feasibility studies for proposed community facilities.
