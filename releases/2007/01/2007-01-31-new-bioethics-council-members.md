Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today announced four new appointments to [Toi Te Taiao: The Bioethics Council](http://www.bioethics.org.nz/), and confirmed current acting chair Dr Martin Wilkinson as chair until the end of 2008.

Announcing the new appointments, Mr Benson-Pope said the new members would bring a wealth of expertise and experience to [the Council](http://www.bioethics.org.nz/about-us/council-members.html). They are:

- Dr Marie Bismark, a senior Wellington solicitor who has a background as a medical doctor and conducted research in bioethics and medical ethics;
- Dr Mark Fisher, a scientist with many years of experience in farm animal physiology and ethical issues relating to animal welfare;
- Dr Peggy Fairbairn-Dunlop, associate professor and head of the Va’aomanuu Pasifika/Pacific and Samoan studies at Victoria University;
- Rosemary Du Plessis, who led the Constructive Conversations/Korero Whakaaetanga research programme (which focused on genetic testing and bio-banking) from 2003 to 2005.

“I'm impressed with the calibre of the new council members, and I’m confident they have the skills necessary to deal with the complex issues they will face,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

“I particularly welcome Dr Fairbairn-Dunlop’s appointment, and the link she will provide to Pacific communities. I'm also delighted that Dr Wilkinson, who has expertly guided the council since February 2006, will carry on as council chair for the next two years.”

The council’s role is to enhance New Zealand's understanding of the cultural, ethical and spiritual aspects of biotechnology, and ensure the use of biotechnology has regard for New Zealanders' values.

A fifth new member, an expert in tikanga Maori, is still to be appointed.
