The Labour-Progressive government is to quadruple the number of days fisheries observers are on fishing boats in areas of coastline inhabited by the critically endangered Maui's and Hector's dolphin, Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton and Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"Fisheries observers can play a key role in monitoring the nature and extent of interactions between commercial fishing vessels and protected native species," Jim Anderton said.

"Until recently, observers were primarily used on large vessels operating in deep water fisheries, but by working with the fishing industry, the Department of Conservation and the Ministry of Fisheries will this year place observers on vessels operating in inshore set net and trawl fisheries."

"This is a fantastic development," Chris Carter said.

"Our inshore areas are home to some of our most vulnerable marine and bird species, such as the Maui's and Hector's dolphins, shags, shearwaters and penguins. The addition of observers to fishing vessels operating in these areas will further enhance information used to protect them."

The inshore observer programme began last year with observers on vessels involved in set netting. This year, it will expand its coverage of trawl fisheries, and the number of days observers are on vessels is expected to quadruple to more than 400 days, with an estimated 165 set net days and 250 trawl days planned.

Mr Anderton and Mr Carter both thanked the fishing industry for their co-operation in the initiative.
