New Zealand will give the United Nations $200,000 to help it work with Pacific Island countries on improving their counter-terrorism legislation, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“With New Zealand's support, the [UN's Terrorism Prevention Branch](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism.html) will be able to extend its work into the Pacific region to help states draft the laws they need to continue the fight against global terrorism," Mr Peters said.

“This in turn will help Pacific Island states ratify the [major international counter-terrorism legal instruments](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/terrorism_convention_overview.html) and implement relevant Security Council resolutions. This will impact directly on their own security, and, indirectly, on the security of New Zealand.”

The funding comes from the Pacific Security Fund, which was established by the government to advance New Zealand’s security interests in the Pacific region. [The fund](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/Pacific/0-pacsecfund.php) is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
