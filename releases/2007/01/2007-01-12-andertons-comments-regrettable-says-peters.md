Jim Anderton's comments about United States President George Bush are ill-informed and regrettable, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

"Mr Anderton is entitled to his own thoughts on world events but it is unfortunate he has chosen to make them public on this occasion. His comments certainly do not reflect the views of the government," Mr Peters said.

"The challenge regarding Iraq is for the international community to find ways to assist the Iraqi government and all its peoples to overcome their differences and unite for the sake of the country's future."

Mr Peters, who is currently in the Philippines for the East Asia Summit in Cebu, said he would be making no further comment on the issue.
