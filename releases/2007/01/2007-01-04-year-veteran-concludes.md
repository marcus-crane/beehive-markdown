Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker today said the 'Year of the Veteran' was a great success, and that 2007 will build on its momentum as we further improve our support of veterans.

"To help celebrate the huge contribution veterans have made to New Zealand, the Government dedicated 2006 as the Year of the Veteran. Veterans have a special place in our society and Year of the Veteran has provided a great opportunity for families and the public to recognise their enormous contribution," said Rick Barker.

"As part of the ‘Year of the Veteran' communities all over New Zealand have commemorated and honoured the sacrifice and service of our veterans.

"During 2006 almost 18,000 Year of the Veteran certificates and lapel badges were presented to veterans. 115 communities held presentation ceremonies and I had the privilege of attending many of these, from Waimate to Wanganui, Nelson to Napier and Auckland to Ashburton.

"Community grants were awarded to 340 organisations, at a total cost of $1.2million. Communities from Kaitaia to Gore received funding, and in many cases it helped turn projects from a pipedream into a reality.

"A fitting finale to the Year of the Veteran was the presentation of Commendations to ten great New Zealanders who have provided outstanding service to the veteran community. Recipients were nominated by their communities and it was an honour to present the commendations to people who have done so much to benefit veterans.

"While the Year of the Veteran has concluded the Labour led Government's commitment to supporting veterans is ongoing.

"This year is shaping up as an important one for veterans, with key initiatives such as the roll out of the Veterans Card, a review of Veterans' Affairs New Zealand, and the rewriting of war pensions legislation to make it easier to understand and more attuned to the needs of veterans.

"I was pleased that in 2006, the Year of the Veteran, the Government was able to reach an agreement with the Ex-Vietnam Services Association (EVSA) and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RNZRSA) in response to the concerns of Viet Nam veterans. This year sees the implementation of the response and I will work to ensure that the eligible benefits provided are taken up.

"Veterans have made a huge contribution to our national identity, and as Minister of Veterans' Affairs I'm fortunate to meet with veterans from all over New Zealand. The initiatives around the Year of the Veteran have been a way to thank veterans for the massive contribution they've made to our communities, cities and indeed to New Zealand's free and democratic society. The year has been a great success," concluded Rick Barker.
