With 1 April fast approaching, it’s time for employers to start their final planning to prepare for the move to four weeks’ annual holiday, says Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson.

"From 1 April this year the Holidays Act 2003 will increase the minimum annual holiday entitlement from three to four weeks."

Employees will become eligible for their extra week’s holiday on their first anniversary date (the date when they started their current job) after 1 April 2007.

"While this will not affect employees’ entitlements over the current holiday period, employers need to be planning and budgeting ahead to be prepared for the change.

"Employees already receiving four weeks’ annual holidays will not automatically get five weeks – it will depend on whether their employment agreement makes it clear that the entitlement increases.

"As always however, employers and employees can agree on a greater number of annual holidays than the minimum," said Ruth Dyson.

The increase to four weeks brings New Zealand into line with Australia and many European countries.

Workers earning the minimum wage will also receive a 9.8% pay rise from 1 April.

The minimum wage, which applies to people 18 years and over, will increase from $10.25 to $11.25 an hour: the largest increase since the Labour-led government came into office in 1999.

Changes to annual leave and minimum wages are part of a wider mix of approaches from the Labour-led government to support higher quality working lives and productive workplaces.
