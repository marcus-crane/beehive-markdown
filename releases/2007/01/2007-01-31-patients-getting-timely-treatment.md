Health Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed an ACNielsen survey showing the new booking system for elective surgery is working, but says further improvements are needed, and are on the way.

"While most DHBs are seeing people within 6 months, some still have work to do," Pete Hodgson says.

"Last October I was delighted to [release an extra $200 million](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27266) to increase the number of procedures carried out in our public hospitals. I have yet to reach agreement with all DHBs on their new volumes but conditions attached to the new money will ensure that the DHBs keep a firm hand on elective surgery. I expect the situation to steadily improve.

"Almost half a million New Zealanders had specialist assessment through the public health system last year, this is not a system that's failing.

The survey of 1000 people showed a majority of people waiting for a first assessment had only been on the list for two months or less.

Three-quarters of people that had been on a waiting list had received treatment, according to the survey.

Pete Hodgson says the extra $200 million to increase elective procedures carried out in public hospitals will mean a 10 per cent increase in capacity over the next four years.
