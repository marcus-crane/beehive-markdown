The National Party appears confused on whether or not there is a problem with the country's drinking water supply.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson says National environment spokesman Dr Nick Smith's assertion that 24 per cent of the country's drinking water supply failed to meet bacteriological standards is incorrect.

The figure refers to the proportion of New Zealand's water supply that is not currently monitored.

"Furthermore National's associate health spokesman Dr Jonathan Coleman seems to disagree with his caucus colleague because he said last year New Zealand was known for having the best standard of drinking water in the world.

"If this group of politicians could agree among themselves and then vote positively for bills introduced into Parliament, we would drink to that," Pete Hodgson says.

The Health (Drinking Water) Amendment Bill was introduced into Parliament last year and voted against by National.

This Labour-led Government will be contributing $154 million over the next ten years to small communities to help them get their drinking water supplies up to standard.
