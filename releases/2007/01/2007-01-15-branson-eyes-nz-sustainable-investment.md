Climate Change Minister David Parker is to meet with world-leading entrepreneur and businessman Sir Richard Branson today, to talk about biofuels.

David Parker says the meeting is a chance to discuss how investment by the British entrepreneur in biofuel technologies in New Zealand could help the world fight the global challenge of climate change.

Sir Richard has pledged to spend NZ$4.5 billion from his rail and airline business profits over the next 10 years on projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including biofuels research.

"Sir Richard Branson has made a bold and visionary commitment to the challenge of tackling climate change, for which I congratulate him." David Parker said.

"I wrote to Sir Richard last year, to encourage him to consider New Zealand-based world-leading initiatives to develop biofuels for the transport sector.

"He responded with interest, and I'm very pleased that while he's in New Zealand for a short time, Sir Richard has been able to find time for this meeting today to discuss details further.

"New Zealand is already committed to developing and using biofuels, through a mandatory biofuels sales obligation.

"New Zealand's established excellence in related scientific research, our reputation for innovation, our climate and resources available, make it an ideal place to invest, and I look forward to talking about this with Sir Richard.

"I am providing him with information on some of the world-leading biofuels research and development being undertaken by New Zealand companies, including:

- Ethanol production from carbon monoxide waste streams (LanzaTech, Auckland)
- Biodiesel production from algae grown on (and cleaning up) municipal sewage and dairy shed effluent (Aquaflow Bionomic Corporation Ltd, Christchurch)
- Ethanol production from cellulose using coppiced Salix willow (BioJoule Ltd, Auckland)"
