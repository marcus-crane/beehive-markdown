New Zealanders got more exercise and ate better food in 2006 but as a nation we have to do more, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Two new studies published in the New Zealand Medical Journal endorse the direction in which we are headed, Pete Hodgson said.

The studies show children who eat at the school canteen are more likely to be consuming high-sugar, high-fat foods while another study shows the cost of healthy food is the same or only slightly more than less healthy alternatives.

"We know that thousands of lives can be saved each year by increasing our physical activity and improving our nutrition. While the problem is global, during 2006 many Zealanders took up the challenge to improve their own health.

"I would like to recognise the personal victories for people who have lost weight and become more active and encourage more New Zealanders to follow their lead.

"Small changes made every day can have a positive health impact. I have met individuals who have changed their own lives through programmes like [Green Prescriptions](http://www.sparc.org.nz/getting-active/green-prescription/overview).

"2006 was also a year where I met a surprising number of young people who were improving their lifestyle and that of their families," Pete Hodgson said.

"I would also like to thank all those involved in initiatives made possible by this Labour-led government's investment, and thank businesses and industries for their support.

"No one strategy will reverse the [rising epidemic of obesity and inactivity](http://www.moh.govt.nz/healthyeatinghealthyaction) amongst us, and no one agency will have all the answers. The answers will come from individuals, families, communities, schools, businesses and local and central agencies working together. The solutions will go beyond party politics. " Pete Hodgson said.
