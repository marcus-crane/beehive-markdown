The Minister of Fisheries, Jim Anderton, said today that National's spokesperson on Fisheries, Phil Heatley, was re-hashing an old press release from the same time last year with regards to the numbers of Honorary Fisheries Officers (HFOs).

"The HFOs support and complement New Zealand's professional, full-time Fisheries Officers and it has been the Ministry's intentional strategy to decrease their numbers in order to improve the health and safety, competency and effectiveness of HFOs. Previously a number of HFOs were only on duty for a few days of the year. While this was their choice, the time and cost of training, equipping and managing them to work a few days of the year was not sustainable. Many HFOs did not want to increase their availability.

"Phil Heatley already knows this because it was included in the press statement that went out last year, in response to his, on this very issue.

"HFO numbers have stabilised in the past 12 months – 160 in February 2006, 161 in February 2007. The Ministry does not intend increasing their numbers beyond 160. Instead it is investing in training, equipping and supporting these volunteers to continue the excellent service they currently provide.

"The HFOs are a valued volunteer force that the Government, and New Zealanders in general, greatly respect. They are responsible for work strictly in the recreational sector and are not used to target hardcore poaching, although they provide valuable surveillance of poachers. MFish uses fulltime Fisheries Surveillance Officers to target hardcore poaching, as they have a higher level of experience and training.

"I launched The Poaching is Theft campaign before Christmas. The campaign urges New Zealanders to report any suspicious activities that may lead to catching poachers by contacting the Ministry of Fisheries on the 0800 4 POACHER number (0800 476 224).

"Everyone has a part to play in ensuring the sustainability of New Zealand's valuable fisheries. We have a three-pronged approach - all New Zealanders on the beach keeping an eye out for those abusing the rules; the professional Fisheries Officers; and our Honorary Fisheries Officers.

"Poaching is a serious issue but there is a lot of 'people power' which can help make a large dent in the criminal poaching business, as well as reminding those on holiday not to overstep the mark by taking too much or taking undersized shellfish," Jim Anderton said.
