"Most recreational fishers are keeping to the fishing regulations," Jim Anderton said today. "The Ministry of Fisheries compliance figures for December 2006 bear that out with 95% of recreational fishers inspected meeting the regulations. Fewer than 5% of recreational fishers inspected in December 2006 were in breach of the regulations.

"Hardcore professional poachers are responsible for most illegal fishing around the coast. With substantial penalties, there is a lot at stake for poachers so the most experienced and highly trained fisheries officers are used to target them.

"Honorary Fisheries Officers work with recreational fishers and are having a lot of success and this is reflected in the December figures.

For December 2006 (lower number of fishers inspected as there was limited good fishing weather), surveillance staff conducted the following surveillance activities.  
In the non-commercial recreational/ customary sector  
·Conducted 1,833 separate inspections including inspection of 1075 recreational vessels  
·Conducted 345 patrols on land and at sea. This consists of two fisheries surveillance officers patrolling for 8 hours.  
·77 Infringements issued and 5 individuals prosecuted.  
In any one-day of the month there were up to 11 active patrols around the country.

"With 19 out of 20 recreational fishers inspected keeping to the rules, fulltime Fisheries Surveillance Officers and Honorary Fisheries Officers have to work hard to find infringements in the recreational sector.

"This work is not wasted, as every inspection is a chance to reinforce regulations and all fisheries officers report there is an ever-increasing knowledge of regulations among fishers.

"Changing people’s attitudes and behaviour takes more than pure enforcement. Education has a big part to play. Signs reminding people of fisheries regulations at key entry points to the water, fisheries officers distributing brochures when patrolling on the water, beaches and boat ramps, and school visits all play a part.

"The Coastwatch programme has raised awareness of fisheries regulations, the penalties and that to keep fishing into the future everyone has to play by the rules.

"Most fishers respect the fishery and everyone’s right to catch a feed. They expect their children and children’s children will be able to do the same," Jim Anderton said.
