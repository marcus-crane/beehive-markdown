Migrant and refugee newcomers to Auckland will benefit from a joint local and central government settlement strategy and action plan launched by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"The government realises the challenges faced by newcomers arriving in a new country, especially a large region like Auckland," Mr Cunliffe says.

"That is why settlement, along with skills and security, is one of the three key government objectives for the future of immigration in New Zealand.

"Successful settlement is a vital part of the immigration process and a contribution to the [economic transformation of New Zealand](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=29). As countries compete harder for global talent, we need to ensure the thousands of new migrants who come every year feel part of our country – and can contribute to our communities and our economy."

The aim of the [Auckland Regional Settlement Strategy and the Auckland Regional Settlement Action Plan](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/settlement/regionalstrategies/auckland.htm) is to support new migrants to fully contribute and participate in the region.

The Auckland strategy supports and advances the migrant work already underway nationally as part of the [New Zealand Settlement Strategy](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/settlement), as well as the Labour-led government's broader work to transform Auckland into a world-class city.

"The Auckland strategy sets out a vision for the region’s future – with 10 goals within the strategy to help support that vision," Mr Cunliffe said.

"The action plan contains 48 initiatives that build on those goals to ensure challenges and objectives are met in practical ways, including developing a pre-employment programme for unemployed and unskilled refugees and developing an interpreter service model as a regional pilot.

"What is pleasing about this work is that it has been developed from the community up. By talking to communities, migrants and refugees we know what their needs are and where to focus.

"The results of the strategy and action plan will be well-settled migrants and refugees, enriched Auckland communities and the sustainable development of the region and New Zealand."
