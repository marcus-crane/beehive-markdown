Housing Minister Chris Carter today urged people to be very cautious of claims made by National MP Phil Heatley about waiting times for state houses.

"Despite considerable pressure over the past few years, Housing New Zealand has held waiting times for state houses at a stable level for the most at risk New Zealanders, and the Corporation deserves credit for this achievement, " Mr Carter said.

"It is correct that waiting times appear to have begun to rise for those in lower categories of need. This is despite the acquisition of more than 5000 new state homes since 1999.

"However, I would urge people to treat this trend cautiously. Housing New Zealand is investigating whether it is partly a consequence of a recent focus on improving the under utilisation of state houses," Mr Carter said.

"Housing New Zealand has been encouraging tenants in homes that are too large for them to move into smaller ones, thus freeing up houses for larger families. Last year, this work delivered efficiency gains in excess of $40m. Housing New Zealand has also been encouraging larger families in houses too small for them to move to bigger ones avoiding the risk of ill health associated with overcrowding.

"When a tenant agrees to be moved they are placed on the waiting list even though they are already in a state house. Housing New Zealand believes this has artificially inflated the waiting list by up to 25 per cent over the past four years, and may also be distorting measures of waiting times," Mr Carter said.

"Work is underway to confirm whether this is the case at present, and for the sake of transparency I have asked for people transferring between state houses to be held on a separate waiting list in future”.

"Housing New Zealand also believes that rising rents in the private sector may be forcing more people to turn to Housing New Zealand for help in some regions.

"Again, the government is exploring the extent of this problem, and it may be it is best dealt with by other government agencies providing more support to people to remain in the private sector," Mr Carter said.

"Mr Heatley should do a bit more homework in future before jumping on his high horse. Let's not forget we only have a shortage of state homes because National sold 13,000 of them in the 1990s, more than the entire waiting list today."
