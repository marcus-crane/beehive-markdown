The latest [Financial Statements of the Government](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/financialstatements/month/nov06/default.asp) show that higher investment returns from Crown Financial Institutes have driven a higher than forecast operating balance, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The operating balance for the five months ended 30 November was $3.5 billion - $625 million ahead of forecast.

"Much of this - $600 million – is down to higher investment returns from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, ACC and EQC which continue to perform ahead of expectations," said Dr Cullen.

"This is great news as the institutes are building up funds to offset future liabilities so better preparing New Zealanders for the challenges ahead.

"However, it is important not to get too excited as there is not extra cash in the bank to spend today. The residual cash balance is about what was forecast at Budget time.

"The result again shows why the operating balance is not a measure of what the government has available to spend, but rather a measure of the overall health of the fiscal purse.

"It highlights the fact that we have probably the most full and transparent set of government accounts in the world, with changes in market performance flowing straight through to the government accounts.

"But it is important to look beyond the headline indicators to get the correct picture," Dr Cullen concluded.
