The Minister of Conservation today announced the release of the publication ‘New Zealand Threat Classification System lists’.

This is the second edition of the publication; this follows the first edition which was released in October 2002.

The new threatened species list updates the threat classification status of 5819 of New Zealand’s native [plants](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/summary.aspx?id=33531) and [animals](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/defaultlanding.aspx?id=32842). Almost half of these are listed in one of the seven threatened categories. The remainder are categorised as “data deficient”, which means they require further research to determine if they are threatened or not.

Conservation Minister, Chris Carter said that it was crucial for New Zealand’s wildlife that their threatened status is understood, so that better planning could be made for protecting it.

“While New Zealand has shown the world that we are world leaders in habitat restoration and pest eradication, we must not become complacent. Human-induced threats and the introduction of [predators and pests](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/summary.aspx?id=33329) continue to plague our native species.

“This list is an important tool used to guide the Department of Conservation and other organisations which focus on species conservation.”

The updated threatened species list will be used for priority setting and future management of threatened species.

There are forty-four species of plants and animals that have had a significant change in their status since the last time the list was produced. Some of the reason for change in status is a result of more available information on particular species.

This list is pertinent to the many New Zealanders who are genuinely concerned about conserving New Zealand’s natural heritage. The information in this list enhances and fosters knowledge and understanding of New Zealand’s unique species and directs conservation management to minimise the risk of extinction.

The list is available on the DOC website [www.doc.govt.nz](http://www.doc.govt.nz).
