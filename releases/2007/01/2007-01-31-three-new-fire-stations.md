Prime Minister Helen Clark and Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today celebrated the opening of three new fire stations in Lower Hutt as a significant investment by the Fire Service in community safety in the region.

"The new stations in Seaview, Hutt City, and Avalon represent an investment of $5.5 million in our country's fire service infrastructure," Helen Clark said.

"Homes, businesses, workplaces, schools, hospitals and all other community facilities need protection from fire. Good infrastructure is needed to support the work of our firefighters.

"Since 1999, the Fire Service has opened 40 new station buildings, and refurbished or relocated 15. It has also opened a new National Training Centre in Rotorua. All up, these new facilities represent an investment of around $47 million by the Fire Service.

"This is not only about investing in buildings, it's also about investing in the safety of our communities," Helen Clark said.

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said the new investments are critical for equipping the Fire Service for the changing demands it faces.

"Our communities are increasingly relying on firefighters to respond to diverse events, such as the need to plan for a possible worldwide ‘flu pandemic, terrorism, and even climate change-related events like storms and droughts.

"I am proud of the work of our firefighters, and congratulate the Fire Service for its decision to invest in these new facilities," Rick Barker said.
