An international review of the New Zealand tertiary education system supports the government’s current programme of reform, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

A [report](http://www.oecd.org.edu/tertiary/review)released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) finds many positive aspects of the tertiary education system and makes no recommendations for radical change.

“The review found a system that is well positioned for further development," said Dr Cullen. "The review report notes that its recommendations relate well to government’s recent developments in tertiary education policy. The report is a positive endorsement of our policy direction."

The review endorsed the direction of the government’s 2002 tertiary education reforms and supports the current work programme of taking those reforms to the next stage. It found the New Zealand tertiary education system to be unique in scale, diversity, achievement and policy innovation - a system with a distinctive identity.

"Many of the comments and issues raised in the report focus on making the existing arrangements work better. Its recommendations support and reinforce the changes to funding and planning that we instigated in April last year.

"In particular, the review’s findings support the government’s ‘investing in a plan’ policy as well as its plans to strengthen the quality and monitoring systems in tertiary education and to restructure funding for learning," said Dr Cullen.

In February 2006, an international expert panel visited New Zealand and met with key stakeholders in New Zealand's tertiary education system - tertiary education providers, sector representative groups, government agencies, research organisations, and students. This visit was part of the OECD’s thematic review of tertiary education over the period 2004-2007. New Zealand is one of 24 countries participating.

The purpose of the review was to examine how the organisation, management, and delivery of tertiary education can help countries to achieve their economic and social objectives. The review provides an independent view of the state of tertiary education in New Zealand.
