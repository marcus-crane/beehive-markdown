Disability Issues Minister, Ruth Dyson, is welcoming the announcement that TVNZ's current affairs show Close Up will be offering live captioning from next week.

"I'm delighted that TVNZ as the country's public broadcaster for  
television, together with funding from New Zealand on Air, has taken this initiative.

"Over 400,000 New Zealanders are deaf or hearing-impaired, affecting their ability to understand and enjoy television - therefore it makes sense to address the communication requirements of this group of people," said Ruth Dyson.

The captioning service is available free on television sets capable of receiving captioning data via Teletext.

A voluntary code for the captioning of government television advertisements was introduced in September and aims to ensure that New Zealand's Deaf and hearing impaired will not miss out on important government communications.

All government agencies subscribing to the code receive a discount on the cost of captioning their commercials. They will also have use of the Captioning logo, demonstrating their commitment to deaf and hearing impaired New Zealanders.
