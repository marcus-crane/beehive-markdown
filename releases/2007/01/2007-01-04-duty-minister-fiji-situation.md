Duty Minister Ruth Dyson today expressed scepticism about statements from President Iloilo of Fiji and Frank Bainimarama.

"The proof of the pudding will be in the eating - in this case whether the two are foreshadowing a genuine commitment to the restoration of democratic government and the rule of law as soon as possible."

Ruth Dyson was responding to an announcement from Commodore Bainimarama that he had handed back executive authority to the President.

"Confirmation that executive authority in Fiji rests with the President does not on its own satisfy the many international and regional calls for restoration of democracy and fundamental freedoms in Fiji."

"New Zealand is concerned too that the President, in accepting back  
executive authority, endorsed the Commander's actions in taking over the Government. There is no doubt that the coup was illegal and  
unconstitutional. What is important now is that all parties work together to restore democracy and the rule of law."

The sanctions New Zealand has taken against Fiji are not affected by today's developments.

"Until concrete progress is made in Fiji, the sanctions will remain in place," Ruth Dyson said.

Ruth Dyson also commented on remarks by the Chair of the Fiji Human Rights Commission about New Zealand's reaction to the coup.

"We are surprised and very disappointed at comments made by an individual whom we would have expected to be at the forefront of defending and promoting democracy and the rule of law in Fiji.

"New Zealand has consistently and rightly expressed serious concerns about the Fiji coup and its aftermath. The coup has also been widely condemned by the Forum, the Commonwealth, the UN, and a wide range of governments.  
We would have thought the head of the Fiji Human Rights Commission would have done the same," Ruth Dyson said.
