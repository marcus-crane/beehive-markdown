New Zealanders are saving enough electricity to power 15,000 homes, through the simple act of changing the kind of light bulbs we use, Energy and [Climate Change](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/about/) Minister David Parker said today.

"We now have 1.5 million energy-saving bulbs in New Zealand households –cutting carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 18,000 cars off the road.

"That's a fantastic achievement, and I'm encouraged to see how quickly New Zealanders have cottoned onto the benefits of installing these bulbs."

Using energy efficient light bulbs to curb emissions is just one of many simple tips given in the Ministry for the Environment’s three new publications on climate change, launched by David Parker today.

The new publications provide New Zealanders with accessible information about climate change and everyday tips on reducing [greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/about/emissions.html). The booklets also include maps on the likely impacts on New Zealand and the substantial cost associated with weather-related disasters.

"Lighting accounts for more than 10 per cent of the electricity used in our homes. By cutting back on power use at home we can also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated through making electricity.

"Small [actions](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/about/take-action.html) like these that can help us tackle climate change collectively and help ensure New Zealand’s sustainability for years to come,” Mr Parker said.

David Parker said the publication of the booklets represents just one part of the Labour-led government’s response to climate change: "The government is taking lots of steps to tackle climate change because there is no one silver bullet for reducing our emissions."

"We are developing policies to help curb the growth of emissions in each sector, and support New Zealanders to make a positive contribution.

"There’s already a lot of energy and enthusiasm amongst New Zealanders to do something and the government wants to make sure that the right tools and resources are available."

Consultation on a range of climate change policy options runs to 30 March 2007. To find out more about the options and making a submission, please visit [www.climatechange.govt.nz/consultation/index.html](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/consultation/index.html)

### BACKGROUND INFORMATION

#### Electricity efficiency

- An energy-efficient lamp uses one-fifth the power of an incandescent lamp producing the same amount of light
- The installation of one energy-saving lamp is estimated to save more than $100 in power bills over the life of the lamp
- The Electricity Commission aims to get another 1.5 million energy-saving lamps into New Zealand homes during the first half of 2007 as part of its $3 million energy–saving lamp programme
- 14 regional organisations took part in the first phase of the programme
