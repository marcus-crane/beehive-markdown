Progress towards streamlining the trans-Tasman business environment will be top of the agenda when Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Australian Treasurer Peter Costello hold annual talks in Wellington on Monday 29 January.

"I look forward to these meetings as they are a valuable opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest and importantly to accelerate progress on the Single Economic Market agenda," Dr Cullen said today.

"Australia remains our largest trading partner, a valuable market of well over 20 million people right on our doorstep and the first offshore market for many Kiwi companies.

"Therefore, it is vital we continue the momentum in recent years towards a single economic market. Our aim is to make it as easy for a company to expand its business in Sydney as it is in Auckland.

"At last year's meeting in Melbourne we agreed to legislative changes so our respective banking supervisors could better support each other to improve financial system stability, allowed for the mutual recognition of securities offerings and improved information sharing between competition authorities.

"At Monday's meeting Peter and I will discuss:

- Trans-Tasman tax issues, including implications of the International Tax Review;
- Business law coordination;
- Banking supervision;
- Climate change;
- Trade and other regional economic issues, including Australia's hosting of APEC later this year."

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne will attend some of the discussions.

Dr Cullen and Mr Costello will hold a media conference at the conclusion of the talks at 3.30pm in the Beehive Theatrette and will later attend a Trans-Tasman Business Circle function.
