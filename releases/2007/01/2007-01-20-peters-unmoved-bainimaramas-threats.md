Foreign Minister Winston Peters is unmoved by Frank Bainimarama's threats of retaliation against New Zealand for imposing travel sanctions in the wake of last year's Fiji coup.

Mr Bainimarama threatened to retaliate after Parmesh Chand, the new head of the Fiji Prime Minister's Office under Mr Bainimarama's regime, was denied entry to New Zealand to visit his family.

However Mr Peters said Mr Bainimarama's threats only served to demonstrate how badly he had misread international opposition to his coup.

"Mr Bainimarama was told very clearly during his visit to New Zealand in November exactly what would happen if he followed through with his publicly stated intention of removing the Fiji Government," Mr Peters said.

"The imposition of travel sanctions was among those measures.

"Mr Bainimarama was also told that each and every action would be taken with regret given the deep affection that New Zealand people have for Fiji and its people. Sadly, he clearly under-estimated our resolve.

"The sanctions imposed against Fiji will remain in place for as long as necessary. We are waiting for an indication of when those presently in control in Fiji intend to restore constitutional and democratic government. There has been no sign of that so far.

"New Zealand remains willing to assist Fiji with the restoration of democracy and good governance, but we will not bend in the face of threats from anyone," Mr Peters said.
