Trade Minister, Phil Goff, welcomed New Zealand's signature of an agreement on rules for wine labelling in 'new world' wine markets.

"This is a positive outcome which has been welcomed by New Zealand wine producers. It simplifies requirements placed on producers and reduces their costs", said Mr Goff.

"The Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labelling was signed on 23 January  
by members of the World Wine Trade Group (WWTG), comprising New Zealand,  
Australia, Canada, the US, Chile and Argentina. It applies to trade between  
WWTG members.

"We send just under half our wine to WWTG markets, and bring in around three-quarters of our wine imports from these countries. These new rules will make it easier, more predictable and less costly for our wine industry to export, and will facilitate consumer choice.

"The New Zealand wine industry, represented by New Zealand Winegrowers, worked closely with the government throughout the negotiations, and made a valuable contribution to this result.

"The labelling agreement establishes common rules for presenting key basic information - product name, alcohol content, volume and country of origin - on wine labels, while giving producers and importing countries flexibility on other aspects of labelling. It is consistent with New Zealand's current regulatory framework and practice. The agreement will now be submitted to Parliament for ratification.

"Industry projections are that wine exports will exceed 70 million litres, worth nearly $700 million, this year, with further increases to over a billion dollars forecast within a few years.

"Agreements that facilitate trade, such as this help the development of an industry which is becoming increasingly important to New Zealand," Mr Goff said.
