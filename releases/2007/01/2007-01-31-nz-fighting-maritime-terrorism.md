New Zealand has signed two international protocols addressing the threat of maritime terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

The new protocols strengthen the 1988 [Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation](http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=259&doc_id=686).

They create new offences relating to maritime terrorism and the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, and establish a regime allowing law enforcement and other officials to board vessels where they suspect an offence has been committed.

Eleven other nations have so far signed the treaties, including Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Mr Peters said legislation would have to be passed before New Zealand could ratify the protocols, which would make them binding.
