New members have been appointed to the Tourism Board, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

The three new appointments are John Barrett, Chairman of the New Zealand Maori Tourism Council, Glenys Coughlan, Te Papa Director, and Kay McKelvie, Media Pictures Ltd Director.

In July, Malcolm Johns, Chief Executive of Intercity Group (NZ) Ltd, will join the board, taking over from Peter Stubbs.

"The new members are all hugely experienced people and leaders in their own right," Mr O'Connor said.

"They bring a mix of skills, which will help the tourism sector meet new challenges and continue to develop into the future."

Mr O'Connor said outgoing board members, Mike Tamaki, Keith Johnston and Matthew Boyd, had served the tourism industry exceptionally well.

"I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to Mike, Keith and Matthew for the great work they have done and the huge passion they have shown. The industry is all the better for it.

"The board in its entirety should be immensely proud of its record of overseeing the strongest growth in New Zealand tourism's history."

The tourism industry contributes $17.5 billion per annum to GDP.

The function of the New Zealand Tourism Board is to develop, implement and promote strategies for tourism, advise the Government and the tourism industry on matters relating to the development, implementation and promotion of those strategies.

Paul Bingham, Kathy Guy, Susan Johnstone and Sean Murray have been reappointed to the board, Mr O'Connor said.
