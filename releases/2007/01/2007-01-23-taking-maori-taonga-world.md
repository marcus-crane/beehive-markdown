Mauri Ora takes Maori taonga to the world

New Zealand has taken centre stage in Japan with the exhibition of the largest collection of Maori taonga (treasures) to leave New Zealand in over 20 years.

*Mauri Ora: Treasures from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa*, was opened at Tokyo National Museum in a moving Maori dawn ceremony, with Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Mahara Okeroa and Maori King Tukeita Paki, on his first overseas engagement.

The Tokyo [exhibition](http://www.tnm.jp/en/servlet/Con?pageId=B01&processId=01&event_id=3675) of 122 items is the largest collection of Maori taonga to travel overseas since Te Maori in 1984.

The collection includes items with early Pacific connections, unique carvings, ceremonial artefacts, traditional weapons, waka huia (treasure boxes), jewellery and woven kakahu (clothing), taonga used by tohunga (ancestral experts) including ceremonial adzes, puppets for ritual use, and tools for ta moko (tattooing).

"Japanese audiences will see something of what is special about Maori culture as well as the vibrant and creative nation we are. I am proud that Maori culture continues to play a significant part in our distinct New Zealand culture and identity. In both traditional and modified forms, Maori practices make us different from any other nation in the world,” said Mahara Okeroa.

"We can take pride in a cultural identity that embodies our unique heritage and creativity. I think it’s part of a much stronger sense of national identity that has emerged over the past few years".

"The exhibition also demonstrates the government’s commitment to investing in the arts, and we will continue to give priority to policies that contribute to a strong sense of national identity and pride,” said Mahara Okeroa.

Mauri Ora was developed by Te Papa under a cultural exchange programme with the Tokyo National Museum. In March 2006, Te Papa showcased Splendours of Japan, showing over 130 Japanese treasures compiled by the Tokyo National Museum.

"Cultural exchanges bring us fresh perspectives on distant peoples and cultures; they also enable us to view ourselves anew. They allow us to identify that which sets us apart and defines us, and also to recognise the values, attitudes and beliefs that we have in common with other peoples,” Mahara Okeroa said.

Mauri Ora is in Tokyo from 22 January to 18 March 2007.
