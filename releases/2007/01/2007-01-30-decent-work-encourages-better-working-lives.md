The launch of [*Decent Work: Charting our Progress*](http://www.dol.govt.nz/services/decentwork/) establishes New Zealand as a leader in promoting valuable working lives for its workforce, [said]() Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson.

The Decent Work project - jointly led by the Department of Labour, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand – outlines New Zealand’s approach to meeting the International Labour Organisation's goal of Decent Work.

"The [ILO aims](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/about/index.htm) to change the lives of millions of people worldwide by improving the social and economic wellbeing of the countries they live in. This is a vital goal when you consider the statistics - 12.3 million people worldwide are victims of forced labour and half the world’s population earns less than two dollars a day," said Ruth Dyson.

"The ILO's Decent Work initiatives encourage productive work which delivers a fair income in an environment of freedom, equity and security.

"New Zealand is taking the lead by adopting a national approach to meeting the ILO’s goal, through identifying factors that are crucial to success. These include:

- Developing legislation to support workers and employers
- Enabling families and caregivers to combine working and caring
- Increasing capabilities of people in the workforce
- Improving the environment in which people and businesses work
- Participating in international forums and developing international agreements on work.

"New Zealand's involvement in this initiative is an opportunity, as a founding member of the ILO, to support a worldwide goal with far-reaching consequences. It also offers New Zealand significant social and economic benefits.

"In the current environment of labour and skills shortages, it is vital that New Zealand’s workplaces are attractive to workers and the Decent Work initiative supports this goal," Ms Dyson said.
