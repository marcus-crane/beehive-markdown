Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven is encouraged by the increase in care taken by New Zealand motorists in 2006, resulting in the lowest annual road toll since 1960.

"New Zealand motorists are obviously more aware of the consequences of speed and drink driving, and are taking greater care and responsibility for their actions behind the wheel.

"However, we can not afford to be complacent. Most of the 387 deaths on New Zealand roads last year could have been avoided.

"Once again the major causes of road fatalities in 2006 were excessive speed and drink driving. In addition, many of the victims were not wearing seatbelts.

The tragic loss of each life has caused needless grief and anguish to family members and friends all over the country," said Mr Duynhoven.

The government has introduced several road safety initiatives to raise the awareness of the consequences of careless driving. The associated advertising campaigns target drink driving, excessive speed, use of seat belts, and the need to drive to the conditions.

Despite particularly unseasonal weather over most of the country, the 2006 holiday road toll also showed a marked improvement with 9 fatalities, the lowest for 25 years, and 13 less than 2005.

"With continuing education and awareness of road safety, along with police enforcement on our roads, we aim to reduce the road toll to less than 300 by 2010," Mr Duynhoven said today.
