New Zealand has been leading climate change discussions in Sweden on how to speed up the delivery of technology that will help the world reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate Change Minister David Parker was picked to lead off the important debate among 29 invited countries, on how carbon markets might bring forward the development and deployment of crucial technology such as carbon capture and storage, and renewables.

"This was a high honour, given the other two lead speakers were China and the European Union," David Parker said. "All nations agree that low emissions technologies are going to play a pivotal role in action on climate change. What we have to agree on is the best way to get these key technologies deployed as soon as possible.

"A fundamental issue yet to be resolved is to what extent developing countries should take on the extra cost of employing low emissions technology, and how developed countries could share that cost."

The informal discussions in Sweden's northern town of Riksgraensen include a consideration of how a global carbon market might assist the uptake of climate change technologies in both developing and developed countries.

"Thanks to the Labour-led government, New Zealand is already focused on developing a national cap and trade scheme that would limit greenhouse gas emissions and encourage businesses to adopt low carbon technologies, Other countries are also recognising the opportunities this kind of system offers.

"But the market won't necessarily solve all our problems, and part of the discussion here is how governments can accelerate the development of key technologies, through subsidies, research grants and the like.

"It's encouraging to see this progress, as the world tries to reach an international agreement to follow the first Kyoto committment period of 2008-2012. The objective is to complete this agreement by 2009," David Parker said.

"It's also encouraging to see that in recent weeks the USA has re-engaged and agreed that the United Nations is the right forum in which this kind of agreement should take place."
