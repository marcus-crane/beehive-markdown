John Key should be embarrassed by yet another National blunder says Energy Minister, David Parker.

"But his resurrection of Think Big is not the first bold statement he's made only to attempt to abandon his position. He's done the same with taking action on climate change and actually believing it's real saying until recently: 'this is a complete and utter hoax… even if one believes in global warming – and I am somewhat suspicious of it' and yet then saying he's always believed in it. And the same again on Iraq when he said New Zealand was 'missing in action…in the war in Iraq' only to later say 'National wouldn’t have sent troops'," said David Parker.

"Next we should expect Key to admit that he was flat wrong about his resurrection of another power project on the West Coast – the Dobson Hydro Scheme. This project involved the flooding of conservation land, part of which Nick Smith added to the conservation estate in the 1990s. The project has been superseded by the Arnold River scheme, which has a lower environmental impact."

"Even more telling is his admission that he takes advice from spin doctors instead of from National's energy spokesperson, Gerry Brownlee. Key said he should have asked his press secretary what project he was committing to build. That National's leader is taking advice directly from a small band of spin doctors and ignoring his own front bench is simply a continuation of the approach to decision making laid bare in the Hollow Men.

"How must Gerry feel? He sees himself as a senior frontbencher but was dumped as Deputy Leader by Key and was given the energy portfolio, only to find himself usurped by Key's press adviser."

"Key may attempt to laugh it off, but this is serious. It is simply not acceptable to make such mistakes. His incompetence will cause major concerns among investors that he does not have a grasp of the facts, makes policy on the hoof and refuses to take qualified advice. Key is also contradicting National Party rhetoric around climate change, energy policy, the environment and sustainability which he sought to promote just last week at the Green party conference," David Parker said.
