“Horticulture is one of our most important exports,” Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today. “Not just directly in the aggregate value of exports, but also in the contribution horticulture makes to regional New Zealand and in providing jobs for New Zealanders.”

Jim Anderton was speaking in Wellington at the launch of Horticulture New Zealand’s Report: “Barriers to Our Export Trade”.

He emphasised that the trade playing field is not level. “Trade is neither free nor fair. The report estimates the losses from tariff barriers alone are worth $25,000 a year in income to an average grower.”

After kiwifruit, wine and apples, New Zealand’s next biggest export crops are onions and squash. “But we also send overseas fresh, processed and frozen fruit, as well as vegetables. We send avocados, flowers and bulbs. These are very substantial earners for New Zealand,” Jim Anderton said.

“And they face some very substantial barriers. For example, in our sixth largest market, Korea, tariffs impose a cost on our horticultural products of over forty percent of the shipped value. Honey exports to Korea face a tariff of over 300 percent.”

Tariffs are not the only barrier facing horticultural exporters. In international markets, consumers are increasingly demanding high standards of environmental and social responsibility.

“Fortunately, we have a story to tell as good as anyone’s on those measures. Take the spurious issue of ‘food miles’. Of course, what matters is the total carbon footprint in the production process, and New Zealand can show that, even after taking into account distance to market, we use much less carbon than our European competitors. Shipping across the world, for example, might use less carbon per kilogram than trucking the same weight across Europe’s autobahns.

“The food miles issue is spurious, but it is a threat. And we will need to keep improving our act to ensure we remain in front of the breaking wave.”

The Report also clearly shows that there are situations where science is used to justify restrictions on trade or management at the border but Jim Anderton questions some instances of this. “It isn’t the science that is blocking our apples from going to Australian consumers − it is a scandalous misuse of science,” Jim Anderton said. “Fumigation at the Japanese border is a matter of trade protection, not science.

“It’s up to the industry to maintain high standards, both in the product itself and in the production process. Market access is hard gained and easily lost. One small slip in practice, in one orchard, could well see long-term exclusion from an important market.”

Jim Anderton ended by congratulating Horticulture New Zealand on the report. “I look forward to the industry continuing to work with the government to keep the pressure on the unfair barriers we face.”
