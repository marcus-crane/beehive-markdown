"We need to celebrate the leadership being shown by young people who are making positive changes to their health and encouraging others to adopt life-long healthy lifestyles through good nutrition and increasing their physical activity," says Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Minister was endorsing comments made by Health Minister Pete Hodgson at Mansell Senior School where he thanked the school and community for their help in encouraging healthy active lifestyles.

"I have been very impressed with the positive changes young people are choosing to make to their own lives, and the leadership they are showing to encourage change within their families and their communities," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"It's great to see this government's investment in young people and their health is paying off."

The Minister says, "This Labour-led government invested $76 million in last year's budget and a further $50.7 million in Budget 2007 in the Healthy Eating-Healthy Action: Oranga Kai-Oranga Pumau campaign, which aims to improve nutrition and increase physical activity.

"On top of this we've invested $67 million in "Mission On", a package of government initiatives to help young people improve their nutrition and be more active.

"We're working hard to improve the health of New Zealanders with this and other initiatives like the Fruit in Schools programme, removing full sugar fizzy and energy drinks from secondary schools by 2009, and helping parents with practical advice on how to achieve healthy diets for children."

Studies show that even small changes in nutrition and physical activity can make a significant difference in people's health over time.

"Too often discussions about youth focus on negative risk-taking behaviour. Let's celebrate instead the positive steps these young people have made to make a real difference to their and their whanau's health," says Nanaia Mahuta.
