There has been a huge 81 per cent reduction in the number of Mâori receiving an unemployment benefit since 1999 despite erroneous claims by National today about the figures, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

National MP Georgina te Heuheu claimed today that the proportion of Mâori receiving an unemployment had risen from 31 to 37 per cent under Labour and tried to suggest this meant that Labour had widened the unemployment gap between Mâori and non-Maori.

In fact the proportion of Mâori receiving an unemployment benefit as at May 2007 was 33 per cent, not 37 per cent, Mr Horomia said.

This is a decrease from March when the figure was 34.3 per cent - again quite different from the 37 per cent figure Mrs te Heuheu appears to have plucked from the air.

The latest figures actually show the proportion of Mâori receiving an unemployment benefit has declined by 43 per cent since May last year, whereas the unemployment figures for the general population decreased by 40 per cent over the same period.

"This suggests, contrary to what National is claiming, that Mâori moved off the unemployment benefit at a faster rate than the general population over the past year."

"In March I celebrated the fact that the number of Mâori on the unemployment benefit had dropped below 10,000 - to 9,902 - for the first time in many years. That figure dropped again in May to 8,238. That's a huge 81 per cent reduction from the 44,378 Mâori on the same benefit when National left office."

"It's a shame Mrs te Heuheu either isn't up with the facts or won't acknowledge the progress Mâori are making," Mr Horomia said.
