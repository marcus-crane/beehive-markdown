The government welcomes the arrival this week of the first of about 200 Saudi Arabian students who will study here under a Saudi government-sponsored programme, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"The King Abdullah Scholarships Programme offers considerable benefits to New Zealand, in terms of both export income and strengthened cooperation and understanding between New Zealand and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council," Dr Cullen said.

Students from Gulf States have been studying in New Zealand in numbers since 2001. There were 1782 students from Saudi Arabia studying in New Zealand in 2006. The vast majority, 1420, were enrolled at English language schools.

New Zealand is one of a number of international partners the Saudi government has developed relationships with to meet its higher education needs.

"The increase in government-sponsored students is evidence of the strong relationship developed between New Zealand and Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, in the education arena in recent years," said Dr Cullen. "It is also a vote of confidence by Saudi Arabia in the quality and quantity of New Zealand education providers."

All students coming to New Zealand under this programme have been subject to strict vetting from both the Saudi and New Zealand authorities to ensure their suitability before they leave the Kingdom.

The New Zealand government and education providers make every effort to support the students, both before and during their time in New Zealand, in order to ease the cultural transition process and ensure their education needs are met. Additionally the New Zealand government supplies pre-departure information on studying in New Zealand.

"I am confident this programme will further strengthen New Zealand's international reputation as a quality provider of higher education, as well as enriching the experience for our own students," said Dr Cullen.

"Improving the quality of international education is a priority for the government. It's our fourth largest export industry, earning $2 billion a year. Current reforms to the tertiary funding framework aim to improve quality and relevance across the sector and this should further enhance our reputation as a provider of high quality international education."
