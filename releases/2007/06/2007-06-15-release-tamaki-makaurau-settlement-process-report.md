The government welcomes the release of the Waitangi Tribunal’s Tamaki Makaurau Settlement Process Report as an opportunity to resume progress in settling Treaty claims in Auckland, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton said today.

"The Crown's goal is to bring a comprehensive, durable and final resolution to all historical claims in the Auckland region, not just those of Ngati Whatua o Orakei but for all groups with an interest in the region.

"The report makes a number of recommendations, which the Crown will now carefully consider, though some key themes are immediately evident.

"The report broadly addresses Crown policy for dealing with overlapping claimant groups. The Tribunal’s recommendations on this complex area will be of particular interest. In the past, the Tribunal has inquired into other settlements using a similar process and given the Crown useful guidance on working with overlapping claimants.

"The Waitangi Tribunal recommendations in relation to the Ngati Whatua o Orakei negotiations will also need to be considered carefully, given their potential impact on the Crown and Ngati Whatua o Orakei achieving a settlement.

"The Waitangi Tribunal has recommended putting the agreement with Ngati Whatua o Orakei on hold until other groups in Auckland have advanced their own settlement negotiations.

"The Tribunal suggests that the other groups with interests in Auckland could join together in a large natural group to negotiate a settlement of their claims to the Auckland region, although the claims of these groups often relate to quite different grievances.

"This approach also raises questions over whether all these groups are equally prepared and organised; and critically how their claims outside Auckland should be addressed. For instance some of these groups have claims that stretch as far south as Tauranga and right up into Northland.

"The Tribunal also suggests that the Crown prioritise such a negotiation ahead of other groups elsewhere in New Zealand who have engaged with the Crown in good faith, and are close to formally entering Treaty settlement negotiations.

"These suggestions would represent a significant shift away from the current Crown approach and would lead to delays in settling claims where claimants are ready and willing to proceed to settlement.

"It could also mean delaying the settlement with Ngati Whatua o Orakei for what could be a number of years.

"As part of my consideration of the report, I will be looking at whether there are alternative approaches that could address some of the issues raised by the Waitangi Tribunal, but in a timely way that meets the needs of both claimants and the Crown.

"The Inquiry report also raises concerns about the actions of officials who were involved in the Inquiry process. I am confident that officials have acted in good faith throughout this process and sought to address the Tribunal's concerns as they arose. That said, I think it is entirely appropriate that the Crown continues to ensure their systems are as robust as possible."
