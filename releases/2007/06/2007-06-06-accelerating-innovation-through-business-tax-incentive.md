The Labour-led government is delivering the most substantial changes to the business environment in twenty years, which could change the entire landscape of research, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

"The Business Tax Reform Package announced in Budget 2007 includes a $630 million (over four years) tax incentive for businesses to carry out their own research to improve their business performance.

"It's a huge incentive to boost private sector research, and highlights the central position that research and development (R&D) can play in building a more innovative and dynamic economy. The rate of private sector investment in New Zealand is currently a third of the OECD average."

Steve Maharey gave further details of how the tax incentive can work for businesses to a group of government, business and science representatives today in Auckland, at the 'Accelerating Innovation Business Breakfast'.

"Under the tax credit, businesses investing in R&D can earn a 15 per cent tax credit on that spending. For example, a company investing $100,000 in research would get $15,000 back in a tax rebate.

"The incentive will make us more internationally competitive, because overseas companies will find it more attractive to invest in R&D here, and it will help New Zealand-based businesses be more innovative and successful.

"The private sector can also form partnerships with government bodies, such as Universities and Crown Research Institutes, to take advantage of the incentive. This will also promote public private partnerships."

The business breakfast was hosted by NZBio and the Capitalising on Research and Development Action Group (CRAG). CRAG is a group of business, science and government leaders, led by Phil O'Reilly of Business New Zealand. The group aims to stimulate business investment in innovation and research, and plans to roll out regional and sector work shops.

"The tax incentive and working groups such as CRAG, represent how this government aims transform our economy in partnership with businesses."
