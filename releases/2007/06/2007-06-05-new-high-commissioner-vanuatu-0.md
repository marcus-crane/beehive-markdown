New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Vanuatu will be career diplomat Jeff Langley, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“New Zealand and Vanuatu have developed a close and friendly relationship in the years since we opened our diplomatic mission there in 1987," Mr Peters said.

"We work alongside each other in regional assemblies such as the Pacific Islands Forum, and New Zealand has a significant development programme in Vanuatu.

“Last year we agreed on a new five-year development strategy, worth around $NZ85 million, which focuses on improving basic education, governance, and economic development," Mr Peters said.

Mr Langley, currently Deputy Director of the South and South East Asia Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has previously been posted to Brasilia and New York.

He will take up his appointment in August, replacing Paul Willis.
