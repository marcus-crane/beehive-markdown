Tonga's hosting of this year's Pacific Islands Forum, and the kingdom's democratic reform process will be discussed when Foreign Minister Winston Peters makes a one-day visit to Nuku'alofa next Wednesday.

Mr Peters is scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Tu'a Taumoepeau, King George Tupou V, Prime Minister Feleti Sevele, Police Minister Siaosi ‘Aho, and Finance Minister Siosiua ‘Utoikamanu.

Meetings are also scheduled with Reconciliation Adviser Viliami Afeaki, and the Civil Society Forum, which is made up of a range of organisations, including those that have been pushing for political reform.

“Tonga will host the Pacific Islands Forum's Leaders Meeting in October. This is a big undertaking for them, and there are a number of pressing regional issues for consideration at this year's Forum meeting," Mr Peters said.

"Tonga's social and economic recovery following last year's disastrous riots in Nuku'alofa, and the on-going political reform process, will also be an important part of Wednesday's discussions.

"New Zealand continues to encourage all parties in Tonga to work constructively towards political reconciliation and reform.

"While we have maintained a close interest in this process, it is up to the people of Tonga to determine the pace and direction of change, and that needs to happen in an atmosphere conducive to maintaining broad public support for the process.

"The talks will cover a range of other issues too. New Zealand has a broad and deep relationship with Tonga, including a substantial development assistance programme, close personal links, and a strong trading relationship," Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters also hopes to visit at least one of New Zealand’s aid projects.
