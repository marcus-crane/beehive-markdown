Defence Minister Phil Goff and Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker today presented a cheque for $250,000 to the EVSA (Neville Wallace Memorial) Children's and Grandchildren's Trust.

“Today’s formal cheque presentation to the Trust represents another important milestone as the Government implements the Memorandum of Understanding reached last year with the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association.

“The Trust helps children and grandchildren of Vietnam Veterans reach their potential and this extra funding will allow the Trust to do even more.

“For nearly fifteen years the Trust has provided financial support to children and grandchildren of Vietnam veterans in a wide range of fields, including tertiary education, sports, and leadership.

“The establishment of the Trust by Vietnam veterans was a gift from one generation to the next, and it is great being able to support such a worthwhile initiative,” said Phil Goff and Rick Barker.
