The Government’s commitment to sustainable building is a significant step towards New Zealand becoming truly sustainable, say Environment Minister David Benson-Pope, and Climate Change Minister David Parker.

"New Zealand puts itself at the cutting edge, by mandating that all new government office buildings meet at least the best-practice standards for green building," David Parker said.

From 1 July, all new A-grade office buildings being constructed to house government staff in central business districts must have a minimum five-star Green Star New Zealand rating, which represents "excellence". A four-star rating is required for B and other grades of office building, signifying "best practice".

The recently completed Department of Conservation headquarters was designed to achieve the 5-star standard, and it could be the first government building to get an as-built Green Star rating.

A further series of green building rating tools is being investigated for schools, housing and commercial office building fit-outs.

Mr Benson-Pope said the Government is walking the talk on climate change and environmental sustainability with its decision to set concrete targets for its ministries and departments.

"Through the Govt3 programme, public service agencies have already taken great strides in improving their sustainability. Many have introduced recycling schemes, encouraged staff to leave their cars at home and switched to buying green office supplies among their varied initiatives," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The responsibility for developing a more sustainable nation needs to be shared by everyone, and the Government is showing the way by taking these important steps towards a greener future for New Zealand," he said.
