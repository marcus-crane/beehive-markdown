Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope today officially launched a programme aimed at helping recipients’ of Sickness and Invalid’s Benefits in Wanganui back into work.

The package, Providing Access to Health Solutions (PATHS), is an employment programme operating in a number of District Health Board (DHB) regions around the country. PATHS Wanganui is the seventh service to be launched.

“The programme offers an intensive case management service to Sickness and Invalid’s Benefit clients who wish to work but cannot due to the affects of their health or disability. Under PATHS, key services are brought together to help these beneficiaries move towards their employment goals.

“Many of these services already exist in the health sector but PATHS integrates clinical, employment and support services and brings people with real needs to the attention of the DHB and other health providers.

“The launch of PATHS Wanganui enables us to offer opportunities to more people. We are seeing people transform their lives with the help of PATHS. They are participating more fully in their communities and building better lives for themselves and their families,” Mr Benson-Pope said.

In December 2006, 1,007 people on the Sickness and Invalid’s Benefits had participated in PATHS, through a wide range of health interventions, from surgery to counselling. Of that group, 345 people had their health barriers removed or reduced to a point where they no longer needed these benefits.

PATHS Wanganui is a joint initiative of Work and Income, Wanganui DHB and the Wanganui Regional Primary Health Organisation.

PATHS is part of the Government’s Working New Zealand: Work Focussed Support Strategy and aims to bring employment, training and health services together in one package. It changes the focus of the service Work and Income delivers to people with ill-health and disabled people.

PATHS already operates successfully at DHBs in South Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Wellington, Canterbury and Nelson/Marlborough. It is set to be rolled out in Mid Central, Hutt Valley and Otago DHB regions.
