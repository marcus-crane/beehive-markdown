Two-thirds of smokers in New Zealand have tried to quit in the past five years, the first comprehensive survey of New Zealanders' tobacco use shows.

“This is strong evidence that the majority of smokers are fed up with the habit, and that the Labour-led Government's multi-pronged approach to help people give up makes sense,’’ Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said.

The New Zealand Tobacco Use Survey (NZTUS) benchmarks New Zealand's tobacco control performance for the first time and allows international comparisons to be made. The survey will be repeated in 2008.

Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui launched the report from the survey at Parliament today.

"Smoking rates are highest among Maori (45.8 per cent) and Pacific peoples (36.2 per cent). But the Government and sector groups are having success in reaching them. Nearly 68 per cent of Maori and 60 per cent of Pacific peoples have made quit attempts in the past five years," Mr Ririnui said.

The survey also reveals that three quarters of young people would not be smokers if given the choice again, Mr O'Connor said.

"Clearly, once you've started this horrible habit it is very difficult to quit, resulting in around 5000 preventable deaths every year. People should have all the support they can to help them pack it in."

This year’s Budget dedicated an additional $43.6 million to tobacco control over the next four years, with about $8 million earmarked for further initiatives that aim to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking, Mr O'Connor said.

Other Labour-led Government initiatives include outlawing smoking in workplaces, campaigns against second-hand smoking, and introducing graphic images on cigarette packets early next year, Mr O'Connor said.
