“Today is World Refugee Day and a great day time to acknowledge the contribution of young refugees to Aotearoa New Zealand,” says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“This year’s UN World Refugee Day celebrates the Voices of Young Refugees and reminds us that we need to engage and listen to youth refugees about their challenges, aspirations and goals for the future,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Initiatives like the Talk With Me!, a secondary school writing competition, announced by my colleague David Cunliffe today, will help young refugees have their voices heard and in turn will help build understanding of resettlement issues. The National Refugee Resettlement Forum is another initiative to do this.”

The Labour-led government also funds a wide range of special support services to assist the resettlement process of refugees in their first years in New Zealand.

Over the last nine years New Zealand has resettled over 2,300 young refugees aged from 12 to 24 years - with over half of them aged between 12 to 17 years old.

“Resettlement for this age can be a very vulnerable time in a young person’s life, which is made harder when they’ve had to flee their home country to escape persecution, the threat of imprisonment, or threats to their lives. Young refugees need to learn a new language in a foreign country and cope with a new culture and education system," says Nanaia Mahuta.

Most young refugees in New Zealand have come from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Somalia, and Sri Lanka.

“Our Labour-led government is committed to building an inclusive nation with common values such as respect, tolerance and understanding. We all want Aotearoa New Zealand to be a fair and decent community where fundamental human rights of all people are protected and advanced.

"We can all learn from the voices of young refugees. World Refugee Day is a good day to begin,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
