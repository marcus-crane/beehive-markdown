New Zealand's Pandemic Planning is well advanced and stands us in good stead for any future pandemic event, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today from the APEC Health Minister's meeting in Sydney.

Health Ministers of APEC\`s 21-member countries are holding their third meeting from June 5 to 8 with Avian Influenza the main topic.

"New Zealand's work to prepare for a possible pandemic at national, regional and local level is going really well. Last month during Exercise Cruickshank there were mock scenarios at airports and hospitals to help frontline people rehearse our planning," Pete Hodgson said.

Led by the Ministry of Health, the four-day simulation of an influenza pandemic involved more than 30 government agencies and all 21 District Health Boards and their public health services.

"This is something that we must continue to prepare for and that is why the topic remains high on the agenda for Health Ministers," Pete Hodgson said.

The APEC is composed of Indonesia, Australia, the United States, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
