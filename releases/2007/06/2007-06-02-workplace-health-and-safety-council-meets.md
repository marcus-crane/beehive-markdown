The newly formed Workplace Health and Safety Council will focus on taking a New Zealand-wide approach to achieving the Workplace Health and Safety Strategy Vision: healthy, safe, productive New Zealand workplaces, says Ruth Dyson, Minister of Labour and Minister for ACC.

At its first meeting on 22 May, the Council agreed that its priority will be to identify actions and activities that make a difference and have the greatest impact.

"It's about finding opportunities to influence and co-ordinate improved information to workplaces about the attitudes, practices, systems and standards that best deliver the health and safety vision," said Ruth Dyson.

"It will be crucial for the Council to know the key issues, ideas and good practice initiatives already in place through employer and employee organisations, industry, workplaces, and professional and community groups."

Connecting with existing employer, employee and professional networks will be a vital part of the Council's role and will help the Council drive co-ordinated health and safety actions and information into workplaces and the wider community.

Over the next 12 months the Council will focus on providing advice on the best ways to:  
·Implement the Strategy over the medium to long term  
·Improve the interface between government agencies and how they implement key pieces of health and safety legislation.  
·Improve health and safety practices, systems, standards and information flow  
·Involve employer, employee organisations, industry and the community in health and safety initiatives.

The next meeting is on 28 August. The Council Chair will rotate, with Ross Wilson, President of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, chairing the August meeting and Phil O’Reilly, CEO of Business New Zealand, the following meeting, scheduled for December 2007.
