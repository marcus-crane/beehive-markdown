The government today welcomed the report of the [Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Pyschiatric Hospitals](http://www.confidentialforum.govt.nz), which has allowed former in-patients to discuss their experiences in an accessible, informal and confidential environment.

Forum chair Judge Patrick Mahony today presented its report to Attorney-General Michael Cullen, Health Minister Pete Hodgson, Justice Minister Mark Burton and Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker.

"I thank Judge Mahony, the other Forum members and especially the participants for having the courage to talk openly about their experiences," said Dr Cullen.

The Confidential Forum was established in 2004 to provide an opportunity for former in-patients, their families and staff members to formally speak about their experiences of psychiatric institutions in the period before November 1992.

493 people attended the Forum with hearings held in 22 locations between July 2005 and April 2007. Many participants were given follow-up counselling sessions and all were provided with tailored information about local and national support services and networks.

"This was a new reconciliation initiative and the right thing to have done. The Forum has been a valuable vehicle to help former patients come to terms with their experiences, many of whom were speaking for the first time about their stay in the institutions," said Dr Cullen.

"We have listened to Judge Mahony and that is why the government wants to build on the constructive steps taken by the Forum," said Health Minister Pete Hodgson.

"I know many of the those who participated in the Forum process found the listening and assistance services helpful and have helped to meet many of their concerns.

"Therefore, listening and assistance services offered to those who took part in the Forum, will now become available to all former patients who have been in state care in the period before November 1992."

The services will:

- provide former in-patients the opportunity to talk in a confidential and respectful environment;
- allow for the identification of the needs for the individual and/or their family;
- facilitate access to individual's records and related information and expert assistance to understand those services;
- explain and assist with application for existing welfare, health and education services;
- refer individuals, with their permission, to the responsible agency for further review of their circumstances and potential claims.

"The Forum has been a successful process for those who participated and we hope it goes a long way to resolving their issues," said the Ministers. "Former in-patients have been shown the care and respect they deserve."
