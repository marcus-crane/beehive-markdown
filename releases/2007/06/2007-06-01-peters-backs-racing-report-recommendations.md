Racing Minister Winston Peters is urging the racing industry to implement recommendations contained in a Department of Labour report on track safety procedures.

The department's report follows an investigation into the raceday incident at Rangiora last October that left two jockeys hospitalised. One of them, Judy Lawson, is still suffering from head injuries.

"Racecourse safety is the industry's most pressing issue," Mr Peters said.

"The report found that no deliberate action was taken at Rangiora to place jockeys at risk. However it made a number of recommendations that seek to reduce the likelihood of a repeat incident.

"This includes a formal procedure, which would include the input of jockeys, to review track safety when issues are raised.

"It is to be hoped that New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing will adopt these measures, which can only serve to ensure the safety of jockeys.

"All practical steps must be considered to avoid tragic injuries such as those suffered by Judy Lawson. We all wish her a full recovery."

Mr Peters, who has previously expressed concerns about poor facilities and tracks at some racecourses, urged clubs to take advantage of the annual $1 million safety fund announced in this year's Budget.

"The Racing Safety Development Fund offers dollar-for-dollar support for projects that improve the safety and quality of racecourse facilities. This will help reduce the number and seriousness of racing-related accidents."

Mr Peters said any decision about the on-going suitability of the Rangiora track for racing was a matter that had to be addressed by the parties involved.
