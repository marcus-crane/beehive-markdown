The Labour-led government will invest $92 million to build four new schools in the Takanini area of Auckland over the next 15 years, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

A new secondary school will be built on Walters Road beside Papakura Normal School, as well as three new primary schools on sites yet to be secured.

"The population of the Takanini area is projected to grow to 22,000, including 4,500 school children by 2020. The establishment of the four new schools will enable us to meet the needs of the local community and provide a world-class learning environment for the students," Steve Maharey said.

"The first primary school could be built as early as 2010, and the secondary school by 2015. In time community based early childhood education services will be developed on the sites, and a new catholic school will also be built to complement both the new and existing schools.

"The community has been closely involved in consultation process for the new schools, to ensure the best possible outcomes for local students.

"Like all new schools, these school will be state-of-the-art with design elements that reflect the local community, and help to provide the best possible education for students.

"Consultation with local school boards will continue before an establishment board, which will have responsibility for appointing a foundation principal, determining school policy and governance matters and ensuring the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community, is appointed.

"The Labour-led government currently invests $527.8 million in school property funding, which allows existing schools to continue modernising their buildings, as well as for the construction of new schools."
