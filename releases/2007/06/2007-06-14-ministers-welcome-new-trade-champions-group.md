The government has applauded the setting up of a new group to promote New Zealand's international business growth and is supporting a joint project to improve high level business links with Japan.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Trade Minister Phil Goff have welcomed the establishment of the International Business Forum (IBF). Its members include leading New Zealand firms, as well as business, trade and sector organisations with a focus on international trade.

Lianne Dalziel represented the government at a function to launch the Forum in Auckland this evening.

Phil Goff said the Forum is a welcome addition to New Zealand's team of "trade champions".

"The government looks forward to working with the Forum and will be providing some funding for joint projects where these are considered priorities. We have already committed to a project to improve high level business relationships with Japan," Phil Goff said.

"The Forum's vision for growth in New Zealand's international businesses is clearly in line with the Labour-led government's efforts to transform the economy. The collaborative partnership between the private and public sectors envisaged by the Forum is essential in delivering New Zealand's international trade objectives."

Lianne Dalziel said a major strength of the Forum is that it is an independent voice that is business-led and business-driven.

"This means the Forum is well-placed to provide leadership in identifying and exploiting new opportunities in international markets, and to articulate the needs and priorities of New Zealand's international businesses," Lianne Dalziel said.

"We looking forward to working closely with the Forum, and welcome the expertise it brings to this crucial area for New Zealand's future prosperity."
