“Young people are thinking about the future and what type of country they want to live in. More importantly what type of planet they are living on," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Today we celebrate twenty years since New Zealand became a nuclear free country.

"That decision was made under a Labour Government and has fundamentally contributed to the 'clean green image' we enjoy today," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Lange Labour government passed the nuclear free legislation - the New Zealand Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act on 8 June 1987.

“It was a strong response to the threat of nuclear war destroying the world as we knew it and provided a way to work for a more peaceful world.”

“The nuclear free legislation was a turning point – this was our first independent step forward on international issues. We may be a small country but we have huge ambition and strong values about a fair and decent society that cares for fellow citizens and the planet we are living on," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"Celebrating our nuclear free status is important because a new generation needs to push the boundaries towards building a peaceful society and global community."

“We can’t rest on our backsides – as a nation we continue to advocate to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to work for disarmament. All New Zealanders can be proud that this fifth Labour-led Government remains committed to that vision,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
