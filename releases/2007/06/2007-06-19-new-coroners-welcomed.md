Courts Minister Rick Barker has welcomed New Zealand’s new coroners meeting in Wellington this week for training.

“I have every confidence that these new coroners will take the new coronial system into the 21st century,” said Rick Barker.

“They will be the country’s first body of full-time professional coroners and will be ably guided by our first Chief Coroner, Judge Neil MacLean. Many of them are experienced coroners but there are also some new faces in the ranks as well and all are well qualified for the job.

“The new coronial system introduces significant reforms designed to enhance public confidence in the integrity and independence of the coronial system. It also recognises the need to address the distinct spiritual and cultural needs of Maori and other ethnic or religious groups as far as possible, in keeping with the purpose and function of the coronial regime.

“The new coroners will work in provincial areas as well as the main centres and travel on a circuit basis. Working on a full-time basis will enable coroners to spend time building relationships with communities, and educating people about the role of coroners,” said Rick Barker.

The new coronial system commences on 1 July 2007.
