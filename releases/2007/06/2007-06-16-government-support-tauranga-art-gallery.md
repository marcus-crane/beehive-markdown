Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Labour-led government will invest $650,000 in Tauranga's new public art gallery.

“Tauranga is expected to have significant population growth in the next 50 years, and is the only major city in New Zealand without a public art gallery. This project rectifies that," Helen Clark said.

“The Tauranga Art Gallery is of significant regional importance and will create opportunities for learning and exposure to notable New Zealand and other artworks.

“It will serve primarily as an exhibition venue, while over time developing a specific collection of artworks. It will also house a collection from notable New Zealand artist, Edward Bullmore, whose works have already been gifted to the gallery.

"The grant provides the funds necessary to complete an art gallery with multiple exhibition areas, a dedicated education space and attached resource room, and a performance venue.

“The gallery will be a venue for travelling art exhibitions, meaning that Tauranga and its environs will no longer miss out on opportunities to see significant artworks.

"The Tauranga Art Gallery Trust was established almost ten years ago with a vision of establishing a public art gallery to enhance the cultural life of the region, and the community has been driving the project ever since. It is strongly supported by the Tauranga City Council, as well as many other supporters and sponsors, including Bay Trust, Tauranga Energy Consumer Trust, and the Venetta Miles Estate," Helen Clark said.

The $32 million Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up by the Labour-led Government in 2005 to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

Grants in this financial year have already been awarded to:  
·Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (up to $6.5million)  
·Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust (up to $578,699)  
·McLean Park Regional Trust ($2.9 million)  
·Riverton Heritage and Tourist Centre (up to $172,203)

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said that as a result of the high calibre of applications received, the fund will be completely allocated this year.

"The high level of community interest in the fund has led Cabinet to ask me to report back on the level of demand for projects which would have been eligible to apply had the fund continued,” Rick Barker said.

“The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up at a time of falling lottery profits when less funding was available to support capital projects. The recent increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits has resulted in higher levels of funding being available for allocation, and has allowed the re-establishment of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

“The Lottery Community Facilities Fund is able to support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. Organisations considering applying should contact GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz or phone 0800 824 824,” Rick Barker said.
