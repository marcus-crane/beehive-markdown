Conservation Minister Chris Carter today announced a tentative list of eight sites New Zealand is intending to work towards nominating for world heritage status.

The tentative list will be submitted to the World Heritage 31st Session Committee meeting which begins in Christchurch this weekend.

The sites are listed below, and will be developed for nomination in the order listed:

1. Kahurangi National Park, Farewell Spit, Waikoropupu Springs and the Canaan Karst System
2. Waters and Seabed of the Fiords of Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) – an addition to Te Wahipounamu – South-West New Zealand World Heritage Area
3. Napier Art Deco Historic Precinct
4. Kerikeri Basin Historic Precinct
5. Waitangi Treaty Grounds Historic Precinct
6. Kermadec Islands and Marine Reserve
7. Auckland Volcanic Field
8. Whakarua Moutere, or the North-East Islands (including Poor Knights Islands)

"These sites are all important places for New Zealanders offering outstanding opportunities and experiences that will stand up very strongly against similar sites elsewhere in the world," Mr Carter said.

"What is on the list, and what is not, has been worked through by two expert advisory groups following more than 300 submissions from the public on 28 sites people thought should be considered. The expert advisory groups have whittled the list down, and Cabinet has made a final decision upon it.

"In this process there were always going to be winners and losers, but it is important to stress this list is tentative only. The sites themselves and the priority given to them may change as New Zealand begins to work through the complex process of formally nominating them for world heritage status," Mr Carter said.

"The nomination process alone can take up to three years for each site, and those nominations can only come from a tentative list lodged with the World Heritage Committee. The process involves extensive consultation with communities and parties likely to be affected, and there is no guarantee of success.

"Our aspiration is to begin one site nomination per year from New Zealand's tentative list," Mr Carter said.

"The order of priority of sites on the tentative list has been determined by the likely technical issues involved in their nomination."

The [World Heritage Convention](http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage considered to be of 'outstanding value to humanity'. Today, 182 countries have ratified the convention making it one of the most widely supported conventions of the United Nations.
