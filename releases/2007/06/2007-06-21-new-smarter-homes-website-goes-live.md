A new website, designed to help New Zealanders live in healthier, cosier and more cost-effective homes, was launched today by Energy Minister David Parker.

Mr Parker says the Smarter Homes website (www.smarterhomes.org.nz) offers advice on how to have a home that’s more sustainable, both environmentally and financially.

"This is about bringing the information together, so it's easier for New Zealanders to make smarter choices for themselves, and for the environment. It has advice that everyone can use, whether you want to know about low-toxic materials for your latest DIY project, or how to design your new house so it uses less water and power."

Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove says the website supports recent initiatives on new insulation requirements and on making it easier and cheaper to install solar water heating systems.

“Heating your home doesn’t have to cost the earth if you make smart choices. Whether you live in a modest flat or a mansion, you can take the axe to your power bill by doing a range of easy things, such as closing curtains at sunset and choosing energy efficient appliances.”

"This website is another example of how the Prime Minister's drive to make New Zealand more sustainable will not only have huge benefits for the environment, it will improve people's comfort and health, while at the same time lowering their gas and power bills."

Mr Cosgrove said research showed better insulated, warmer homes also improve health: "People in insulated homes have fewer days off work and school, they visit the doctor or hospital less often and their general health improves."

Smarter Homes has been designed to cut through all the information clutter when making decisions about building, renovating or buying or renting a home. It includes a HomeSmarts tool that can be customised so users can find out the best way to tackle building projects or problems in their home. The website has been developed by the Ministry for the Environment, in partnership with the Department of Building and Housing, Consumers’ Institute and BeaconPathway Ltd.

From July 1, the site will be administered by the Department of Building and Housing.
