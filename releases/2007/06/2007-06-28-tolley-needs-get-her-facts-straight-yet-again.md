"Anne Tolley should get her facts straight before trying to ruin the lives of vulnerable people in our communites," said the Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services, Ruth Dyson today.

Ruth Dyson was referring to media reports and Anne Tolley’s own press statement describing an 18 year old as a sexual predator who is under 24 hour a day supervision.

"This young man is trying to live independently in the community. He is not involved in the Youth Justice system, is not under supervision, is not in CYFS custody and has no court orders or any other imposed conditions on his movements relating to sex offences."

"Anne Tolley should be ashamed of promoting misinformation that could lead to vigilante actions against a vulnerable member of our community."

"He is completely free to go about his business and CYFS has provided helpers to assist him to live an independent life."

"I think CYFS caregivers and the valuable work they do should be supported, rather than continually criticised by the National Party," said Ruth Dyson.
