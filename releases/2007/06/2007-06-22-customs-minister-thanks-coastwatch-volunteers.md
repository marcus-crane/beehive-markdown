Our Coastwatch volunteers are an important part of protecting our border so it’s timely to thank these volunteers during Volunteer Awareness Week for the positive work that they do and the hours they contribute to make a difference in our community says Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“As an island nation Aotearoa New Zealand has an extensive coastline and much of it lies in remote areas. The local knowledge of the community and the vigilance of Coastwatchers especially, play a vital role in alerting Customs to suspicious activities.

Coastwatchers have been instrumental in protecting the border from international crime, illicit drugs, and other activities by land, sea and air.

“They look out for attempts to smuggle exotic flora or fauna, they report unusual activity by aircraft, or boat landings in isolated areas, ships signalling to the land, and boats meeting at sea.

“Volunteer Awareness Week is a good opportunity to give volunteering a go. If you’re interested in becoming a registered Coastwatcher, then phone 0800 4 CUSTOMS for more information. Or call that number to report suspicious activity – it’s answered 24 hours a day.

“Border security is everyone’s business. The whole community can help – not just those who live on the coast – by reporting any suspicious border activity – whether it’s on the coast, in the community, or at the airport. Everyone doing their bit and working together can make for safe and responsible communities.

“Our Labour-led government is committed to building strong communities. Volunteers, like Coastwatchers, do just that. And the wider community also have an important role in protecting our borders today.

“Thank you to Coastwatchers for their generosity and effort to protect the country's border,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
