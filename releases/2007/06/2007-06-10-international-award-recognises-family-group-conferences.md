New Zealand has received the American Humane Association Award for its pioneering use of the Family Group Conference, Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services announced today.

New Zealand’s Family Group Conference system of dealing with care and protection issues and youth justice cases was established by the 1989 Children, Young Persons and their Families Act.

"The Family Group Conference's origins are uniquely New Zealand and, because of its success, it has now been adopted and adapted as a best practice model in more than 20 countries worldwide and at least 35 states in the United States.

"This award is valuable recognition from one of the oldest United States organisations dedicated to child protection, who say that the Act and the Family Group Conference process have resulted in great strides in the child and family welfare systems in their country.

"Most importantly, they believe that the Family Group Conference has improved the lives of some of the United States' most vulnerable families.

"We know it is making a significant difference for our own children, young people and their families. Our government recognises that family must always be central to the choices made for children and young people, and CYFS is committed to moving Family Group Conferences even further to the front of their practice.

The American Humane Association award was presented to New Zealand Ambassador Roy Ferguson at a ceremony in Washington DC at the Association's Annual Family Group Decision Making Conference.
