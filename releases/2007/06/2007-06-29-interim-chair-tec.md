Tertiary Education Commissioner Jim Donovan will fill the role of interim chair of the TEC until a permanent replacement is found, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Jim Donovan fills the vacancy created by Russell Marshall, who retires at the end of June.

“Jim has been a commissioner since the TEC was set up in 2003 and has the necessary skills to step into this role,” Dr Cullen said. “He has the confidence of the commissioners, the sector and ministers. I am very pleased he has agreed to take this role on.”

Jim Donovan has a strong background in corporate governance, having been CEO of Fronde Systems Group Ltd, a leading New Zealand-based IT services company. Under Jim’s leadership, Fronde has rebranded and adopted a new sharper business focus.

“Jim understands the needs of businesses for skill development and innovation and he has a clear understanding of the role of the tertiary education system in building skills and innovation.”
