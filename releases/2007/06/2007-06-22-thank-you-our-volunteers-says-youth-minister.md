Volunteer Awareness Week is a time to celebrate and thank many thousands of volunteers for the wonderful work they do alongside and with rangatahi in our communities says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“Every day of the week there are thousands of volunteers making a difference by investing time and supporting young New Zealanders,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

Figures show that over one million New Zealanders are actively involved in formal or informal voluntary work within their communities each year, putting in millions of hours of unpaid work.

“Volunteers play a vital role in mentoring young people through life’s ups and downs. They support learning and the teaching of new skills or the handing down of traditional knowledge. They coach kapahaka, patrol our beaches, drive children to activities, coach sports teams, teach first aid or fishing, or work on the marae.

“Many young people in turn are becoming volunteers and are contributing to their communities - whether they are on the phones at Youthline, or advocates to ensure youth voices are heard, a buddy to a younger child, or lend a practical hand to an older New Zealander.

“Our Labour-led government is committed to building strong, sustainable and connected communities. Volunteers are the life blood of our communities and provide special support for and by young people.

“It is this diversity, with older and younger New Zealanders contributing time and working together in communities with families – young and old - that makes a difference. After all strong families make for strong communities and the government recognises the important contribution of volunteers and the importance of the community and voluntary sector to society,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
