New Zealand will participate in a multinational Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercise next week as part of its commitment to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“The PSI aims to foster cooperation among nations in halting the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction," Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand has become an active member of the PSI, and we hosted a meeting in Auckland in March.

“This exercise is being held at the Naval War College in the United States. It is a “table-top” simulation, so does not involve actual military deployments.

"Nineteen other countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Singapore have also been invited to participate.

“The exercise will test the ability of PSI partners to coordinate an appropriate response to a series of threats relating to weapons proliferation.

“The scenarios developed for these exercises are always challenging – they force participating countries to quickly develop their national responses while cooperating with international partners.

“The fact that the US is organising this exercise shows that, like New Zealand, it attaches importance to this non-proliferation initiative. It is a good example of our ability to work together in areas of mutual concern, while taking account of existing policy constraints,” Mr Peters said.

New Zealand will be represented by an interagency team led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and involving the Defence Force, Ministry of Defence, and Customs.
