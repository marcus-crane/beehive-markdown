**REGULATION OF NON-BANK DEPOSIT-TAKERS**

**Background**  
Non-Bank Deposit-Takers (NBDTs) are entities whose core business involves offering deposits or deposit-like securities to the public and the provision of financial services. The NBDT sector comprises a wide range of financial institutions, including finance companies, building societies and credit unions.

The Discussion Document on NBDTs noted that the current regulatory arrangements for NBDTs, while not fundamentally flawed, had several deficiencies including: inconsistency in regulatory requirements and supervision across different NBDTs, the absence of minimum entry requirements for NBDTs, and insufficient information to enable depositors to assess and compare the risks of depositing with NBDTs.

The Discussion Document proposed some substantive changes to the regulation of NBDTs to address these problems, while still seeking to keep regulatory costs low and preserving diversity and flexibility in the NBDT sector. The proposals included a requirement for all NBDTs to be licensed and to meet minimum prudential, governance and fit and proper requirements, both at licensing and on an ongoing basis. It proposed a new (elective) category of NBDT, supervised directly by the Reserve Bank and required to meet a higher level of standards, with other NBDTs continuing to be supervised by trustee corporations, but under enhancements to their trust deed requirements.

Submissions on the proposals expressed mixed views. There was widespread agreement on the identified deficiencies with existing arrangements and support for the proposed objectives for reforms. However, most submitters preferred to retain the existing trustee-based supervision arrangements, supplemented with some uniform minimum requirements, and were not supportive of a two-tiered structure. As a result, the changes proposed for NBDTs were revised to propose a one-tier regulatory framework, where all NBDTs are supervised by trustee corporations, under the (phase two) enhanced trust deed requirements for debt issuers. This is considered a more cost-effective means of achieving the desired regulatory objectives.

The decisions include:

- All NBDTs will be required to be licensed by a prudential regulator and to comply with minimum prudential, governance and fit and proper requirements at licensing and on an ongoing basis;
- NBDTs will continue to be supervised by trustee corporations under the (phase two) proposed enhancements to trustee-based supervision for debt issuers;
- NBDTs will be required to obtain and publicly disclose a credit rating (subject to a Cabinet report back on minimising costs), and to comply with enhanced public reporting requirements;
- The Reserve Bank will be the prudential regulator of NBDTs, with the Securities Commission continuing to have responsibility for market conduct supervision and supervision of trustee corporations.

**What is a Non-Bank Deposit-Taker (NBDT)?**  
An NBDT is a financial institution whose core business involves borrowing money from the public (mainly in the form of deposits or debentures, whether secured or unsecured) and the lending of money or provision of other financial services.

The definition of an NBDT does not include entities that provide financial services, including lending, but which fund solely from non-public sources (eg from wholesale markets, related parties and the like). It also excludes entities that issue debt securities to the public, but whose core business does not include, directly or indirectly, the provision of financial services or lending.  
NBDTs can take a number of different legal forms and include finance companies, building societies and credit unions.

**What will be the role of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand?**  
The Reserve Bank will become the single prudential regulator for New Zealand. This would widen the scope of the Reserve Bank’s prudential functions to include the prudential regulation of non-bank deposit takers (NBDTs) and the regulation and supervision of insurance companies (which is the subject of the Phase 2 report back to Cabinet by 30 November 2007).

**What is being proposed?**  
A one-tier regulatory framework is proposed, where all NBDTs continue to be supervised by trustee corporations under the enhanced trust deed requirements for debt issuers, and are subject to some additional requirements:

- All NBDTs will be required to be licensed by the Reserve Bank and will be subject to minimum prudential, governance and fit and proper requirements set and enforced by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the Securities Commission.
- NBDTs will be subject to enhanced public disclosure requirements under the Securities Act. Proposals on disclosure requirements will be taken to Cabinet under Phase 2 of the RFPP reforms, later this year.
- Subject to final Cabinet approval later this year, it is proposed that NBDTs will be required to obtain and disclose a credit rating from an approved rating agency.
- The Reserve Bank will be responsible for administering the credit ratings regime and will have the capacity to intervene in situations of NBDT distress or failure where the soundness of the financial system is at risk.
- The Securities Commission will authorise and supervise trustee corporations, and will set and enforce public disclosure requirements for NBDTs, in consultation with the Reserve Bank.

**Why are these reforms being proposed?**  
The Discussion Document on NBDTs, issued in September 2006, noted that the current regulatory arrangements for NBDTs, while not fundamentally flawed, are inadequate in several respects. The deficiencies highlighted included inconsistency in regulatory requirements and supervision across different NBDTs, the absence of minimum entry requirements for NBDTs, lack of governance requirements and insufficient information to enable depositors to assess and compare the risks of depositing with NBDTs.

The weaknesses in the current regulatory arrangements create a number of risks for depositors and for the soundness and efficiency of the financial system:

- The absence of a licensing requirement for NBDTs, including fit and proper requirements for directors and senior management, creates a risk that an NBDT could be owned and controlled by entities or persons who may not manage the NBDT in a manner consistent with the interests of depositors, exposing them to an excessive risk of loss.
- The absence of standardised minimum prudential requirements creates a risk of inadequate supervision of NBDTs.
- Existing disclosure arrangements do not provide a satisfactory basis to enable depositors to identify and compare risks of NBDTs. This impedes the ability of depositors to evaluate the trade-off between risk and return and may lead to depositors taking greater risks with their money than they would take were they aware of the risks.
- There is a potential for contagion within the NBDT sector, where the failure of some NBDTs could trigger wider-spread financial distress in the NBDT sector. The current regulatory arrangements do not adequately address this risk, given that existing disclosure arrangements and the lack of credit ratings do not enable depositors to readily distinguish between the risks of different NBDTs.

**Why should NBDTs be subject to a special form of regulation?**  
NBDTs have special features that warrant a form of regulation that goes beyond that required for other debt issuers. These features include the following:

- Many NBDTs perform bank-like functions, including providing on-call or short-term deposit facilities and the provision of payments services. These functions suggest that NBDTs should be regulated in a manner similar to that applicable to banks, while still facilitating continued diversity, flexibility and competitiveness in the NBDT sector.
- Unlike corporate bond and other debt issues, in which the funds are used to finance an issuer’s own business, NBDTs lend to many clients. This makes it difficult for depositors to ascertain the true risk of an NBDT and provides a justification for additional prudential and disclosure-based regulation.
- NBDTs are potentially vulnerable to contagion risk, whereby the distress or failure of some NBDTs could trigger acute distress or failure in others. This suggests the need for enhancements to the standard regulation of debt issuers, such as in respect of public disclosure requirements, ratings and distress management arrangements.

**What impact does this announcement have on the in-principle Cabinet decisions made relating to credit unions?**

The prudential regulatory regime for non-bank deposit takers will be designed so as to regulate and supervise all NBDTs in a similar manner – no matter the legal form. If credit unions are able to meet the prudential requirements for NBDTs, some of the protections offered through the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act become obsolete. Cabinet has therefore determined that the in-principle decisions regarding credit unions in respect of:

- having the same flexibility to borrow and invest surplus funds and the same ability to hold land as any other NBDT, and
- raising capital by issuing securities to their members.

will be confirmed, subject to their being able to comply with the NBDT requirements.  
Furthermore, the decisions in respect of granting credit unions

- legal status so that they can have limited liability, own property, have perpetual succession, sue and be sued;
- an ability to utilise a conversion mechanism to allow them to convert to a limited liability company (subject to limitations on reserves and use of the moniker “credit union” and
- explicit requirements regarding the members of the committee of management owing directors’ duties are also confirmed.

**What will happen to credit unions that are unable to meet the base level NBDT standards?**  
It is possible that some smaller credit unions may be unable to meet some of the proposed minimum standards for NBDTs (either individually or as a group) – especially in respect of credit ratings. An option that is proposed for these entities, subject to officials reporting back to Cabinet on all of the options that could be used to minimise the cost of credit ratings, would be to impose specific prudential restrictions on these smaller entities, some of which could be based on the current restrictions in place through the Act  
**What are the objectives of regulating NBDTs?**  
The proposed objectives for prudential regulation of the NBDT sector are to promote a sound and efficient financial system by:

- ensuring that NBDTs meet a transparent set of prudential requirements designed to promote sound governance and risk management in NBDTs and promote depositor confidence;
- providing depositors with a clearer basis for distinguishing between lower-risk and high-risk NBDTs; and
- resolving NBDT distress or failure in an orderly and timely manner, with minimum disruption to the financial system and depositors.

**What do the objectives not include?**  
The objectives do not include:

- promoting a uniform level of risk across the NBDT sector;
- promoting the same level of risk as for registered banks;
- preventing NBDT failures; or
- insulating depositors from loss in the event an NBDT fails.

**What will licensing and minimum regulation of NBDTs involve?**  
Minimum requirements would apply to all NBDTs at the time of licensing and on an ongoing basis. It is proposed that the licensing and other requirements will comprise:

- Fit and proper requirements for NBDT shareholders with control or significant influence, directors and senior management. These would be designed to ensure that NBDTs are controlled and managed by persons with appropriate capability and experience and do not have serious criminal records.
- A requirement that an NBDT must demonstrate the capacity to manage its affairs prudently, in line with the nature of business it proposes to undertake.
- A minimum dollar level of capital. The Discussion Document suggested a minimum of up to $2 million. The minimum amount of capital will be decided by Cabinet later this year.
- A requirement that every NBDT must include in its trust deed(s) a minimum capital ratio, determined by the trustee, and that the ratio must be measured on the basis set out in regulation by the prudential regulator.
- Either disclosure of, or a limit on, credit exposures to parties related to an NBDT, such as shareholders with control or significant influence, and directors. A decision on this will be made by Cabinet later this year.
- Minimum governance requirements, including a minimum board size and composition, and probably a minimum number of independent directors and a non-executive or independent chairman.

**Why require NBDTs to be licensed and also registered as financial service providers?**  
Registration with the Companies Office will be required for all financial service providers, including NBDTs. It is intended to be a mechanism for identifying the providers of financial services, determining which regulatory category they should be in, and ensuring that all owners (with control or significant influence), directors and senior management are subject to criminal and other “negative assurance” checks.

Registration is not an equivalent to licensing or authorising of a financial institution; it will not provide any kind of positive assurance assessment of fitness or involve the imposition of minimum regulatory or supervisory requirements. The licensing requirement for NBDTs will provide a basic check on fitness for purpose and fitness of owners, directors and senior management, and will involve minimum regulatory requirements.

There will be no duplication of function between financial service registration and licensing of NBDTs. Effective coordination arrangements will apply to ensure that the registration and licensing procedures are properly coordinated.

**What will be the functions of trustees under the new arrangements?**  
The trustees will continue to be the front-line supervisors for NBDTs, much as they are now. Their functions will include:

- establishing a trust deed for particular offers of securities, in agreement with the NBDT;
- prescribing the financial, reporting and other covenants in the trust deed;
- enforcing trust deed covenants and supervising and monitoring NBDTs; and
- taking remedial actions to respond to breaches of trust deed requirements or financial distress in an NBDT, including advising the Registrar of Companies of any material breaches of trust deed covenants or emerging financial difficulties.

Trustees will be subject to greater oversight by the Securities Commission under the new regulatory arrangements, and there will be a minimum set of requirements for the content of trust deeds.

**What will be the functions of the Reserve Bank?**

- licenses and (subject to appropriate checks and balances) de-licenses NBDTs, in consultation with the Securities Commission;
- prescribes and enforces compliance with the minimum regulatory prudential and governance regulatory requirements for NBDTs, in consultation with the Securities Commission;
- applies the fit and proper requirements to NBDTs’ owners (with control or significant influence), directors and senior managers;
- prescribes the credit rating requirements;
- provides advice and recommendations to the Securities Commission on the performance of trustee corporations in the discharge of their NBDT supervisory functions; and
- can intervene to manage the resolution of NBDT distress or failure in situations where the NBDT’s situation may pose a threat to the soundness of the financial system.

**Why will the Reserve Bank be the prudential regulator of NBDTs?**  
As the Reserve Bank is the prudential supervisor of banks, and will become the prudential supervisor of insurers, there are synergies and efficiencies in the Reserve Bank also becoming the prudential regulator of NBDTs. The Reserve Bank’s position as prudential regulator of NBDTs will also facilitate achieving some consistency in prudential regulation between banks and NBDTs, including in respect of capital adequacy measurement, fit and proper requirements, ratings and corporate governance.

**Will there be duplication of the functions of the Reserve Bank and trustees?**  
There will be no duplication of function between trustees and the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank’s responsibilities are largely limited to the licensing of NBDTs, setting and enforcing minimum standards across the NBDT sector, and administering the credit rating regime.

The Reserve Bank will not be the supervisor of NBDTs. It will not be involved in setting trust deed covenants or monitoring NBDTs on an individual basis. Nor will the Bank be involved in the handling of NBDT distress or failure other than in the rare situation when an NBDT’s circumstances may pose a risk to the soundness of the financial system. Rather, the trustees will have these functions – the trustees will be the sole supervisors of NBDTs.

**What will be the role of the Securities Commission?**  
As in the case of other aspects of trustee-based supervision (eg for debt issuers), it is proposed that the Securities Commission would retain responsibility for authorising and supervising trustee corporations. The Commission would also have responsibility for enforcing NBDT disclosure and advertising requirements under the Securities Act 1978, in consultation with the Reserve Bank.

**Will there be overlap or duplication in functions between the Reserve Bank and Securities Commission?**  
The functions of the Reserve Bank and Securities Commission are distinct and will not involve duplications of responsibility. The Reserve Bank’s role relates to prudential regulation setting, while the Securities Commission’s role relates to market conduct and disclosure. In order to ensure effective coordination between the Securities Commission and Reserve Bank, there will be effective information-sharing and coordination arrangements.

**Why is a mandatory credit rating being proposed?**  
The requirement to obtain and disclose a credit rating from a rating agency approved by the Reserve Bank would bring a number of important benefits, both to depositors and to the financial system as a whole.

Ratings provide a relatively simple summary of the risk of an NBDT defaulting on its financial obligations. A rating therefore reduces the need for investors to try to understand more complex and voluminous financial information on NBDTs. Ratings would provide the most cost-effective means of enabling depositors to distinguish between higher and lower risk NBDTs and thereby make better-informed investment decisions. This is particularly so if ratings are disclosed prominently in public offer documents and advertisements in ways that can be readily understood by non-expert investors, backed by greater initiatives to promote financial literacy among investors.

Ratings would also strengthen market disciplines on NBDTs and reduce the need for a more intrusive form of regulation and supervision, both in terms of a reduced need for prudential restrictions on NBDTs and less detailed financial public disclosure requirements. In turn, this would reduce the regulatory costs for the NBDT sector relative to the situation where there are no required ratings.

**Will ratings be understood by non-expert depositors?**  
Currently, there appears to be quite limited public understanding of credit ratings. However, as more NBDTs acquire ratings, and as public awareness of ratings grows, the understanding and use of ratings by ordinary depositors are likely to increase. To facilitate this, a number of initiatives can be taken, both to promote more effective disclosure of ratings and to enhance public understanding of ratings, including:

- clear, prominent and user-friendly disclosure of ratings;
- disclosure of comparisons between the rating scales of different rating agencies;
- promoting public understanding of credit ratings through explanatory information, public education initiatives and by encouraging the financial news media and other bodies to regularly highlight the importance of ratings and provide information on the ratings of NBDTs.  
  Government officials will be considering these and other options as part of the development of the new regulatory arrangements for NBDTs.

**Will ratings be costly for NBDTs?**  
Requiring NBDTs to obtain and disclose a rating will involve costs for NBDTs – both in terms of the direct cost of the rating and the indirect cost of management time, systems and controls. However, the costs of mandatory ratings are expected to be modest for most NBDTs relative to their revenue, assets and liabilities. The costs could be more significant for very small NBDTs.

In the case of NBDTs that can only achieve a low rating, a ratings requirement could increase their funding costs. This could lead to consolidation or rationalisation in the NBDT sector, depending on market reaction to ratings. However, this need not be a negative development; it may be a desirable outcome of better-informed investor decision-making and efficient markets.

There are various options available to reduce the costs of ratings for NBDTs, including the possibility of exemptions for small NBDTs, the application of ratings to groups of entities (eg groups of affiliated credit unions) rather than necessarily requiring ratings to be applied to all individual entities, and the possibility of reduced fees negotiated on a collective basis with the rating agencies. Government officials will explore these options and report back to Cabinet later this year on possible options for minimising the costs of ratings.

**When will the new arrangements come into force?**  
It is intended that legislation to give effect to the new arrangements will be introduced later this year and enacted if possible in 2008. It is proposed that the new regulatory requirements will not come into force until a later date – possibly 2010 – so that all relevant elements in the RFPP package can be brought into force as a cohesive package. It is likely that a transition period will apply after the commencement date to provide existing NBDTs with sufficient time to come into compliance with the new regulatory requirements.

**Will stakeholders be consulted on the details of regulatory requirements?**  
Yes. Stakeholders will be consulted in the development of the proposed regulatory requirements. Consultation with some key stakeholders will occur in the preparation of legislation. Once legislation has been introduced into Parliament, it will be subject to the standard select committee process, therefore enabling any parties to express views on the proposed requirements. Any regulations prepared pursuant to the legislation will be subject to the standard consultation process.

There has already been extensive consultation with stakeholders throughout the RFPP process. The consultation papers elicited a large number of helpful submissions and proposals for the regulation of the NBDT sector have been subject to a number of important changes in the light of these.

**TRUSTEE SUPERVISORY MODEL**

**Background:**  
Currently the Securities Act 1978 requires the issuers of debt securities and collective investment schemes offered to the public to engage the services of a trustee corporation for the purposes of frontline supervision of that issuer. The ‘Supervision of Issuers’ Discussion Document asked: whether trustees should continue as frontline supervisors of issuers of debt securities and collective investment schemes; whether trustees had the necessary powers to carry out this role; and whether there was sufficient transparency and accountability in relation to the supervisory function which is performed by trustees. Submissions on the Discussion Document presented strong support for retaining trustees as frontline supervisors.

The model retains trustees as ‘frontline’ supervisors of debt securities and collective investment schemes, but has an enhanced role for the Securities Commission, which will approve trustees and monitor them on an ongoing basis. The Securities Commission will have a graduated set of powers to deal with a trustee that appears to be in breach of its obligations.

**What is the Trustee Supervisory Model?**  
The Trustee Supervisory Model retains trustees as ‘frontline’ supervisors of debt securities and collective investment schemes, but with a new regulatory function for the Securities Commission, who will approve trustees and monitor them on an ongoing basis. Collective investment schemes (CIS) include participatory securities, unit trusts and superannuation schemes. Debt securities include non-bank deposit takers.

**What are the objectives of the Trustee Supervisory Model?**  
The model aims to

- provide a well founded basis for consumers to rely on financial promises being kept;
- encourage sound governance of institutions;
- deter, detect and minimise the risk of unfair or fraudulent conduct; and
- facilitate contestability, competitiveness and innovation.

**What will happen to the current automatic right of some statutory trustee corporations to act as trustees for CIS and debt issuers?**  
There are currently four statutorily approved trustees (Public Trust; Trustees Executors; Guardian Trust; and Perpetual Trust) with this automatic right. This automatic right will be removed. Anyone wishing to be approved to act as a trustee will have to satisfy the Securities Commission that they meet the approval criteria. It is expected that the current statutory trustee corporations should be able to meet any of the proposed criteria.

**What will be the Securities Commission’s role in the Trustee Supervisory Model?**  
The Commission’s key role will be to approve trustee licences; to monitor trustees’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their licence and to address any non-compliance. The Securities Commission will also:

- have discretion in the application of criteria, and may impose conditions and obligations on a particular trustee. This is because each class or classes of securities differ and require varied forms of capability and expertise. Approval will be subject to an appeals process on the basis of law and merit.
- monitor whether the trustee continues to meet the terms and conditions of its approval.
- be able to receive and act upon complaints which arise from the approval or monitoring of trustees under the trustee supervisory model, and to act on any information it receives, relating to a complaint.
- be provided with a graduated set of powers to deal with a trustee that appears to be in breach, ranging from requesting further information from a trustee to suspension to revoking some or all the trustee’s licences.

**What are the approval criteria to become licensed as a trustee?**  
Approval criteria will be flexible in order that they may be tailored to suit the trustees of various single issues of securities, or classes of securities issues.  
The Securities Commission will be able to approve trustees to act for a specific issue, for a general class of securities (i.e. debt, or CIS), or on an ‘all-securities’ basis, as appropriate.

Some approval criteria:

- meeting registration obligations with the Registrar of Financial Service Providers
- independence from issuers and related parties
- appropriate skills, qualifications and experience
- satisfaction of “fit and proper” character requirements
- adequate infrastructure and resources
- appropriate governance standards and procedures
- capital adequacy
- monitoring systems and procedures
- professional indemnity insurance provision
- corporate form to clarify legal and accounting separation of assets
- New Zealand residency

**What happens if the Securities Commission declines an application for approval to be a licensed trustee?**  
If the Securities Commission declines an application, it will be obliged to give the applicant its reasons for doing so. The applicants will be able to bring their case back to the Securities Commission for reconsideration. The Securities Commission will provide an opportunity for the applicant to be heard. Applicants who are still dissatisfied, as well as being able to seek judicial review of the decision, and will have a right of appeal to the High Court, on both law and merits.

**What are the penalties for acting as a trustee without a licence?**  
A person who acts as a trustee for any class or classes of securities issued to the public without a licence will commit an offence and be subject to penalties for that offence. The offence provisions will adopt a similar framework to those already contained in the Securities Act 1978.

**What reporting requirements are there by trustees to the Securities Commission?**  
There will be periodic (annual) reporting and event-based reporting requirements. These are designed so the trustee must demonstrate ongoing compliance with its licence.

**What happens if a trustee is suspended or removed and an issuer is unable to appoint a new trustee?**  
In those cases, the Securities Commission would appoint an ‘interim trustee’ until the issuer finds a new trustee. This statutory trustee could either continue to supervise the trust, or wind it up in accordance with the trust deed. This statutory trustee will have assured funding, and indemnification from liability for any actions or omissions of the removed trustee and will not be able to profit from the appointment.

**What information sharing provisions are there in the Trustee Supervisory Model?**  
Trustees currently have obligations to the Registrar of Companies under the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989, including giving notice of their concerns under section 11 in certain dire circumstances. Currently, trustees often consult with the Securities Commission prior to giving the Registrar such notice, and it is proposed that they retain this ability. Submitters supported this, but did not wish such consultation to be an obligation. It is however proposed that when a section 11 notice is given, the Registrar of Companies give a copy of this notice to the Securities Commission for the purposes of the Commission’s role as general overseer of trustees.

**Who has the power to make regulations prescribing fees and charges?**  
The Governor-General will have the power to make regulations prescribing fees and charges in connection with the application and approval procedure. There will be consultation on any fees. This power will be equivalent to the current s70A(2) of the Securities Act.

**What legislation is impacted by the Trustee Supervisory Model?**  
The changes will likely require amendments to the Securities Act 1978; the Securities Regulations 1983; the Unit Trusts Act 1960; The Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989; the Trustee Act 1956; The Trustee Companies Act 1967; and the Trustee Companies Management Act 1975.

**What confidentiality assurance is there for all data given to the Securities Commission?** All data given to the Securities Commission under the supervisory model will be considered to be given in confidence and kept private, except data that is aggregated with that of other trustees in order to provide an overview of the sector.

All data given in confidence will have protection from the Official Information Act 1982. However, the trustee will be able to agree with the Securities Commission to release a particular piece of information.

**INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PRUDENTIAL REGULATION**

**Background:**  
In December 2005, Cabinet agreed that prudential supervision for the financial sector be consolidated into a single regulator. Cabinet also agreed in principle that this regulator should be the Reserve Bank, subject to officials reporting back on detailed institutional arrangements for the prudential regulator. Cabinet took decisions in principle to allow time to assess in more detail what additional arrangements would be suitable for the Reserve Bank, given its expanded prudential role, and whether the risk of undermining the independence of its monetary policy activities was sufficiently manageable through governance and accountability arrangements. The Reserve Bank is to be the prudential regulator for non-bank deposit takers and insurers.

The changes will preserve the independence of the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy functions and support the extension of the Reserve Bank’s prudential regulation functions. The changes include modifications to:

- governance and accountability arrangements associated with the Reserve Bank’s financial sector regulation functions;
- policy responsibilities for prudential regulation;
- funding arrangements for prudential regulation functions;
- legislative arrangements for prudential regulation.

Policy responsibilities: the Reserve Bank will be responsible for the provision of policy advice on prudential regulation to the Minister of Finance. MED and Treasury will continue to provide advice to their respective Ministers on the implications of prudential regulation in their areas of responsibility. They will also provide second opinion advice in relation to the Reserve Bank’s policy role.

Funding arrangements: the costs to the Reserve Bank of regulating NBDTs and insurance companies are to be publicly funded. The Reserve Bank will received additional funding for these functions through a renegotiation of its Funding Agreement with the Minister of Finance.

Legislation amendments: A Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Bill is to be introduced to give effect to the governance and accountability arrangements outlined above. Changes to legislative will also be required to house the Reserve Bank’s new regulatory purposes and functions. Assessment is underway on which existing Acts should be amended and whether new Acts are required.

**Who will be regulated by the Reserve Bank?**  
As the prudential regulator for the financial sector, the Reserve Bank will regulate banks, non-bank deposit takers (such as finance companies, building societies and credit unions) and insurance companies.

**Will the prudential regulation of non-bank financial institutions and insurance companies affect the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy responsibilities?**  
There will be a clear legislative separation of the Bank’s monetary policy and its new financial sector functions.

**What changes are proposed to the Reserve Bank’s functions in light of the extension of prudential regulation responsibilities?**  
The proposed adjustments include:

- changes to some of its governance and accountability arrangements to enhance its transparency and responsiveness to Government while maintaining its regulatory independence;
- responsibility for providing lead policy advice to government on prudential regulation; and
- additional funding to carry out its new functions.

**What changes are proposed to the Reserve Bank’s governance and accountability arrangements?**  
Changes include:

- A Ministerial authority to comment on the Reserve Bank’s draft Statement of Intent and require it to demonstrate how it has taken these comments into account in the formulation of its objectives for the financial sector;
- A Ministerial authority to direct the Reserve Bank to have regard to a statement of Government policy objectives for the financial sector;
- An amendment to the Reserve Bank Act to reflect the increase in focus on prudential regulation, while recognising that monetary policy remains the Reserve Bank’s primary function;
- The Reserve Bank’s Statement of Intent (SOI) is to provide more ex ante information about the Bank’s intended actions and measures for judging performance;
- The Reserve Bank’s Annual Report to contain reporting against the enhanced SOI.
- The Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Report is to provide information on performance of prudential regulation regime and its implications for the financial sector and is to be provided to Parliament;
- The Reserve Bank is to increase transparency around its policy process by publishing assessment of net benefits of its policies; and
- The Reserve Bank Board and Treasury are to increase their monitoring of financial sector regulation.

**What changes are proposed to policy responsibilities for prudential regulation?**  
The Reserve Bank is to become responsible for providing lead policy advice on prudential regulation to the Minister of Finance. While the Ministry of Economic Development will no longer provide lead prudential policy advice on NBDTs and insurance companies, the Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development will continue to provide advice to their respective Ministers on the implications of prudential regulation for their areas of responsibility.

**How are the Reserve Bank’s new regulatory functions going to be funded?**  
Regulation of non-bank deposit takers and insurance companies is to be funded through a renegotiation of the Reserve Bank’s Funding Agreement with the Minister of Finance.

**What legislative changes are required to give effect to the changes to the Reserve Bank’s prudential regulation responsibilities?**  
Changes to governance and accountability arrangements are to be given effect to through a Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Bill. Decisions will be taken later in the year on which Acts will be amended and whether new Acts are needed to house the Reserve Bank’s new purposes and functions related to the regulation of non-bank deposit-takers, insurance companies and banks.
