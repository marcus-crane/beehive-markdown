The switch to a clean-burning wood pellet burner to heat Central New Brighton School is good news for the environment and will reinforce government messages to youth about the need for sustainability, Christchurch East MP Lianne Dalziel said today.

"New Zealand’s clean, green image is already part of our identity as a nation. Now we need to make sure that we're living sustainably in all areas of our lives – in our homes and in our communities. This kind of initiative in our schools is an excellent example of community action to look after our environment," Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel acknowledged the support of Nature’s Flame, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solid Energy, when she officially opened Central New Brighton School's converted boiler today. The school is one of the first in Canterbury to make the change.

Wood pellets are a renewable fuel, and therefore do not release any additional carbon dioxide emissions when burned. Their use results in improved air quality compared to coal or diesel, lowers electricity demand, eliminates landfill waste created by coal ash, and the running costs over time are lower.

Lianne Dalziel said that through its [Govt3](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/govt3/) programme, which helps central government agencies become more sustainable, government departments are collaborating to investigate the development of an environmental rating tool for New Zealand schools. The rating would be based on factors such as energy and water efficiency, waste minimisation, and indoor environment quality so that buildings could be certified as meeting performance standards in these areas.

"Once a school is rated it would raise awareness of potential improvements the school can make and of sustainability principles in general," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Sustainability is rapidly becoming a core value here and around the world.  
[Central New Brighton School](http://www.cnb.school.nz/) is showing community leadership in this move to the use of renewable fuel. New Zealand has the capability and the willingness to show global leadership in moving to becoming truly sustainable and carbon neutral," Lianne Dalziel said.
