"The Government is being proactive, in partnership with local government and organisations, in the face of serious and worsening drought conditions in the East Coast of the North Island, the worst in 125 years," Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton has said.

Jim Anderton spent Wednesday morning visiting Hawke's Bay to see for himself the difficulties farmers are having. "The government has already moved to get the rules relaxed for the IRD Adverse Events Equalisation Income Scheme. Drought-affected farmers will now have greater flexibility in their decision making and will not be discouraged from taking decisions in a timely fashion. The 30 day, ‘after balance date’ deadline for deposits to the scheme has been extended to 31 March 2008.

"I want to say that the farmers I met yesterday were resilient, determined and totally lacking in self-pity but they are facing some very difficult times. The strongest message I can give to the affected farmers is to act now. Sell stock, even capital stock," Jim Anderton said. "Talk to your financial and farm management advisors. They can help you make the hard decisions that need to be made to protect your businesses for the future."

The Hastings stock sale yesterday was oversubscribed, for the first time ever, and another will be held today. Meat processing companies are doing what they can by prioritising the processing of stock from drought-affected areas.

Rural Assistance payments are available from Work and Income New Zealand for farming families who need to get by. "Resources available," Jim Anderton said, "but people are not asking for help. Even the East Coast Rural Trust has had no calls for assistance. I understand, and admire, the pride in self-sufficiency that is a characteristic of rural people, but these are unusual times.

"If you see that your neighbours need help, urge them to get it. Social networks are really important in times like this and farmers and their families need to be looking out for one another," Jim Anderton said.

As well as going by helicopter to two local properties, he met with Federated Farmers representatives, Regional Councillors, trustees of the Hawke's Bay Primary Producers' Adverse Events Trust, as well as Lawrence Yule, Mayor of the Hastings District Council and local MP Rick Barker. At the meeting Mr Yule agreed to establish a Forum to co-ordinate efforts of all organisations working to help those badly affected.  
"We will keep monitoring the situation,” Jim Anderton said. “The Government is committed to funding a full-time co-ordinator for the East Coast Rural Support Trust, to supplying funds for other Rural Trusts, and for woolshed meetings where farmers can go for advice and information.”
