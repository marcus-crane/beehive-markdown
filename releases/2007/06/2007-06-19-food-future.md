The food industry is central to the New Zealand economy, and the forecast 27 per cent increase in the Fonterra pay out for the 2007/08 season is a great sign of things to come, says Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

"The golden age of agriculture is about to begin as signalled by Dr Andrew West of Agresearch, and the production of food is of enormous value to the future of New Zealand."

Steve Maharey today opened the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology annual conference in Wellington.

"Fonterra is a prime example of the success of our food industry. It's forecasting that farmers will be paid out $5.53 for the 2007/08 season, up 27 per cent on the current season. International demand for dairy products is completely outstripping supply, and this payout is the highest the company has ever forecast.

"Another example of the value of our food industry is kiwifruit exports, which earned $699 million in the year to June last year.

"Research and science can drive up the volume and value of our food industry even further. There is a huge amount of intellectual property and technology that goes into our food.

"In the future, innovation will lead to food products that can ease the symptoms of headaches or eventually diseases. Our overseas markets will pay more for our food if it's safer, healthier, tastier or more functional.

"The international market for food is growing and about to boom even further. The new ideas and innovations of our scientists will keep New Zealand food at the centre of that growth.

"It's important that our young people train and get involved in the agriculture and food industries, as they will reap huge benefits in the future."
