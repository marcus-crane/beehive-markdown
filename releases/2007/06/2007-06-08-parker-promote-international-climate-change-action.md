Building international consensus for climate change action and promoting New Zealand's interests around agriculture will be priorities for Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues, David Parker, as he attends next week's high-level climate change pre-Bali negotiations in Sweden.

This is the first time New Zealand has been invited to this forum to be held in Riksgränsen. High-level representatives from China, the U.S, Brazil, several EU member states, Japan, South Africa and Indonesia will also attend.

“There are differing views on the way forward. My aim is to promote a consensus for broad based action from 2012. I'll also be looking out for New Zealand's interests, particularly around agriculture. Reducing agricultural emissions is challenging and New Zealand is playing a constructive and leading role in this.

“The more countries that agree to a post-2012 regime the more effective emissions reductions efforts become, and the less competitiveness will be put at risk," said David Parker.

New Zealand’s invitation reflects its valued contribution in the international community on climate change and recognises the Government's sustained efforts and support for international action in the core United Nations fora and beyond, including APEC, the Commission on Sustainable Development , and the UN Security Council.

"It’s an extremely good opportunity to work with key players in a relatively informal setting. As we move towards a post 2012 regime, there is a lot at stake internationally and for New Zealand. I want to promote the best deal for cutting emissions.

“New Zealand also needs to continue to help vulnerable Pacific countries which have much to lose if we fail to get an effective climate change regime in place.

“I am greatly heartened by recent statements by world leaders, and welcome the fact that increasing numbers of them are embracing the need for concerted, multilateral action. The G8 Summit in Heiligendamm this week shows that momentum is building, which I hope we can capitalise on in Sweden next week,” David Parker said.
