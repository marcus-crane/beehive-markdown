Thirteen new coroners have been appointed under the new Coroners Act 2006, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today. The new coroners join Chief Coroner Judge Neil MacLean appointed in December last year.

The appointees (and where they will be based) are:

- Brandt Shortland (Whangarei)
- Katharine Greig (Auckland)
- Murray Jamieson (Auckland)
- Peter Ryan (Hamilton)
- Gordon Matenga (Hamilton)
- Wallace Bain (Rotorua)
- Christopher Devonport (Hastings)
- Carla na Nagara (Palmerston North)
- Tim Scott (Palmerston North)
- Ian Smith (Wellington)
- Richard McElrea (Christchurch)
- Sue Johnson (Christchurch)
- David Crerar (Dunedin)

A third coroner to be based in Auckland will be appointed at a later date.

The Coroners Act 2006 repeals and replaces the Coroners Act 1988. It established the office of Chief Coroner to be supported by a body of up to 20 legally qualified full-time coroners. The 14 coroners will replace the current 55 part-time coroners.

"The new Act introduces significant reforms designed to enhance public confidence in the integrity and independence of the coronial system," said Dr Cullen. "It also recognises the need to address the distinct spiritual and cultural needs of Maori and other ethnic or religious groups as far as possible, in keeping with the purpose and function of the coronial regime."

The new coroners will be sworn in over the next fortnight and will take office when the new coronial system comes into force on 1 July. Existing coroners will continue in office until they have completed any outstanding work.
