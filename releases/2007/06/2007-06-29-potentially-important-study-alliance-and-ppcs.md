Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today noted with interest the announcement that two of New Zealand’s largest meat processing companies, PPCS and Alliance, had engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake an appraisal of the two companies’ operations and “evaluate potential options to improve livestock returns paid to the farmer suppliers of each company”.

Jim Anderton said this was “potentially a very important development, given that the two companies together represent $3.1 billion in turnover and process significant volumes of New Zealand’s livestock.

“New Zealand meat is a great product, and I believe that the industry has a great future,” he said. “But to achieve its potential, it needs to invest in greater research and product development, and invest in getting more out of market opportunities.

“It is good to see that the companies’ Boards, management and shareholders are taking the lead to address these issues.

He noted that neither Alliance nor PPCS would be making any further statements until the appraisal and review had been completed. “This sounds like a sensible approach to me,” Jim Anderton said. “And there would certainly be no advantage in me speculating on the outcome.”

“The Government will be taking a close interest in developments, given the importance of the meat industry to New Zealand’s economy and the size of the two companies.”
