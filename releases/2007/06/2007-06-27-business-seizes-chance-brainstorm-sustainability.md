The realities and exciting opportunities around trading in a sustainable New Zealand were on the agenda as the Government engaged with business and industry today, said Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

The second of three sustainable business workshops, led by the Ministry for the Environment and Ministry of Economic Development, was held in Wellington today.

"The responsibility for developing a more sustainable nation must be shared by everyone. I’m pleased to see so many companies have realised the importance of sustainability and want to work with government to achieve a strong economy," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"The Labour-led government’s commitment to sustainability was demonstrated in the six initiatives announced in Budget 2007. They included additional funding over three years for business partnerships for sustainability. Some of the $7.4 million over four years for sustainable government procurement and improved eco-verification will also support sustainable New Zealand businesses.

"The business partnerships initiative will help government and business to jointly tackle some of the emerging opportunities and risks around market development and market access for New Zealand businesses, especially in key sectors such as tourism and the food and beverage sector.

"Smart and innovative business people will seize the market opportunities inherent in becoming a sustainable operator.

"As we refine our sustainable business programme, the Labour-led government wants to listen to the views of people from within the sector. We need to know how we can go forward as partners towards sustainability," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The final workshop is in Christchurch on 13 July. Up to 70 business representatives are expected at each event.
