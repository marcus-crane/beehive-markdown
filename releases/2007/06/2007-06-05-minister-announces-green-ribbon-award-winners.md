Environment Minister David Benson-Pope, today announced the winners of this year's Green Ribbon Awards.

“The list of outstanding nominations demonstrates just how committed New Zealanders are to environmental sustainability,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

The announcement of the Green Ribbon Award winners coincides with United Nations World Environment Day and shares a common goal to raise environmental awareness.

From 69 nominations, eight winners have been selected.

The honours for 2007 include:

- A Waikato farming family’s success in restoring the plant life, wildlife and water quality of neighbouring peat lakes.
- A council and community effort in Invercargill to transform a former landfill into a picturesque estuary and park.
- Enthusiastic Auckland trio Ashley, Courtney and Brooke Varneys’ commitment to a vast array of environmental projects.

2007 marks the 17th year the Awards have taken place. During this time 89 environmental champions have been recognised.

This year’s Awards were presented by the Minister for the Environment in a ceremony at the Grand Hall at Parliament this evening.
