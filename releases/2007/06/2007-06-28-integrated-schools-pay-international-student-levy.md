State integrated primary and secondary schools will be levied for costs associated with their international students from next year, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The levy of $900 per international student, the same rate state schools pay, will apply from January 1, 2008.

The levy is designed to recover costs associated with the quality assurance of schools’ education and language services for international students.

Dr Cullen said the levy was introduced to help manage the cost of enrolling international students with state integrated schools. International enrolments at state integrated schools have jumped six per cent in the year to March 2007.

“With the growth in international enrolments at state integrated schools it is appropriate that something be done to manage the associated increase in costs,” Dr Cullen said.

“By applying the international student levy to both state and state integrated schools, the government has ensured there is greater equity in the way costs associated with international students are recovered.”

Costs associated with international enrolments include Education Review Office quality assurance of education programmes and pastoral care, English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) support and the cost of recruiting and training additional teachers.

As proprietors of state integrated schools fund their own buildings and maintenance, they will recoup part of the international student levy to help meet building and maintenance costs associated with international enrolments.
