“National's Hollow Men campaign on forestry should be exposed for the sham that it is,” Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

"The National party is using newspaper columns, such as one today from Simon Power in the Wanganui Chronicle, to spread a grossly distorted picture around forestry and carbon credits.

"National is once again being driven by the distortion and spin of the same shadowy figures behind the Hollow Men, such as National Party strategist Matthew Hooten, who moonlights as public relations advisor to the Kyoto Forestry Association.

"All the lines are the same and the timing smacks of more than coincidence. The media and all New Zealanders should be aware of this continuation of National's tactics to play fast and loose with the truth.

"National should come clean. How much is Hooten being paid by the forestry lobby? What talks has he had with National? How come National is using the same lines as the foresters at the same time? What influence does Hooten and his vested interests have over National's forestry polices?

"I'm very interested in the answers to these questions and to seeing how closely National policy develops along the lines of the demands of Hooten's clients,” Jim Anderton said.

What's really happening in forestry?

“National claims massive deforestation when the facts clearly show that there is more land in forestry now than there was in 1999 − 69,000 hectares more. The national forestry estate now stands at 1.8 million hectares compared to 1.73 in 1999.

“National also claims that foresters can't get credits for the trees they plant. This is simply not true. Those foresters that establish new permanent forest sinks qualify for credits under the Permanent Forest Sinks Initiative.

“Furthermore, the Government has recently consulted on incentives to encourage planting of commercial forests, including devolving all credits and liabilities to foresters and an Afforestation Grants Scheme. This is in addition to $10m in the Budget to promote tree planting on erosion prone hill country.

“While the Government has been grappling with the complexities of climate change since 1999, the National Party has been using this serious global issue as a political football. When the Government proposed the agricultural sector, which is responsible for half of New Zealand emissions, make a modest contribution to emission reduction research, the National Party cheered while one of its MPs drove a tractor up the steps of Parliament. Would they still do this now? National’s lack of credibility on this issue speaks for itself.”
