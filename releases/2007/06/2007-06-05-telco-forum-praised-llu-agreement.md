Today's announcement by the [Telecommunications Carriers' Forum](http://tcf.org.nz/outputs/release.php?i=24) that it has made unanimous progress on aspects of local loop unbundling and co-location is good news, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"I want to congratulate the Telecommunications Carriers' Forum, which has made progress recently on a number of issues of benefit to the whole industry and the public including number portability and now LLU and co-location."

The minister noted that the role of the TCF working group on LLU was to seek agreement on a range of non-price terms that would assist the work of the Commerce Commission in its full standard terms determination.

"While it is for the commission to now assess in detail the merits of the agreement reached by the TCF, I do wish to recognise today's announcement as a tangible further sign of forward momentum within the industry.

"It is further evidence that, with an appropriate regulatory framework in the background, the incentives are now right to move the industry rapidly forward in the interests of all New Zealanders.

"I want to congratulate independent TCF chair Malcolm Alexander and all those who have worked on the LLU working groups. I look forward to further advice from the commission in due course on the details."
