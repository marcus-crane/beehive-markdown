Foreign Minister Winston Peters today acknowledged the Fiji interim administration’s agreement in principle that elections could be held in the first quarter of 2009.

The administration has also accepted in principle the assessment report of the independent Pacific Islands Forum/Fiji Joint Working Group, which was established to recommend a timetable for elections.

“This is a further step on the path back to democratic government in Fiji following the lifting of emergency regulations on 31 May,” Mr Peters said.

“It is, however, an 'in principle' acceptance only, and there is a long way to go before elections can actually be held.

"We shall be watching closely the implementation of the report by Fiji's interim administration, as well as the practical measures they need to take to prepare for elections. These include a redistribution of boundaries following a census in September; an updating of voter registration, and a voter education programme.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Fiji was seriously set back last week by the unexplained and unjustifiable expulsion of our High Commissioner. That action was hardly consistent with a regime that is looking for a return to democratic government.

“We have nonetheless made it clear that we are committed to the pathway set out by the Pacific Islands Forum for a return to democracy in Fiji, and that we shall continue to play an active role in the Joint Working Group," Mr Peters said.
