Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed support for a meaningful debate on how best to deal with the problems facing our export sector.

"It is heartening that groups as diverse as Export New Zealand and the Salvation Army have today joined the Canterbury Manufacturers' Association in calling for open and honest debate about these critical economic issues," said Dr Cullen.

"This is fundamentally about how best to ensure our productive sector can remain viable and competitive and how thousands of New Zealanders can continue to keep their home ownership dreams alive.

"Bill English should remember that next time he attempts to scuttle efforts to find additional tools to supplement monetary policy."
