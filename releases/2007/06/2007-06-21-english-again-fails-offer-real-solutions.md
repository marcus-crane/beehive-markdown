Bill English needs to front up and suggest real solutions to issues confronting exporters rather than knocking down every idea that is floated, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"Mr English's negative approach is not what exporters need right now as they struggle with the high dollar," said Dr Cullen. "His attacks this week typify his attitude.

"He stayed silent during talks in my office last year over additional instruments to supplement the Official Cash Rate and then he shot down the mortgage levy idea.

"He torpedoed the chance of cross-party talks continuing and he opposes the select committee inquiry.

"Bill English is turning a blind eye to the problems of exporters. There is a real debate to be had here over how best to relieve pressure on our productive sector.

"All I have heard from Mr English is that he thinks interest rates should have been higher earlier and government spending should be slashed. He is not prepared to engage in discussion of other options, even those proposed by the Treasury and Reserve Bank in last year's Supplementary Stabilisation Instruments report.

"I agree with the Canterbury Manufacturers' Association that we need to have a meaningful debate. John Walley said earlier this week; 'although the discussions surrounding any new taxes and tools that directly address domestic inflation may be politically contentious, that does not make them wrong or something to be ignored.'

"There are no easy solutions, no silver bullet, but we need to act and the Labour-led government is not afraid of having this debate.

"It is time Mr English stopped playing petty politics and exhibited some of the maturity required of his position as Opposition finance spokesperson," Dr Cullen concluded.
