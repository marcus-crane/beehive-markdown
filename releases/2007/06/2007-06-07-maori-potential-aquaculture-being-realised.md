In support of the launch of Aquaculture New Zealand today, the Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia, announced an investment strategy that ensures a Maori Relationship Manager will work within the aquaculture industry for the next three years.

"Maori are significant players in the New Zealand aquaculture industry," Mr Horomia said. "The Maori Relationship Manager will strengthen their involvement and this will benefit both Maori communities and the wider industry."

Maori will play a key role in the future development of this industry he says and this is reflected in the investment Te Puni Kokiri is making to assist iwi in realising the full potential of aquaculture in their regions.

"The Government takes very seriously its commitments in the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. Providing funding for the new industry body to employ a Maori Relationship Manager is one initiative. Te Puni Kokiri, in partnership with NIWA (the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere Research) is also holding a series of nationwide hui to provide Maori with information about aquaculture and the planning processes around this industry."

The Minister says strengthening Maori success in aquaculture requires a focus on various critical factors including: ensuring new aquaculture developments are based on sound business propositions; access to industry and commercial expertise is assured; Maori have the knowledge and human resources to actively participate in the planning processes; an emphasis on iwi working together to maximise the benefits of the settlement assets and the environmental concerns being balanced with commercial aspirations.

"The government will work with Maori to ensure active participation at all levels of the industry," the Minister says. "My concern and that of my Ministry is to ensure that adequate resources are developed that take into account all those factors that will impact on the commercial realities and kaitiaki aspirations for Maori."

"Aquaculture has the potential to assist economic development at both regional and national levels, benefiting Maori communities directly as well as the wider growth and prosperity of the industry," the Minister says. "Maori offer a unique set of skills and experiences that can add value to export products and businesses. The Maori relationship manager role within Aquaculture New Zealand will work to ensure that Maori continue to have a key, and growing, role in this very significant industry".
