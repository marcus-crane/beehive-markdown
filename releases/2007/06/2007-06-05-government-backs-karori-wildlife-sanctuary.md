The future of a unique wildlife sanctuary in the heart of Wellington is being put on a more sustainable footing with a major investment by the Labour-led Government, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark today visited the [Karori Reservoir Wildlife Sanctuary](http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/index.html) to announce that the Labour-led Government will invest up to $6.5 million, to assist in the construction and fit-out of an all-weather Visitor and Education Centre at the sanctuary. The funding will come from the contestable [Significant Community Based Projects Fund](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Community-Funding-Significant-Community-Based-Projects-Fund?OpenDocument).

"The Visitor and Education Centre will include displays, exhibits and in-Sanctuary facilities, and aims to provide visitors with a world-class, interactive experience in wildlife conservation, Helen Clark said.

"The Karori Sanctuary is a visionary project which has captured the imagination of Wellingtonians and all who visit. This government investment will enable it to greatly enhance the conservation and education experience for all visitors.

“It offers benefits at a national level for domestic and international visitors, with the potential for it to become one of the most highly visited conservation interpretation sites in New Zealand, given its central location in our capital city.

“I congratulate the Sanctuary's Trust on its enormous efforts over the last twelve months to ensure that, this year, the criteria for funding from the Significant Community Based Projects Fund could be fulfilled and that forecasts for the future sustainability of the Sanctuary are positive,” Helen Clark said.

The $32 million Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up by the Labour-led Government in 2005 to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

Helen Clark said further announcements about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year would be made shortly.

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said that as a result of the high calibre applications received, the fund will be completely allocated this year.

"While no further funding round has been planned at this time, the high level of community interest in the fund has led Cabinet to ask me to report back on the level of demand for projects that would have been eligible to apply had the fund continued,” Rick Barker said.

“The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up at a time of falling lottery profits when less funding was available to support capital projects. The recent increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits has resulted in higher levels of funding being available for allocation and has allowed the re-establishment of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

“The Lottery Community Facilities Fund is able to support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. Organisations considering applying should contact [GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz](mailto:GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz?subject=Lottery) or phone 0800 824 824,” Rick Barker said.
