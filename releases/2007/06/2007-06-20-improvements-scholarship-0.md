The final phase of improvements to New Zealand Scholarship examinations has been announced today by Education Minister, Steve Maharey and Associate Education Minister, Parekura Horomia.

"This marks the completion of the final three out of 26 recommendations arising from a 2005 review by the Scholarship Reference Group", says Steve Maharey.

"The improvements will further strengthen scholarship as the national system to recognise and acknowledge New Zealand’s top scholars, and provide them with a monetary reward."

"The first change is that from 2008, Te Reo Rangatira will be introduced as a scholarship subject. Te Reo Mâori will remain as a separate scholarship examination subject", says Parekura Horomia.

"Te Reo Mâori is the study of Mâori language, and Te Reo Rangatira is a much broader subject, with a wide cultural and philosophical framework within which learning takes place. "

The second change is that students can receive a monetary award for all languages, including their first or native language. For example, up to now a native French speaker could not get a monetary award in French because it was his or her first language. This will no longer be the case.

Steve Maharey says the decision to make both first and second language speakers eligible for Scholarship monetary awards in those languages is a matter of fairness, "This creates a level playing field for all students, regardless of their first language."

The third and final recommendation of the Scholarship Reference Group was a proposal to introduce requisites, or conditions, to decide who can sit Scholarship.

"It has been decided that conditions are not necessary. Scholarship is designed to identify the top achievers at secondary school level and the structure of the system eliminates the need for requisites to be introduced."

In 2005, the Scholarship Reference Group made 26 recommendations for improving scholarship. Today's announcement means that all recommendations have now been addressed.

Kua Whakamarau Hiranga Te Reo Rangatira

Kua pânuitia e te Minita mô te Mâtauranga, a Steve Maharey, me te Minita Tuarua mô te Mâtauranga, a Parekura Horomia, te wâhanga mutunga o ngâ mahi whakatika i ngâ Whakamâtautau Hiranga o Aotearoa.

“Koia nei te whakaotinga o ngâ taunakitanga whakamutunga e toru, o ngâ taunakitanga 26 katoa, i puta mai i te arotakenga, i te tau 2005, a te Rôpû Tohutoro Hiranga, i kî a Maharey.

Ko çnei mahi whakatika ka whakapakari ake i te tahua ngore hei pûnaha â-motu ka whakamôhio, ka tautoko i ngâ ngore teitei o Aotearoa, me te whakawhiwhi utu mô râtou.

I kî a Horomia, ko te whakarerekçtanga tuatahi, atu i te tau 2008, ka tîmatatia Te Reo Rangatira hei marau hiranga. Ka noho tonu Te Reo Mâori hei marau whakamâtautau hiranga wehe.

“He whai mâtauranga reo Mâori te marau o Te Reo Mâori, â, ko Te Reo Rangatira he marau whânui ake, me tçtahi pou tarâwaho tikanga, taumauri, kei roto nei ngâ whâinga akoranga.”

Te nuinga o ngâ tauira kei ngâ kura whakarîroa, ka whai mâtauranga ki Te Reo Mâori, engari ngâ tauira kei ngâ wharekura me çtahi ake kaupapa ako rûmaki, ka whai kç i Te Reo Rangatira, e kî ana a Horomia.

“Mâ tçnei whakarerekçtanga ka haere tonu ngâ ahunga whakamua kia pûmau ka wâtea tonu ngâ huarahi ôrite atu ki te hiranga taha mâtauranga, mô ngâ tauira e whai matauranga ana ki ngâ momo âhuatanga rerekç o te ao Mâori.”

Ko te whakarerekçtanga tuarua, ka âhei ngâ tauira ki te whiwhi i tçtahi tohu moni mô ngâ reo katoa, tâpiri atu ki tâ râtou reo tuatahi, reo tangata whenua rânei. Hei tauira, atu

ki tçnei wâ, e kore te kaikôrero reo tangata whenua Wiwi e whiwhi i te tohu moni, i te mea koia nei tôna reo tuatahi. Kua mutu tçnei âhuatanga inâianei, e kî ana a Maharey

Ko te taunakitanga tuatoru, whakamutunga, a te Rôpû Tohutoro Hiranga, ko te whakaaro ki te whakauru i \`etahi taumaunga me ngâ tikanga here hei whakatau ko wai ka âhei ki ngâ whakamâtautau hiranga.
