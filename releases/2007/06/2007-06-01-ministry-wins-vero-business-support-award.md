Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope today congratulated the Ministry of Social Development on last night winning a Vero Excellence in Business Support award.

The Ministry won the award for the 'Most significant contribution by a government department', recognising Work and Income's Industry Partnerships.

Industry Partnerships, through programmes such as Straight 2 Work, seek to address skill and labour shortages and maximise job opportunities. This is done by supporting clients to gain employment skills or training tailored specifically to industry sector requirements.

The aim of the Industry Partnerships and programmes such as Straight 2 Work is to provide employers with employees that are specifically trained to their entry level requirements and to enable Work and Income clients to access and keep employment that becomes sustainable.

"I congratulate the Ministry on this fantastic achievement. We should all applaud Work and Income frontline staff for maximising job opportunities for their clients.

"Their great work has already contributed to historic lows in youth unemployment and the number of working age people receiving the Unemployment Benefit.

"The past seven years have seen huge inroads into reducing benefit dependency. More than 135,000 people have come off benefits since December 1999.

"Work and Income frontline staff play a big part in supporting New Zealanders into work through such programmes as Straight 2 Work and will continue to do so with the roll out of the Working New Zealand: Work Focused Support package.

"I personally want to thank all Work and Income staff. This award is testament to their dedication and continued hard work," said Mr Benson-Pope.
