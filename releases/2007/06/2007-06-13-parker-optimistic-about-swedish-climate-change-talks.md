Climate change Minister David Parker says it's an honour and a privilege for New Zealand to be involved in high level international talks on climate change in Sweden's far north.

David Parker is representing New Zealand at the discussions at Riksgraensen, 100 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.

The talks are aimed at making progress on global agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after 2012, when the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends.

"The fact that New Zealand has been invited to join 28 other nations at these important talks is testament to our country's reputation as a respected and influential player in climate change negotiations," David Parker said.

Those countries attending include China, India, USA, and Indonesia, as well as the European, African and South American nations.

"We've forged relationships in previous meetings, like New York in May this year, and the Prime Minister has enhanced our credibility with her insistence that climate change be put on the agenda at high level discussions such as APEC. This kind of relationship-building is paying off."

The Swedish talks are being held at a time when the sun does not set for several weeks during summer, at this far northern town.

"Perhaps this is a good metaphor for post-2012 talks," David Parker said. "For climate change policy to work to avoid dangerous temperature increases, the sun cannot set on the nations that will need to contribute. We need these new commitments to be truly global.

"The discussions we have over the coming days will feed into the more formal United Nations talks to be held in Bali in December. I'm looking forward to some robust and frank discussions, but also to interacting in a meaningful way to move us all forward towards some kind of useful consensus."

The Midnight Sun talks began on Monday and conclude on Thursday.
