The drop in smoking rates for teenagers over the past eight years is very pleasing and a strong vindication of the priority the Labour-led Government places on tobacco control, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

Mr O'Connor was commenting on figures in a report released today which puts the number of Year 10 smokers at 14.2 per cent, down from 28.6 per cent in 1999.

"For the first time, more than half of Year 10 (aged 14-15 years) students have never smoked. One of our health sector targets is to push this figure higher and with the continued support of some very committed individuals and organisations we will continue to focus effort and resources on achieving this aim.

"This year's budget contained an additional $43.6 million for tobacco control, including $8 million over four years to support renewed efforts aimed at further reducing the number of teens taking up smoking."

Mr O'Connor said he is particularly pleased that no group is being left behind – Year 10 smoking rates are dropping among both boys and girls, as well as for Maori, Pacific and European teens.

The investment in this year's budget is the latest step taken by the Labour-led Government to reduce the number of smokers in New Zealand and the around 5000 smoking-related deaths every year, Mr O'Connor said.

Outlawing smoking in workplaces, including bars and restaurants, has proven to be successful in helping people break the habit. The introduction of graphic images on cigarette packets early next year is also expected to be effective, particularly in stopping young people taking up smoking in the first place, Mr O'Connor said.

The National Year 10 Smoking Survey is conducted annually by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) New Zealand, and the Health Sponsorship Council. More than 30,000 teenagers took part in the survey.
