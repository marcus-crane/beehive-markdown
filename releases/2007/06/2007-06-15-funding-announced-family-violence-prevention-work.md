Thirty-three community projects throughout New Zealand are being funded as part of a national campaign to prevent family violence.

Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope today released the list of successful applicants of the first round of the [Community Action Fund](http://www.facs.govt.nz/our-work/preventing-violence/community-action.html).

The Community Action Fund was launched in December and is a key part of the campaign to prevent family violence by supporting community initiatives. The campaign will also include mass media, the development of resources to tackle family violence and partnerships with the corporate, government and NGO sectors.

"Family violence is a complex and entrenched issue. It damages families, children and communities and prevention requires a nationwide commitment. The funding from the Community Action Fund gives communities the resources to develop their own projects to support change at a local level.

"The projects reflect the commitment, and the knowledge, skills and creativity of communities," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The next funding round opens on Monday and closes on 31 July 2007. Further rounds will be held over the next four years.

Application forms and further information are available on the [Family and Community Services website](http://www.facs.govt.nz)
