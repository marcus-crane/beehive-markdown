“Tariana Turia should be supporting efforts to strengthen Maori participation in aquaculture, instead of spreading gloom and scepticism,” Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“Mrs Turia said on radio that I was blaming Maori for the lack of progress. What I actually said was that the government is committed to a partnership with the aquaculture industry, local government, Maori and everyone with a stake in the sector to help the industry achieve its goal of being a $1 billion dollar business by 2025.

“If she took the trouble to read my speech at the launch of the Labour-Progressive government’s ‘Our Blue Horizon’ document and Aquaculture New Zealand, she would see that there is much that is practical that is being done to strengthen Maori participation and that I welcome it.

“Te Puni Kokiri is currently investigating initiatives that include a Maori development work programme to build stronger relationships between industry and Maori. Funding has been approved for $190,000 each year for the next three years. A road show with local Maori communities is also going to head to ten areas to talk about opportunities and the commercial aquaculture settlement. And Aquaculture New Zealand has appointed a Maori economic development manager. All of which comes on top of $3m invested by the Government in aquaculture development generally.

“What is it about all of that that Mrs Turia doesn’t understand?” Jim Anderton said.
