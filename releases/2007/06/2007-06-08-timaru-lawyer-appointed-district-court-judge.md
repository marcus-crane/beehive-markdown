Timaru lawyer Jocelyn Munro has been appointed a District Court Judge with a Family Court warrant, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today.

Ms Munro was admitted in 1991. A former teacher, Ms Munro joined Petrie Mayman Clark in Timaru as a staff solicitor in 1992. She has been a partner of the firm since 1994.

Her practice since admission has been primarily in litigation, with a primary focus on family law (more than half her current practice), criminal and employment law. She has also appeared in the Youth Court. Other experience includes conveyancing, estate planning and trusts.

In 2005 she was appointed as Regional Representative of the Family Law Section and has served for two years as the South Canterbury Representative on the Canterbury District Law Society Council. She has acted as honorary solicitor for the South Canterbury Justices of the Peace Association and served on the Board of South Canterbury Chamber of Commerce.

Ms Munro will be sworn in on 11 July and will sit in Rotorua.
