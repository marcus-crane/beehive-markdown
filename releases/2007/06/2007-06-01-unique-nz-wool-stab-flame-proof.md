The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, is visiting AgResearch in Christchurch today to see innovative new wool fabrics developed by the Crown Research Institute (CRI).

"These new fabrics are the result of groundbreaking advances in research at the CRI, and such projects include investment by the Labour-led government to create world-leading new technology."

The new products include:

·A 'Smart singlet' - knitted from fibres that can transmit an alarm signal (from a electrical circuit in the garment) if the wearer is shot or incapacitated. It could be used by ballistic experts and discussions are underway about how it could be used by the Navy.  
·Stab and flame proof vest – a wool vest that cannot be punctured by a sharp object and is flame proof. It's been developed for possible use to protect prison officers from attacks.  
·Woollen Business Shirt – made from a new lightweight, pure wool fabric that's machine washable and shrink resistant.

“It is great to see the talent and expertise within New Zealand research organisations delivering such high quality technology, and adding huge value to our primary industries. Such products could be marketed and sold in New Zealand and overseas."

During the visit to AgResearch, Steve Maharey also announced details of the government's commitments from Budget 2007 for primary sector research:

·$12 million over four years to support the Pastoral 21 Group, on top of $15.6 million* committed in Budget 2006  
·$8 million* a year for research into primary sector productivity  
·$14 million* a year for innovative foods and biological products  
·$8 million* for climate change research and $16 million* invested in the Crown Research Institute capability fund are other budget initiatives with strong primary sector links.

“These new initiatives are on top of the annual investment of around $115m that the Government makes in research science and technology to support the primary sector, as part of the drive to transform the New Zealand economy."
