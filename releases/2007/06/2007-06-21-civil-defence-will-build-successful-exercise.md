The final report on civil defence exercise Capital Quake indicates how far the sector has come over the past five years and the directions it is now taking to increase its ability to respond to a major emergency, says Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker.

The exercise, held over 14 and 15 November 2006, was the largest civil defence exercise ever held in New Zealand, directly involving more than 1000 people from 50 organisations. The exercise was based on the response to a magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Wellington fault causing massive destruction and disruption across central New Zealand.

Rick Barker released the report on the exercise today.

“Capital Quake successfully achieved its stated aim and objectives of testing an all-of-nation response to a major earthquake in Wellington,” said Rick Barker.

“This Labour-led Government has significantly transformed the civil defence sector since 2002 through the Civil Defence Act, the National Plan and Guide, regional group plans, increased investment in the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management and in preparing the public to ‘Get Ready Get Thru’.

“At the same time, local government has been doing outstanding work in regional preparedness for a ‘big one’. Capital Quake was the first opportunity to exercise a co-ordinated response to a major emergency, involving Government agencies, emergency services, NGOs and private companies and international arrangements.

“The exercise was, first and foremost, a learning activity and I am pleased that it has identified a range of areas that will be further developed in cooperation with local government. The Government had requested two all-of-nation exercises and the second, beginning in Auckland in November, offers the perfect opportunity to build on the success of Capital Quake,” said Rick Barker.
