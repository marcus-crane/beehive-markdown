The government is backing New Zealand’s rapidly growing biotechnology industry, with confirmation of ongoing funding of $25 million over the next five years for the Australia New Zealand Biotechnology Partnership Fund, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard announced in Brisbane today.

The fund aims to facilitate trans-Tasman collaboration and in particular to help firms involved in trans-Tasman projects to commercialise their ideas. Ongoing funding of $5 million annually until 2012 is now confirmed after a Ministry of Economic Development review showed the fund is making a positive impact in supporting the commercialisation of biotech firms in both countries.

Prime Minister Helen Clark also announced new recipients of grants from the fund – including two New Zealand companies which are represented on the Prime Ministerial Export Year trade mission currently visiting Australia.

"Since July 2004 the fund has provided Kiwi firms with the means to establish significant alliances with Australian organisations, giving them access to a greater pool of expertise and skill, and a more visible profile on the international stage.  
"New Zealanders need to aim for ‘world-leader’ status in sectors like biotechnology if we are serious about transforming our economy and lifting living standards - and this trans-Tasman fund is helping in this work,” Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said the review of the Australia New Zealand Biotechnology Fund showed the grants for large-scale collaborative trans-Tasman projects were accelerating the rate at which New Zealand biotech companies were building strategic commercial alliances with Australian entities.

"We are seeing Kiwi biotech firms in a position to grasp bigger, better and more lucrative opportunities. The benefits go both ways – local firms are exposed to a larger sphere of ideas and creativity, and Australian companies know they don’t have to partner with Asian or US firms to achieve results,” he said.

At the biotech-themed day in Brisbane, Helen Clark also announced three new grant recipients in the latest funding round.

"Industrial Research, Catapult Systems and KODE Biotech are collectively receiving $1.28 million (GST exclusive) to carve out international market opportunities in their fields of expertise in partnership with Australian companies.

I am confident these firms will do much to increase global recognition of New Zealand and Australia as a hub of world-class biotech activity."

Industrial Research, with Australian partner Mimotopes, will be working in the fast-growing field of synthetic peptides, which are a new type of therapeutic pharmaceutical.  
Catapult Genetics NZ Limited was formed following the merger of New Zealand's Catapult Systems Limited and Australian company Genetic Solutions Pty Limited, global leaders in sheep and cattle DNA testing technologies respectively. The ANZBPF grant will support validation of diagnostic genetic markers in new markets and new large-animal species, allowing screening for traits such as increased fertility and disease resistance.

KODE Biotech will be developing a blood-typing product aimed at the Asian market with Australian firm CSL, in order to eradicate potentially life-threatening blood transfusion reactions.

The fund will contribute up to 25 per cent of the project costs, with the New Zealand partner contributing another 25 per cent and the Australian partner making up the remaining 50 per cent.

IRL Chief Executive Officer Shaun Coffey and Catapult Genetics CEO Dr Gerard Davis are both part of the Prime Minister’s trade mission delegation.

Grants totalling $7.53 million (GST excl) have been previously awarded to six other New Zealand companies, including PGG Wrightson, Proacta, Neuren, Industrial Research, Keratec and Livestock Improvement. The projects cover various aspects of biotechnology, including the commercialisation of bone-grafting technology, improving the metabolic efficiency of dairy cows, and the development of cutting-edge pharmaceuticals for HIV prevention, cancer therapy and nerve repair.  
Smaller grants have also been awarded to five other companies for commercial skill development and to assist with the establishment of collaboration between trans-Tasman firms.

"The Australia New Zealand Biotechnology Partnership Fund has given firms on both sides of the Tasman the impetus to join together in leading-edge scientific collaborations."

"This latest round of funding, coupled with the government’s continued financial support, will do much to ensure the fund is a significant contributor to increasing the profile of Australasia’s biotechnology industry as the fifth-largest in the world," Trevor Mallard said.
