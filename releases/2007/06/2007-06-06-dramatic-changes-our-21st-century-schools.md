The Education Minister, Steve Maharey, says schools are being dramatically reshaped to meet new styles of teaching and learning.

Steve Maharey was speaking at the '21st Century Environments for all learners' Conference in Auckland today, about creating schools to meet the needs and challenges of a modern, knowledge society.

"A revolution is taking place within education, with the emphasis on active learners creating dramatic changes in the design our classrooms, with more space, break out rooms and areas for professional development of teachers.

"For example, the entranceways of schools are changing to be more welcoming to the community.

"Anyone visiting a new or recently upgraded school will see dramatic differences in the way they're built and laid out. Our 21st century schools are providing more opportunities to use new tools, such as information technology and computers.

"For example, libraries have changed from a focus on books to becoming communication centres.

"There are at least 14 brand new, modern schools to be built across the country as part of Budget 2007, including five in Auckland, four in Chistchurch, one in Wellington and two in the Queenstown Lakes District.

"This years budget has also delivered even more funding to improve our schools, with $238.3 million of capital funding over 2007/08 to 2009/10 for school property, which includes the new schools, 180 new classrooms and 10 new school gyms, as well as modernising existing schools and development of kura and wharekura."
