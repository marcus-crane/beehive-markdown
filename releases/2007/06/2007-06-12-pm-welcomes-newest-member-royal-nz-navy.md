Prime Minister Helen Clark today officiated at a ceremony to mark the commissioning into the Royal New Zealand Navy of the brand new multi-role vessel, HMNZS Canterbury at the Tenix dockyards in Melbourne.

"This vessel represents the addition of a significant capability to the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). The Canterbury provides a platform to transport and deploy personnel, equipment and supplies when New Zealand has not previously had available," said Helen Clark.

"The need for a multi-role vessel has long been recognised by the NZDF. The Canterbury will allow New Zealand a much greater degree of flexibility in responding to military deployments and requests for civil and disaster relief; primarily within the Pacific, but also wider afield.

"The Canterbury is the first of seven new ships being constructed under Project Protector, the $500 million initiative designed to provide an enhanced operational capability to the Royal New Zealand Navy.

"In 2000, the government undertook a review of existing defence capability. That review determined that New Zealand's navy needed a practical fleet matched to our wider security needs. From that assessment came the design for the Project Protector fleet.

"All of the vessels to be introduced under the auspices of Project Protector have been designed with a multi-agency role in mind. The protection of New Zealand's coastline, the security of fishing stocks and the ability to deploy personnel from the NZDF and other agencies have all contributed to the final fleet design.

"In addition to the Canterbury, Project Protector will provide two 85-metre Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) and four 55-metre Inshore Patrol Vessels (IPV). The project has provided valuable contracts for New Zealand manufacturers, who will complete at least $110 million worth of work for these vessels.

"The seven Project Protector vessels represent the greatest boost to ship numbers and capacity ever enjoyed by the Royal New Zealand Navy, and will provide a significant boost in morale and capability," said Helen Clark.
