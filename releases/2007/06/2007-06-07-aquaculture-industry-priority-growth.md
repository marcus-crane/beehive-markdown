Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched a new industry body for the aquaculture sector, saying it is a significant step toward realising the industry’s potential to become a billion dollar a year industry by 2025, and contribute to New Zealand's economic transformation.

"The new agency, Aquaculture New Zealand, will be a single overarching voice for aquaculture," Helen Clark said.

"Twenty years ago, aquaculture was a relatively small industry, turning over about a million dollars a week and employing four hundred people. Today it has grown to employ 2500 people, and it turns over close to a million dollars a day. Fish and shellfish farming has now become the fastest growing sector of New Zealand’s seafood industry. Our government believes the sector’s vision to become a billion-dollar industry by 2025 is achievable.

"The sector has immense potential to help transform New Zealand’s economy in a way which is both environmentally and socially sustainable.

"Aquaculture New Zealand will enable the industry to implement its sector strategy, and to communicate and build relationships between the government, councils, iwi and other stakeholders.

"Aquaculture New Zealand brings cohesion, stability and marketing direction to the industry. Future growth of the industry depends on it continuing to grow sustainably and develop markets for its products, particularly offshore.

“I look forward to seeing further aquaculture development being provided for in regional coastal plans,” Helen Clark.

The government’s aquaculture website, www.aquaculture.govt.nz went live at midday today.
