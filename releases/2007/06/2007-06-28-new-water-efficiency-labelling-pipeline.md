Regulations for a Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) will be brought in at the end of this year, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

Water Efficiency Labelling is a new scheme to help New Zealanders save water. Like the labels you see on electrical appliances (fridges, stoves etc) it will give consumers information at the point of sale about a product’s water consumption and efficiency.

The Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry for Consumer Affairs are this month jointly hosting consultation meetings regarding the discussion document issued this week. These meetings will enable stakeholders to assist government to finalise the Consumer Information Standard (Water Efficiency Labeling) Regulations ready for implementation.

Ms Tizard said she invites any comments on the design and details of the scheme.

"We want efficiency rating labels that provide consumers with better information about what they purchase," said Ms Tizard.

"Conserving water is good grounds for developing a Consumer Information Standard. In time, Water Efficiency Labelling will also encourage the manufacture and import of more water-efficient products.

"A benefit of having a New Zealand WELS, in line with the Australian scheme, is that it will facilitate better trans-Tasman trade," she said.

The list of products currently proposed under the scheme includes taps, dishwashers, washing machines, showerheads, toilets, and flow controllers.

Mr Benson-Pope said this work was part of the Labour-led government’s wider sustainability programme.

"Households use around 30 per cent of the energy consumed, especially via heated water, so using less water means saving money and energy.

"This labelling scheme, like the energy efficiency ratings label, reinforces the message that water is a precious resource," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Manufacturers, importers and retailers of the scheme's listed products and appliances will be required to display labels in the future.
