Figures out today confirm tourism's place as New Zealand's number one export earner, Minister Damien O'Connor says.

According to the Tourism Satellite Account: 2006, published today by Statistics New Zealand, international tourism expenditure accounted for $8.3 billion, or 19.2 per cent of New Zealand's exports in 2006, compared with 18.9 per cent for the previous year.

"This report demonstrates just how important tourism is to the well-being of New Zealand, and that we are doing very well with it," Mr O'Connor said.

"It is our largest export sector and maintains consistent year-on-year growth. And this is despite the high exchange rate environment over the period.

Other standout figures include: international and domestic tourists spending $18.6 billion, an increase of 3.2 per cent ($573 million) from the previous year, and tourism directly and indirectly contributing 8.9 per cent to gross domestic product, Mr O'Connor said.

"These impressive figures will provide a real shot in the arm for the tourism industry at a time when it and the Government are revising its overall strategy. The figures are a culmination of a huge amount of effort and innovation by thousands of companies and individuals.

"The challenge now is to ensure we continue to be smart in the way we deal with changing international trends and to remain focused on protecting and enhancing the special image our country enjoys overseas. The update of the Tourism Strategy is the prefect opportunity for us to make sure we continue to get it right."

Nb: The "Tourism Satellite Account" is an internationally-used mechanism for including all aspects of tourism so it can be compared to the other elements of the economy as a whole.
