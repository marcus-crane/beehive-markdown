New Zealand is expanding support for the world’s best PhD students to study here under the International Doctoral Research Scholarships ([NZIDRS](http://www.newzealandeducated.com/scholarships/page1.html)) programme, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Dr Cullen [made the announcement](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F29872) at a function in Parliament celebrating the achievements of the 95 NZIDRS students currently studying in New Zealand.

The living allowance of $18,000 will increase to $20,500 in 2008. The scholarship also covers tuition fees, health insurance, and book and travel allowances.

"We want to continue to attract the world’s brightest and best to New Zealand to help foster the exchange of high quality ideas and research at the top level of our tertiary institutions," Dr Cullen said.

"Attracting the best is important if we are to continue transforming New Zealand into a high wage, knowledge-based economy.

The scholarships are awarded for three years to international students for full time study for a doctoral research degree. The first students enrolled at New Zealand universities in 2005.

"The scholarships are designed to attract top international students, so we can enhance the reputation and profile of tertiary education and strengthen our research capacity and capability.

"International education is our fourth biggest export industry, earning $2 billion a year in foreign exchange. The scholarships underline our efforts to raise quality in the tertiary sector and enhance our growing international reputation for the excellence of tertiary training here.

"Just last week New Zealand was acceded to the [Lisbon Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Area](http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/highereducation/Recognition/LRC_en.asp).

New Zealand tertiary qualifications will now have equivalent status in each of the 50 Lisbon convention countries.

"I congratulate the international scholars currently studying here and hope they return home, armed with excellent research and well satisfied with the quality of their tertiary experience," Dr Cullen concluded.
