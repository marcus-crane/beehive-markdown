Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor has welcomed a petition calling for the banning of cigarette displays in shops and petrol stations.

Mr O'Connor received the petition today on the steps of Parliament. The petition calls for a law change to force retailers to keep tobacco products out of sight of the public.

"This petition shows there is some public disquiet about the way tobacco products are 'in the face' of adults and children every time they go to into retail outlets," Mr O'Connor said.

Under the present law retailers can display 100 packets of tobacco or 40 cartons of tobacco products. There are also controls on how displays are set up.

Mr O'Connor said while the existing controls were thoroughly canvassed before coming into force in 2003, the Government was continuing to investigate their effectiveness.

"Evidence shows that between 40 per cent and two thirds of retailers fail to comply with the present law. This is not good enough, frankly. In most cases it is due to a lack of understanding of the rules, however, it seems that some retailers are deliberately flouting them."

Mr O'Connor said he has asked the Ministry of Health to continue its close monitoring of the law as well as develop a public consultation document on the future of tobacco displays.

"This Government has a good record on tobacco control. The public does not miss smoky bars and restaurants.

"Now it is time to ask if they will miss the wall of cigarettes at the local shop."
