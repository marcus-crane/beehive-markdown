“When economic researchers have looked at places where really rapid economic growth is occurring, they have found the population in those same places have an unusually high number of creative people,” Wigram MP and Minister of Agriculture Jim Anderton said last night.

He was speaking at a dinner celebrating the 50th anniversary of Peter Hallifax Ltd, the Christchurch wholesale company that manufactures and exports tourist products. The company also marked the occasion with its inaugural Emerging Art Awards.

“Art and business success go together for a very good reason − they are both about creativity,” Jim Anderton said. “Our businesses today are increasingly seeing the importance of creativity to international success. They use design to increase the value and desirability of their product. And often the design reflects a special ‘New Zealandness’, which helps exporters sell premium branded products in international markets.”

Jim Anderton said this is a good time to be a New Zealander. “Since the beginning of this century, we have enjoyed the longest continuous run of economic growth in decades. Our economy has grown on average more than the average of developed countries − faster than the US, the UK and Japan and as fast as Australia's. Our economy is 25 percent larger today than it was when the current government came into office in 1999.

“As a nation we should be ambitious. It's no coincidence that there are Kiwis sailing both the defender and the challenger in the America’s Cup finals. And just as we cheer on our sporting success, we need to get used to cheering success in business,” Jim Anderton said. “We need innovative and creative companies like this one. Every business success promises jobs and higher incomes. Every creative business successfully selling to the world promises a more secure future for New Zealand.”
