The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, is welcoming the announcement of $59 million to fund key research into health issues that affect New Zealanders.

"The Labour-led government is committed to investing in quality research to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC).

"This funding will research a wide range of issues including asthma and respiratory disorders, injury prevention, neurological diseases and heart injury.

"It will also target a variety of public and mental health issues, including a study of traffic-related injuries of newly licensed drivers, and research into depression in alcohol dependent people."

The HRC is the principal government agency responsible for funding health research in New Zealand.

"This government is committed to continually improving the health of New Zealanders, and the HRC's funding of new and ongoing research is central to that goal."
