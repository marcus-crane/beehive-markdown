Housing New Zealand has launched an ambitious campaign to encourage tenants living in its 68,000 state houses to install energy-saving light bulbs, Housing Minister Chris Carter announced today.

High-quality energy-saving light bulbs, such as Ecobulbs, use 80 percent less power than standard light bulbs and last 10 times longer. Replacing five standard light bulbs with Ecobulbs can save householders around $650 in power costs over the life of the bulbs.

Ecobulbs normally cost about $5 each. Mr Carter said to help make the switch, state housing tenants will be able to buy five Ecobulbs for $10 – a saving of around $15.

Vouchers for the energy-saving bulbs have been included in Housing New Zealand’s quarterly newsletter to tenants, Close to Home, which will be delivered to letterboxes this week. Tenants have until 2 September to redeem the vouchers at participating Shell service stations nationwide.

Mr Carter said the voucher scheme, which is jointly funded by Housing New Zealand and the Electricity Commission, is the first nationwide campaign of its type.

“Some tenants will have missed out on similar regional schemes run by power companies and trusts, so we wanted to make sure that all of our tenants, right across the country, are able to access this great initiative and tap into the savings available.”

He said promoting energy-efficient light bulbs benefit more than just state house tenants.

“Reduced energy demand and usage is good for the economy and the environment, and that benefits all New Zealanders.

“If just 40 percent of state house tenants install Ecobulbs, throughout the life of the bulbs we will have saved enough electricity to power Queenstown for a year, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 53,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide.”

Housing New Zealand chief executive Dr Lesley McTurk said the majority of state housing tenants were low-income earners, “and we are committed to helping our tenants save money wherever possible.

”Because energy-saving light bulbs use substantially less power than standard light bulbs, and can last up to nine years, tenants can save around $6 a month on their power bill, or $650 over the life of the bulbs.”

Dr McTurk said Housing New Zealand takes its environmental and sustainability obligations seriously, and will continue to promote to tenants the benefits of energy-efficient lighting and other energy savings.

Other environmental sustainability initiatives include improving insulation in all state homes built before 1977, and phasing out open fireplaces in areas with poor air quality.
