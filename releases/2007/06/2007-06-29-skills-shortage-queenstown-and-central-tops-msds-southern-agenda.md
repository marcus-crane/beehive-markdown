The labour market challenges facing Queenstown and Central Otago are one of the top priorities in the Ministry of Social Development’s Southern Annual Regional Plan, launched today by Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope.

The plan is the first of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand over the coming fortnight. Regional plans set out each region’s specific needs and development opportunities and how the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) is responding to these.

Mr Benson-Pope said the plan contains a number of significant projects that will have a positive effect on many of those living in the region.

"The plan outlines what MSD is doing to support young people, families, people seeking work and the wider community. It also shows how the Ministry is working with other government agencies to address skills and labour shortages in Queenstown and Central Otago," he said.

Some of the key projects included in the regional plan are:

- Queenstown and Central Otago: MSD is leading the interagency Labour Market Development Group, which this year has a focus on developing solutions to skills shortages in Queenstown and Central Otago. The group is proposing a research project is carried out as the first step in developing a labour market strategy.
- Early Years Service Hubs: These hubs provide a central point where families with young children from pre-birth to six years old can access relevant services. Seven hubs will be established nationally at existing facilities and hub workers will liaise with providers to co-ordinate a range of services. MSD will establish a hub in South Dunedin by September this year.
- Enterprising Communities Grants: The Ministry’s Enterprising Communities programme has funded Port Chalmers Regional Maritime Museum to create two new positions which will help the museum with its expansion plans. The programme is also funding the successful Healthy Homes Retrofitting project in Bluff.
- Seasonal Solutions Central Otago Ltd: The Ministry helped to initiate this co-ordinated response to horticulture and viticulture labour shortages in Central Otago. Last season more than 45 workers were recruited under the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme, and this year the aim is to attract 100 workers. MSD is also working with Seasonal Solutions to explore cadetships for young people over the coming year.
  
  The regional plan draws together the activities of all of the Ministry’s service lines within the Southern region. These include: Child, Youth and Family, Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Integrity Services, and Senior Services.
