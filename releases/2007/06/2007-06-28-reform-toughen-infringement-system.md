Courts Minister Rick Barker today announced details of reforms to the Infringement System which will be tougher for those who don’t pay their fines, and easier for those who do.

“An extensive review of the current system has been carried out and the Government has now decided on a range of measures which need further investigation,” Rick Barker said.

“These measures will achieve three objectives: they will toughen up the current regime, at the same time they will streamline it to make it easier to comply, and paying fines will be made easier.”

Rick Barker said that changes would be introduced over the next three years and the benefits would grow with time. The main changes proposed are:

1. Getting tougher
   
   - Using driver licence suspensions as a sanction against people who don’t pay transport related fines \[this may not necessarily include parking fines]
   - Credit information being provided to credit agencies on outstanding fines
   - Vehicles of low or no financial or re-sale value being able to be seized
2. Easier to comply with:
   
   - Making interventions earlier in the fines process, particularly for young offenders – investigation will go ahead on a number of measures
   - Lower or different penalties will be considered for the Graduated Driver Licence System (GDLS) for people under 25 years including alternative sanctions such as increasing the use of demerits points
   - Other initiatives are to:
     
     - Investigate earlier referral to court
     - Evaluate referral programmes.
3. Making payment as easy as possible
   
   - Broader range of payment options from a wider range of agencies.
