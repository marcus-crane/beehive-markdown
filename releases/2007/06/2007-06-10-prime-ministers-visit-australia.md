New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced she will meet with Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Australian Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd while in Australia next week.

Helen Clark is in Australia next week to lead an Export Year business mission to Australia’s eastern states. The mission will focus on food and beverage (Melbourne), biotechnology (Brisbane) and specialised manufacturing (Sydney) sectors, with sector-focused business delegations attending in each state capital.

Helen Clark will meet Prime Minister John Howard in Sydney on Friday, and will meet Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd also in Sydney the same day.

“Meeting with Prime Minister John Howard is an opportunity to touch base on a range of issues of mutual interest, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. This includes Australia hosting this year’s APEC summit in Sydney in September, and the prominence of climate change on the agenda,” Helen Clark said.

“My meeting with Kevin Rudd will be the first since he became Leader of the Australian Labor Party.

Also while in Australia next week, Helen Clark will officiate at the commissioning of the Royal New Zealand Navy’s new multi-role vessel, HMNZS Canterbury in Melbourne on Tuesday.
