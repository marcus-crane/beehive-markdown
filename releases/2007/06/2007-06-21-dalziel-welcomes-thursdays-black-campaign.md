Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel is wearing black today in support of the Thursdays in Black campaign calling for a world free from rape and violence.

Lianne Dalziel said she wholeheartedly backs the aims of the global campaign in which people everywhere are invited to wear black on Thursdays as a symbol of strength and courage, to show solidarity with survivors of violence and to demand an end to rape and violence. It calls for a community where people can walk safely without fear of attack.

"The aims of the campaign – a world without rape or violence – are ones very close to my heart and ones I have been committed to achieving throughout my political life."

That is why I am especially pleased to announce that the local [Christchurch Women’s Refuge](http://www.womensrefuge.co.nz/) is receiving $30,000 in government funding to work with the Canterbury Igniting Change project to help prevent family violence. The Igniting Change forum is organised by Christchurch City Council, the Families Commission and MSD’s Family and Community Services.

Speaking at the Tertiary Women's Focus Group of the New Zealand University Students Association conference at Lincoln University today, Lianne Dalziel applauded the group's initiative in launching the campaign in New Zealand

She thanked Canterbury Crusader rugby player Corey Flynn who has also lent his support.

"It's great to see men standing up and being counted on these issues, and having such a prominent male role model taking a lead will have a big impact."

The aims of Thursdays in Black resonated strongly with the Labour-led government's initiatives to eliminate sexual violence and family violence, Lianne Dalziel said.

"We have a long way to go before violence is no longer tolerated in our homes and communities, but we have made a good start and together we can get there."
