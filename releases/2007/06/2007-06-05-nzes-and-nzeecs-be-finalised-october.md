The government’s timetable for delivery of both the New Zealand Energy Strategy (NZES) and the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (NZEECS) was today updated by Energy Minister David Parker.

The finalised versions of the NZES and NZEECS will be published in September and October respectively. This is to align with the decisions being taken on emissions trading.

"We've had over 3000 submissions on the NZES, NZEECS and related climate change policy documents," said David Parker. "These submissions deserve careful consideration."

"It's important that the NZES and NZEECS mesh with decisions on emissions trading. Policies in all these areas will complement one another and form an important part of the comprehensive, whole of economy response to climate change and energy policy issues.
