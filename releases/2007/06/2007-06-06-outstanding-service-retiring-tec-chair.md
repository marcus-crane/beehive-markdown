Russell Marshall has made an outstanding contribution to education in New Zealand over more than 30 years, Tertiary Education Minister, Dr Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen was commenting on the decision of Russell Marshall to retire from his position as chair of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

"He has led the TEC through one of the most significant periods of change that New Zealand’s tertiary sector has seen," Dr Cullen said.

"His work has been critical in building the organisation and in rolling out the tertiary education reforms. His leadership has helped maintain stability and continuity through a period of great change and he leaves the TEC in a strong position to implement the reforms."

Russell Marshall’s resignation takes effect from 30 June. The government is advertising for a replacement chair and expects to announce the appointment in early September. An interim chair will be appointed shortly.

Russell Marshall, 71, was a member of parliament for 18 years, serving two terms as a Cabinet Minister, including a term as Minister of Education. He chaired the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, whose work resulted in the formation of the TEC. He also chaired the National Commission for UNESCO, Education New Zealand, and the international education consultancy PINZ, and was Chancellor of Victoria University. He served as New Zealand’s Permanent Representative to UNESCO and was High Commissioner to the United Kingdom immediately prior to taking up the chair of the TEC in 2005.

"His career has been one of tremendous service to the people of New Zealand, particularly to the education sector and I wish him well in the future," Dr Cullen said.
