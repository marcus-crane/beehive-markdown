The final phase of improvements to New Zealand Scholarship examinations has been announced today by Education Minister, Steve Maharey and Associate Education Minister, Parekura Horomia.

"This marks the completion of the final three out of 26 recommendations arising from a 2005 review by the Scholarship Reference Group", says Steve Maharey.

"The improvements will further strengthen scholarship as the national system to recognise and acknowledge New Zealand’s top scholars, and provide them with a monetary reward."

"The first change is that from 2008, Te Reo Rangatira will be introduced as a scholarship subject. Te Reo Mâori will remain as a separate scholarship examination subject", says Parekura Horomia.

"Te Reo Mâori is the study of Mâori language, and Te Reo Rangatira is a much broader subject, with a wide cultural and philosophical framework within which learning takes place. "

The second change is that students can receive a monetary award for all languages, including their first or native language. For example, up to now a native French speaker could not get a monetary award in French because it was his or her first language. This will no longer be the case.

Steve Maharey says the decision to make both first and second language speakers eligible for Scholarship monetary awards in those languages is a matter of fairness, "This creates a level playing field for all students, regardless of their first language."

The third and final recommendation of the Scholarship Reference Group was a proposal to introduce requisites, or conditions, to decide who can sit Scholarship.

"It has been decided that conditions are not necessary. Scholarship is designed to identify the top achievers at secondary school level and the structure of the system eliminates the need for requisites to be introduced."

In 2005, the Scholarship Reference Group made 26 recommendations for improving scholarship. Today's announcement means that all recommendations have now been addressed.
