With the achievement of universal, affordable primary health care less than two weeks away it's time for John Key and National to come clean on their policy on cheaper doctor's visits and prescriptions, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

From 1 July, New Zealanders in the 25-44 year old age group will join the three million New Zealanders who have already seen their primary health bills slashed by Labour's $2.2 billion investment in the sector. John Key and National are on record supporting higher fees for the millions of people aged between 25-65, a move that would free up hundreds of millions of dollars every year for tax cuts.

"The Labour-led government has cut the cost of seeing the doctor by around half," Pete Hodgson said.

"From 1 July, all New Zealanders will have access to affordable doctor's visits and prescriptions.

"For an average family, the annual cost of going to a general practitioner has fallen from about $940 a year on average to around $440 while for an older couple who on average paid about $780 year, the cost is now around $340 a year.

"These savings have only been achieved through the Labour-led Government's seven year investment in primary health care - an investment John Key and National promised to cut at the last election. They have been routinely desperate to undermine the success of the Primary Health Care Strategy over the years for the sole reason of hoping to never find themselves having to commit to keeping it in place.

"As late as last year, Tony Ryall was actively encouraging efforts for the last two stages of the rollout to fail. With universal coverage about to be achieved, it's time for National to come clean on cheaper doctor's visits.

"With John Key's fondness for telling people what they want to hear rather than what he believes in, I'm guessing a u-turn on doctor's visits can't be too far around the corner."
