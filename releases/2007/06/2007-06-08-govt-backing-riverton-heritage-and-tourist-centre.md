Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Labour-led Government will contribute $172,203 to enable the Riverton and District's Heritage and Tourist Centre enhancements to be completed

The grant help complete the redevelopment of the current museum into a modern heritage museum and tourism information centre. The funding will come from the Government's contestable Significant Community Based Projects Fund.

“The project involves a significant redesign of the Wallace Early Settlers’ Museum and the completion of a new adjacent building to house a new exhibition: Te Hïkoi – Southern Journey, which illustrates the history of the area and its people,” Helen Clark said.

“This redevelopment provides a modern heritage museum with a multi-function educational theatre, research facilities, and a tourism centre.

“The centre will be an important tourist attraction in the area, complementing other tourism initiatives in the Southland region along the Southern Scenic Route.

‘Riverton has a fascinating history as an early contact site between Maori and Europeans, with trading between them beginning in the early 1800s. The new exhibitions will remind us of our whaling and sealing past; of how Maori in an earlier era survived and adapted to the Southern climate; and of early European settlement," Helen Clark said.

The $32 million Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up by the Labour-led Government in 2005 to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

Grants in this financial year have already been awarded to:  
·Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (up to $6.5million)  
·Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust (up to $578,699)  
·McLean Park Regional Trust ($2.9 million).

Helen Clark said further announcements about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year would be made shortly.

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said that as a result of the high calibre of applications received, the fund will be completely allocated this year.

"The high level of community interest in the fund has led Cabinet to ask me to report back on the level of demand for projects which would have been eligible to apply had the fund continued,” Rick Barker said.

“The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up at a time of falling lottery profits when less funding was available to support capital projects. The recent increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits has resulted in higher levels of funding being available for allocation, and has allowed the re-establishment of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

“The Lottery Community Facilities Fund is able to support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. Organisations considering applying should contact GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz or phone 0800 824 824,” Rick Barker said.
