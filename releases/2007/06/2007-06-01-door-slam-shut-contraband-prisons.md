Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today the Government is to push for a law change to combat the smuggling of contraband into prisons.

The Government wants amendments to the Corrections Act 2004 which would further strengthen the control of contraband in prisons through additional search, detection and offence provisions, particularly in relation to drugs and unauthorised cell phones and other electronic communication equipment.

Mr O'Connor said the Labour-led Government has in the past seven years committed significant funding to upgrade the security of New Zealand prisons, leading to escape rates dropping by 80 per cent and the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs halving since the late 1990s.

"But despite significant progress we are still seeing contraband getting through our systems. The public don't accept this and neither do I," Mr O'Connor said.

"I will use every tool at my disposal to remove the scourge of drugs from prisons and to keep cellphones and weapons out of prisoners' hands."

The proposed amendments in the Corrections Amendment Bill include:  
·Introducing a new criminal offence for non-prisoners to possess without authority drugs, communications devices or offensive weapons in prison, with the penalty to be a $5000 fine and/or up to three months in prison.  
·Giving Corrections greater powers to undertake body and property searches.  
·Extending the current penalties (12 months imprisonment and/or $5000 fine) to include situations where contraband is passed by a prison officer, staff member or probation officer to a prisoner while they are outside a prison  
·Making it an offence to attempt to tamper with a drug sample.  
·Allowing for prisoners to be re-tested if a sample is believed to have been tampered with.  
·Clarifying the term 'unauthorised electronic device', specifying cellphones, wi-fi, Bluetooth transmitters and any internet-capable device.  
·Making it an offence for a prisoner to possess or use an unauthorised electronic device, with the penalty to be a $5000 fine and/or up to three months in prison.

The Government aims to introduce the Bill into Parliament in August.

Mr O'Connor said eliminating smuggling altogether is a huge challenge, not just in New Zealand, but worldwide.

"It is a hugely difficult task because cellphones are getting smaller all the time, SIM cards and drugs such as 'P' are relatively easy to conceal, and some prisoner visitors resort to tricks such as hiding contraband on their children's clothing."

Mr O'Connor said moves to further tighten security would not impact on his and the Government's commitment under Effective Interventions to create a prison environment that was focused on reducing re-offending by increasing rehabilitation opportunities.

"I am taking a carrot and stick approach.

"I am determined to do everything I can to ensure prisoners have every opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, through work, education and access to good health care, including drug and alcohol treatment units – which we are doubling in number.

"However, this is not going to work for prisoners if they refuse to abide by the rules or are distracted by drugs.

"The presence of drugs and mobile phones lead to standover tactics and assaults, and allow prisoners to subvert prison controls and organise illicit activities outside prisons."
