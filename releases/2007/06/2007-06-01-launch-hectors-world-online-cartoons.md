The launch today of Hector’s World™, four new online cartoon episodes which teach children about internet safety, is a fantastic, innovative and unique resource, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Laban launched the first public screening cartoon series at a ceremony in Auckland today.

“Kids today are very capable at using the Internet. However, they are not always able to identify risks like cyberbullying,” said Laban.

“Hector’s World™ focuses on helping our young children understand the risks of surfing the Internet in an engaging, balanced and informative way.

“It is important that we equip our children with skills to keep themselves safe during their online explorations as much as we would on any other journey,” said Laban.

The Labour-led government’s Community Partnership Fund under the Digital Strategy assisted with funding for the production of the cartoon series.

The Digital Strategy uses ICT to help unlock New Zealand’s economic, social and cultural aspirations.

“This project has been a successful joint venture between the community, business and government and reflects our commitment to building strong, sustainable and connected communities.

“The Hector’s World™ concept has the potential to go global. I understand that there is already interest from overseas about the resource – great news for our growing ICT industry,” said Laban.
