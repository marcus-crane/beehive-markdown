"An online dog re-registration initiative by Auckland City Council is a good service for responsible dog owners", says Associate Local government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“Making it this simple will help responsible dog owners minimise the risk of over-looking the need to re-register.”

“This initiative means Auckland will have more resources available to concentrate on the heart of the dog problem – irresponsible owners who actively avoid registering their dogs," says Nanaia Mahuta.

Figures from the National Dog Database show that in 2006/2007 there are 19,204 dogs registered in Auckland City alone.

“For effective dog control and safe communities we need good laws, active and determined local councils, and support from citizens and responsible dog owners.

“Good laws need good enforcement. That’s the job of councils, and it’s great to see new initiatives being taken. Good laws also need the active support of citizens. Making the law easy to observe builds this support.

"This government, and local government, understand the benefits of responsible dog ownership and we want people to be able to enjoy those benefits with as little fuss as possible.

"However responsible dog owners are let down by those who do not respect the law. If you know of dogs which are unregistered, menacing or dangerous, then tell your local council,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
