Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven is warning homeowners to be aware of the risk of electrical shock and electrocution when installing underfloor thermal insulation using staples.

The warning comes after three homeowners received fatal electric shocks this year when stapling underfloor insulation material into power cables.

“As with any electrical work being carried out, whether in the home or at work, it is essential that any potential hazards or risks are identified and eliminated.

“When stapling underfloor thermal insulation it is essential to keep staples well clear of any power cables.

“Work preparation must include identification of cable location and, where required, cable protection to eliminate the possibility of stapling the cable.

“Turning off the power while installing the insulation is recommended, however this action does not necessarily eliminate the hazard. A cable that has been damaged by a staple could still make the aluminium foil live when the power is turned back on and create the same electric shock hazard.

“Damage to a power cable may result in a fatal electric shock and there is also risk of an electrically initiated fire if an electrical cable is damaged during the installation.

“Homeowners who have any doubts or concerns about installing underfloor thermal insulation safely should have the work carried out by professional installers,” Harry Duynhoven said.
