Courts Minister Rick Barker said today that 1 July heralds the beginning of a 21st century coronial system.

“On 1 July New Zealand will start a new era of coronial services when significant reforms designed to enhance public confidence in the integrity and independence of the coronial system come into force,” said Rick Barker.

“For the first time New Zealand will have a body of full-time coroners, headed by a Chief Coroner, and supported by a dedicated coronial service,” said Rick Barker.

“Being full time means coroners will have more time to build relationships with communities, local iwi and cultural groups, and will not have to fit their coronial duties around other employment commitments,” said Rick Barker.

The changes are the result of the Coroners Act, which takes full effect on 1 July 2007.

“Having met with the new coroners at a last week’s training in Wellington, I have full confidence that the team will take New Zealand’s coronial system into the 21st century,” said Rick Barker.

“While the advent of the new coronial system will undoubtedly bring benefits, it builds upon the strengths of the old system. I’d like to acknowledge the exceptionally dedicated service of the approximately fifty-five, mostly part-time coroners who have given so freely of their time and expertise to provide coronial services to their communities,” said Rick Barker.

The new full-time coroners will span the country in nine locations: Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua, Hastings, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Based in these regional centres the coroners will travel to hear inquests in the region they serve ensuring close inter-action with local communities.
