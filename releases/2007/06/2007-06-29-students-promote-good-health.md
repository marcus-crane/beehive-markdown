Health Minister Pete Hodgson praised the leadership of young New Zealanders at the launch of a student health promotion initiative in Christchurch today.

The initiative is part of the Labour-led government’s “Mission On” programme which is designed to help young New Zealanders lead a more active and healthier lifestyle.

“These young Kiwis are showing the way. They know that you feel better when you are active and eating right. Mission-On has a lot of input from adults: teachers, parents, and experts like the Mission On lifestyle ambassadors Bernice Mene and Indira Moala; but I want to thank young Kiwis who are right on board with this,” said Pete Hodgson.

St James was chosen for the launch of the initiative, for their achievements in creating a healthy food environment and delivering healthy eating messages to their students, parents, whânau and the whole school community.

The students have put together a dvd of a series of advertisements about healthy eating, and excerpts were shown at the launch.

The principal of St James School, Jo Barlow says “We know healthy children learn better. We have enjoyed the support of the ‘Fruit in Schools’ co-ordinator at Community Public Health, the Sports Trust, the Cancer Society, the National Heart Foundation and the opportunity to work with cluster schools.”
