John Key has flushed his attempt to gain green credential down the river in a startling return to the madcap energy and economic polices of Rob Muldoon says Energy Minister, David Parker.

"John Key thinks he's Rob Muldoon," says David Parker. "Key's plans to resurrect project Aqua ignore, massive cost overruns, engineering difficulties and water availability issues that caused it to be abandoned. John Key clearly has visions of the project being his very own Clyde Dam, one of the most expensive wastes of money the New Zealand energy sector has ever seen. Taxpayers had to pick up the tab for this at a rate of around 17 cents per unit of power in today's money, around twice the cost of today's most competitive options that Key ignores."

Key's power madness extends to the Dobson project. This project involved the flooding of land, part of which was put into the conservation estate by National's Nick Smith in the 1990s.

This is yet another example of Key being poorly informed and making up policy on the hoof. The Dobson project has been superseded by the Arnold River scheme that is already in train and would provide sufficient energy for the West Coast. Meridian has also come up with a replacement project for Aqua. Both alternatives have lower environmental impacts than their earlier incarnations. This is evidence of the Resource Management Act working as it should, and no excuse to "gut the RMA" as National has proposed.

On the tourism and mining fronts, the Department of Conservation approves more than 90 per cent of mining and recreations (tourism) concession on the West Coast with 162 tourism concessions issued.

"Key is also demonstrating just how duplicitous National is. At the weekend National was cosying up to the Greens yet today he's announced plans that are both economic and environmental madness.

"Under Key's rhetoric there is a clear return to the mistakes of National governments past: Think Big for energy, Borrow and Hope for tax cuts, replacing parts of Working for Families with muesli bars, attacking KiwiSaver retirement provision; privatising the health sector and vouchers for schools," David Parker said.
