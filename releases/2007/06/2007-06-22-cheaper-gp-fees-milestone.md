A major milestone in the delivery of healthcare to all New Zealanders is less than two weeks away with the universal roll out of cheaper doctor visits and cheaper prescription charges, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

From 1 July, New Zealanders aged between 25-44 will see the cost of seeing the family doctor fall by up to half and prescription charges fall from $15 to $3. Already, 3 million New Zealanders aged over 44 and under 25 have access to affordable primary health care.

"The Labour-led government has cut the price of seeing the doctor in half," Pete Hodgson said.

"From the gutted health system we inherited from National, Labour has invested $2.2 billion in primary healthcare over the past seven years, an investment in the health and well-being of all New Zealanders.

"Labour has always said cost should never be a barrier to visiting the family doctor. This final roll out for the 25-44 aged group means another roughly one million New Zealanders now have access to affordable primary healthcare."

Pete Hodgson today released new figures which demonstrate the dramatic impact the Labour-led government's investment has made on the average family health bill.

For an average family, the annual cost of going to a general practitioner has fallen from about $940 a year on average to around $440 while for an older couple who on average paid about $780 year, the cost is now around $340 a year.

"These dramatic savings have only been achieved through the Labour-led Government's seven year, $2.2 billion investment in primary health care – an investment John Key and National promised to cut at the last election.

"The health of New Zealanders has never been better and the Labour-led government will continue our work to make it better still," Pete Hodgson says.
