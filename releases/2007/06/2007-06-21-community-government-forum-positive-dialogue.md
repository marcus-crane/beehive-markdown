The enthusiasm and commitment of community sector people to talk through issues of common concern at a forum with Government has been magnificent, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Laban is speaking at the conclusion of a two-day Community-Government Forum held in Wellington during Volunteer Awareness Week 2007. The gathering brought over 150 representatives from the community and voluntary sector together with Ministers to discuss common issues.

Representatives at the forum reflected the rich diversity of our society. Maori, Pacific, arts and culture, Asian and ethnic groups, sport and recreation, social services, philanthropy, education and religion were represented.

“The forum focused on a number of challenging issues, including contracting, relationships with government departments, funding efficiencies and ways to monitor and strengthen the relationship between Government and the sector,” said Laban.

“I’m thrilled that thirteen of my ministerial colleagues were able to sit down along side community people for a positive and frank discussion about issues of common concern.

“I’m certain that the Ministers went away better informed about the current issues relating to the community and voluntary sector.

“I am pleased that there was a willingness of the sector to work together at the forum to build on the successes of the past and find new ways forward.

“The community sector is hugely important to our Kiwi way of life. I value the opportunity to voice my appreciation directly to such a wide range of sector representatives and to hear first hand about some of the significant cross-cutting issues affecting their work.

“This Labour-led government is committed to building strong, sustainable and connected communities, and this week’s forum helped identify ways we can continue this commitment into the future,” said Laban.

The Community-Government Forum was organised by a steering group of community sector leaders.

“It was wonderful to see the sector and Government Ministers coming together for a positive dialogue. This Forum was a positive step forward,” said Dr. Diane Mara, Chair of the Community-Government Forum Steering Group.
