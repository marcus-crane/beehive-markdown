Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the appointments of a new Chair and two new members to the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand.

The new Chair is Alan Sorrell, an Auckland barrister with a practice specialising in media and entertainment, intellectual property and copyright.  
He has recently spent nine years as member and Chair of the New Zealand Film Commission.

The new members are: Penelope (Penny) Eames of Waikanae, Wellington, is owner/manager of an international arts consultancy and has extensive experience in developing arts policy and management, business processes and governance.

And Sid Ashton of Christchurch is currently Chair of the Christchurch Arts Festival and the Charities Commission. His former position as CEO of Te Runanga o Ngâi Tahu and his extensive governance activities will provide the Board with strong community knowledge and managerial skills.

All three have been appointed to the Board for three-year terms from 1 July this year to 30 June 2010.

“The impressive range of skills and experience of Alan Sorrell as Chair and the two new members will compensate for the retirement of three longstanding members of the Board. I am confident that Creative New Zealand will be well served by these appointments.”

Ms Tizard also acknowledged the major contributions made to the Board’s work by the outgoing members, Alastair Carruthers as Chair (now taking up the Chair position on the Creative New Zealand Council), Judith Fyfe and Graeme Gorton.

“Thanks to the skills and experience of these three members, the reputation and operation of the Arts Board is in excellent health.”

The Arts Board of Creative New Zealand promotes and supports the arts of all New Zealanders by developing art-form policy, allocating grants and carrying out initiatives that support the strategic direction set by the Arts Council.
