Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope today opened the consultation period for the [Out of School Services Five Year Action Plan](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/families-whanau/out-of-school-services.html).

"The Government is seeking the views of the public on the draft of the action plan, which aims to improve the supply of good quality and affordable out of school care for five to 13 year olds," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Action Plan for Out of School Services is one of the key areas of activity of [Choices for Living, Caring and Working](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/general/gen-choices-for-living.asp), a wider government strategy that provides parents and carers with choices about how to balance work and family commitments.

The Action Plan outlines the Government’s approach to improving Out of School Services. It has been drafted based on the feedback the Ministry of Social Development and the Families Commission received during consultation last year.

"The way New Zealanders live, work and raise families has changed enormously over the past generation and is continuing to change. Families are much more likely to combine work and parenting and we need to ensure they have access to the support and services they need, and children are well cared for in a safe and stimulating environment. Out of School Services are also important for employers – by providing support to parents it helps them access the employees they need," he said.

"The Action Plan does two things - it addresses the things parents, carers and providers say are the main issues for the sector right now, plus it has longer term proposals which we think will improve quality, and make Out of School Services more affordable and accessible for families," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"A strong Out of School sector gives parents more choice and contributes to the wellbeing of children and young people. Providing opportunities for children and young people to spend their out of school time in meaningful activities can have positive effects on their academic, social, emotional and physical well-being."

In Budget 2007 the Government announced an investment of $17.4 million in Out of School Services over the next five years. The money will be used to establish 12 activity-based out of school programmes (Extended Services), increase the pool of funding available to providers, enhance the approval process for providers, establish a Quality Review Group, and review how Government funds Out of School Services.

The consultation period lasts until 22 July. To see the plan and have your say please visit [www.msd.govt.nz](),"&gt;oss@msd.govt.nz
