The Education Minister, Steve Maharey and Manurewa MP, George Hawkins, have expressed their sorrow at the death of the former Labour Education Minister, Hon Phil Amos.

Steve Maharey said Hon Phil Amos was born in Wanganui, and was educated in Otorohanga and Auckland.

"He was a hard working member of the Labour party, who held many positions. He was a long serving MP for Manurewa (1963-75) and later he became the Minister of Education (1972–75) and Island Affairs (1972-74)."

Manurewa MP George Hawkins said Hon Phil Amos served his local community very well, he was a real enthusiast for education, and he got a lot of joy out of being Minister of Education.

Steve Maharey and George Hawkins extended their deepest sympathy to his family and loved ones.
