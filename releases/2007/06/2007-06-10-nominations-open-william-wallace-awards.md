Nominations are now open for the annual William Wallace Awards, which honour outstanding young people in care.

"Many young people who are not able to live with their own families have to overcome significant barriers to achieve excellence," says Ruth Dyson, Minister for Child, Youth and Family Services.

"The awards are a great way to celebrate these amazing young people and to support them to fulfil their potential through educational support, vocational training or opportunities to develop leadership.

"CYFS originally planned to give out four awards annually but the calibre of nominations was so high last year that eight awards will now be made each year."

A total of $20,000 is divided into the following awards: two $3000 awards for tertiary study, two $3000 awards for vocational study and four $2000 awards for leadership programmes.

"Caregivers, social workers and community representatives are encouraged to make nominations on behalf of young people," said Ruth Dyson.

The awards are open to any young person who is in the guardianship or custody of CYFS - this includes if they have been placed with a Child and Family support service, iwi, cultural or community based social service – and who is able to take up their award in 2008.

This is the second year the awards have been held. Included in last year’s winners were several young people who had overcome difficult backgrounds to achieve excellence in their school and community.

Nomination forms and more information on the William Wallace awards can be found at [www.cyf.govt.nz](http://www.cyf.govt.nz)  
Nominations close on August 10 and an award ceremony will be held in October during Foster Care Awareness Week.
