The latest figures from Statistics New Zealand show that research spending is growing, which is very positive for our science sector, says Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

The 'Research and Development Survey 2006' shows that total research and development (R&D) has increased 10 per cent since the last survey in 2004, to $1.8 billion.

"The figures show that private funding is increasing, but much more investment is needed to bring New Zealand businesses into line with other OECD countries, which have far higher levels of private R&D spending.

"The survey shows that businesses now finance 41 per cent of total R&D expenditure – a rise of 19 per cent. This is a positive sign, but more growth is needed.

"The Labour-led government aims to further improve that through a $630 million tax incentive for businesses to carry out their own research.

"Under the tax credit, businesses investing in R&D can earn a 15 per cent tax credit on that spending. For example, a company investing $100,000 in research would get $15,000 back in a tax rebate.

"The incentive will make New Zealand more internationally competitive, overseas companies will find it more attractive to invest in R&D here, and it will help our businesses be more innovative and successful.

"The survey shows the Labour-led government is still the largest funder of R&D providing $785 million, or 43 per cent of funding in 2006 – up 8 per cent on 2004."
