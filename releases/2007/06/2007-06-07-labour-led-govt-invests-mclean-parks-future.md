Prime Minister Helen Clark today visited McLean Park in Napier to announce that the Labour-led Government will contribute $2.9 million to the project to redevelop McLean Park.

The redevelopment includes the upgrade of lighting and other facilities to meet minimum criteria for international cricket and National Provincial Championship rugby, and the construction of the new Graeme Lowe stand.

The government funding comes from the contestable Significant Community Based Projects Fund.

“This major project upgrades McLean Park to 21st Century standards. This is important because McLean Park is the only venue in Hawkes Bay which can host major national and international cricket and rugby events," Helen Clark said.

“With the new Graeme Lowe Stand, upgraded lighting and upgrades to other facilities, McLean Park is future proofed well into the 21st Century.

"Support for the redevelopment has been strong in the region, with active participation and financial support from both the City and Regional Councils,” Helen Clark said.

The $32 million Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up by the Labour-led Government in 2005 to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

Grants in this financial year have already been awarded to:  
·Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (up to $6.5million)  
·Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust (up to $578,699).

Helen Clark said further announcements would be made over the coming week about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year.

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said that as a result of the high calibre of the applications received, the fund will be completely allocated this year, and no further funding rounds are planned at this time.

“As there have been high levels of community interest in the fund, Cabinet has asked me to monitor and report back on the level of demand for projects which would have been eligible to apply had the fund continued,” Rick Barker said.

“The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up at a time of falling lottery profits, which meant less funding was available to support capital projects. The recent increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits, however, means more funding is now available for allocation, and has allowed us to reintroduce the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

“The Lottery Community Facilities Fund will support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. Organisations considering applying should contact GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz or phone 0800 824 824,” Rick Barker said.
