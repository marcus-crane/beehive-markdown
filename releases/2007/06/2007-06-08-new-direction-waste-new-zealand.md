A new report released today shows the time is right for New Zealand to take a quantum leap forward in terms of how we manage our waste and so make an even greater contribution to environmental sustainability, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"[Targets in the New Zealand Waste Strategy 2006 Review of Progress](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/waste/waste-strategy-review-progress-mar07/index.html) shows good progress in recycling and landfill management since the Strategy was released in 2002," said Mr Benson-Pope. "But it also highlights New Zealand wide inconsistencies in the management of waste, and that responsibilities are not always assigned to the correct parties.

"What needs to be done is clear. We need to set ourselves more challenging waste targets, we need more consistency in our local approaches to waste management, we need better information about waste flows and we need to take a more collaborative approach between producers, local authorities, recyclers and consumers in the design of waste minimisation schemes.

"The review shows that we are still throwing away waste that could be recycled or reused, particularly construction, demolition and organic waste. Garden and food waste makes up more than 23 percent of the waste going to landfills.

"That is why the government is supporting a move to a more comprehensive product stewardship regime as part of the Waste Minimisation (Solids) Bill, currently before the Local Government and Environment Select Committee. It includes regulations to support [product stewardship schemes](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/sustainable-industry/initiatives/product-stewardship/index.html) and ensure that those producers who take a leadership role in this area are not undermined by those who won't.

Under product stewardship schemes, producers, brand owners, importers, retailers, consumers and other parties can take responsibility for the environmental effects of products – from the time they are produced until they are disposed of.

"Businesses know that becoming more sustainable creates economic opportunities while improving New Zealand's environment and our way of life," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Product stewardship schemes such as Resene's Paintwise which I launched yesterday, AgRecovery, Tyre Track, Fisher and Paykel Appliances, Vodafone and Telecom's and many others, play a huge role in minimising and managing waste in New Zealand.

"These schemes show that the wider community shares the government's goal of a sustainable New Zealand," said Mr Benson-Pope.
