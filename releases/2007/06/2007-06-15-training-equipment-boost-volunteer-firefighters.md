A new training initiative for volunteer firefighters and the roll-out of new appliances to many brigades throughout the country will ensure the nation’s thousands of volunteer firefighters get the best training and equipment possible, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today.

On the first day of National Volunteer Awareness Week, June 17-23, Rick Barker announced that a Volunteer Placement Programme has been established which will see volunteer firefighters working at career fire stations alongside their full-time equivalents.

“The Volunteer Placement Programme will see volunteers spending one to three days at a career fire station training and working around equipment and appliances of relevance to them in their role as firefighters,” said Rick Barker.

“A total of 18 fire stations are taking part, including Auckland City, Wellington, Nelson, and Dunedin.

“Of the 10,000 Fire Service firefighters in New Zealand, more than 7,000 are volunteers, and there is a wholesale commitment to supporting their professional development.

“The Volunteer Placement Programme builds upon existing initiatives to support and train our volunteers. The Training and Progression System is a robust and systematic training programme for volunteers, and the recently opened National Training Centre is well utilised by volunteers,” said Rick Barker.

Rick Barker also announced the development of a range of new vehicles for volunteer fire brigades.

“The replacement of mid-sized appliances, which is well underway, is to be enhanced by the introduction of new operational light response vehicles (LRV) to some volunteer brigades. Also being developed is a new design of smaller fire appliances for volunteer stations, and developing water tanker designs for volunteer brigades.

“Overall, over 30 new vehicles a year will be supplied to volunteer brigades across New Zealand, at a cost of $10million a year.

“Volunteer firefighters provide their communities with countless hours of hard work and dedication without monetary reward. They are there for their communities and it’s important we provide them with the best training and the best resources we can,” said Rick Barker.
