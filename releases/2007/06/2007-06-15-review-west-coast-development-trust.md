Members of the West Coast Development Trust have met with Finance Minister Michael Cullen and agreed to changes to the trust deed.

The changes follow a review of the trust carried out by Treasury five years after the trust was established.

"I am pleased with the performance of the trust and its work in driving economic development on the West Coast," said Dr Cullen.

"It is satisfying that the initial capital of the trust has grown from $92 million to $120 million in the six years it has been operating. This shows it has been a prudent manager of the fund which will underpin its work in the years ahead.

"The main changes agreed are designed to improve governance of the trust while continuing to ensure a broad representation of interests. Six trustees will replace the current 12, with one trustee to be appointed by the four West Coast councils (currently four). Of the six trustees, three will be elected, one for each of the three West Coast districts (currently two for each district).

"One trustee will remain the representative of tangata whenua and an independent trustee will continue to be appointed.

"The changes will take place at the time of the council elections this year.

"West Coasters should appreciate the work the members of the trust have carried out on their behalf, both in wisely managing the fund and in continuing to examine opportunities for the future development of the region.

"I hope the local councils and the trust can work positively together for the future good of the region in the years ahead," Dr Cullen concluded.
