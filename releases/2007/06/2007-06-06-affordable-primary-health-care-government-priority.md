Extra money is being offered Primary Health Organisation practices that maintain very low fees for their patients, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

“This is an area of priority for this Government and I am interested in additional opportunities to further support low cost, high quality primary care,’’ Pete Hodgson says.

Since last October PHO practices that agreed to maintain very low fees received additional funding. From July 1 this year that top-up will increase from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent.

The Very Low Cost Access Initiative currently involves 23 per cent of PHO practices and benefits over 900,000 people, many of whom have high needs. In 2007/08 a total of $18.72 million will be available for practices already involved in this initiative and more practices are welcome to join, Pete Hodgson says.

“The additional money will help practices retain staff and continue to provide quality, affordable services to their mainly high needs populations.”

Where all the practices in a PHO are offering very low cost access, then that PHO receives a similar increase in its funding for Services to Improve Access under which PHOs offer such things as outreach services to make sure everyone can access quality primary healthcare.

“The latest increase in Very Low Cost Access payments demonstrates this Government’s ongoing commitment to making primary health care affordable for all families,’’ Pete Hodgson says.

From July 1, a major milestone will be reached when the final stage of the Government’s $2.2 billion funding roll out for the Primary Health Care Strategy will see 25-44 year-olds benefit from reduced fees for doctor visits and prescription charges. Cheaper fees are already in place for other age groups.

Standard consultation fees charged by very low cost access practices will remain very low at $15.50 for adults 18 years and over, $10.50 for children 6-17 years and remain zero for children under 6. Further funding announcements in the primary healthcare area can be anticipated later this calendar year.
