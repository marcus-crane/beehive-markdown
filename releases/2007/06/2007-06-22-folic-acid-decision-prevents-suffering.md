Food Safety Minister Annette King says today’s joint New Zealand and Australian decision to go ahead with mandatory fortification of bread with folic acid is a triumph for humanity and common sense.  
Ms King says although a joint decision has been taken, New Zealand and Australia will be proceeding with mandatory fortification in different ways.  
“Australia will achieve fortified bread through fortifying the flour directly, while in New Zealand, fortification will be achieved through adding the folic acid during the bread-making process, rather than directly to the flour” she said.  
“New Zealand women do not get enough natural folate in the diet to prevent a large number of babies being born with devastating neural tube defects, the most common of which are spina bifida and hydrocephalus.  
“While fortification alone won’t provide the recommended amount of folic acid that should be taken before and during pregnancy, it will be enough to make a difference. However, folic acid supplements are recommended for women planning a pregnancy to reduce the numbers of children with neural tube defects born in this country.” In New Zealand the reduction expected in NTD affected pregnancies is four to14 per year.  
For those who have a philosophical objection to fortification, organic and non-yeast leavened breads are exempt from mandatory fortification.  
“We promised that New Zealanders will have a choice, and we have delivered on that promise, but I urge all women considering a diet low in folate or folic acid to consult their doctor about the risks and consequences. While neither fortification nor supplements will reduce the risk by 100 percent there is evidence to suggest that this risk can be reduced by about 70 percent if folic acid intake is increased.”  
Ms King said that in New Zealand fortification of bread at levels of 80 to 180 micrograms of folic acid per 100g of bread will occur in the bread-making process and will be mandatory two years after the standard is gazetted. Bakers can commence fortification any time after gazettal.  
Dietary modelling studies have shown that this will increase folic acid intake in New Zealand women by 140 micrograms of folic acid a day, she said. “This is still below the 400 microgram daily intake recommended by the Ministry of Health for women in the four weeks before and first twelve weeks of their pregnancy, and all pregnant women should ask their doctor about the right folic acid supplement for them.”  
Ms King said it had also been agreed that a comprehensive and independent review of mandatory fortification with folic acid will be initiated two years after implementation of the standard. The review will consider health impacts and the effectiveness of the initiative, the actual cost impacts on the industry and the adequacy of the monitoring framework.
