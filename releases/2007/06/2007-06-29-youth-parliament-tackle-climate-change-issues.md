"Young people have strong views about looking after our planet for the benefit of future generations so I look forward to their debate on climate change at next month’s [Youth Parliament](http://www.myd.govt.nz/ayv/youthparliament/youthparliament.aspx)," says Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Youth MPs have chosen to debate legislation on how to reduce New Zealand's ecological footprint.

"The [draft climate change legislation](http://www.myd.govt.nz/uploads/docs/Climate%20Change%20bill%20-%20report%20to%20cabinet.pdf) proposes the set up of household carbon accounts and a system of tax incentives for households that reduce their total carbon emissions and convert to low emissions technology.

"This will give the Youth MPs an opportunity to tackle a complex problem and to vote on whether to make it law, just as MPs do," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Youth Development Ministry consulted with government departments and youth organisations, and received nearly one thousand submissions from young people, on topics for the Youth MPs to debate during Youth Parliament 2007. The Youth MPs then voted on the topics using the STV (single transferable vote) process.

"The Youth MPs will also sit on a Select Committee which will examine one of the key topics they've selected in some depth. They’ll hear submissions by government officials, interested stakeholders and other young people. Each Select Committee will then write a report to be tabled during Youth Parliament 2007. I'll also table the reports in Parliament so that every MP is aware of their recommendations.

"Topics for debate include foreign aid to the Pacific, student loans system, youth gangs and offending, youth tax rates, cloning, party pills, and NCEA.

"These Youth MPs have set themselves an impressive agenda, they’ve identified key issues that affect both themselves and our country today, and they’re going to debate these issues with passion and rigour, and present some fresh ideas and new approaches."

The Minister says the Youth MPs will get a good understanding of how the decision-making process works and how they can influence that process. They will have their voices heard as they work with government departments and MPs through debating legislation, general debates and the select committee topics.

The ten members of the Youth Press Gallery will also be reporting on the issues and outcomes of Youth Parliament.

"These young people are our future leaders and decision-makers for this country and this planet. We need to listen to their voices," says Nanaia Mahuta.
