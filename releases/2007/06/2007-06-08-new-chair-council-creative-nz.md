Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark today announced that Alastair Carruthers has been appointed as the new chair of the Council of Creative New Zealand.

Mr Carruthers has been appointed for a three-year term from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010.

Helen Clark acknowledged the contribution and commitment Mr Carruthers had made in his current position as Chair of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand, and welcomed his acceptance of a broader role in the development and promotion of the arts in New Zealand.

“As Chair of the Arts Board, Alastair Carruthers has played a big role in nurturing and fostering the arts in New Zealand.

“I look forward to having his governance skills and experience at the helm of the Council of Creative New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

The purpose of Creative New Zealand is to encourage, promote, and support the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The Council is responsible for overall policy development and is the “public face” of the organisation. It guides the development of Creative New Zealand’s three-year Strategic Plan, and determines the division of funding between the two arts boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi.
