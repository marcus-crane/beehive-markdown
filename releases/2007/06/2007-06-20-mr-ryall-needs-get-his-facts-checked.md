Key goals of the Get Checked diabetes programme are being achieved despite mischief-making by National’s health spokesman, Health Minister Pete Hodgson says.

It was obvious by his claims that Mr Ryall had not bothered to read the report.

“The report into Get Checked found the numbers of people participating in the programme have increased, awareness of diabetes has heightened and monitoring of patients has improved,” Pete Hodgson says.

“Guidance provided to doctors on treatment for diabetes and referrals to specialist services has improved while innovative programmes to improve access to diabetes care, particularly for Maori and Pacific people, are being used.

“The last is a key goal of Get Checked, given that Maori and Pacific people are disproportionately represented among ethnic groups being affected by diabetes,” Pete Hodgson says.

Far from not having data on who is accessing Get Checked, 79,993 people accessed the programme last year and every District Health Board has exact numbers by ethnicity of who has been through Get Checked, the Minister said.

“Mr Ryall’s claims are yet another indictment of his lack of understanding of the health sector,” Pete Hodgson says.

“He needs to write a health policy for the National Party urgently. Last week he told a conference of GPs that he did not think a population approach to health was the way forward.

“However this week, he is critical that a population approach to diabetes is not going fast enough. Flip flopping in the course of just one week will not do.”

The Minister warmly welcomed the recommendations of the Auditor General, some of which are already being implemented, because they will further improve diabetes management.
