Kia Ora, Talofa Lava, Malo e lelei, Fakalofa lahi atu, Namo, Ni sambula, Kia Orana and warm Pacific greetings from the peoples of the Pacific.

I have been asked on behalf of all Ministers and delegates attending this 8WAMM to extend the vote of thanks, and it is my honour to do so, in particular on behalf of the Pacific region who hosted the 7WAMM in Fiji.

First I would like to thank H.E. Yoweri Musevini, President of the Republic of Uganda, the First Lady, Janet Musevini, and the people of Uganda for hosting this Ministerial Meeting. Thank you for your warm and gracious hospitality.

I would also like to mention the Hon Syda Bbumba, Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development for the Republic of Uganda, the National Organising Committee and all those involved in the huge logistical task to prepare for this 8WAMM.

Finally but not least, a special thanks to Don McKinnon, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and your team for the organisation, hard work and commitment to bring us together to discuss important issues facing women and working towards the advancement and empowerment of all women in the Commonwealth.

It is with high expectation President Museveni, that the communique from this meeting, in particular those issues affecting women in the Commonwealth, are advanced by you as host to the next CHOGM to be held here later this year.

The strongest message to your fellow Heads of State is that leadership on gender equality must commit to the Plan of Action that must only gather momentum.

As you know Mr President, "actions speak louder than words". We must act now if we are to truly empower and transform the lives of the women and children. It is a fundamental right and responsibility of good governance not a mere favour. Transforming lives begins at home and can make a real difference to our society.

Once again Mr President we thank you for opening this Meeting and anticipate leadership from our collective effort.

Teenaa Koutou Katoa, Asantesana.
