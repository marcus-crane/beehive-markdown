Police Minister Annette King has requested independent expert advice on the testing and assessment of people who apply to join the police, of recruits and of probationary constables.

“I am pleased that Dr Dave George, an organisational psychologist with more than 20 years’ experience in the field, has agreed this morning to provide me with that advice as soon as possible,” she said. Dr George is a partner at Cerno, a Wellington-based practice whose clients include leading businesses, government departments and multi-nationals.

Ms King says she has requested the advice because of public debate over the standard of people entering the Royal New Zealand Police College and graduating from it.

“Over the past 18 months, since I became Police Minister, I have regularly received verbal assurances and updates from the police administration that the standard of police graduating from the college is being maintained,” she said.

“Trends in recent years have shown significant improvement in police retention, with turnover at a 10-year low. Such stability should give the public confidence in the professionalism of our police service.

“However, in the past few days public issues have been raised that have the potential to undermine public confidence in the police,” she said.

“This is the last thing that I want, and it is the last thing either the police administration or serving police want as well. I also believe it is the last thing the public wants, because New Zealanders deserve to have confidence in the police.”

Ms King said she is disappointed that there has been “ill-informed and perhaps mischievous” criticism linking changes in academic standards for recruits to the Government’s drive, in line with its confidence and supply agreement with New Zealand First, to add 1000 more sworn police over three years.

“Such criticism and allegations are incorrect. The standard tests were changed in November 2004, more than a year before the confidence and supply agreement was reached and formalised in December 2005. There is clearly no link between the two, and such insinuations represent an unwarranted attack on police.”
