Foreign Minister Winston Peters is calling on Fiji’s interim government to respond positively to an independent assessment that elections could be held as early as November next year.

The assessment, released today, was made by a Joint Working Group appointed by Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers in Vanuatu two months ago. The group included a representative of the Fijian administration.

”We shall be watching the interim government's response closely. If it reacts positively to the recommendations, there is ample time to prepare for, and conduct, free and fair elections in Fiji by the end of next year," Mr Peters said.

“I would like to see Fiji nominate a date for an election now, and back that up with practical measures such as appointing a credible Supervisor of Elections.

“The Elections Office should also be returned to full capacity and strengthened to ensure that November 2008 objective is attained.

“The report makes sensible recommendations for rapidly moving ahead with a redistribution of electoral boundaries, following the census to be undertaken in September. It also proposes updating the register of voters, and holding voter education programmes.

“The Joint Working Group is also calling for urgent appointments to the Constituency Boundaries Commission, the Electoral Commission, and the Supervisor of Elections to ensure that the proper infrastructure is in place.”

Mr Peters said the independent assessors had also considered the resources required for holding elections in Fiji, and the amount of external assistance that might be necessary to ensure the timetable was met.

“Depending on Fiji’s response, this assessment will help New Zealand and others in considering how best we might assist the election process.

“I am most appreciative of the very useful work done by the members of the Joint Working Group in a relatively short period of time,” Mr Peters said.
