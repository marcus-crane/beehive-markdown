The Government is to fund, from July, qualified overseas trained doctors to complete their medical registration in New Zealand, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

Each year around 30 overseas trained doctors who become registered in New Zealand come from countries with health systems that are not identical to ours. These doctors, who have sat a registration examination, then spend a supervised intern year in a New Zealand hospital before they get full registration.

Mr O'Connor, who is also Rural Affairs Minister, said the Labour-led Government is to invest around $900,000 annually to support this intern year, which will ensure these doctors are better prepared for clinical practice in New Zealand.

"While the Government appreciates that many young New Zealand health professionals travel overseas to get further training, we also rely on foreign-trained doctors, especially in rural and provincial areas.

"Once these doctors are ready to practice in New Zealand they offer a valuable service to our communities, particularly in rural areas where they are very well received."

"We want to ensure they are assisted with this intern year – and that they become work-ready as soon as possible. This funding will remove barriers that stand in the way of well-trained people joining our health workforce."

All New Zealand trained doctors have an intern year after university. During this year, the recent medical graduates receive further supervised clinical training and are provisionally registered with the Medical Council.

On successful completion of the year they gain full registration with the Medical Council. Training and supervision in this intern year is funded by the Clinical Training Agency and costs $32,190 (GST excl) per trainee.

Currently there is no funding for the intern year for this group of overseas doctors who have passed their registration examination, Mr O'Connor said.

Mr O'Connor said that while the proportion of overseas-trained rural and provincial doctors was high historically, there were a number of initiatives underway to encourage and support New Zealand-trained health professionals to work in rural areas.

These include:

- Funding for rural GP training, including 10 rural scholarships to medical school and 20 rural rotations for trainee doctors.
- Funding for the University of Otago to develop a curriculum for a Rural Medical Immersion Programme.
- From February 2008, up to 20 fifth-year medical students from Auckland University will have the opportunity to spend a year working and studying at Whangarei Hospital and smaller hospitals in Northland.
- Rural bonus and rural premium funding – to support the rural health workforce.
- Six rural nurses awarded scholarships to complete their Masters programme and register as Nurse Practitioners with prescribing competencies. A number of other postgraduate scholarships have been awarded to primary health care nurses working with rural populations.
- Two new funding schemes for midwives practicing in remote and rural areas.
- The Mobil Surgical Bus, which supports rural health professional development.
