The Education Minister, Steve Maharey, has announced the latest phase of the Mission On campaign, which requires schools to promote healthy food and nutrition for students, and sell only healthy options in schools.

"The Labour-led government is investing $67 million over four years in a range of Mission On initiatives to target obesity and promote healthy, confident young people.

"The changes to the National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) ask schools to review their current practice, and offer certain food and drinks either everyday, sometimes or occasionally.

"It's up to schools how they address the NAGs. This change does not do away with traditional barbecues, sausage sizzles or selling chocolate for fundraising, it merely requires schools to look at what they provide and make practical decisions about offering healthy options as well.

"The change to the NAGs is not about banning particular food and drinks, but for example, schools could consider selling pies or sausage rolls occasionally, and sandwiches and fruit every day. Schools have the flexibility to implement the guidelines to suit the needs of their students.

"Representatives from the school and early childhood education sectors were consulted on the changes to the NAGs, in a national hui in November and in subsequent regional meetings.

"A third of our children's daily food intake is consumed at school, making it the ideal place to promote healthy, active lifestyles. Getting this message across to children early helps create lifelong habits of eating well and being healthy."

The changes to the National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) will take effect from 1 June 2008. The Ministry of Health's Food and Beverage Classification (to be announced shortly) will help schools make sensible decisions.

Schools will tell the Education Review Office (ERO) how they're implementing the NAG changes as part of their regular review process.

This announcement complements the 'Food and Nutrition Guidelines' distributed to schools in March. A toolkit was also sent to all schools, including advice on how to apply to the $12 million Nutrition Fund to support Mission On activities in schools.
