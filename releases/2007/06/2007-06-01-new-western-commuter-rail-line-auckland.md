The Labour-led Government's historic investment in public transport is already delivering results for commuters and making it easier for New Zealanders to use environmentally-friendly transport, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark drove in the last spike for the first stage of the new double-tracked commuter rail in West Auckland at a commissioning ceremony today. The double-tracking work covered 7.5 kilometres between Titirangi and Henderson.

From the beginning of July, train services are expected to run every fifteen minutes during peak hours between Britomart in central Auckland, and Henderson.

“The completion of this double tracking is a significant achievement in the Labour-led Government's work to provide more efficient and reliable public transport services. As well, it’s important for putting New Zealand on the world map as a nation which cares about sustainability and is tackling greenhouse gas emissions through a commitment to more energy efficient public transport

“The Labour-led Government has invested heavily in public transport since coming into office in 1999. At that time, spending on public transport totalled $45 million. In the next financial year alone, we expect to spend close to $500 million on public transport nationwide – around ten times as much as National had bothered investing a few short years ago.

"The new double-tracked section is part of the $600 million Project DART announced by the Labour-led Government in Budget 2006. It includes double tracking on the Western Line, the redevelopment of Newmarket Station, and improved linking of Manukau City to the rail network.

"The improvements being carried out also enable an easy transition to electrification. In Budget 2007, the government announced a $500 million commitment to help electrify Auckland's urban rail passenger network," Helen Clark said.
