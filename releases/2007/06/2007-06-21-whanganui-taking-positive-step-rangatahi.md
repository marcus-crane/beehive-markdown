"It's encouraging to see that Whanganui is taking a positive step to engage in issues concerning rangatahi, their well-being and positive development in their community," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

At the first Mayoral/ Iwi Taskforce meeting in Whanganui between Council and Iwi representatives today, it was agreed that tamariki and rangatahi are to be central to future discussions and initiatives.

"A number of communities know that they have the capacity and commitment to work together at a local level and make a real difference. The fact that tamariki and rangatahi are being put at the centre of the decision-making and solutions process is one that requires leadership. This response will encourage rangatahi to participate and to make positive choices in their lives.

"I understand that this first meeting agreed to establish a taskforce to focus on youth well-being, and to create positive alternatives to gang involvement,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The taskforce will carry out a local survey and further research to assess the needs of rangatahi. It will also help co-ordinate the creation of positive strategies and initiatives for rangatahi.

"These clear objectives will advance discussions more proactively than simply focusing on the 'problem'. The next step is to ensure that rangatahi are engaged and participating in the discussions. It’s often very important for the voice of rangatahi to be heard and taken into account - and you can learn a great deal if you ask for their feedback.

"I look forward to tracking progress on these discussions to advance opportunities for rangatahi," says Nanaia Mahuta.
