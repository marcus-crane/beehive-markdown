The National Party’s rural issues discussion paper shows the party is still out of touch with New Zealand’s primary sector and trying to catchup to where the Labour-Progressive Government is already, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He said the document, published yesterday, contained the usual lip-service to the importance of primary sector industries to New Zealand but failed to contain anything that would positively benefit those industries.

“Instead, it’s full of discredited ideas that either don’t make sense or contradict other parts of the document – such as confirming that the National Party intends to sell off all Landcorp’s farms, while at the same time professing to be concerned about training for farmers and ignoring the huge contribution to the industry Landcorp makes in training. Or privatising accident compensation insurance, which does not mean cheaper levies and could see farmers left without cover when an insurance company fails – both of which happen in Australia. This is straight out of the Max Bradford ‘power prices will come down with competition’ book.

“One of National’s ‘proposals’ is to ‘invest in infrastructure, including roading, communications and energy’. National’s track record on infrastructure speaks for itself, and we have had to make enormous investments to catch up to first world standards. You see, National always talks about keeping costs and taxes low, which they know is what people want to hear, and in the next breath they talk about investing more into everything. They can’t have it both ways, and neither can New Zealand.”

He said the document was factually inaccurate when it described horticulture as “a billion dollar industry”. It is in fact a $4 billion industry.

“When launching the issues paper, John Key described agriculture as being responsible for half New Zealand’s carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, it is responsible for half New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly nitrous oxide and methane, rather than carbon dioxide.”

Mr Anderton said the paper did propose some sensible measures, but the Labour-Progressive government had either put them in place already or was currently working on doing so. These included improvements around water allocation for irrigation and immigration initiatives for seasonal workers.

“Once again, the National Party is clearly demonstrating that it is a follower rather than a leader where policy innovation is concerned.

“The National Party clearly has a strategy of hugging the Government to death, which would be a compliment if this was sincere rather than the deceptive tactics of the hollow men of New Zealand politics.”
