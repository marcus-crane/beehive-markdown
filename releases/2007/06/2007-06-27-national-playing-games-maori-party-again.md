Reports National will not support Tariana Turia's foreshore and seabed repeal bill after months of stringing her along should be a wake-up call for the Mâori Party, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

The issue was the Mâori Party's raison d'etre and it told Mâori voters before the last election it would repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act.

The party needs National's support, but it has continually flip-flopped on whether it would support Mrs Turia's bill, saying it might one week and it won't the next.

After Gordon Copeland donated his votes on legislation to National  
a spokesman for John Key was reported saying last week, when asked about National's support for Mrs Turia's bill, \`\`you never say never.''

Today the Independent Financial Review reports that Mr Key will not support the bill – although it appears Mr Key wouldn't allow himself to be quoted saying this, Mr Horomia said.

"National should come clean with the Mâori Party and the public, stop being duplicitous and admit it has no intention of supporting Mrs Turia's bill," Mr Horomia said.

"It is clear the party is simply playing with the Mâori Party in order to win its votes in the House. This is no surprise to Labour, which has seen National use Mâori as a political football year after year.

"Mr Key is simply playing a new version of an old National game and it's time the Mâori Party accepted that while it has a new leader, National hasn't changed its spots," Mr Horomia said.

"It was after all National that used the ugly and divisive "Iwi vs Kiwi" billboards to claim Labour's foreshore legislation did too much for iwi. What did the Mâori Party expect?"
