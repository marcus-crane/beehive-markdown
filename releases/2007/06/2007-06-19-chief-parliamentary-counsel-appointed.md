Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the appointment of David Noble as Chief Parliamentary Counsel and Compiler of Statutes. He will take up the position in October 2007.

The Chief Parliamentary Counsel is also the Chief Executive and professional leader of the Parliamentary Counsel Office. The Parliamentary Counsel Office is New Zealand's law drafting office; it is responsible for drafting and publishing most New Zealand legislation.

Mr Noble is currently the Legal Director/Chief Legal Adviser in the Department for Education and Skills in London, a position he has held since November 2004. He is the head of the Legal Department which is responsible for providing advice and legislative drafting services primarily on education matters and children’s services to policy advisers and Ministers. He is also indirectly responsible for the provision of litigation services to the Department.

Mr Noble is also currently a Director within the Treasury Solicitor’s Department and is a member of the Executive Board, and Audit and Pay Committees. He is the Chair of the Client Care Programme Board.

Mr Noble was called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1981. He has a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) and a Master of Social Sciences in Urban and Regional Studies (Distinction).

“David Noble is a very experienced lawyer and manager of legal staff including those responsible for drafting legislation. He has worked successfully in the Civil Service in the United Kingdom for 20 years and in the European Commission.

"He has extensive experience in working for Ministers and also has experience working in local government, private practice and as an academic,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said that until David Noble takes up his position in October, Ian Jamieson will be appointed as Chief Parliamentary Counsel and Compiler of Statutes from 1 July 2007, when the current Chief Parliamentary Counsel and Compiler of Statutes, Mr George Tanner, QC, retires.

Ian Jamieson is currently the Deputy Chief Parliamentary Counsel (Drafting), a position he has held since 2002. He is responsible for managing the drafting  
team leaders, for drafting legislation, and for coordinating the training of new Parliamentary Counsel.

Mr Jamieson joined the New Zealand public service in 1976 and has worked as a solicitor in the Department of Labour, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Defence.

He first joined the Parliamentary Counsel Office in April 1988 and worked as a Parliamentary Counsel until 1995. From 1995 to 2002 Mr Jamieson worked in private practice on legislative advisory work for government agencies and as a consultant to the Parliamentary Counsel Office.
