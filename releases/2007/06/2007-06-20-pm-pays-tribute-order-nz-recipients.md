Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to the 50 recipients of the Order of New Zealand since its inception in 1987.

Helen Clark attended a dinner at Government House in Wellington to celebrate the Order of New Zealand's twentieth anniversary.

The Order comprises Queen Elizabeth II, twenty ordinary members at any one time, and additional or honorary members as appropriate. It was instituted by Royal Warrant, on 6 February 1987, to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity.

"The Order of New Zealand is the highest award our country can bestow. It recognises citizens whose contribution has been truly outstanding," Helen Clark said.

"The Order has been enriched by the calibre of those to whom it has been awarded. The Order's standing is also testimony to the foresight of those who in the 1980s saw the need for a uniquely New Zealand honour at the highest level.

"There have been a total of fifty appointments to the Order of New Zealand. The five foundation members in 1987 were Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, Dr Clarence Beeby, Sonja Davies, Sir Edmund Hillary, and the Honourable Sir Arnold Nordmeyer. Of these, only Sir Edmund survives, and his accomplishments continue to inspire New Zealanders," Helen Clark said.
