National MP Simon Power's allegations that the Corrections Department misled the Ombudsman have been rubbished by an independent investigation, Corrections minister Damien O'Connor said today.

Mr Power told the New Zealand public yesterday that the Department of Corrections had deliberately misled and deceived the Ombudsman over its intention to upgrade its fleet of prisoner transport vehicles. The Office of the Ombudsman's report into prisoner transport was made public on Tuesday.

"I was very concerned about this most serious allegation and yesterday afternoon I asked State Services Commissioner Mark Prebble to investigate this claim," Mr O'Connor said.

"Mr Prebble subsequently spoke to the Ombudsmen who wrote the report, and they made it clear they do not consider they were misled.

"A letter from Mr Prebble, dated today, which I have tabled in the House says: 'I have now spoken with both John Belgrave and Mel Smith. They have told me that they do not consider that they have been misled by Corrections.

"The letter goes on to say: 'There is no basis for saying that Corrections has misled the Ombudsmen on these issues. Accordingly, I see no basis to undertake further inquiry into these matters.'"

Mr O'Connor said this latest wild allegation is par for the course for Mr Power.

"Last month he told the House that prisoners were being made to work for free on a Corrections Officer's 11-metre yacht he dubbed HMS Corrections.

"While the investigation is nearing completion, I have been informed that the yacht is not a 11-metre yacht, but a barely seaworthy 13-foot plywood dinghy being repaired in a prison workshop for use by local Seas Scouts.

"Mr Power has an unfortunate habit of getting things wrong. These are just the latest examples."
