A Ministerial panel is to be established to explore how to manage deer, chamois, tahr and pigs in a way that improves the conservation of native habitats but also recognises the importance of the four species to recreational hunters.

The panel has been established as part of the Labour-led Government's confidence and supply agreement with United Future.

"Deer, chamois, tahr and pigs are a recreational hunting resource for many New Zealanders," Conservation Minister Chris Carter said.

"Unfortunately, these animals also have a significant impact on many of New Zealand's fragile native habitats. Debate about how to manage these impacts while preserving recreational hunting opportunities has raged for fifty years.

"The aim of this panel is to lay to rest some of that controversy, and provide an opportunity for interested parties to reach agreement around the future management of these species. I believe this is a valuable initiative and I congratulate United Future on pushing for it," Mr Carter said.

The panel will be chaired by former Science Minister, the Hon Margaret Austin. It will comprise Sue Maturin of Forest and Bird, Graeme Nugent of Landcare Research, Hugh Barr of the NZ Deerstalkers Association, and Garry Ottmann of Game and Forest.

"This panel is a significant step in bridging the gap between conservationists and the hunting fraternity while also coming up with a workable management system that will benefit everyone," United Future leader Peter Dunne said.

"Many hunters are also conservationists. This fact has been lost in the vigorous argument that has surrounded the management of these four species and their environmental impacts.

"United Future believes consultation and rational discussion can achieve a future management situation that balances the recreational and economic importance of deer, chamois, tahr and pigs with the imperative to preserve New Zealand's natural heritage. I look forward to the panel's report."

Terms of Reference

The Panel will attempt to establish the concerns of interest groups including Tangata Whenua, and the extent to which agreement can be reached on:

·The options to manage the numbers of deer, chamois, tahr and pigs consistent with:  
§the conservation of indigenous biodiversity,  
§the biosecurity requirements of New Zealand,  
§the recreational, food and trophy value of those species,  
§the health and profitability of exotic plantation forests, and  
§ancillary considerations, including both farming and tourism requirements and opportunities  
·The legislative and policy changes associated with each option  
·The costs associated with each option and how should these costs be funded

Process

The Panel will hold working meetings in Wellington. It will meet on an “as needs” basis at regular intervals. This is expected to involve five or six one or two day meetings.

There will be two components to the consultation process.

Firstly, the Panel will prepare a discussion document that identifies key issues and submissions will be sought from the public.

Secondly, the Panel will consider the submissions it receives, hold hearings with key stakeholders and prepare a report for the Minister of Conservation that identifies how these issues can be addressed within an appropriate planning and management framework.

Individual members of the Panel will be free to put up any paper for the Panel to consider or provide other input they feel appropriate.

The Department of Conservation will arrange for secretarial and other services to enable the Panel to carry out its functions, and assist the Panel to prepare its discussion document and report to the Minister of Conservation.

The Department of Conservation will provide the Panel with policy, operational, scientific or legal advice as the need arises. Landcare Research is also available to provide scientific advice.

Members of the Panel are expected to work co-operatively, to look for points of agreement between differing views, and to help construct a report and recommendations that can be accepted by the Panel as a whole.

Members of the Panel have been appointed for their background and experience relating to this issue, rather than as advocates for particular interests. They are free, however, to put forward the views of interest groups for discussion. Where the Panel cannot reach agreement, it must record the options for consideration by the Minister.

The Minister of Conservation reserves the right to disband the Panel or change its membership at any stage in the process.

The Report

The Panel will report back to the Minister of Conservation by December 2007.

The report will:

·Summarise public submissions received  
·Record the level of agreement on each of the issues listed in the terms of reference  
·Record areas of disagreement and recommend possible solutions  
·Provide recommendations on how the issues listed in the terms of reference can be addressed within an appropriate planning and management framework.
