"It's great to see young people expressing their ideas through drama, dance and music and that's what Stage Challenge in Hamilton is all about," says Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Ministry of Youth Development is proud to support this event by sponsoring the Award of Excellence for Environmental or Social Awareness. I know that young people have strong views on 'planet earth' and looking after it for the benefit of future generations”.

Each school entering this category needs to demonstrate the relevance of the theme, New Zealand's youth culture, and how they express that to the audience. Every aspect of the performance is considered from an 'environmentally friendly' perspective.

"Congratulations to all participating schools - in particular the first place getters Huntly College, Melville High School who were second, and Kaitaia High School who were third, for their performances.

Congratulations also to Maeroa Intermediate who won the Environmental /Social Excellence Awareness Award and demonstrated an engaging level of creativity, energy and vibrancy for important and challenging issues,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

All students involved in Stage Challenge have committed to being alcohol, drug and smoke-free, and are encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

"Stage Challenge is a positive outlet for young people and I certainly look forward to continued support for this initiative.

“Each year Stage Challenge is held throughout the country and young people get a chance to express their creative talent. I really like the diversity and cultural expression blended with pop culture,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
