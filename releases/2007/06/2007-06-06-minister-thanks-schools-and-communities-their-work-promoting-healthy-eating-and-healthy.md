The staff students and community of Mansell Senior School in Papakura should be thanked for their positive health outlook, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

During a visit to the school Pete Hodgson thanked present students and encouraged them to keep up the high profile, which their school had gained during the WHO Regional Health Ministers, meeting in Auckland in 2006. At that time students from their school met with Health Ministers from the Western Pacific Region to show them their solutions for the rising epidemic of obesity and lowered physical activity.

"I would like to recognise the personal effort involved and thank our students, their teachers and their wider school communities for the tremendous momentum gained in the fight against obesity and inactivity. Our Labour-led government contributed $76 million in Budget 2006, and a further $50.7 million in Budget 2007 towards the campaign; but this is where we will change a future generation's attitudes,

"Last year was a real eye-opener for me when I met young people who were prepared to change their lives and that of their parents. That is real leadership and I am very pleased to have you on my health team," Pete Hodgson said.

"No one strategy will reverse the rising epidemic of obesity and inactivity amongst us, and no one agency will have all the answers. The answers will come from individuals, families, communities, schools, businesses and local and central agencies working together. The solutions will go beyond party politics. " Pete Hodgson said.
