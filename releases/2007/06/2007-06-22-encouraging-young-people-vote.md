"More can be done to encourage young people to vote and if debating the voting age is an opportunity to consider that issue, and how young people can learn and engage in the democratic process, then I welcome the debate," says Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The comments were made in response to Sue Bradford's proposal to lower the voting age to 16 and to add civics education to the school curriculum. The draft bill will go into the next private members bill ballot.

"Any measures that encourage young people to vote and to participate in community, local and national elections should be considered," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"Initiatives like online voting, which I trialled to select my Youth MP, and the successful 'Kids Voting' scheme which has been running in Auckland schools and was launched in Hamilton this week, help raise awareness among young people about New Zealand's electoral system and their role as voters.

"There are many more young New Zealanders who would benefit from participating on their marae committee, church youth group or youth organisation. We need to encourage their participation and to then listen to the positive voices of young people," says Nanaia Mahuta.

¡§Initiatives like Youth Parliament, which sits next month, provide an important opportunity for Youth MPs to understand and experience the parliamentary decision-making process. It gives them the chance to express their views to each other, politicians, government officials and the public," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The 121 Youth MPs from around the country sit in Parliament over 4 days to debate legislation and to take an in depth look at current issues. The Minister will table their reports in Parliament so that all MPs can consider their views.

"Young people make up 1 in 5 of our population and they are our future leaders. It's important that they are encouraged to contribute to decisions that affect their communities and the country, and to vote in local and central government elections."

¡§The Youth Development Ministry plays an important role in encouraging and promoting the engagement and participation of young people in decision-making through a range of initiatives ¡V like Provoke and Activate, as well as Youth Parliament.

¡§To plan for the future we need to invest in today¡¦s leaders,¡¨ says Nanaia Mahuta.
