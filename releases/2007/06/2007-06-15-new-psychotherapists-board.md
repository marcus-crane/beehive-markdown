Psychotherapists practising in New Zealand will soon be regulated by a newly established board.

Nominations are being sought for the board, which has been set up under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 as a stand alone regulatory body.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson says the board will be responsible for registering psychotherapists and have responsibilities similar to other health professional bodies under the Act.

"The board will be responsible for setting standards and competencies for the profession, ensuring practitioners remain competent while they are practising and accrediting training institutions,'' Pete Hodgson says.

The decision to establish a board followed an application by the New Zealand Association of Psychotherapists to have psychotherapy included as a health profession under the Act. Consultation with organisations including district health boards, the Health and Disability Commissioner, service provider groups, the Consumers Institute and the association, found a general consensus that the practice of psychotherapy by people who were not qualified or competent could cause a client's mental illness or psychological state to worsen.

The majority of those who made submissions advocated for a separate, stand alone authority to regulate the profession.

"This means only psychotherapists who are registered under the Act and hold an annual practising certificate are able to use the title of psychotherapist and perform the specific activities associated with their profession. This provides registered psychotherapists with the backing of a professional body and consumers with the confidence their psychotherapist meets the standards required,'' Pete Hodgson says.

Nominations for the Psychotherapists Board are currently being sought and applications close on 22 June 2007. The Board will be made up of two lay members (neither a registered health practitioner nor qualified to be registered) and five practising psychotherapists each with at least 8 years experience. At least one of the psychotherapist members must have specialist training and experience in child and adolescent psychotherapy.
