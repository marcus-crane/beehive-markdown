Reducing drug and alcohol-related crime is the aim of a new initiative in police stations, courts and prisons, Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

The aim of the trials, involving a team working between prisons and the community, and other professionals working at two police stations and two courts, is to break the link between alcohol and drug addiction and crime, Mr Hodgson said. They are to begin within the next few months at a cost of around $1.8 million per annum.

This initiative, the latest in the Labour-led Government's Effective Interventions programme, is a further investment in the safety of our communities, Mr O'Connor said.

"There are around 210 convictions a week for drug offences alone in our courts and another 143 convictions for disorderly behaviour. If we can catch these offenders early and get them to address their issues, then we stand a good chance of bringing down the number of crimes committed in our communities," Mr O'Connor said.

Research shows that at the time of their arrest, up to half of all offenders are using at least one drug and around half of those believe drug use contributed to the offending. Around 60 per cent of all prisoners are affected by drug use at the time of their offending.

Health professionals will work in two police watchhouses to help identify offenders with drug and alcohol problems and get them referred for appropriate treatment.

Health professionals will work in two courts where they can help with sentencing options for judges. Research shows appropriate conditions imposed at sentencing can help address drug and alcohol problems.

Another trial will provide better continuity of drug and alcohol treatment to ensure prisoners going back into the community continue to access those services.

The pilots are a result of a review of the effectiveness of drug and alcohol treatment services within the criminal justice system which began in October last year.

Key outcomes for the pilots will be to:  
· reduce re-offending  
·improve the mental health and social functioning of offenders  
· reduce the rate of alcohol and drug related harm, and addiction

Other initiatives include specific research proposals to help build the alcohol and drug workforce (and enhance its responsiveness to Mâori and Pacific offenders) and some expansion of alcohol and drug treatment services for offenders.

This announcement follows a government commitment under Effective Interventions to double by next year the number of alcohol and drug treatment places in prisons to more than 500 a year.

Research shows that offenders who have been through a treatment unit are 13 per cent less likely to be re-imprisoned after 24 months than if they had not attended treatment.
