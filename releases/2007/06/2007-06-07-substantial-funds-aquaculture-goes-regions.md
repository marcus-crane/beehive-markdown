The government has allocated nearly $400,000 to assist four key regions to advance planning for aquaculture, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

This is the first allocation from a pool of $2 million of contestable funds available to regional councils over five years.

The fund assists the implementation of the aquaculture reforms. It is primarily targeted to help identify areas where aquaculture shouldn?ft go, support environmental studies, assist with costs associated with consultation, encourage Maori involvement in aquaculture development, and support cultural, social and economic impact assessment.

Mr Benson-Pope said marine farming is becoming an industry that encapsulates the government?fs vision for economic transformation by combining new technology, high quality products and environmental sustainability to gain a competitive edge.

"Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regional councils are working to include communities in the planning of this exciting growth area by helping to facilitate consultation and research.

"I am delighted these councils have applied for funding and are dedicated to advancing the knowledge and growth of aquaculture in their regions in an environmentally sustainable way," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"This funding is part of the government response to the New Zealand Aquaculture Sector Strategy. A key issue in that strategy is the need to build the confidence to invest. This confidence comes from sound planning, and that is what this funding addresses."

Prime Minister Helen Clark today released the government?fs five part support plan for industry „Ÿ Our Blue Horizon „Ÿ in Nelson at the launch of the new national organisation, Aquaculture New Zealand.

The government?fs work to support aquaculture development is jointly run by the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation, Ministry for Economic Development, Te Puni Kokiri and NZ Trade and Enterprise.
