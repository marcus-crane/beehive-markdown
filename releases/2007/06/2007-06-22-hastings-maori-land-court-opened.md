Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Courts Minister Rick Barker officially opened the newly refurbished Hastings Mâori Land Court today.

Parekura Horomia said the Maori Land Court played an important part in facilitating the use of collectively owned Mâori land and resources.

"Issues relating to the multiple ownership of land and the law relating to the succession of ownership mean Mâori land transactions can be complex. In addition the court inquires into fishing boundary issues and determines customary rights in relation to the foreshore and seabed."

"The records held by the court also form an invaluable part of the whakapapa of all Maori," Mr Horomia said.

Rick Barker said that the Labour-led Government has made significant investments in the Mâori Land Court.

“In recent years we’ve completed refurbishment of registries in Christchurch and Rotorua, new Chambers for the Chief Judge in Wellington and work on a new building for the Gisborne Mâori Land Court is almost complete,” said Rick Barker.

“We’ve also invested in Mâori Land Court services and improving access to the record. Since the launch of Mâori Land on Line in 2005, thousands of landowners have been able to access information about their of land tittles via the internet from anywhere,” said Rick Barker.

Rick Barker said that today’s opening forms part of what has become the largest investment in Court buildings in New Zealand’s recent history.

“Since being elected in 1999 the Labour-led Government has completed five new courthouses and 28 major courthouse refurbishments. More are planned as well, including the construction of the new Hastings District Court which is due to commence shortly,” said Rick Barker.
