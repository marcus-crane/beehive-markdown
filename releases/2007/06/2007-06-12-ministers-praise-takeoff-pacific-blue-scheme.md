The launch of Pacific Blue NZ’s Carbon Offset scheme for customers is yet another step in the nation’s drive towards carbon neutrality, say Government Ministers David Benson-Pope and David Parker.

The scheme, announced today, is a first for airlines operating in New Zealand.

“Any move which allows passengers to offset their individual flight emissions when they journey across the Tasman, or to our Pacific neighbours, is a positive step in our bid to negate future climate change,” said Mr Parker, Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues.

Mr Parker said he was pleased to note Carbon Offset intends to source customers’ offsets from the [Projects to Reduce Emissions (PRE) programme](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/projects/index.html), which was set up under the Labour-led government.

There are more than 40 independently owned and operated projects in the PRE scheme, including wind farms, hydro-electricity generation, geothermal generation and generation of heat and power from landfill gas. Investors are private or publicly-listed companies, state-owned enterprises, and local authorities.

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said this announcement shows how far as a nation we have come along the path towards environmental sustainability, in such a short time.

"The greenhouse gas emissions caused by air travel are a key issue for New Zealand, with our geographic location and the importance of exports and inbound international tourists to our economy," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"This Government is taking bold steps towards carbon neutrality in the public sector, and asking all New Zealanders to play their part in mitigating climate change.

"I’m encouraged to see innovative companies, such as Pacific Blue NZ, show leadership in the business sector, and giving Kiwi consumers the opportunity to reduce their own carbon footprint," said Mr Benson-Pope.
