Opposition leader John Key’s gall was reaching new and breath-taking levels, Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton said today.

He said that National’s claim that it would put a new emphasis on trade training in schools was outrageous, given that when it was last in government, it had virtually destroyed the trade training and apprenticeships systems, leaving many industries now desperate for skilled staff.

“Of course, there is also the small problem of the unemployment rates under National of between 6 per cent and over 10 per cent and having no jobs for school leavers to go to or train for.

“National put in place the market-based Equivalent Full Time Student system that rewarded institutions for the number of bums on seats, rather than focussing on the needs of the country. Institutions, under that system, concentrated on running cheap courses that had lots of students, rather than costly trades courses. That’s why employers can’t get skilled, trained staff now.”

Jim Anderton said it was important to have courses at school that engaged all pupils. “Indeed, this is a crucial principle in the NCEA qualification. Hence, the credits for chainsaw technique and other important skills in primary sector industries which John Key’s National Party buddies and some Auckland educators scoffed at.

“These things may be new to Mr Key, who has only recently come into politics after being overseas for many years. But for the people of New Zealand, they know what National’s track record is in these areas and they will not be fooled by this new enthusiasm for areas National has neglected in the past.”
