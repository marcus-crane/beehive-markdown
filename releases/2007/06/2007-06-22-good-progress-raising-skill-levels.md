Increasing numbers of young New Zealanders are embracing trade training as a viable career option and that bodes well for the continued transformation of the economy, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Latest training figures for the March quarter show a 10.3 per cent rise in Modern Apprentices and a 3.5 per cent increase in Industry Trainees.

"It is clear trade training is in good heart and that's good news for employers demanding skilled workers," said Dr Cullen.

As at 31 March 2007, there were 124,035 Industry Trainees – up 3.5 per cent on March 2006, and 9752 Modern Apprentices, up 10.3 per cent on March 2006.

Some 3260 Modern Apprentices having completed their qualifications since the programme was launched as a pilot in 2000. Total annual spending will rise to approximately $50 million by 2009/10.

"Trade training is a priority for the Labour-led government. That's why Budget 2007 invests $53 million more over four years to support increased workforce participation in Industry Training. This will expand numbers participating each year to 220,000 by 2011. The government's total investment in the Industry Training Fund will reach $180 million by 2010/11, more than three times more than in 2000.

"The future for both Industry Training and Modern Apprenticeships looks bright, particularly with very encouraging levels of uptake of the Gateway programme for secondary school students," said Dr Cullen.

The programme, which began as a pilot in 2001, provides year 11-13 students with a range of learning opportunities in workplaces, integrated with their school-based studies.

Figures released by the Tertiary Education Commission show that 204 schools and 6740 students participated in Gateway in 2006. For 2007, the programme continues to demonstrate strong growth, with a further 97 schools now signed up for the programme and an estimated 9000 students likely to participate this year.

A total of 83 per cent of all students in the Gateway scheme last year were reported as having positive outcomes. Of these, 25 per cent of placements led directly to employment, including 6 per cent – or 410 - to Modern Apprenticeships. A further 54 percent of all students in the scheme moved on to further study at secondary or tertiary levels.

"The Gateway programme is developing into a major success in linking young New Zealanders to further training, successful careers and very bright futures," Dr Cullen said.

"We are making a real difference to the career choices available to increasing numbers of young New Zealanders. They are getting quality training and so a great chance to contribute to this country's economic development."
