Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today the Government is to introduce waist restraints for prisoners during transport.

The Office of the Ombudsman today released a report into prisoner transport, which contained a number of recommendations to improve the system.

"I can confirm today that I have decided the use of waist restraints is the most suitable method of protecting prisoners from each other, and to further protect the public and prison officers," Mr O'Connor said.

"I have already discussed my preference with my Cabinet colleagues. The step requires a regulation change and Cabinet approval.

"The default condition will be to restrain all prisoners unless there is a good reason not to, such as a medical condition. I intend to start implementation of waist restraints by the end of August."

At-risk prisoners, youth and women prisoners will continue to be segregated from mainstream prisoners.

Mr O'Connor said: "I would like to extend again my sympathies to the Ashley family. The release of today's report will be a difficult time for them. We cannot bring Liam back but I am confident that the steps we have taken and will continue to take will go a long way to ensuring such a tragedy does not happen again."

Mr O'Connor thanked the Ombudsmen for their work.

"I am very pleased the report identifies areas which needed change. Since Liam's death, the department has been focussed on every aspect of prisoner transportation and the Ombudsmen's report provides a valuable contribution to this work."

The Department:  
·has carried out Mr O'Connor's instruction issued days after Liam's murder that prisoners under 18 must be kept separate while travelling,  
·has simplified and clarified prisoner handover processes and forms,  
·has set clearer rules on the separation of prisoners,  
·is providing training for staff to understand new standardised emergency procedures.

Further projects include a review of vehicle design and national standards for vehicles.

Mr O'Connor said: "The Corrections Department has a responsibility to protect the public and prison staff. It must also do everything it can to provide a safe environment for prisoners.

"The report recognises that assaults are 'very rare'. I expect the Department to ensure that the way prisoners are moved meets the standard expected by the public."
