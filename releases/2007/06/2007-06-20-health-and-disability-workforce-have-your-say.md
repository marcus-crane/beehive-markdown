Creative thinking about the future for the health and disability workforce is needed to ensure the health system is able to look after the needs of New Zealanders in the future, Health Minister Pete Hodgson says.

Mr Hodgson was commenting on the launch of A Career Framework for the Health and Disability Workforce in New Zealand Consultation Document, which is now open for public comment.

The publication has been developed jointly by the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards. It describes the structure of careers and how people progress within the health and disability workforce.

It will support individuals and organisations to develop careers and career pathways, and will inform and improve health and disability workforce planning. It is one of several initiatives which will guide workforce planning.

"Our population is ageing, and so is the workforce,” Pete Hodgson says.

"The ethnic makeup of our population is also changing, with an increase in Maori, Pacific and Asian populations.

"This means that service needs are changing, over time we are likely to need more services, with an increasing focus on the management of long term conditions.

"We need to think creatively about these issues to ensure we recruit new workers and retain existing ones as well as finding different ways to provide services."

The framework aims to cover the entire health and disability workforce - clinical and non-clinical, health and disability and management. It can be viewed at

"I would like to encourage all those with an interest in this issue - and that's potentially all New Zealanders - to take the time to read it, and to comment," Pete Hodgson says.
