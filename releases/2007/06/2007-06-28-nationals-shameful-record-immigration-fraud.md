National should be hiding in shame instead of criticising the Labour-led government's record on pursuing immigration fraud cases, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"When Labour took office in 1999, we inherited a situation where the previous National administration had appointed just one immigration fraud officer after nine years in power," Mr Cunliffe said.

"In contrast, the Labour-led government established a fully fledged investigations unit that now has 18 staff including a manager, investigators and support staff. Their work resulted in 55 successful prosecutions in 2005-06 and 31 successful prosecutions in the 11 months to 31 May 2007, compared with one in 1999.

"While the unit acts to identify and prosecute fraud cases in New Zealand, this government has also taken a number of decisive actions to stop immigration fraudsters getting through our borders in the first place.

"In 2003, we set up the Advance Passenger Processing system which screens passengers before they board planes for New Zealand. In the 11 months to May 2007, 762 people have been stopped from coming here under APP even before they get on a plane. In the year to June 30 2006, 680 were stopped.

"We established the Immigration Profiling Group in 2005 to look more closely at a range of immigration applicants who might pose a risk to New Zealand. The IPG has made over 12,000 decisions since its creation, declining around 20 per cent.

"Then there is the Regional Movement Alert List, set up in 2006 to share information with Australia and the United States; the risk targeting programme, also created in 2006; and a range of offshore interdiction programmes.

"About five million people arrive and depart from New Zealand a year. While the vast majority are people lawfully travelling for private and business reasons, we are overwhelmingly better positioned than in 1999 to apprehend the small number travelling fraudulently or with other criminal intent.

"National put just $730,000 into border security in its last year. The Labour-led government has put $136 million into border security since 2000.

"While I have pledged to implement all the recommendations in the report of the Auditor-General and I accept his finding that systems improvements are needed, it beggars belief that National's Lockwood Smith can show his face on this issue given the appalling track record when he was a minister and did so little."
