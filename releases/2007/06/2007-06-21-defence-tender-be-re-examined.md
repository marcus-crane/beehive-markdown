Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced that tenders for a contract to provide 8 security guards for the Joint Force Headquarters in Trentham will be referred back to the Defence Force Tender Evaluation Team.

"I have received the audit I requested of the previous tender process which recommended granting the contract to Security Guard Services (SGS) and it has confirmed my concerns", said Phil Goff.

"The Tender Evaluation Team was not aware of the terminated business arrangement between SGS and the Police last year at the time the recommendation was made. It should reconvene to reassess its decision.

"The new information about SGS's work with the Police brings into question the quality of SGS's service delivery and their internal quality assurance mechanisms.

"The Tender Evaluation Team has now been directed by the Chief of Defence Force to re-examine their recommendation for preferred supplier having regard to the new information", said Mr Goff.
