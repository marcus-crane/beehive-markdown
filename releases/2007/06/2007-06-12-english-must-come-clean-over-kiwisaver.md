Thousands of workers should be worried by the refusal of the National Party to again clarify its position on KiwiSaver, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today. "National finance spokesman Bill English this morning ducked questions over how the savings of workers would be affected if National ever became government," said Dr Cullen. "Speaking to the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce this morning, Mr English was asked to explain National's position on the enhancements to KiwiSaver introduced by Budget 2007. "He said National would keep some form of KiwiSaver, but once again failed to clarify exactly what this meant. From 1 July thousands of workers will sign up to KiwiSaver and will see their savings boosted by the $20 a week tax credit and the phase in of employer contributions. "Workers need certainty before making long term decisions. National needs to be honest with them as it has very little credibility over superannuation. Remember, it was a National government that illegally scrapped the Labour government's scheme in 1975 and a National government, of which Bill English was a Minister that cut the annual adjustment to New Zealand Superannuation to 60 per cent of the average wage. "And just last month Mr English said the consensus was broken over superannuation. "It's the same slippery position on spending cuts. Mr English also told the audience that a National government would slow the growth in spending. He wants to slash half a billion dollars from the Budget, but won't say how." "Glib slogans and half truths are no substitute for real policies. It's increasingly clear there aren't any," Dr Cullen concluded.
