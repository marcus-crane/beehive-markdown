National MP Simon Power's increasingly lame attempts to gain headlines reveals his complete insincerity, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor says.

"In his latest bleat Mr Power criticises Corrections for providing work opportunities for Wellington prisoners, who grow vegetables for charitable organisations such as city missions, and for Wellington Zoo in exchange for manure for prison gardens.

"Presumably this is the same Simon Power who said in a press release of 5 November 2006 that: 'Prisoners should be doing meaningful work, training or study while they are in prisons, and I imagine the public would agree.'

"The Government is way ahead of him. As I stated last year, the Government is funding Corrections to increase the percentage of prisoners in work and training from 40 to 60 per cent by 2009.

Mr O'Connor said it remains a mystery what Simon Power actually stands for.

"It's irresponsible to oppose but not propose. Instead of having 'fun' denigrating the work of thousands of Corrections staff, Simon Power should front up and tell the public of New Zealand what he stands for.

"He told the media in January that he would have policy ready by the end of March. It's nearly July now, and still not a peep. The four-month-and-counting delay shows he's all poo and no do."
