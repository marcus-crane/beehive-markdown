The purchase of the 9,165 hectare Michael Peak Station in Central Otago for a conservation park was announced today by Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Minister for Land Information David Parker.

The station, located in the headwaters of the Manuherikia Valley, north of State Highway 85 between Alexandra and Ranfurly, has been jointly purchased by Land Information New Zealand and the Nature Heritage Fund.

"This station forms part of the stunning Upper Manuherikia landscape that has inspired artists such as painter Grahame Sydney and poet Brian Turner,” said David Parker. "The purchase protects these landscapes and makes them freely available for walking, horse and bike riding. It provides access to Mt St Bathans – the highest peak in the district – and to Omarama Saddle, which is a gateway to the Mackenzie country.

"The station contains a rich and vibrant variety of ecosystems and plants of high conservation value," says Chris Carter. "They include high altitude snow totara, and a wide range of sub-alpine shrubs and tussock grasslands. This is a spectacular and beautiful area."

It is intended that 6,900 hectares of pastoral lease in the valley headwaters become a core part of the proposed Oteake Conservation Park. The remainder of the property is developed farmland 15 km down the valley. This farmland will be available to exchange for other areas in the vicinity with high conservation values that may also be added to the park. The park will be managed by the Department of Conservation.

The property was purchased from the Waldron family, which has been farming the area for three generations, for $8 million.
