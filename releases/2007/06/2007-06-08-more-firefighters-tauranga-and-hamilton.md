Tauranga and Hamilton are in line for more career firefighters, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker announced today.

“The Fire Service Commission’s planning processes have identified Tauranga and Hamilton in particular have both grown significantly over the last few years and the increase of 27 career personnel in 2008 are in response to that,” Rick Barker said.

Rick Barker said it is the first time for twenty years that the number of career firefighters in New Zealand has been increased, and he expects further increases over the next two or three financial years to keep pace with the needs of an expanding and moving population.

“Tauranga’s 18 new staff from January 2008 will allow for another fire appliance for the district. This will be based initially at the current Greerton Fire Station, before moving to a new facility in the area when land purchase, building design and construction are finalised,” said Rick Barker.

“The existing volunteer fire brigade at Greerton will remain in commission and support the additional career staff unit. The contribution of the Greerton volunteers to the overall Tauranga fire force has been immense and I look forward to them continuing this vital role.

“Nine additional career firefighters in Hamilton from April 2008 will allow an aerial appliance currently crewed by two firefighters to be crewed by four, so it can be used as an independent unit offering more flexibility and depth to Hamilton’s fire coverage,” said Rick Barker.

The New Zealand Fire Service currently employs 1,680 career firefighters and more than 7,000 volunteer firefighters in 430 stations throughout New Zealand.
