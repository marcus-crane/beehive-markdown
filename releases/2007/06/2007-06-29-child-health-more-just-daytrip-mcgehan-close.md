Spending money on the health and well-being of our children rather than cutting tax is the best investment for New Zealand’s future, say Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Minister for Social Development and Employment David Benson-Pope.

In a speech at the Christchurch School of Medicine, Pete Hodgson outlined the Labour-led government’s investments in the health of young New Zealanders over the past seven Budgets, and how important the social development programme has been for children and young people.

"We are rebuilding oral health services in schools and the community; we have lifted vaccination rates from around 60 percent up to over 80 percent and are working to get it higher; we have successful screening programmes including screening of newborns for metabolic disorders, hearing impairment and we’ve improved screening techniques for Down Syndrome.

“Smoking rates have been halved among teens, improvements in the provision of child and adolescent mental health services are being secured year by year and the Government is supporting hundreds of programmes around the country to help fight obesity and encourage youngsters to lead a healthier lifestyle,” Pete Hodgson says.

“Our sights are set on long-term gains for children and young people rather than a theme-park attitude of visiting a high-needs area for one day and then disappearing.”

David Benson-Pope says low unemployment, programmes to reduce family violence and the Working for Families scheme are all contributing to giving New Zealand children the best possible start in life.

"It is estimated that between 2001 and 2008, 130,000 children will have been lifted out of poverty by a combination of factors, including Working for Families," David Benson-Pope says.

“Over $27 million was allocated in this year’s Budget for a range of initiatives to strengthen families including $20.4 million over the next two years to help community organisations deliver services that support New Zealand’s children and families.”

Child and adolescent health will always be a priority for Governments and Health Ministers, Pete Hodgson says.

“Our children and young people are not only our future, their health and well-being is a measure of the health and well-being of our society and how we care for them says much about us as a nation.”

“We know what happened to health services under the National government.  
For me, the low point came on 1 April 1991, even before the mother-of-all-budgets, when the benefit cuts removed $1.3 billion from the economy in a single day, and the country was plunged into recession. I for one will fight any return to the dog-eat-dog times of the1990s,” Pete Hodgson says.

This year’s Budget included:

- • $68 million for a pneumococcal vaccine programme
- • $20 million for antenatal Down Syndrome screening
- • $13.2 million for sexual health education and reduction of  
  sexually transmitted infections
- • $10.5 million for better outcomes for Autism Spectrum Disotrder
- • $6 million for Plunket Well child telephone contact for families  
  with assessed need
- • $2 million for screening all newborns for a range of treatable  
  metabolic disorders
