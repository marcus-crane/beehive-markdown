Employment and study opportunities for New Zealanders in Europe will expand with New Zealand qualifications now being recognised under a European convention, Tertiary Education Minister, Michael Cullen announced today.

New Zealand’s request to accede to the [Lisbon Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Area](http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/highereducation/Recognition/LRC_en.asp) was unanimously approved at a meeting in Bucharest overnight.

"This is great news. Someone with a New Zealand qualification can now work or study much easier overseas because that qualification will now have equivalent status in each of the 50 Lisbon convention countries," said Dr Cullen.

The Lisbon Convention is recognised as setting international best practice for assessing and comparing qualifications from around the world.

"The agreement means that European agencies have come to understand and recognise the levels and depth of New Zealand qualifications," said Dr Cullen.

"This will not only expand work and study opportunities for Kiwis with tertiary qualifications, it will also raise the profile of our tertiary qualifications with European education agencies.

"This will help foster greater international linkages as students from the likes of France, Germany or Italy can study here with more confidence, knowing that a New Zealand tertiary qualification will be recognised back home.

"This is part of the Labour-led government's strategy of revitalising international education. We want to improve our reputation as a high quality provider of education to ensure New Zealanders can work with confidence overseas and we can attract students of the highest calibre to this country. Greater education linkages will improve our ability to compete in the global marketplace."

Signatories to the Lisbon Convention include the UK, France, Germany, Italy, USA, Canada and Australia.
