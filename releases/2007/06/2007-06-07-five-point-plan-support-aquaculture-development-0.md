The government has announced its five-point plan to support the future growth of aquaculture in New Zealand.

"The government's plan supports regional councils in their planning processes, provides better public information on aquaculture, promotes Maori involvement in aquaculture, and helps the aquaculture industry develop markets and products," Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Continued growth of the aquaculture sector will be based on industry partnerships with regional councils, iwi and communities, and with research providers."For this growth to be successful, it must also be sustainable," Jim Anderton said. "One area I'm particularly excited about is working with industry to develop national standards for sustainable aquaculture.

"National standards will prove to the world that New Zealand's aquaculture industry is environmentally sustainable ? giving us an edge with consumers who are demanding eco-friendly food products."

Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said the government will be working closely with regional councils and other interested parties on initiatives to help aquaculture develop in a sustainable way.

"We want to encourage investment in aquaculture planning, particularly through supporting regional councils to create new Aquaculture Management Areas, where suitable, to make better use of existing aquaculture space, and to provide for research and experimentation," David Benson-Pope said.

"Towards this, we have provided $2 million to councils through a contestable fund. Nearly $400,000 of this has just been approved to Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions to assist with the information gathering, policy development and community processes required for good aquaculture planning."

Maori will also play a key role in the future development of aquaculture in New Zealand. "Strengthening their involvement will further benefit Maori communities, and ensure the prosperity of the wider industry," Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said.

"The Government takes very seriously its commitments in the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. The government has also provided funding for the new industry body Aquaculture New Zealand to employ a Maori relationship manager.

"This will prove an important position, as the role will help develop even stronger relations between industry and iwi groups."
