A Taranaki wildlife sanctuary involved in efforts to protect the western North Island brown kiwi is to receive funding from the Labour-led Government to create a secure, pest-free, environment, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark today visited the nationally significant Rotokare Wildlife Sanctuary near Eltham to announce that the Labour-led Government will invest $578,699 in the Sanctuary.

"This grant will contribute to the construction of a predator-proof fence, and to pest destruction efforts around a 230ha forested catchment, wetland and lake. It will also help fund walking tracks and a visitors' carpark," Helen Clark said.

“This project will bring significant conservation benefits, both locally and nationally, by protecting indigenous biodiversity, and by providing education opportunities. The sanctuary is an ideal venue for community conservation projects.

“The Sanctuary with its natural lake and wetlands is part of the national network of sanctuaries, and can assist in the recovery effort of the western North Island brown kiwi.

"This project complements the work of both the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary and, one of last year’s successful applicants to the fund, Maungatautari Ecological Island, as well as other existing conservation initiatives,” Helen Clark said.

The grant is being made available through the $32 million Significant Community Based Projects Fund, set up by the Labour-led Government in 2005 to support major community projects which have regional or national significance.

Grants in the first funding round were awarded to the Invercargill Velodrome (up to $1 million), the Dunedin Chinese Gardens (up to $3.75 million), an eco-tourism attraction in the West Coast's Oparara Valley (up to $1.8 million), Maungatautari Ecological Island (up to $5.5 million), Auckland’s ASB Showgrounds (up to $4.7 million), and the Hawke's Bay Opera House (up to $2.5 million).

Today's announcement follows the grant of up to $6.5 million to the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary earlier this week.

Helen Clark said further announcements about other successful applicants to the Fund this financial year would be made shortly.

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said that as a result of the high calibre applications received, the fund will be completely allocated this year.

"While no further funding round has been planned at this time, the high level of community interest in the fund has led Cabinet to ask me to report back on the level of demand for projects that would have been eligible to apply had the fund continued,” Rick Barker said.

“The Significant Community Based Projects Fund was set up at a time of falling lottery profits when less funding was available to support capital projects. The recent increase in New Zealand Lotteries profits has resulted in higher levels of funding being available for allocation and has allowed the re-establishment of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund.

“The Lottery Community Facilities Fund is able to support a wide range of projects to build or improve community facilities. Organisations considering applying should contact GrantsOnline@dia.govt.nz or phone 0800 824 824,” Rick Barker said.
