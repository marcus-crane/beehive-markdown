In another step in the ongoing roll-out of the Labour-led government’s communications overhaul, applications are to be sought for local radio spectrum licences covering broadband internet services.

"It is critical to economic transformation in New Zealand that we take the necessary steps to achieve competitive broadband coverage throughout the country. Making radio spectrum available for wireless broadband is a key part of the government’s strategy," said Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"The government has 75 area spectrum licences to allocate later this year for wireless access services in the 3.5GHz band. These commercial fixed licences have been created to facilitate the roll-out of wireless broadband services in New Zealand.

"This follows the sale last year of an initial 73 licences in a spectrum targeted at local and regional commercial services. The 2006 licences were allocated mainly in larger provincial centres and metropolitan areas."

To ensure the success of this second offering, changes to the allocation and tender rules have been proposed. The Ministry of Economic Development has today released the proposed allocation rules for stakeholder feedback.

"Inquiries about the second round allocation are already demonstrating a high level of interest in this spectrum. I encourage all parties considering the provision of local wireless broadband access and services to read and provide their comments on the document," Mr Cunliffe said.

The consultation document is available on the Ministry of Economic Development’s radio spectrum web site at [www.rsm.govt.nz](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/)

Interested parties have until 12 October 2007 to comment on it.

### Background

- Following any necessary amendments to the Allocation Rules, the Ministry of Economic Development expects to invite applications for the 75 lots at the beginning of November 2007. Intending applicants will be supplied with a set of documents including the Allocation Rules, application form, guidelines and instructions. Applications are expected to close on 30 November.
- Qualified applicants will be allocated the lots they have applied for, at the reserve price, if no other applicant has applied for the same lot or lots. Where there are multiple applications for a licence, applicants will be invited to resolve the issue between themselves by January 2008. Any lots for which competing interests remain after that date will then be offered in a closed single-round tender.
