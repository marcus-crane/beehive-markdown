A report released today by the Ministry of Health projects that the number of people with diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes may increase from about 120,000 in 2001 to 180,000 in 2011.

"The Diabetes Surveillance population-based estimates and projections for New Zealand 2001 - 2011 shows that of the projected 60,000 new diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes cases in 2011, about a third will be the result of an increasing number of people who are overweight and obese and the rest will largely be due to our ageing population and other factors," Pete Hodgson said.

"This government is investing heavily to ensure our younger generation can lead healthier, more active lives. The Healthy Eating - Healthy Action (HEHA) Strategy is the Government's vehicle for achieving this.”

The HEHA Strategy continues to target New Zealanders of all ages, to act now to prevent harm like diabetes and heart disease in the future. Even small differences in diet and physical activity levels over time can make a significant impact.

There are many fantastic initiatives happening around the country to target people at risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Ngati Porou Hauora on the East Coast runs a successful programme called 'Ngati and Healthy' to prevent diabetes in the Ngati Porou region.

"District Health Boards like Counties Manukau are implementing successful diabetes prevention programmes. Lets Beat Diabetes is an excellent example of a community-based prevention and management programme continuing to successfully improve the lives of people living with diabetes.”

"This latest report 'Diabetes Surveillance population-based estimates and projections for New Zealand 2001-2011' will be useful for the future planning of health promotion initiatives like HEHA and for DHBs, PHOs and diabetes organisations planning services for people living with diabetes," Pete Hodgson said.
