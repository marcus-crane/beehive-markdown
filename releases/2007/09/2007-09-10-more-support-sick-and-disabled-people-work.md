Greater support and new services are being introduced for people with ill health and disabled people, Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

“Changes to the government's Working New Zealand programme which come into effect from 24 September build on changes to the social support system implemented earlier this year. This includes the Job Search Service, changes to employment and training programmes to make them more widely available, and the alignment of benefit rules to make the system easier to understand.

“Evidence has shown that most people on benefit want to work and with the right support they can. This Labour-led government wants to ensure people on Sickness Benefits or Invalid’s Benefits who want to work, are given every opportunity to do so. Where work is not appropriate, we want to provide a service that helps them participate in their community.

“From this month, there will be one medical certificate for people applying for Sickness and Invalid’s Benefits. The family doctor will be able to complete the medical certificate. People applying for Invalid’s benefit will be able to use existing information about the nature of their illness, injury or disability and will not be automatically referred to a designated doctor. Further specialist advice will only be necessary if there is insufficient information to establish eligibility or determine service needs.

“People receiving an Invalid’s benefit won't have to re-establish their condition at regular intervals if it is unlikely to change, and all clients will receive a service that helps them plan for their future, whether it is about work, or involvement in their community," said Mr Maharey.

“New specialist health and disability advisors will work alongside case managers and clients, there will be new co-ordinators to support health practitioners, and more staff working directly with employers in their workplace.

“This government has also approved initial funding for services to address mild to moderate mental illness or addiction; and for people awaiting specialist assessment, treatment or surgery.

“The number of working age people receiving an illness or disability type benefit worldwide is rising. In New Zealand we have slowed the growth in these benefits dramatically, and these services will make even more of a difference to the lives of disabled people and those with ill health,” Mr Maharey said.
