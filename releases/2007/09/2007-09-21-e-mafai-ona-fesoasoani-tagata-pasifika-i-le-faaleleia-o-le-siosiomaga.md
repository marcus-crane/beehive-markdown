Luamanuvao Winnie Laban is today encouraging New Zealand’s Pacific communities to take action and help reduce New Zealand’s impact on climate change.

“We all need to play our part in the fight against climate change – for the sake of our natural environment, economy and our grandchildren,” says Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Labour-led government yesterday unveiled [plans](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=49) for an [emissions trading scheme](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/nz-solutions/reducing-our-footprint.shtml) that will put a price on harmful greenhouse gas pollution and encourage businesses and households to become more energy efficient.

“The traditional Pacific way of life was based on sustainability. Our ancestors knew that if they didn’t look after their natural surroundings for the next generation, then life simply would not continue.

“Today our Pacific communities can help make a real difference. Turning off the lights, installing energy efficient light bulbs and better insulation in homes, cutting out the use of plastic bags, and walking or taking a bus instead of using the car all add up and all help.

“The cost of doing nothing is too great. We must once again look to our ancestors and learn from their teachings and way of life,” said Laban.
