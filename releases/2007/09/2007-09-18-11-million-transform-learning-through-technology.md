Twenty three new groups of schools have been selected to join a nationwide programme to transform learning through innovative use of information and communications technology (ICT), Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"The Labour-led government will invest $11.1 million over the next three years to support 23 new clusters of schools to put e-learning strategies at the heart of their teaching programmes. In total, it will cover 122 schools from Northland to Invercargill.

“This programme focuses on improving the quality of teaching through better use of technology, which therefore improves the achievement of students.

“The Correspondence School has been included for the first time, with funding to investigate the use of audio and video conferencing, and to develop online learning environments.”

Other initiatives being funded in the latest round include:

- Three schools on Great Barrier Island will set up a virtual ‘Island Sea Academy’ to provide marine education for local children
- Seven Southland schools (Southern Connections’ cluster) will encourage the use of blogs and online diaries to improve teaching methods
- A group of rural Manawatu schools are organising a specific information technology Expo to share their expertise with the community.

Steve Maharey says each cluster of schools has access to a national online network of colleagues, ICT resources, professional development, and support from a professional facilitator.

“E-Learning strategies can place teachers and students at the centre of their own communication and information networks. This helps create a flexible system where teachers, schools and communities can identify the needs of learners and use technology to boost their achievement.

“This means that over 63 per cent, or 1657 New Zealand schools have been involved in this programme since it began in 1999. The Labour-led government has invested more than $408 million in Information and Communications Technology since 2000.”
