Three current Charities Commission Board members have been reappointed for a further three years, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban announced today.

Judith Timpany (Deputy Chair), Ian Calder and Frank Claridge will all serve a second term.

“I am delighted that Frank, Ian and Judith have been reappointed as it enables continuity during the Commission’s busy registration period,” said Laban.

“All three have considerable experience working in the charitable sector. This has already proved invaluable for the complex issues faced by the board each month.

“Registration with the Charities Commission is not a simple ‘rubber-stamping’ exercise, but a carefully considered process with some complex cases,” said Laban.

The Charities Act 2005 established the Charities Commission to run a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities. Charitable organisations have until 1 July 2008 to register in order to continue to be eligible for tax exemption.

The other members of the Board are Sid Ashton (Chair), Kerry Ayers, Amohaere Houkamau, and Patricia Webster.
