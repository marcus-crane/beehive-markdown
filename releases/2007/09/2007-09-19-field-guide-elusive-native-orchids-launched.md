Wellingtonians and residents of the lower North Island have another reason to venture into the great outdoors with the launch of a field guide to New Zealand’s extraordinary native orchids, said Conservation Minister Chris Carter.

At the launch of Wild Orchids of the lower North Island this evening, Mr Carter said more than 70 percent of New Zealand’s orchids are found in and around Wellington with many species so tiny, most people do not know they were there.

“Wellingtonians are already well attuned to their natural environment and it’s hoped the book will encourage them to learn more about these elusive and diverse native plants,” Mr Carter said at the book launch this evening.

“Our orchids are coveted by overseas collectors and if people are more aware of these plants, it is much more likely they will help protect them from weeds and animals and report incidents where they suspect orchids are being taken illegally.”

“I want to extend my thanks and congratulations to the authors for their work in helping raise awareness of New Zealand’s unique and wonderful flora.”

Wild Orchids of the lower North Island identifies 72 species of wild orchid and includes photographs, maps and descriptions. Exotic orchid flowers come in hues of pink, yellow, blue, green, purple and brown. Some orchid varieties sport beards, others have sepals (the part of a plant that surrounds and protects the flower when it is in bud) which resemble horns or spider’s legs. Some cling to trees and give off a pleasant scent.

The book was compiled over a decade by Department of Conservation botanist John Sawyer who co-authored the book with leading plant conservation scientist Peter de Lange, photographer and botanist Jeremy Rolfe and orchid expert Ian St George.
