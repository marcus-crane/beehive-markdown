The Mâori Party’s refusal to support the Minimum Wage (New Entrants) Amendment Bill is a vote against our rangatahi who often do the same work as adults and are entitled to  
fair minimum wage protection, says Māori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

The bill passed its third reading yesterday and improves the rights of young workers, a significant number of whom are Mâori.

“This is why I’m particularly disappointed in the Mâori Party’s decision to vote against the bill. They should be supporting moves to uphold the employment rights of our rangatahi, not the opposite,"Mr Horomia said.

“They have sent the wrong message and let our young people down in the process. There is simply no excuse for failing to support a bill which seeks to reduce discrimination against young Mâori workers.”

The bill comes into effect next April. From that date 16 and 17-year olds will be paid the adult wage after completing an initial period of 200 hours or three months in a job.

The youth rate is currently $9 per hour while the adult minimum wage is $11.25 per hour.

It was initially proposed to remove the youth rate altogether, but a compromise was reached in order to gain enough parliamentary support to pass the bill, Mr Horomia said.

“This was a balanced way forward and is another step in the Labour-led government’s drive to ensure all workers have fair minimum wage protection. We have also raised the minimum wage every year since we have been in office – of key importance of Mâori workers who make up a disproportionate number of those on the minimum wage.”
