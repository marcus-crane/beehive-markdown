Prime Minister Helen Clark and Health Minister Pete Hodgson launched a new campaign today to urge women to have regular cervical smears.

Helen Clark and Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced the launch of the $2.5 million dollar campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of regular cervical screening for all women.

The advertisements specifically target Maori and Pacific Island women who continue to be screened at lower rates than other ethnic groups.

"Ten years ago 180 women annually lost their battle with cervical cancer. Now that figure has reduced to seventy per year, largely due to increases in screening, and thus early detection" Helen Clark said.

"Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of all cancers. All women between twenty and seventy years of age are encouraged to take part in the National Cervical Screening Programme.

"As Minister of Health when the Cervical Screening Register was established in 1990, I know that when women take charge of their health and begin having regular smears, that can literally be a life-saving decision.

“The Labour-led Government believes all women should feel comfortable about using this service," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark also met Lillian Ward from Tokomaru Bay, who is the face of one of eight new television commercials promoting the importance of cervical screening.

"Lillian’s story is both inspirational and a warning to others not to delay getting a cervical smear. Lillian was found to have an entirely treatable condition after having a routine cervical smear – something she had delayed doing for nine years," Helen Clark said.

“Maori and Pacific Island women are continuing to be diagnosed with cervical cancer at greater levels than women from other ethnic groups. This campaign aims to redress that. Yet while it targets Maori and Pacific women, the messages and stories in the television campaigns are for all women.” Pete Hodgson said.
