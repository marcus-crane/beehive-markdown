Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today that New Zealand will participate in a multinational Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercise in Japan in October as part of its commitment to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

"The PSI aims to foster cooperation among nations to deter, prevent or intercept the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction," Mr Goff said.

"New Zealand is an active member of the PSI. We hosted a meeting in Auckland in March and participated in a "table-top" simulation exercise at the US' Naval War College in June. The exercise in Japan is different in that it involves the actual deployment of military assets - in our case a P3 Orion aircraft.

"In addition to the aircraft, New Zealand will be represented by an interagency team comprised of officials from the New Zealand Defence Force, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and New Zealand Customs Service.

"A number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, France, and the US will also be participating. Others will also be present as observers as the exercise is played out.

"The exercise, known as Pacific Shield, will test the ability of PSI partners to coordinate an appropriate response to an incident involving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction", Mr Goff said.
