Foreign Minister Winston Peters will travel to Europe next week for high-level talks with the European Union, Spain and Portugal.

In Madrid, Mr Peters will hold talks with his counterpart Miguel Moratinos, and meet with the External Affairs Commissions of Spain's Senate and Congress.

He then flies on to Lisbon, for the latest round of six-monthly consultations with the European Union Presidency, which is currently held by Portugal.  
Portuguese Foreign Minister Luís Amado will head the European delegation, and the two Ministers will also hold a bilateral meeting the next day.

“New Zealand and Europe are natural partners. We share a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights," Mr Peters said.

"The centrepiece of the EU talks will be the adoption of a joint declaration on EU-New Zealand relations, which sets out the directions in which the relationship has moved, and explores where it might be further enhanced.

“We will also discuss a range of political issues affecting New Zealand’s relations with Europe, and exchange views on major global concerns such as Afghanistan, Iran, the Middle East and North Korea. We will also touch on recent developments in the Pacific, in which the EU has a strong interest.

“New Zealand and Portugal share an interest in the development of Timor-Leste and this will feature prominently in our bilateral discussions.

"In Madrid, we will explore the enormous scope for Spain and New Zealand to work together more closely. Spain has emerged as a major economic power, and both countries share many similar values and views on global events.

"For example, Spain is a co-sponsor of the Alliance of Civilisations, a key initiative aimed at bridging the gap between the Muslim world and the West.

"Foreign Minister Moratinos has been very active in promoting this initiative, which New Zealand also strongly supports, and our meeting is an opportunity to consider how we might advance our cooperation further,” Mr Peters said.
