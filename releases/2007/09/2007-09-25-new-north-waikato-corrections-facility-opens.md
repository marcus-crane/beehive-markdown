Spring Hill Corrections Facility will add 650 beds to the country's prison capacity, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr O'Connor accompanied Prime Minister Helen Clark as she officially opened the $380 million prison in North Waikato today. Spring Hill is the last of four regional prisons built under the Labour-led Government, which combined add more than 1600 new prison beds to the corrections system.

The four new prisons – Otago, Northland and Auckland Women’s corrections facilities are the others – are built to be highly effective in terms of security and rehabilitation, Mr O’Connor said.

“Everything about these new facilities is designed to reduce re-offending – in order to improve public safety and ultimately to reduce the prison population so that our tax dollars can be spent in more productive areas such as health and education.”

The entire Spring Hill facility is enclosed by a highly secure perimeter wall with a controlled single point of entry. The perimeter consists of two fence lines, which incorporate detection technology. A sterile zone between the two fence lines lessens the likelihood of contraband being introduced.

Mr O’Connor said prisoners will be encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and progress through the system. They will face sanctions or opportunities depending on their attitudes and willingness to improve their behaviour.

“From a rehabilitation point of view, prisoners will undertake work and develop new skills through training. Required health and rehabilitation programmes, including extensive six-month-long drug and alcohol treatment courses announced under the Government’s Effective Interventions initiative, will be available.

“Employment opportunities being explored for Spring Hill include engineering and stainless steel fabrication, furniture assembly activities, a nursery to develop horticulture and nursery skills and a 65 hectare dry stock farm.”

The modern purpose-built facility is built to last for 100 years. It will have 280 staff and will receive prisoners from November.

Mr O'Connor thanked the local community, the Ngati Naho Kaitiaki Society, the prime contractors, subcontractors and the Corrections Department for seeing the construction stage of the project through to completion.

"The facility was one of North Waikato’s largest construction projects and is a big local employer. Corrections wants to be a good neighbour and, with the help of local businesses, iwi and community groups, will provide skills and manpower specifically targeted for the local labour market.”
