Two years young and the Fiordland Marine Guardians’ are taking action to safeguard Fiordland from marine pests.

Welcoming their Annual Report, acting Minister for the Environment David Parker says the Guardians’ ability to identify biosecurity issues is crucial and a reflection of the success of the Fiordland initiative.

One of the Guardians’ main roles under the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Management Act is to advise government agencies of any threats facing Fiordland’s marine environment.

“The Fiordland initiative is about local people stepping forward to protect this treasured environment, and represents a grass roots example of communities taking action,” David Parker said.

The Guardians’ advice to MAF Biosecurity New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Ministry for the Environment was that more direct action needed to be taken to stop undaria (invasive seaweed) reaching Fiordland. As a result, a control programme is now underway.

“MAF Biosecurity New Zealand is developing long-term strategies to reduce the risk of invasion by all high-risk marine pests into the Fiordland Marine Area,” he said.

Chairman of the Guardians, Malcolm Lawson, says the threat is heightened by undaria’s presence in Bluff Harbour and Stewart Island, which are two of the major departure points for vessels travelling to Fiordland.

"We recognised that if no action was taken it was only a matter of time until undaria became established in Fiordland and this would have had an irreversible effect on the marine environment," Malcolm Lawson said.

Other important work over the year included planning for the Fiordland Marine Area User Survey. More than 900 questionnaires were completed and 39 key informants interviewed. Full results will be available by the end of this year.

"The results from this survey will influence the advice and recommendations we make to the government agencies in the future."

Malcolm says a highlight for the Guardians is that as well as holding public discussions, their new media channels are proving very successful.

“Our website has around 500 visits a month and our newsletter is another way to reach the more than 400 individuals and organisations,” he said.
