Prime Minister Helen Clark will be in Europe next week for high level talks with the leaders of Britain, France, NATO, and the European Union, to attend the ninetieth anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium, and take part in trade and tourism promotions around the Rugby World Cup.

"The meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and new French President Nicolas Sarkozy come soon after each has taken office. Gordon Brown is well known to me in his former capacity as Chancellor of the Exchequer. I consider he will be a good friend of New Zealand in his new capacity.

"New Zealand has wide ranging relationships with both Britain and France, not least in trade, where Britain, in particular, is still a large partner. We share common views and perspectives on many major international issues with both countries,' Helen Clark said.

"The European Union is also one of New Zealand's most important bilateral relationships. In Brussels I will have talks with the European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy High Representative, Javier Solana.

"In light of our increasing co-operation with NATO peace keeping operations, I will also meet its Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer again."

While in Britain, Helen Clark will meet former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is now the Quartet Middle East Envoy. She will also attend a service at the refurbished grave of former New Zealand Governor-General and World War Two military commander Lord Freyberg. She will deliver speeches at the Oxford Union and Southampton University.

"A highlight of the visit will be the commemorations at Passchendaele in Flanders which was the scene of New Zealand's worst military disaster. A Shared Memories Arrangement will be signed with the government of Flanders.

"In October 1917, during two battles on 4 and 12 October, more than 1300 young New Zealand men were killed and thousands more were injured. Loss on this scale had a major impact on New Zealand, which at that stage had a population of just one million.

"I am honoured to be taking part in ceremonies at several of the battle sites to remember our fallen soldiers," Helen Clark said.

While in Paris, the Prime Minister is also officially opening the "New Zealand Rugby Ball", the tourism and trade promotion venue set up at the base of the Eiffel Tower during the Rugby World Cup. She is also scheduled to attend the All Blacks' World Cup Quarterfinal in Cardiff, and take part in a New Zealand Trade and Enterprise organised event there.

"The World Cup is one of the world's biggest sporting events and it makes sense to use this opportunity to promote the trade and tourism opportunities New Zealand can offer and to raise our profile on the international stage," Helen Clark said.
