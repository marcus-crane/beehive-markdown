A new language resource launched today will help preserve and protect the Tokelauan language and culture for our grandchildren, says Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Tau Gagana Tokelauan language resource is a part of the Labour-led government’s Mind Your Language programme and joins the Cook Island and Niuean resources launched last month.

Speaking at the launch in Wellington today, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said that of the 6,800 Tokelauan people living in New Zealand, only 40 per cent could hold an everyday conversation in their native tongue.

“We want to see that number increase, especially amongst our younger New Zealand born Tokelauans,” said Laban.

“The comprehensive resource includes three work books at different levels of ability, and a Tokelauan calendar that everyone in the family can learn together,” said Laban.

“This new resource is fabulous news for New Zealand’s Tokelauan communities. New Zealand has a special relationship with Tokelau and I hope our Tokelauan communities embrace the opportunity to learn their language.

“Losing a language is to lose diversity, culture and identity. Everyone suffers. Today we celebrate an important milestone that will help ensure Tokelauan will not be lost,” said Laban.

The Tau Gagana Tokelauan Mind Your Language programme is a part of the Labour-led government’s $600,000 allocated in Budget 2006 to support and revive Pasifika languages at risk of becoming extinct.

One research estimate suggests that nearly half of the world’s 7000 languages will be extinct by the end of the century. Laban said it was not only important to preserve Tokelauan, but also important to preserve it in New Zealand.

“I wish to congratulate and thank the Tokelau Mind Your Language Working Group and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs for bringing this wonderful resource into fruition,” said Laban.
