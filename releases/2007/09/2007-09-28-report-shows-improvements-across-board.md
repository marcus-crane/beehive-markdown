The latest annual report on school performance shows our students are achieving more qualifications and skills, across years, levels, ethnicities and gender, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey has presented the ‘Schools Sector Report 2006’ to Parliament. It reviews school finances, assesses student achievement and engagement, and rates the quality of schooling and the effectiveness of teachers.

“This report shows only one in ten students left school with little or no formal attainment last year, down from one in five students in 2002. This improvement, which follows the introduction of NCEA, is a huge achievement considering there had been little progress for the previous 20 years.

“It also highlights that the achievement of Mâori and Pasifika students is improving. In 2006, 22 per cent of Mâori and 12 per cent of Pasifika left school with little or no formal attainment, down from 35 per cent of Mâori and 26 per cent of Pasifika in 2002.”

“This is further proof that NCEA is a world-class qualifications system that is consistently raising achievement. Gaining school qualifications measurably improves student outcomes after leaving school, including lower unemployment and higher incomes.”

The report shows the Literacy and Numeracy Professional Development Projects are also successfully boosting achievement. The biggest improvement in literacy is for students who were in the lowest 20 percent of achievers.

“It also finds the Labour-led government has significant increased school funding, and the vast majority of schools are managing their finances well. New Zealand is now the second highest in the OECD for public expenditure on schools as a percentage of GDP as seen in the OECD ‘Education at a glance’ report.

“This government is delivering a better education system, with more qualified teachers, more resources in schools, and more students staying at school longer. Investment in schools has increased from $3.9 billion in 1999 to $5.8 billion this year.

"There is still work underway to help students to do better, including reducing early leaving exemptions and truancy. The Mâori education strategy, Ka Hikitia, is also focusing on initiatives that we know improve Mâori achievement."
