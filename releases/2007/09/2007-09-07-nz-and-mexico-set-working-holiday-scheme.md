A new reciprocal working holiday scheme between New Zealand and Mexico was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Helen Clark and the President of Mexico, Felipe Calderón Hinojosa in Auckland today.

Helen Clark welcomed the agreement as a great opportunity for young New Zealanders to enjoy the experience of living and working in Mexico. The reciprocal nature of the scheme means that young Mexicans will be encouraged to come and experience New Zealand.

“Under this scheme up to 200 young people aged between 18 and 30 can visit and work for a year in the host country.

“It will enable both New Zealand and Mexican young people to experience each other’s countries and cultures.

“Today’s signing builds on our strengthening ties with Latin American nations. New Zealand has had working holiday schemes with Argentina and Uruguay since 2003 and, Chile since 2002. The scheme has been so successful with young travellers from Argentina and Chile that places have been progressively increased from 300 and 200 respectively, to 1000 places each today. The Working Holiday Scheme with Uruguay offers 100 places.

“Mexico is one of the key countries under the Government’s Latin America Strategy, and this scheme recognises the importance of developing a relationship that helps to increase contact and understanding,” Helen Clark said.

The New Zealand-Mexico Working Holiday Scheme was signed in the presence of Helen Clark and President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa at Government House in Auckland.
