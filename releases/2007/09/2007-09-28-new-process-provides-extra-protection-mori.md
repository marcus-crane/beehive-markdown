A new process covering the sale of Crown land will provide another layer of protection for Māori interests, says Māori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

The government today announced the new process for the sale of all Crown-owned land to ensure national interests including heritage, cultural, local and recreational values are better protected.

The process modifies an interim one put in place in April after concerns were raised about the proposed Landcorp sale of Whenuakite on the Coromandel Peninsula and Rangiputa in Northland.

State-Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard also announced that Landcorp had agreed to retain ownership of nine properties, including Whenuakite and Rangiputa, in return for market value compensation from the Crown.

"Labour's Māori caucus took a close interest in the review to ensure Māori interests were accounted for and I'm pleased the new measures will achieve this.”

"Under the new process government departments, Crown entities and state-owned enterprises will notify Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) if the land meets the criteria for "potential interest". LINZ will assess whether the land should be protected and ministers will make the final decision."

The Office of Treaty Settlements would be asked to assess potential claim issues and Te Puni Kōkiri would be required to determine whether Māori cultural values needed protection, Mr Horomia said.

Cultural values may include the presence of one or more of the following features on a piece of land: burial places, traditional religious ceremony sites, wānanga sites, sources of water for healing or death rites, sites for gathering of traditional food or resources, battle sites, traditional housing sites, boundary markers or acknowledged sacred landmark features, Mr Horomia said.

"Existing Crown land disposal processes including the landbanking Protection Mechanism and Sites of Significance will remain in place, but the new process adds a new layer of protection for Māori interests in several ways."

Under existing processes individual Māori are required to apply to have surplus land landbanked or wāhi tapu sites protected.

Under the new process a wide variety of land, including surplus Crown-owned non-urban land over five hectares, will be assessed for ''sensitive values". This will allow officials to assess if the land has cultural value to Māori beyond the narrower definition of wāhi tapu used in the Sites of Significance process and potential claimant interest in the land for Treaty settlements.

For the first time, key landholding state owned enterprises and all Crown entities are expected to use processes which take national interests, such as those of Māori, into account before selling land, Mr Horomia said.

"The Protection Mechanism and the Sites of Significance processes were not applicable to land held by those agencies. This plugs a gap in terms of the recognition of Māori interests in Crown land sales outside of government departments."

"In addition the process strengthens the obligation on government departments to ensure Māori and other national interests are considered for protection when land is being sold."

I runga i tētahi whakaritenga hou e pā ana ki te hokohoko whenua Karauna, ka whakawhiwhia tētahi ake takotoranga whakamaru mō ngā pānga Māori, e kī ana te Minita Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia.

I te rangi nei ka pānuitia e te kāwanatanga te whakaritenga hou mō te hokohoko i ngā whenua pupuri Karauna katoa, kia pūmau te whakamaru pai ake o ngā pānga ā-motu, tāpiri atu ki ngā wāriu taonga tuku iho, tikanga, rohe kāinga, me hākinakina.

Ka whakarerekē e tēnei whakaritenga tētahi ritenga wā poto o te marama o Paenga-whāwhā a-muri i ngā whakahē i puta mō ngā whakaaro kia hokona atu e Landcorp a Whenuakite kei Hauraki, me Rangiputa kei Te Taitokerau.

I pānuitia anō e te Minita mō ngā Hinonga Kāwanatanga, a Trevor Mallard, kua whakaāe a Landcorp ki te pupuri mau ngā whenua e iwa, kei roto i ēnei ko Whenuakite me Rangiputa, i runga i te utunga kāpeneheihana wāriu mākete, mai i te Karauna.

“I āta titiro tata tonu te uepu Māori o Reipa ki te aromatawai ki te whakapūmau ka tiakina te whaipānga o te Māori, me taku harikoa ka tutuki ēnei whaipānga e ngā tikanga hou nei.”

“I raro i ngā whakaritenga hou ka whakamōhio atu ngā tari kāwanatanga, ngā mauri Karauna, me ngā hinonga Kāwanatanga, ki Toitū te Whenua (TtW) mehemea ka taka iho te whenua ki ngā paearu mō te “ whaipānga pūmanawa nohopuku”. Mā TtW e aromatawai mehemea me whakamarutia te whenua, ā, mā ngā minita te whakataunga whakamutunga.”

I kī a Horomia, ka inoitia te Tari Whakatau i raro I te Tiriti ki te aromatawai i ngā take kerēme ka puta, ā, mā Te Puni Kōkiri e whakatau mehemea me whakamarutia ngā pānga wāriu tikanga Māori.

Tērā kō ngā wāriu tikanga ka tāpiri atu ki te aroaro o tētahi, o ētahi rānei o ngā āhuatanga kei runga i tētahi wāhi whenua: urupä, wāhi tapu, wāhi wānanga, puna wai rongoā whakamahu, tikanga tūpāpaku, wāhi kohikohi kai, kohikohi rawa, wāhi pakanga, wāhi whare Māori, pou tohu rohenga, wahi whenua tapu rānei, i kī a Horomia.

“ Ka mau tonu ngā whakaritenga whakawhiti whenua Karauna, tāpiri atu ki ngā whakahaere Tikanga Whakamaru, me ngā Wāhi Rongonui, pupuri whenua, ëngari ka tāpiri atu ki ngā whakaritenga hou, tētahi papanga hou, hei tiaki whakamaru i ngā whaipānga Māori I raro I ētahi momo ahua.”

I raro ngā whakaritenga ināianei, me tono kē te Māori ngātahi kia pupuritia te whenua toenga, kia whakamarutia rānei te whenua wāhi tapu.

I raro i ngā whakaritenga hou, he whānui ake ngā momo whenua, tāpiri atu ki ngā toenga whenua Karauna kei waho o ngā tāone, rahi ake te rima heketea, ka aromatawaitia mō ngā “wāriu aro atu”. Tēnei ka tuku i ngā kaimahi kāwnatanga ki te aromatawai mehemea he wāriu tikanga tō te whenua ki te Māori, i tua atu i te whakamāramatanga whāiti o te wāhi tapu i whakamahia nei i roto i ngā whakaritenga Wāhi Rongonui, me te pānga pūmanawa nohopuku a ngā kaikerēme ki te whenua mō ngā whakataunga Tiriti.

He mea tuatahi tēnei, te whakahau i ngā hinonga pupuri whenua take nui a te kāwanatanga, me ngā mauri Karauna katoa, ki te whakamahi i ngā whakaritenga ki te aro atu ki ngā whaipānga ā-motu, pērā i tā te Māori, i mua o te hokonga i ngā whenua, i kī a Horomia.

Kahore ngā whakaritenga Tikanga Whakamaru me ngā Wāhi Rongonui, e pā ana ki ngā whenua e pupuri ana e ēra pokapū. Mā tēnei e whakakī i te āputa mō te whakamōhio i ngā whaipānga o te Māori ki ngā kaupapa hokohoko whenua Karauna i waho ake o ngā tari kāwanatanga.”

“I tua atu,ka whakapakaritia e ngā whakaritenga nei te here i ngā tari kāwanatanga ki te whakapūmau e whakaarotia ana ngā whaipānga Māori, ā-motu rānei, kia whakamarutia i ngā wā kei te hokona atu te whenua.”
