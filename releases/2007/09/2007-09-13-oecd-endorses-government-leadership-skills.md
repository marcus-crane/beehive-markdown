An OECD report shows New Zealand has made considerable progress in integrating skills and economic development policies at the regional and national level since the election of the Labour-led government in 1999, and there are now opportunities to take that work even further, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The *Integrating Employment, Skills and Economic Development* report finds there was little central government attention paid to regional economic development prior to 1999, but there has since been a great deal of work to integrate labour market and vocational training policies.

Michael Cullen said the report is welcome, particularly as it comes at a time when the government is working with trade unions, business leaders and industry training organisations to develop a new, unified skills strategy.

"Since 1999, New Zealand has seen more people in work than ever before, more people in industry training, more young people getting skills through apprenticeships, and record levels of participation in tertiary education," Michael Cullen said.

"The OECD report finds that the government’s work with councils, businesses, unions and the training sector has been a major driver of this success. But the OECD is correct in its call for further action.

"One of the consequences of our record-low unemployment rate has been persisting skills shortages.

"While we continue to see more and more New Zealanders enter the workforce and more gaining qualifications, we need to grow those numbers and ensure people have the right skills to meet industry demands.

"I am working with my colleagues Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey and Labour Minister Ruth Dyson through the Skills New Zealand Forum on a new skills strategy that will unify actions across government to ensure that New Zealanders are able to develop and use the skills needed in the future."

Michael Cullen said he expected to make further announcements on a strategy before the end of the year.
