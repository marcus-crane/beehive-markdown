The Crown today signed a new deed of settlement with the Tûwharetoa Mâori Trust Board regarding Lake Taupô.

The deed updates a 1992 deed which vested ownership of the bed of Lake Taupô - including the Waikato River to Huka Falls and tributaries flowing into the lake - with the Board while guaranteeing public access.

Since 1926, the Crown paid Tûwharetoa an annuity and a share of revenue from things such as trout fishing licences and boating facilities. But the value of the annuity decreased over time and the Crown and the Board wanted to clarify rights under the 1992 deed.

The new deed includes a one-off, lump sum payment of approximately $9.85 million plus an annual, non-reviewable payment of $1.5 million. The lump sum compensates the Board for increases it would have been entitled to in perpetuity under previous arrangements.

The Board will also have the right to licence commercial users of the lake and new Crown and private structures. It has already entered into an agreement with at least one commercial operator.

Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said he was pleased matters left outstanding from the 1992 settlement had been resolved.

"Under the agreement the trust board's rights on a number of fronts have been clarified, including in regard to commercial tourism operators where the board will have the ability to charge fees similar to those charged by DoC on Crown land."

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said the Crown would continue to own and manage the trout fishery.

“This is a significant document which will lead to a stronger and clearer relationship between the Crown and Tûwharetoa while continuing to protect public access to the lake in perpetuity,” Mr Carter said.  
Local Government Minister and Taupô MP Mark Burton welcomed the signing saying: “I’m pleased to see that the discussions have resulted in a deed which provides clarity for tourist operators, the Crown and other users of Lake Taupô.
