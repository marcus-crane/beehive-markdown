National Party Health Spokesperson Tony Ryall has painted himself into a corner with his assertion that the removal of the doctors fees cap was signalled some time ago Health Minister Pete Hodgson said.

"The rather obvious question is why didn't this plan get mentioned in National's 45 page discussion document - Mr Ryall is clearly being disingenuous," Pete Hodgson said

"This is not the first time Mr Ryall has made sure the facts don't get in the way of a good story. For Example he has spent the past two years claiming that elective surgery procedures have been declining when the facts show that there more elective surgery carried out now than ever before," Pete Hodgson said.

"Mr Ryall needs to pay more attention to telling the truth from the outset."
