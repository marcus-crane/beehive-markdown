[JAS-ANZ](http://www.jas-anz.com.au/showpage.php) oversees and maintains a joint accreditation system to improve export opportunities and strengthen trade between New Zealand and Australia and other countries.

Lianne Dalziel said she was pleased to re-appoint Mike Willing to the Governing Board.

“He has the technical knowledge based on over 25 years of experience in the development and implementation of quality systems and processes, and also the capacity to galvanise the Board and build capability.”

Before joining NZQA, he was with Fonterra as Compliance and Product Conformance Manager; and prior to that, Quality Manager for Global Operations at the New Zealand Dairy Board.

**Background**

JAS-ANZ was established by a treaty between New Zealand and Australia in 1991. JAS-ANZ, through its accreditation and certification programmes, enhances trans-Tasman trade and assists exporters by gaining international recognition. In addition to quality management and product certificates, JAS-ANZ issues certificates of environmental management systems which have increasing potential to add value to products in the global market place in response to rising customer awareness.

The Board has ten members, six of whom are appointed by the Australian Government and three by the New Zealand Government. The Chief Executive of JAS-ANZ is the tenth member. One of the Australian members and one of the New Zealand members are appointed as representatives of the government of each party to the treaty. New Zealand and Australia rotate the Chair and Vice-Chair responsibilities.
