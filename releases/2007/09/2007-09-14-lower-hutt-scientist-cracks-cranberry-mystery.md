Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today congratulated Hutt South and Industrial Research Ltd scientist Dr Lai Yeap Foo for his groundbreaking international research into the benefits of cranberries.

"It's excellent to hear about the work of Dr Yeap Foo and to meet him in person .This Lower Hutt scientist was responsible for the groundbreaking research into the chemical compounds of the cranberry that inhibit urinary tract infections - following his research there has been stunning growth in the cranberry market internationally - not just as a drink but in health products as well.

"As Economic Development Minister, this is the sort of story I really like to hear about. It shows New Zealanders are at the cutting edge of innovation and research - and it shows we can develop solutions to problems that have international companies stumped.

"New Zealand is internationally recognised for our biotechnology expertise - and Dr Yeap Foo is one of our many scientists who contribute to this success. It's excellent to see also the collaboration between IRL and scientists like Dr Yeap Foo with companies who need the research to develop their products and grow into successful exporters. All this is crucial for growing our economy and turning New Zealand into a high wage exporting country.

Dr Yeap Foo, who works for Industrial Research Limited at Gracefield - a Crown Research Institute - was contracted in the late 1990s by American researchers to \`\`isolate and identify the cranberry compounds that are responsible for providing urinary tract health''.

Earlier this week there was a presentation for Dr Yeap Foo to celebrate his achievements and to recognise his major contribution to international molecular nutrition and food science.

Since his work on cranberries, Dr Yeap Foo's research has led to the first commercialisation of an antioxidant derived from Evening Primrose waste and the establishment of a Blenheim company to produce a solvent-free antioxidant from grape seeds. Currently, Dr Yeap Foo is working on new natural functional ingredients for use in cosmetics for a New Zealand company.
