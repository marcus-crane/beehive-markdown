Members of Parliament were today encouraged to get active in the lead up to Sport and Recreation New Zealand's (SPARC) 2007 Push Play Nation campaign which launches on Sunday 16 September 2007.

Concluding with national Push Play Day on 2 November 2007, Push Play Nation is about having fun while working physical activity into everyday life so that it becomes a healthy habit.

"With summer just around the corner, it’s the perfect time for everyone to dust off their walking shoes, pull the bike out of the garage and explore New Zealand’s fabulous back-yard," Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said.

"I encourage everyone in parliament, at work, or at home, to get active and make the 2007 Push Play Nation campaign a great success."

The 2007 Push Play Nation campaign builds on the success of last year's campaign and provides ideas about fun ways to be active with programmes from well known New Zealand personalities including Maggie Barry; Petra Bagust; Robbie Magasiva; Tawera Nikau; and Mike Chunn.

This year, activity diaries have been produced which allow participants to create a personalised fitness programme and record their progress over twelve months. Activity diaries come with a green and white wristband for participants to wear during the seven weeks of the campaign, and spot prizes will be awarded to people seen wearing them during the campaign.

Limited stocks of activity diaries will be available for free from Rebel Sport, Countdown supermarkets or Avanti dealers nationwide or the diary can be downloaded from the SPARC website [www.sparc.org.nz](http://www.sparc.org.nz).

Adults are encouraged to engage in thirty minutes of moderate intensity physical activity at least five days per week.

"Being physically active has proven health benefits and is a great way to reduce stress. I encourage everyone to push play this month - you'll feel better and contribute to a healthier and more active New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.

SPARC is the crown entity responsible for promoting, encouraging and supporting sport and physical recreation in New Zealand.
