The silence from National on the future of asset testing in the aged care sector speaks volumes, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

“National’s long awaited policy released today comes less than three months after they voted against the largest investment ever into the health of older people - around $400 million over four years, for residential and home-based support. The investment was explicitly designed to address low pay in the sector and thereby to reduce the high level of staff turnover. National has opposed these initiatives every step of the way.”

In 2005 this Labour-led government increased the threshold for asset testing from $15,000 to $150,000 and has been increasing the exemption thresholds by $10,000 every year since 2005. From 1 July next year single people and couples with both partners in care will be able to keep up to $180,000 in assets, says Pete Hodgson.

"Labour will continue to invest in the health of older New Zealanders and will continue to invest in raising the rate of superannuation. We're confident that older New Zealanders will judge parties on their actions, not hollow rhetoric. In particular older New Zealanders need to know that any National government would not fund resthome increases by reintroducing asset testing as they did when last in power."
