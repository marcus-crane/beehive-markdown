Disability Issues minister and Banks Peninsula MP Ruth Dyson today paid tribute to city councillor and cyclist Graham Condon, who died yesterday.

"Canterbury and New Zealand have lost an outstanding athlete and civic leader, a passionate and generous giver of time and talent," said Ruth Dyson.

Graham Condon was killed yesterday in Christchurch following a motor vehicle crash, during his bike training.

"Graham Condon has represented our country many times in the paralympics, and remained  
actively involved in athletics, including his bid for masters competition in the near future. His sports leadership was an inspiration to many."

"As a civic leader, Graham has been a Christchurch City Councillor for many years and was seeking re-election next month. He was a shameless and tireless promoter  
of Canterbury as a host city; for strong social amenities in our region; and for improved access to sports facilities for all our residents."

"His contribution will be greatly missed."

"I extend my sincere sympathy to Kathy and Graham's family. We will feel his loss very strongly," said Ruth Dyson.
