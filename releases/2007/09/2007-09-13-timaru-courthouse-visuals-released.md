Courts Minister Rick Barker released visuals for the new Timaru District Courthouse in a visit to the city today.

“The Timaru courthouse was built in 1877 and is rightly classified as a historic building. Justice has been carried out on the site for 130 years and I am delighted that the design maintains the integrity of the existing building while meeting the future needs of the local community,” Rick Barker said.

“The new Timaru courthouse will have two courtrooms, one designed specifically for jury trials with jury retirement rooms, two mediation/hearing rooms, custodial rooms and cells and large public and administrative spaces,” said Rick Barker.

The refurbishment of the existing courthouse will include extensions between North Street and Heaton Street.

Rick Barker said the new courthouse will be a modern design addressing past space and security concerns.

“Security in the existing courthouse has been an issue in the past because its open plan design did not separate the public, offenders and juries. The new courthouse will incorporate modern security design.”

Construction of the new courthouse is scheduled to begin in early 2008 with completion expected by mid-2009.
