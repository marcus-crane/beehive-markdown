A raft of appointments has been made to the Sports Tribunal, including the reappointment of retired High Court Judge and former New Zealand Cricket president Barry Paterson as the tribunal's chairman, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The Sports Tribunal is now a fully independent body governed by the Sports Anti-Doping Act 2006, and its functions include adjudicating on anti-doping cases, determining sports-related disputes and hearing appeals against decisions of sports organisations.

Also reappointed are Nick Davidson QC, a Christchurch barrister who is a judicial officer for the NZRU, SANZAR and the IRB, as deputy chair, and existing members Carol Quirk, a former President of Surf Life Saving New Zealand; Tim Castle, a barrister who is on the International Court of Arbitration for Sport; Adrienne Greenwood, former Chief Executive of Yachting New Zealand; and Ron Cheatley MBE, elite cycling coach and Halberg Coach of the Year in 1989/90 and 1998.

"These reappointments will help provide the Sports Tribunal with continuity as it takes on new responsibilities under the Sports Anti-Doping Act," Trevor Mallard said.

Under the Act, the Sports Tribunal is responsible for hearing evidence about sports anti-doping cases as well as imposing penalties on athletes, coaches or other persons who have committed anti-doping violations.

In its most recent decision this week, the Sports Tribunal suspended body builder Niko Toluono for 2 years for refusing to supply a urine sample for drug testing at the Auckland Body Building Championships.

Trevor Mallard paid tribute to two retiring members of the Sports Tribunal, former Black Fern, Dr Farah Palmer, and top Auckland barrister, Kit Toogood QC.

"Both Farah and Kit were original members of the Tribunal and have done a lot to establish its excellent reputation and track record, and I would like to thank them for their hard work."

Job advertisements for three new Sports Tribunal members are being placed in the sports sections of the major papers this weekend.
