Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that New Zealand and Canada have completed the negotiation of a new, open Air Transport Agreement.

The agreement was finalised at a meeting between Helen Clark and her Canadian counterpart, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who are both in Sydney for the APEC summit.

The Agreement would replace arrangements dating back to 1985 and comes after the adoption by Canada of a “Blue Sky” international air policy in November last year.

“We are delighted that Canada agreed to hold air services negotiations with New Zealand so early in the process of implementing its new policy,” Helen Clark said.

“It reflects the close friendship that Canada and New Zealand have always enjoyed and will be of great benefit to travellers, as well as promoting enhanced trade linkages.

"The new arrangements will remove existing restrictions on both the routes and frequency of services flown by New Zealand and Canadian airlines.

"The agreement will create major new opportunities through the removal of capacity and route constraints. New Zealand airlines, for example, would have the option of providing services to Europe via Canada.

"The new arrangements will come at an opportune time, with Air New Zealand due to recommence services to Vancouver at the beginning of November.

“The government will use the inaugural flight for a trade mission to promote tourism and trade between New Zealand and Canada.

“The Canadian Government is working to reinforce Vancouver’s role as a gateway to North America for the Asia Pacific region.

Under the current arrangements Canadian and New Zealand airlines have been restricted to operating four flights each per week. Open code-share arrangements, which Canada had required to be renewed every two years, would now be on a permanent basis.

Canada is currently New Zealand’s seventh largest source of tourists.
