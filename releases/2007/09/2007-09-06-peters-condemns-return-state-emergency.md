Foreign Minister Winston Peters today condemned the Fiji Interim Government’s decision to re-impose emergency regulations.

“The Fiji Interim Government should be in no doubt; the international community is watching its actions very carefully,” Mr Peters said.

“The re-imposition today of emergency regulations is a clear signal that it is unwilling to heed the calls that have been made by the Pacific islands Forum and other key partners to get Fiji back on track to constitutional government.

“It appears the administration has no intention of permitting the kind of legitimate freedom of expression and respect for human rights that underpin genuine democracy. I am also compelled to call on them to respect the rights and the personal safety of Mr Qarase.

“The lifting of the emergency regulations by the end of May this year was a key milestone sought by the international community, which the Interim Government, albeit reluctantly, agreed to. Any hope that that action was the start of progress back towards democracy appears to have been short-lived.

“As an immediate step, we have asked our Acting High Commissioner in Suva to seek an emergency meeting of the Fiji/Pacific Islands Forum Joint Working Group to seek an explanation from the Interim Government as to the justifications for, and the likely duration of, this outrageous measure.

“Fiji’s interim administration has been urging New Zealand and other partners to lift the sanctions put in place after the coup. It defies logic to see how they can now expect serious consideration to be given to such appeals when their actions undermine any claims they make to be improving Fiji’s governance.

“New Zealand’s ties to Fiji and its peoples are longstanding and deep. Watching the way in which the interim regime is taking the country backwards causes us grave concern. Those who truly have Fiji’s best interests at heart must see that this is taking the country in the wrong direction,” Mr Peters said.
