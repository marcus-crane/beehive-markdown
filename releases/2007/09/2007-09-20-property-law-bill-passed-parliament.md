New Zealanders will find it easier to understand and apply the rules governing their property dealings due to today’s passage of the Property Law Bill by Parliament, says the Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove.

The Property Law Act 2007 clarifies and modernises the many complex, technical rules contained in the Property Law Act 1952 that apply to dealings in land and personal property.

“This legislation affects New Zealanders’ everyday lives, such as when they buy or sell a house, or if they run a business that involves borrowing money or leasing commercial premises. These dealings can involve mortgages and guarantees to secure loans – all of which come under property law,” Mr Cosgrove said. “It is vital that this law is up to date, clear and accessible.”

The new Act is largely based on Law Commission recommendations that aim to create modern, more user-friendly legislation for people buying or selling property, mortgaging their property to raise finance, or entering into commercial leases of land.

Mr Cosgrove said the changes brings certainty for people and protects their rights over property transactions, as well as ensures the relationship between the parties to a lease is reasonable and fair.

Examples of reforms within the new Act include:

•Extending the current law that lessors cannot unreasonably refuse their consent to a lessee’s request to transfer or sublease premises to someone else, to a lessee’s request to change the permitted use of premises.  
•Releasing lessees from liability for damage to commercially leased premises where damage results from events such as fire or flood or from any danger for which lessors are insured, provided that they have not intentionally caused the damage, or caused the damage through serious criminal offending, or caused the insurance monies to be irrecoverable.  
•Clarifying the rights of owners of a piece of land that provides access to their respective properties, particularly about repair and maintenance costs and disputes.  
•Extending the powers of the Court to make an order for compensation when modifying or extinguishing an easement or covenant, or to vary orders requiring the completion of work, such as the removal or trimming of trees, where circumstances change and the order is no longer appropriate.

Mr Cosgrove thanked the Law Commission for identifying the changes needed to make property law work even better for New Zealanders. “The new Act clarifies the law and makes it easier to understand and apply. Promoting certainty in property dealings will reduce the number of property law disputes,” he said.

&gt;b&gt;Property Law Bill Background Information

**What is the Property Law Act 2007?**  
The new Property Law Act rewrites existing property law in a modern statute making it more streamlined and user-friendly, thereby also reducing costs for businesses. Although a significant piece of legislation, the Act mostly restates and clarifies existing law with reforms recommended by the Law Commission in 1994.  
Why is new legislation needed?  
The Act replaces the Property Law Act 1952. Some of this Act’s provisions are obsolete and do not interact well with other legislation. The reforms have restated the existing rules clearly in modern language, modified parts that are no longer satisfactory and updated the general law principles.

**What does the new Act do?**  
The Act clarifies rules that apply to dealings in land or personal property, including goods. The rules apply when people buy and sell commercial or residential, or mortgage land or personal property. The rules also apply to commercially leased property and ensure that the relationship between the parties to a lease is reasonable and fair. There are many small reforms to the law of mortgages, which overall clarify and improve them. The Act codifies the existing law relating to the cancellation of leases that is currently found in several sources. The Act also codifies the law relating to the cancellation of agreements for sale and purchase.

**How will new Act affect New Zealanders?**  
The reforms clarify and improve existing property law which provides more certainty in peoples' property dealings, and help protect their rights. The reforms also help ensure the relationship between parties to a lease is reasonable and fair.

**What are some other examples of changes that will benefit people?**

•Clarifying the rights of people who share the ownership of a piece of land that provides access to their respective properties, particularly about repair and maintenance costs and disputes.  
•Extending the powers of the Court to include a power to make an order for compensation when modifying or extinguishing an easement or covenant, or to vary orders requiring the completion of work, such as the removal or trimming of trees, where circumstances change and the order is no longer appropriate.  
•Mortgagees will have to notify other interested parties (such as a friend or relative who guaranteed the mortgage) when exercising rights over a property after a mortgagor defaults on a mortgage. Currently only mortgagors have to be notified.  
•Unless otherwise agreed, commercial lessees will be required to leave a property in good condition at the end of a lease only if it was in good condition at the start of the lease. Currently they may be required to do so regardless of the condition of the property at the outset unless otherwise agreed.

**When will the Act come into force?**  
The Property Law Act 2007 is scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2008.
