Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons, today congratulated Westland District Council for its initiative to encourage solar water heating by waiving building consent fees.

“I am delighted that the Westland District Council is taking this positive step to encourage its homeowners to install solar water heating,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

Westland District Council has decided to waive the consent application fees for installations of alternative energy sources that are carbon neutral, including solar hot water heaters.

“Building consent fees for solar water heating vary significantly across councils and can be a price hurdle for homeowners considering installing a system.”

“I strongly encourage other councils to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability by following the example of the Westland District Council.”

Hot water accounts for around $800 of an average household energy bill. A well designed and installed solar water heating system can provide between 50 and 75 percent of a household’s annual hot water needs.

Solar water heating systems, including the cylinder, typically cost between $4000 and $8000 installed.

The Government is encouraging solar water heating as part of its broad approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. The programme includes: New guidelines for the installation of solar water heating which will streamline the building consent process; Motivating demand through independent information and promotion; Providing financial assistance to homeowners; Working with the building industry to encourage solar water heating on new housing, particularly volume-build developments; Working with the solar industry to improving information and capacity issues; Encouraging solar water heating systems on publicly owned buildings; and Encouraging new ideas through an Innovation Fund.
