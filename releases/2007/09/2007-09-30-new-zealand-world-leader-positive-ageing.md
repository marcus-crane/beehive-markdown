New Zealanders can be proud of their attitudes to ageing, says Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson, marking World International Day of Older Persons on 1 October.

"New Zealand is a world leader in promoting positive ageing. In 2001 the Labour-led government launched the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy which encourages older people to participate in their communities and recognises the value of their knowledge, skills and experience.

"The Strategy is backed by an annual report and action plan to measure how it is being implemented. There are now 37 government agencies and 31 local government authorities contributing to the action plan for 2007/2008. This is an increase of eight government agencies and ten local government authorities from last year’s plan.

"This year, particular emphasis has been placed on reporting new and innovative projects. I know that many central, regional and local government agencies are accomplishing a great deal more in the field of positive ageing.

"Our government's approach has been endorsed by the Secretary General of the United Nations, who in his recent report *Follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing*, said that adopting a specific older people’s strategy or plan, highlights the importance of ageing in the context of national social policy. He said that a plan on ageing helps to identify priorities and guide policy implementation.

"I would also like to thank the network of 40 Volunteer Community Co-ordinators (VCCs), who work alongside the Office for Senior Citizens, promoting positive ageing in their communities.

"I know that with the commitment of all sectors of society, New Zealand will continue to be a great place for older people to live."

**What our Labour-led government is doing for older New Zealanders**

We recently passed the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Amendment Act, which helps ensure vulnerable people have greater protections when setting up an enduring power of attorney. The legislation will ensure their wishes are carried out and that their interests and welfare are safeguarded.

The [SuperGold Card](http://www.supergold.govt.nz) has been launched, with discounts across a range of services and products to seniors. The Card, which has been developed with New Zealand First, recognises the contribution our senior citizens have made, and continue to make, to New Zealand.  
For example, to celebrate International Day of the Older Person, Horizons Regional Council is providing free travel to all SuperGold Card Holders, Monday to Friday, between 1 - 12 October.

This term, as part of our Confidence and Supply agreement with New Zealand First, we've increased the floor for New Zealand Super to not less than 66% of the Average Ordinary Time Weekly Wage for a married couple.

Around two thousand superannuitants with a spouse or partner in long-term residential care are now eligible to be paid the single, Living Alone rate of New Zealand Super. This change reverses a discriminatory situation that has existed since 1993.

Our government will continue with the phase out of income and asset testing for people in aged residential care. From 1 July this year single people and couples with both partners in care have been able to keep up to $170,000 in assets - up from $160,000 in 2006 - before they are used to contribute to the cost of their care. The exemption thresholds will increase by $10,000 each year, progressively removing asset testing.

Our government has lowered the cost of seeing a doctor or nurse, for people aged 65 and over since 2004, with most visits dropping by an average of $22. The cost of subsidised prescription medicines has also fallen from $15 per item to just $3 per item.

**Coming up**

The Government will develop a code of practice for home equity release schemes in order to provide a level of protection for older people's financial interests. These schemes allow older people to release some of the capital they have in their homes so that they can improve their lifestyle and age in place.
