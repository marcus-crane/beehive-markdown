National MP Jacquie Dean, having jumped on the anti-party pill political bandwagon, can’t seem to get off it even as the legislation banning BZP is going through the House, Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton said today.

“Talk about flogging a dead horse.

“The latest from her is that I am leaving City Councils to do “my dirty work” (her words not mine) by banning party pills from liquor outlets.

“I don’t see making an evidence-based decision to ban BZP nationally, after commissioning research and listening to experts is in any shape or form dirty work.

“Councils like Manukau are responding to the evidence now available on BZP. Banning pills from being sold in liquor outlets seems a good idea to me as pills mixed with alcohol make them even more harmful and I commend the Manukau City Council for its concern.

“But, banning BZP and related party pills altogether is an even better idea which is why I’m recommending it to the House.

“However, I will not be banning dihydrogen monoxide or asking for the experts to consider it, which is the latest bandwagon Ms Dean is looking to jump on.

“Because as I informed her, in response to her recent letter to me on the matter –dihydrogen monoxide is water!”
