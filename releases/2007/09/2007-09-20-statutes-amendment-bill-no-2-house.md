The Statutes Amendment Bill (No 2) 2007, which implements several minor, technical and non-controversial amendments to a number of Acts, had its First Reading in the House today.

Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove said Statutes Amendment Bills allow amendments to be made to several Acts in unison that would not otherwise receive sufficient priority to be progressed.

“Statutes Amendment Bills are consensus bills in that only those amendment proposals which attract the support of all Members of the House make it into the SAB and the Bill only progresses through the House with the support of all Members.

Mr Cosgrove said this Statutes Amendment Bill (No 2) 2007 contains amendments to some 14 Acts covering subject areas as diverse as bio-security, fisheries and national parks.

“For example, the amendment to the Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995 to substitute the term “video record” for the outdated term “videotape” will broaden the definition enough to cover digital video recordings. This brings the Act into line with technology we now use daily, but which wasn’t conceived when the Act was passed. This change will also reflect the terminology already in use in the Evidence Act 2006,” Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said an amendment to the National Parks Act 1980 will update the statute book by removing an incorrect reference and correcting a drafting error in the Act. And an amendment to the Veterinarians Act will bring that legislation into line with regulation of other professions, such as lawyers and teachers, by requiring proof of fitness to practice in order to be registered.

“These examples emphasise the usefulness of these small, technical and non-controversial changes being made together in one bill,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Statutes Amendment Bill (No 2) has been referred to the Government Administration Committee for consideration and public submission.
