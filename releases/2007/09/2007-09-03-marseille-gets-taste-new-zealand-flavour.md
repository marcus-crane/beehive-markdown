New Zealand will be in focus in Marseille this week as government builds on the All Blacks’ presence to ensure France’s southern capital gets a taste of Kiwi flavour, said Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard and Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today.

A programme to promote the best of New Zealand internationally kicks off this week. New Zealand food, wine, culture, and creative industries will be on display in Marseille where the All Blacks are based from 2-13 September.

"The All Blacks' stay in Marseille is an ideal opportunity to promote what New Zealand has to offer as a destination and build relationships across a wide range of industries," said Trevor Mallard.

International food and beverage media and trade contacts will attend a cooking master class on 6 September with New Zealand chef Peta Mathias, which will feature New Zealand lamb, venison and wine. Themed ‘Cooking with the All Blacks’, the class will include guest appearances by several team members and All Blacks nutritionist Glenn Kearney.

"The food and beverage sector contributes around half our GDP and Europe is a key market, so this is an ideal way to get key media and buyers to taste the New Zealand difference," said Trevor Mallard.

A showcase of New Zealand products will be in place at the Marseille Chamber of Commerce, where the NZ Inc reception will be held on 7 September.

Street workshops of poi, haka, and waiata will be run in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence by the London-based Manaia Performing Arts Company, who will also perform a contemporary Maori culture demonstration at the entrance to the Stade Vélodrome before the All Blacks’ first game on 8 September.

The vibrant New Zealand music industry will cap the week of New Zealand focus, with a concert after the game featuring The Black Seeds and DJs from Loop Records and Breaks Co-op.  
"We are very appreciative of the support shown by the Marseille city officials for these leveraging activities organised by New Zealand, which focus on raising New Zealand’s profile and relationship building across key sectors," said Damien O'Connor.  
From October 5, the focus of New Zealand’s promotion shifts to Paris, where New Zealand’s innovative rugby ball venue will be located for almost three weeks close to France’s iconic Eiffel Tower.

"It will become the hub for New Zealand-hosted tourism, trade and industry events, exhibitions, big screen viewings, functions and meetings, taking the best of NZ Inc to the world," Mr O'Connor said.
