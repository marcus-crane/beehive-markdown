Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that she is deeply disturbed by reports that force has been used against peaceful demonstrators in Myanmar.

“Engaging in peaceful protest is a fundamental human right. It is simply unacceptable for peaceful protestors to be shot, beaten or arrested. I urge the authorities in Myanmar to respect the rights of their citizens and stop using violence," Helen Clark said.

“I am concerned for the safety of those detained in Myanmar in recent weeks and for that of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. I add my voice to those of other world leaders who have called for restraint.“

Helen Clark welcomed news that the UN Secretary General is urgently dispatching his Special Envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to the region.

“The world is watching Myanmar. The authorities in Myanmar have an opportunity to engage in genuine and open dialogue with Myanmar’s democratic opposition to defuse the current situation. They should seize this opportunity.”

"Next week I am in Europe and have meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, EU Secretary-General and High Representative Javier Solana, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

"I expect the situation in Myanmar to feature prominently in these discussions," Helen Clark said.
