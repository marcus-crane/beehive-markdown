New legislation which implements recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct has passed its third reading, Justice Minister Mark Burton said today.

“This is a significant event in the history of civilian oversight of policing in New Zealand. Public confidence in the new Authority and in the Police will be enhanced” said Mark Burton.

The passage of the Independent Police Conduct Authority Amendment Bill was deferred awaiting the outcome of the Commission of Inquiry so that recommendations could be acted upon quickly.

“This Government is committed to having a police force in which all New Zealanders can have pride and confidence. To help achieve this, New Zealand needs a robust and independent police oversight body. All 12 recommendations from the Commission of Inquiry relating to the Police Complaints Authority will be implemented”, Mark Burton said.

The legislation also implements recommendations from Sir Rodney Gallen’s review of the Police Complaints Authority undertaken in 2000.

The main provisions in the legislation are:

- A name change: from the Police Complaints Authority to the Independent Police Conduct Authority, to emphasise it’s enhanced independence and it’s role, which is broader than the investigation of complaints;
- Clarifying that the Authority has the ability to investigate historic complaints;
- Requiring Police to notify the Authority no later than five working days of receiving a complaint;
- Enabling the Authority to refer minor matters back to the Police for investigation where it is appropriate to do so, allowing the Authority to concentrate on investigating serious matters. The Authority will maintain overall supervision of Police handling of complaints;
- Requiring the Authority to provide a copy of its opinion and recommendations to the Minister of Police and the Attorney-General if unsatisfied with Police’s response to a recommendation;
- Allowing the Authority to have up to five members. The expanded membership will allow wider representation and strengthen confidence in its independence.

Mark Burton said that the Authority has maintained a strong degree of confidence in the independence, impartiality and accountability. This legislation further enhanced it and sits alongside non-legislative changes, including the appointment of five investigative officers for the Authority to independently examine serious complaints.
