A poll indicating a large majority of New Zealanders support action on climate change has been welcomed by Climate Change Minister David Parker.

“New Zealanders know that climate change is a serious global challenge, and that everyone has to do their bit if we’re going to make a difference,” David Parker said.

“New Zealand also has its clean green image to protect. The world looks to us to take responsible action on environmental issues, and we are.”

A Colmar Brunton survey broadcast this evening on One News finds that 85 percent of New Zealanders believe the government should be introducing measures to reduce New Zealand’s impact on climate change.

“The good news is that taking action on climate change has many spin-off benefits. Saving energy reduces power bills. Improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles reduces air pollution that makes us sick. Better insulation makes our homes cosier and healthier. Planting trees can reduce erosion and improve water quality,” David Parker said.

“Later this week the government will be announcing the next steps in our programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“An emissions trading scheme will reduce emissions, and set our economy on a path to greater sustainability. This is the way the world is heading, and it will bring opportunities as the world’s markets increasingly demand low-emissions products and services,” the Minister concluded.
