New Zealand is close to finalising a working holiday scheme with Brazil, Trade Minister, Phil Goff said today from Brasilia. Minister Goff is currently leading a trade mission to four South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay.

"The scheme will initially be for several hundred people aged between 18 and 30 to travel in each direction each year and will help strengthen growing people to people links between our countries", Mr Goff said.

"Our current schemes between Argentina, Chile and Uruguay have proven hugely attractive to young Latin Americans and have been fully utilised. Argentina now has 1000 working holiday visas each year and they are all snapped up within three months of the quota being opened. A working holiday scheme was also recently concluded with Mexico.

"Our relationship with Brazil is starting to take off as the Brazilian economy grows. Tourist numbers grew by twenty per cent last year with over 11,000 tourists from Brazil visiting New Zealand. There is also strong demand for English language training in New Zealand with over 2200 Brazilian students studying in New Zealand last year.

"Working holiday schemes have proven really valuable to New Zealand. Tourists only come to New Zealand for a matter of days while those on working holiday visas are here, working, paying taxes, and spending their earnings for up to a year. At a time of shortages of labour in the horticulture and tourism industries those on working holidays have been of great assistance.

“The net impact of the working holiday schemes has actually been to generate more jobs and strengthen the economy"

“But most importantly working holiday schemes have helped build lasting relationships between young people from Latin American and New Zealanders. The schemes create in the countries where they operate a growing group of people who have an understanding and interest in our country. That will continue to benefit New Zealand for years to come’, Mr Goff said.
