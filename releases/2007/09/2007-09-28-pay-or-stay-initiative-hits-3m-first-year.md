The Pay or Stay collection of fines at airports initiative has seen $3 million in fines collected or arrangements to pay entered into in the first year of operation, Courts Minister, Rick Barker announced today.

The initiative enables the Ministry of Justice Collections Unit to catch people with unpaid reparation or fines if they are travelling overseas or returning to New Zealand.

"Since Pay or Stay began on 28 September 2006, $3 million has either been collected or put on arrangement," Rick Barker said.

“Pay or Stay has been successful in giving all New Zealanders a strong message that the system won’t tolerate people dodging the payment of their fines or reparation to victims. There’s only one way to deal with a reparations or fines, and that is to pay.

"The fact that people can be stopped coming into New Zealand or leaving should be a warning to everyone that we take a tough approach to those owing fines or reparation. The flow on effect of this message is that more people are entering in to an arrangement to pay outstanding reparations or fines before they travel, knowing if they don’t, they could be stopped at the border.

"Pay or Stay is an important part of this Labour-led Government's drive to make it tougher for those who don’t pay their fines, and easier for those who do," Rick Barker said.

A total of 87 fines defaulters have been intercepted through the initiative. The greatest number of fine defaulters intercepted was in December (18), followed by July (13), then October and January (9 each month).

In addition to the interceptions at airports, 892 people paid in full through Collections’ 0800PAYORSTAY phone line (0800 729 677), and 1500 people made partial payments through the phone line.
