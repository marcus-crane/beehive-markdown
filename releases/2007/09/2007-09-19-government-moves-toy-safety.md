The Government is issuing an unsafe goods notice banning children’s toys with excessive lead levels as a precautionary measure to further ensure the safety of New Zealand children.

"While we have not identified any specific problems with toys containing excessive lead levels, New Zealand does not currently have a regulated maximum lead content in toys," said Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

"Recent international recalls related to possible unsafe levels of lead in toys have brought to the attention of both Government and consumers the need to clarify safe practice on this issue. The Government is taking a proactive approach to specifying maximum allowable limits. This ban is an interim step until a mandatory standard can be developed and formalised," said Judith Tizard.

The Unsafe Goods Notice (Lead in Children’s Toys) will limit the permissible amount of lead in toys in line with international standards. Similar action is also being taken today by the Australian Government with the issue of a banning order that limits the levels of lead migration allowed in children’s toys to the same level.

"The Ministry of Consumer Affairs is working closely with Australian consumer agencies to develop regulations or mandatory requirements that will limit the maximum levels of lead and other toxic metals allowed in children’s toys," said Judith Tizard.

"This common approach between New Zealand and Australia will help ease compliance costs for suppliers, but more importantly introduce stronger safety standards for consumers in both countries. Regulating the limits on lead migration from toys will also clarify the safe limits for retailers and importers," says Judith Tizard.

The Unsafe Goods Notice (Lead in Children’s Toys) is issued under section 31 of the Fair Trading Act. It is enforced by the NZ Customs Service at the border and the Commerce Commission in the marketplace. Breaches of an unsafe goods notice attract penalties of up to $60,000 for an individual and up to $200,000 for a company. This ban will come into effect for 18 months from Thursday 20 September 2007.

"I encourage consumers to ask retailers if the toys they are buying have been produced in accordance with the requirements of the voluntary toy standard. If they have concerns about the toys they already own, they should also check with the retailer," Judith Tizard said.
