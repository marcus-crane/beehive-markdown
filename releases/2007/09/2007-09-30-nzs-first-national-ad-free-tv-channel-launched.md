Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today launched TVNZ 6, the first national advertisement free TV channel in New Zealand history.

“This marks the first new digital TV channel to be officially launched on free-to-air digital television on Freeview. Freeview is a group of free-to-air broadcasters leading the move to digital, including Television New Zealand, CanWest, Maori TV and Radio New Zealand.

“More than 41,000 households have already bought set-top boxes to watch free to air digital TV, and they can now watch TVNZ 6.

“TVNZ 6 will have daytime viewing for preschool children, family shows in primetime and drama and comedy programming in the evening.”

The programmes include a kiwi animation for preschoolers called ‘The Adventures of Massey Fergusson’, a New Zealand comedy/drama showing life though the eyes of a 15 year old called ‘Being Eve’, ‘The Gravy’, which is a new contemporary culture show, and the return of the Goodnight Kiwi each night.

“In March next year,TVNZ will launch its factual and news channel TVNZ 7, and Triangle TV is launching its Stratos digital channel of regional and diverse interest programming on Wednesday.

“The move to digital offers New Zealanders more opportunities to see their own stories and local programmes at more convenient times. It also means that TVNZ and local production companies have greater opportunities to create innovative new Kiwi programmes and series.

“The Labour-led government has committed $79 million over six years to support TVNZ’s digital television strategy. It has also provided $25 million over five years to Freeview, as well as providing access to free digital frequencies to support the development of free-to-air digital television.

"Free-to-Air digital television contributes to this government's core objective of building national identity. It will carry public broadcasting into the future, ensuring a visible and uniquely New Zealand presence in the diverse digital environment."
