Minister Pete Hodgson, acting for the Minister for the Environment, is encouraging anyone with views about Transpower’s proposed upper North Island electricity transmission line to make a submission.

“Now is the time to express your views about Transpower’s proposed new transmission line. Anyone can make a submission, whether you are in favour or opposed to the proposal,” said Mr Hodgson.

“An independent Board of Inquiry will consider all submissions and make final decisions about Transpower’s proposal. I will be announcing the Board members in the next week or so. The Board will be chaired by a current or former Environment Court judge.”

Transpower is proposing to build a new overhead electricity transmission line, underground cables and substations, from Whakamaru to Otahuhu and Pakuranga (Transpower’s proposed Upper North Island Grid Upgrade Project).

Minister Hodgson has called in Transpower’s proposal under the Resource Management Act. The Minister’s responsibility under the call in process involves publicly notifying Transpower’s application, seeking submissions and referring these to a Board of Inquiry. The Board considers all submissions and holds public hearings.

“I called in Transpower’s proposal because it has aroused widespread public interest regarding effects on the environment, it involves significant use of natural and physical resources and the proposed transmission line crosses so many councils’ boundaries. It is a nationally significant proposal and so it warrants a rare intervention under the Resource Management Act,” said Minister Hodgson.

All submissions must be received by 5pm on 5 October 2007. Submission forms can be obtained from local councils in Waikato and Auckland, from the Ministry for the Environment website (www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/call-in-transpower), or by phoning 0800 876 447.

Copies of Transpower’s application can be viewed at local councils in Waikato and Auckland, at Ministry for the Environment Offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, on Transpower’s website (www.gridnewzealand.co.nz) or information can be obtained by emailing [www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/call-in-transpower/](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/rma/call-in-transpower/)or phoning 0800 876 447.
