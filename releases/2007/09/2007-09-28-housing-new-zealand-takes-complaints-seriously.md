Housing Minister Chris Carter says Housing New Zealand (HNZ) took tenants’ complaints seriously and he had prepared a detailed reply to concerns raised by Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia over the condition of state housing in Porirua.

“I am responding in detail on a range of cases raised by the Maori Party over the quality of state housing in Porirua,” Mr Carter said.

“While I cannot discuss individual cases, my letter does explain to Mrs Turia the steps HNZ has or is taking in each case and does give further information which may satisfy some of her concerns.

“Earlier this year, after the issue of the generally poor condition of some HNZ homes in Eastern Porirua was raised, a community meeting was called and from that, work was completed on all the Corporation properties identified,” Mr Carter said.

Far from being neglected, Porirua was an area where a lot of work was being done by the Corporation to improve not just individual homes but whole streets under the Community Renewal programme, said the Minister.

Under Budget 2007, HNZ is spending $5.25 million on Community Renewal in Porirua alone with another $5.43 million being spent on modernisation programmes in the Wellington/Hutt Valley region which includes Porirua.

Community Renewal in Porirua targets the areas of McKillop Street, the top end of Champion Street and Mungavin Avenue, Cannons Creek, Westmeath/Waihemo and streets in the Castor Loop and Waitangirua Mall.

As well, another $500,000 is being spent in the Hutt Valley/Wellington region on the Healthy Housing programme and $882,000 on energy efficiency initiatives under HNZ’s retrofitting programme.

“I am happy for Mrs Tariana to raise individual issues with me. HNZ will continue to work with community organisations, community groups and local councils to deliver the best possible outcome for Porirua residents,” Mr Carter said.
