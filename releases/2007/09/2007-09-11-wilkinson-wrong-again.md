National MP Kate Wilkinson, deliberately or otherwise, is not telling the truth, Courts Minister Rick Barker said today.

Rick Barker was referring to a press release in which Wilkinson said there were 20 stays of proceedings for 'systemic' reasons in the last year.

“In reality, there has been nearly half this number,” said Rick Barker.

Since 1 July 2006 there have been 11 stays granted for reasons of systemic delay and 1 stay granted for reasons of systemic and prosecutorial delay. This compares with the over 195,000 cases disposed of through the Courts over the same period.

“While stays of proceeding are a matter of significant concern, as the data shows, fortunately in New Zealand they are rare compared to the overall volumes of cases.

“It is important to point out that four of the stays granted related to accommodation pressure in the Blenheim Courthouse. This has now been resolved through a renovation programme that has created more capacity,” said Rick Barker.

“New Zealand’s courts were run down in the nineties by the National Government and it has been left to the Labour-led Government to pick up the pieces. We have invested heavily in courts, appointed more judges and more staff, put in place more information technology systems and undertaken the largest court building programme in New Zealand’s recent history.

“Despite more cases coming before our courts our investments are making a difference. Both the High Court and District Courts are dealing with and disposing of more cases each year.

“National has no courts policy. All they can produce is flip flops. Last Sunday Kate Wilkinson said “more money being spent on justice does not translate to better justice” (Sunday Star Times, 9 September 2007). In May Simon Power said it was time more money was put into the courts system (New Zealand Herald, 1 May 2007).

“What Kate Wilkinson needs to explain is how spending less money on courts will improve anything. While I am all ears, I fear she has learnt nothing from the nineties,“ said Rick Barker.
