Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today announced new government funding to help community irrigation projects get off the ground.

“As part of the government's Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change package, Cabinet has approved funding for a Community Irrigation Fund. This is a contestable fund of $5.7 million spread over eight years. “

Mr Anderton said the government was aware that raising investor and community support for irrigation projects involves sustained high transaction costs. “Without sufficient funding, some of these schemes never get off the ground or developers scale back the size of the schemes they are proposing. When that happens, it is possible that opportunities for adapting to climate change are lost, with all the economic, social and environmental benefits that implies,” Jim Anderton said.

He was speaking at the launch in Wellington today of the new Irrigation New Zealand Code of Practice and Design Standards.

“More demand for water and a limited supply means inevitably that we have to do better at managing the resource,” Jim Anderton said. “The public expects that water will be managed by best practice principles.

“So I welcome this Code of Practice. It will help irrigators to achieve more efficient use of water.”

Jim Anderton noted that the benefits of irrigation have often been demonstrated but with increasing demands on New Zealand’s water resources, the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation systems are increasingly important.

“So this Code is directly contributing to New Zealand's bottom line. The especially pleasing feature of this Code is that it has been driven by the industry and I strongly urge the industry to continue its efforts to encourage its widespread adoption,” Jim Anderton said.
