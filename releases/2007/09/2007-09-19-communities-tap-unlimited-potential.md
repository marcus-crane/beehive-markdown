Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban took time last week to help celebrate with a few of the over 50 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) trainers who gathered in Wellington to graduate from the Unlimited Potential Learning Foundation (UPLIFT).

UPLIFT assists economically disadvantaged and under-served communities across the country to access ICT by providing skilled trainers at community organisations’ centres. The programme is well on its way to reaching the goal of providing over 4,000 people with ICT skills within two years.
