Nearly $8 million will be invested over the next two years to boost research capacity in the high-priority areas of nursing, veterinary science, and information and communications technology, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The funding is being allocated through the latest round of the Building Research Capability in Strategically Relevant Areas Fund.

“The Labour-led government is committed to backing research that will contribute to New Zealand’s society and economy,” Michael Cullen said.

“Nursing, veterinary science and ICT are all issues of major strategic importance for our country, but they haven’t always attracted enough investment to build a strong research culture.

“The University of Auckland and the University of Waikato will jointly receive $3.2 million to build an ICT research community within New Zealand, with a focus on excellence shown by young and emerging researchers. Computer science has a relatively short history of research in New Zealand despite the phenomenal growth of this discipline in recent years.

“A second award of $2.7 million is going to the University of Auckland for work on a nursing and health consortium to ensure the discipline can play a fuller role in academic research. Research will create opportunities for new knowledge to be passed on to the health sector, ultimately benefiting the health and well-being of all New Zealand families.

“The third award will see Massey University receive $2 million to enhance veterinary and large animal science research capability. Networks will be created to encourage collaboration and support technicians to become active researchers in this field”, Michael Cullen said.
