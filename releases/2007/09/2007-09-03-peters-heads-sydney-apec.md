Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves for Sydney tomorrow to attend the APEC Foreign Ministers Meeting, ahead of this weekend's Leaders Summit.

Mr Peters said climate change, trade, and human security issues were likely to dominate the agenda for Foreign Ministers.

“This year’s meeting will be an historic occasion, as APEC is returning for the first time to Australia, where it was launched back in 1989," Mr Peters said.

“Over the years APEC has expanded and matured as an organisation, and this year’s set of issues is testament to that.

“There will be the usual focus on priority trade issues, including supporting progress in the WTO on the Doha Development Agenda, and encouraging greater regional trade and economic integration.

"There will also be a strong focus on climate change, which is something New Zealand welcomes, as last year we were highly active in getting the issue onto APEC’s formal agenda for the first time.

"Given that APEC is a grouping of the most economically dynamic region in the world, an agreement among its members on a credible response to the challenge of climate change is fundamental to securing future prospects for sustainable development on a global scale.

“APEC’s developing human security agenda will be another key focus for Ministers, as APEC is now playing an important role in regional cooperation on issues such as counter terrorism, pandemic preparedness, and disaster management.

“I am hopeful that progress can also be made on reforming APEC to ensure it can effectively respond to the challenge of a growing and diverse agenda.”

While in Sydney Mr Peters will also hold bilateral meetings with counterparts from a range of countries, including the United States, Russia, and Canada.
