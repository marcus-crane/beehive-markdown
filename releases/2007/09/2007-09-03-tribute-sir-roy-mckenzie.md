Prime Minister Helen Clark and Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today expressed sadness at the passing of Sir Roy McKenzie.

Sir Roy was knighted in 1989 for his services to education and the community, and was made a member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1995.

“Sir Roy was one of New Zealand’s leading philanthropists and gave more than 60 years of service to the community. He gave support and advice to many charities and in 1990 he founded Philanthropy New Zealand, giving charitable organisations an opportunity to share knowledge about the philanthropy process,” Helen Clark said.

“He was a key figure in the establishment of New Zealand’s first hospice, Te Omanga in Lower Hutt, and was involved in the hospice movement.

"He made significant contributions to education and welfare, notably for improving education for disadvantaged children, promoting early intervention, and research into the welfare of families," Helen Clark said.

“Sir Roy has left a positive mark on many of New Zealand’s notable charitable organisations, including Women’s Refuge, Deaf Decade, Outward Bound Trust, and Nga Manu Native Reserve Trust. He founded the Roy McKenzie Foundation and the Centre for the Study of Families at Victoria University.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said Sir Roy was a great example of the very best in Kiwi generosity.

“Sir Roy dedicated much of his life to quietly strengthening the foundations of our society - grass-roots charities and community groups,” she said.

“Our thoughts are with Sir Roy’s wife Shirley, and their family,” Helen Clark said.  
Sir Roy died at his home on Saturday, aged 84.
