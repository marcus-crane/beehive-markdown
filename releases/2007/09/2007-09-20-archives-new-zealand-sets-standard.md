The Minister for Archives New Zealand, Hon Judith Tizard, has officially launched Archives New Zealand’s new storage standard.

"This standard represents a whole of government approach to managing the risks that effective storage of public records faces," Judith Tizard said.

"This standard builds a vital tool for records managers and archivists both in and out of government. It will help ensure that records of ongoing value are preserved for the memory of government and for the benefit of future generations."

“Historical government records are a vital tool for building our sense of national identity. Many government records also have great significance to Mâori, and need to be protected and preserved with special care.”

”‘Many government organisations already store their records well. This standard gives us a tool for auditing and improving storage across the government. Proper storage will ensure that records remain safe, secure, and able to be used,” Judith Tizard said.

The standard is the first mandatory standard issued under the Public Records Act 2005. From 2010, public offices may be audited against the requirements in the standard.

The standard applies to physical records such as paper files, photographs, microfilms, maps and plans, and sets minimum requirements for storage of physical records throughout the state sector, in local government, and where government records are held by community archives. It does not apply to digital records.

Archives New Zealand is now working to ensure that the standard is implemented throughout government.
