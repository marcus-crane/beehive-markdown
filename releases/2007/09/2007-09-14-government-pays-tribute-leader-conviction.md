Bishop Whakahuihui Vercoe championed indigenous rights throughout his life and will be honoured for that both within the Anglican Church and Te Ao Mâori, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

Bishop Vercoe was the first Mâori primate of the Anglican Church, becoming Archbishop in 2004. He was made a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2000, for services to Mâori and the community.

He was previously an army chaplain in Malaya and Vietnam and was also honoured with a military MBE in 1970.

“Bishop Vercoe was always strong in his convictions and was a passionate advocate of Mâori rights, including the need to resolve historical Treaty of Waitangi grievances.”

“He sought and helped secure a greater role for, and better recognition of the place of, Mâori within the Anglican Church for which he will also be remembered. His compassion for those suffering from poverty was also well-known.”

“I wish to extend my condolences to his whânau on behalf of the Government.  
Haere râ e te rangatira, Moe mai, okioki.”
