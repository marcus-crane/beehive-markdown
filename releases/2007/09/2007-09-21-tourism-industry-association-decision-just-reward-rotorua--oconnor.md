Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor has welcomed the Tourism Industry Association’s (TIA) decision to hold New Zealand’s biggest tourism event in Rotorua again next year.

TIA announced today that TRENZ (Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand) will return to Rotorua in 2008 following this year’s successful event, the first time Rotorua has hosted TRENZ.

Mr O’Connor said: “The decision is a great move and recognises the professionalism and enthusiasm shown by local organisers and businesses in the lead up to and during this year’s event. It is also testament to the city’s first-class facilities, including its hotels and restaurants, and the new Energy Events Centre.

“Events such as TRENZ provide a real economic boost for host cities. Rotorua has demonstrated it has what it takes to host such large gatherings and fully deserves recognition for its outstanding commitment. Congratulations to the city’s leaders and businesses.”

TRENZ matches hundreds of international buyers with New Zealand tourism products, and hosts dozens of local and international media. TRENZ 2008 will take place 26-29 May 2008.
