National Party leader John Key’s enthusiastic endorsement of the Government’s roading programme is a remarkable reversal of National’s mean-spirited approach throughout the 1990s, says Transport Minister Annette King.

“The Labour-led Government is investing in the largest road-building programme in New Zealand’s history,” she said.

“Mr Key told the Road Transport Forum at the weekend that there had been an artificial cap on building new roads. Well, I don’t know what country he’s been living in for the past few years, but it can’t be New Zealand.

“When the Labour-led Government came to power in 1999, the total investment in land transport was just over one $1 billion. In 2007/08 it is forecast to reach $2.75 billion. Total government investment in public transport, at a projected $490 million in 2007/08, is 12 times higher than the $41 million in 1999/00.

“And, most significantly, in complete contradiction to what Mr Key told the forum, central government spending on roading has actually doubled from $850 million in 1999/00 to an allocation of $1.7 billion in 2007/08.”

Ms King says Mr Key “totally misrepresents what is happening when he says ‘we need to move from maintenance mode to expansion mode’. We have to do both, and that is what this Government has been doing. New roads include the Western Ring Route in Auckland, the Waikato Expressway, Alpurt B2 and Wellington’s inner-city bypass, and we are also maintaining the assets we have.

“The Labour-led Government has made, and is making, a tremendous investment in new roads, in maintaining roads and in making our roads safer. And we are not doing this by borrowing up madly. We are funding our roading programme in a fiscally-responsible way, and we will continue to do so, including working in partnership with private enterprise where this is possible.”
