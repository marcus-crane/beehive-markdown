The National Party wants to scrap our world-leading, no fault ACC legislation because it just doesn't understand it, said ACC Minister Ruth Dyson today.

"Anne Tolley seems incapable of understanding what a workplace injury is, even though it is very clearly defined in legislation. It is an injury that occurs while at work and during work time.

"Affco is part of the ACC Accredited Employer Programme - this ensures that a company receives significantly reduced ACC levies in return for taking on the responsibility - and risk - for any injuries in their workplace.

"Affco chose to cover a claim as a work-related injury in 2003 because it occurred on work property, to one of its employees, who was on a work break.

"This is the intention of the ACC legislation, the only thing that is unusual is the cause of the injury - a shooting. But quite frankly the cause of injury is irrelevant, whether it is an injured toe or a shooting, the law has been consistent since 1992 that workplace injuries are those that are sustained in the workplace.

"I do not know why Anne Tolley and the National Party are so keen for the New Zealand taxpayer to pick up Affco's liability under the agreement they signed under the law.

"This situation might work under a private insurer scheme which National has said it wants to inflict on the taxpayers of New Zealand, but it is not the way that ACC works.

"ACC is a 24 hour, seven day a week no fault scheme; that is its world-leading point of difference and that is something all New Zealanders can be proud of."
