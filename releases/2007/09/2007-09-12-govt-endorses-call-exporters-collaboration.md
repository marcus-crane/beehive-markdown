Trade Minister Phil Goff and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed a call for greater collaboration between New Zealand businesses in order to grow more successful strong kiwi exporters of scale.

The call came from more than 100 CEOs and founders of New Zealand export businesses during five special forums hosted by Export Year Business Champion Ken Stevens. The forums highlighted collaboration as one of the best untapped opportunities to overcome the issue posed by the small size of New Zealand’s businesses.

"The Labour-led government endorses the call for companies to work together to achieve the necessary size and scale to more successfully break into export markets. We need more successful exporting firms if we are to raise living standards and wages in communities around New Zealand - our own market is just not enough," the ministers said.

"The Export Year 2007 programme is built around the concept of partnership, and while the government facilitates international trade and a better business environment, it is ultimately up to individual businesses to seize the commercial opportunities.

"Our thanks go to Ken Stevens who has done a superb job organising the CEO Forums that brought together a diverse group of businesses and people. It is heartening to hear that participants were both optimistic and ambitious for their businesses.

"The government will continue to listen and respond to the issues and challenges exporters highlighted at the forums. In terms of skills, we are refocusing the funding of tertiary education away from bums on seats towards more responsiveness to the needs of the job market and industries. Our immigration policy has moved away from being a border patrol towards a more active facilitator in attracting key skill sets."

Budget initiatives, in particular the research and development tax incentive and the drop in company tax rates, the expansion in support for firms undertaking market development, an extension to the Beachheads programme into China and India, would also help, ministers said.
