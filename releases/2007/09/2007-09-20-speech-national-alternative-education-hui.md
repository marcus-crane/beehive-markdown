*Speech to the National Alternative Education Hui*  
*Majestic House*  
*Christchurch*

Thank you for the invitation to provide a perspective on alternative education. I accepted the original invitation to attend today on the basis that I have been the patron of the Alternative Education Centre in my electorate Te Kupunga o Aranui, and because for about 11 months of my 4 year stint as Associate Minister of Education I had responsibility for this area.

As you know, I no longer have a portfolio interest in education, but I do have an abiding personal interest, because in my 17 years in Parliament I have come to the conclusion that just about every answer to the questions we are faced with in terms of the ills of society are to be found in education. And when I say education I mean that in the context of lifelong learning; not just the formal education sector. Obviously I am a Minister and I have been briefed on the current state of play with Alternative Education, so I am aware that there are issues that you will be seeking answers to – and I will be able to provide those.

But I want to begin with a bit of a personal perspective about the concerns that I had about something called Alternative Education in the context of what it is an alternative to.

I went through a process when I had responsibility for Special Education, which led me to the conclusion that there was nothing special about special education – what was defined as special education was something we should provide for all our children.

The Minister of Education has labelled this as personalised learning, a concept recently defined by the UK Minister for Education, David Millband as:

“High expectations, of every child, given practical form by quality teaching based on a sound knowledge of each child's needs. It’s not individualised learning where pupils sit alone. Nor is it pupils left to their own devices – which so often reinforces low aspirations. It means shaping teaching around the way different youngsters learn; it means taking the care to nurture the unique talents of every pupil”.

I will come back to unique talents in a minute, but the essence of what we need to move towards an education system that meets the needs of the student, not the other way round. Which leads me to ask what is Alternative Education an alternative to? It must be that it is the alternative to the mainstream or the traditional education system.

I often joke that this was about transmitting information from teacher to student without necessarily passing through the brains of either.

That was great for me because I have an excellent memory, which means I did well in a system which tested that memory. What I have discovered is that I learn best by doing. So how much better would my performance have been in an environment that understood my learning style and adjusted the curriculum delivery to that?

But I also think of the kids that didn’t have my abilities and that didn’t really engage with education even though they were bright and talented in many different fields of endeavour.

I remain firmly of the view that everyone has talent and the key to unlocking potential is to identify and nurture that talent.

The kids I knew that did not do as well as me at school missed out because it was easy to label a lack of concentration as a behavioural issue or disability rather than potentially being a lack of interest because the teaching style wasn’t reaching them or challenging them enough.

The students had the problem, not the other way round.

Today some of my friends would have been sent to Alternative Education.

And even though this would have been better than dropping out, isn’t that a cop out? Ditching the student so the school doesn’t need to think about whether it needs to change cannot be acceptable in this modern day and age.

Steve Maharey says:-

“Changing the system is about viewing education through a different prism; it’s about a different framework, a different way of working with learners and it is about helping learners to open doors and find new pathways”.

And that’s precisely what you do.

So I come back to the same place I got to with special education – what’s so special about identifying students learning needs and modifying the teaching programme to ensure that they can access the curriculum to the best of their ability?

What’s so alternative about an education programme that helps learners open doors and find new pathways?

In a review of Alternative Education programmes conducted last year the effectiveness of the Alternative Education is confirmed as focussing on:

- The place where the programme operates
- The students' commitment to the programme
- The engagement with students’ families
- The programme curriculum which offers more individualised support
- The team of programme providers involved in a multi-disciplinary approach – the importance of having trained teachers who have a professional approach to education was emphasised.

It seems to me that these are not so much alternative ideas, but rather ideas whose time has come to review how we teach our children in the 21st Century. So what does that mean for you?

When the Ministry of Women's Affairs was established, Ann Hercus said that it was the only Ministry dedicated to its own demise. David Lange said that its task was to demolish the structure of inequality, so 21 years on it is still going strong.

But change has occurred and what was radical then is mainstream today.

I believe the future of Alternative Education is to influence the mainstream so that Alternative Education genuinely meets the needs of those who cannot be catered for in the mainstream or who need a period of absence from the mainstream ranging from hours in the day to months of a year.

In 2006 just over 60 per cent of Alternative Education places were taken by Maori students. Does this not send a message to anyone that the mainstream is failing to engage with Maori in a way that is intolerable?

Steve Maharey and Parekura Horomia recently released the draft Maori Education Strategy [Ka Hikitia](http://kahikitia.minedu.govt.nz/kahikitia/default.htm) – which means to “step up” “lift up” or to “lengthen one’s stride”.

This plan makes it clear that the whole education system must work together to improve the way Maori are taught. It simply isn’t good enough to leave them to the “last resort” option.

Three weeks ago Steve Maharey announced the results of the review of Teen Parent Units.

[Teen Parent Units](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=9203&indexid=9373&indexparentid=3830) had grown from a pilot formed by the Ministry of Justice in 1997 to 17 units from Whangarei to Christchurch.

A number of issues were identified around funding, governance, management and teaching.

There was also an issue around the numbers of students needed to make the Teen Parent Units viable and the fact that not all areas could support a dedicated unit but needed to support a small number of teen parents in the mainstream.

The Minister announced that Teen Parent Units would be part of a unique schooling improvement project linked to the national cluster of Teen Parent Units based on the model of education. This will be focussed on raising achievement for those vulnerable students.

Alternative education was formalised in its current form around 1998, but had its beginnings before then.

- Funding hasn’t increased since 2001
- Early learning exemption changes are having an effect on rolls

Although a review of Alternative education is not yet formalised, it is planned for the Ministry’s programme.

I am confident that when it is developed it will follow the same model as the Teen Parent Unit review, which everyone engaged in that sector has said has been invaluable in terms of getting some perspective on the diverse challenges facing this group of students and, as a result, recognising that there cannot be a one size fits all approach to their education – which cannot be separated from all their other needs.

I am sure that you will welcome such a review committed as you are to the wellbeing of young New Zealanders, who also in my view have been abandoned by the mainstream, without the mainstream first looking at whether what they were doing was good enough.

I am not painting a rose-tinted view of the behavioural challenges that many of these children present either. But these children do not live their lives in silos for the convenience of the funding arms of government. They have whole lives and need to be treated as such.

And that’s what Alternative Education has to offer and that’s why I don’t see it as alternative. In fact there is no alternative to Alternative Education. It’s the way of the future.
