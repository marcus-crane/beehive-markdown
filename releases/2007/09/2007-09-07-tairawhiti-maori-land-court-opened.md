Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Courts Minister Rick Barker officially opened the newly refurbished Tairâwhiti Mâori Land Court at a dawn ceremony today.

“The Mâori Land Court plays an important part in facilitating the use of collectively owned Mâori land and resources. The records it holds also form an invaluable part of the whakapapa of all Mâori," Mr Horomia said.

“Tangata whenua have named the Tairâwhiti Court “Te Whare o Te Râ” (The House of the Sun). This is particularly appropriate given the remarkable artwork designed specifically for the refurbished building by renown local artist Derek Lardelli, which ensures this will be one of the most unique courts in the country.”

"The refurbishment of this court is an example of the commitment the Labour- led government has to improve and support the infrastructure provided for the Mâori Land Court. This is the fifth Mâori Land Court premises that has been substantially re-furbished in the past three years; the others are Christchurch, Wellington, Rotorua and Hastings," said Rick Barker.

"We have invested in IT infrastructure and access to court records through projects such as the Mâori Freehold land registration project and Mâori Land Online, and have increased Mâori Land Court staffing levels by 25% since 2001.

"It all forms part of the largest ever ongoing investment in Court facilities," said Rick Barker.
