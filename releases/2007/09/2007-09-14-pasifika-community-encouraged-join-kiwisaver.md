Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Phil Goff today urged Pasifika leaders to encourage their communities to take advantage of the new Kiwisaver scheme.

"Already nearly 140,000 people have enrolled with Kiwisaver in less than three months. We want to make sure that the Pasifika community is aware of the advantages of joining up", he said.

"While the average age of Pasifika people is younger than other communities, young workers need to know that by the time they retire they will likely have around 20 years of life ahead of them.

"To meet their needs and enjoy a good living standard, they need to take up the opportunity to enjoy Kiwisaver now.

"All of us agree that it's a good idea to save but too often we don't get around to doing it.

"Kiwisaver encourages people to do so by boosting their savings contributions and as one Pacific church Minister put it, by helping to keep our fingers out of the cookie jar.

"Both people and the country benefit from making the choice to save to meet longer term needs as well as spending on current consumption.

"People on a lower income of around $600 a week or $26,000 a year, might be only able to save $20 weekly, but with the Government's $20 and the employers $20 that makes $60 weekly. In addition the Government starts off the savings account with a gift of $1000 and helps meet the cost of managing the account every year.

"Kiwisaver can help too towards home ownership which is not easy for young people today. After 5 years in Kiwisaver, a couple can get a contribution of $10,000 given to them towards their home deposit.

"We want to be sure that Pasifika people are aware of the benefits Kiwisaver has to offer, so the government have translated leaflets into Samoan, Tongan and Cook Island Maori, we'll be advertising the scheme in Pasifika languages on Niu FM and 531 PI and in Pasifika magazines and newspapers

"Kiwisaver gives people the ability to make an intelligent choice for a secure future for them and their families and I encourage all Pasifika people to take the time to understand the scheme and its benefits and to join Kiwisaver", said Phil Goff.
