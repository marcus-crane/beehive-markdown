Energy and Climate Change Minister David Parker says New Zealand is doing much better than Australia on greenhouse gas emissions, contrary to what National’s Nick Smith claims.

“As usual, Nick Smith is using whatever suits his agenda when it comes to climate change.”

“He keeps saying coal generation is going up in New Zealand, despite the fact that it decreased last year by 4.8 percent.”

“As far as country comparisons are concerned, on a per capita basis, Australia produces 19 tonnes of carbon dioxide for each Australian each year, whereas New Zealand produces only around 9 for each New Zealander.

“Between 2002 and 2005 Australia’s per capita carbon dioxide emissions increased by 0.8 tonnes, whereas New Zealand went up by half of that,” David Parker said.

“Australia’s farming emissions have only dropped through the floor because of a drought, which, perhaps ironically, some have linked to climate change.

“This idea of killing off livestock to reduce emissions is the first indication of a climate change policy we’ve had from the National Party for some time.”
