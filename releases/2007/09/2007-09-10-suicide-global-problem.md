Working to prevent suicide in all parts of the community and among people of all ages is the focus of this year’s World Suicide Prevention Day.

Each year approximately 1 million people die by suicide world wide.

“These are sobering statistics to think about as we mark World Suicide Prevention Day,” Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton said

In New Zealand figures show suicide occurs across all age groups. While people who die by suicide are most often in the 15 to 45 year age group, suicide and suicidal behaviour can still affect young adolescents and the elderly.

“Because of this, it is important that suicide prevention efforts meet the needs of people of all ages,” Jim Anderton said. “The New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy, which I launched last year, moved our focus from youth to the whole population.

“We also recognized that different levels of support are required at different times. That’s why the government funds a variety of programmes, such as support for family and communities after a suicide; improving treatment in emergency departments for those who have made a suicide attempt; campaigns to recognize mental illness and seek help, such as the one on depression fronted by John Kirwan; assisting GPs to better respond to those presenting with mental health problems; and ensuring a wide range of suicide prevention information is available. An example of that is the latest resource, which is being launched today for the Samoan community and is bilingual,” Jim Anderton said.

The theme of suicide prevention across the life span is being highlighted by events here in New Zealand. To mark World Suicide Prevention Day, Living Works, the suicide prevention programme of Lifeline, is hosting a seminar and panel discussion in association with the University of.Auckland. Invited speakers will discuss issues about mental health and suicide for both young people and older New Zealanders.
