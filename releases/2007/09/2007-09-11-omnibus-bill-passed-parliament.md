A wide range of legislation has been made more workable and effective due to the passage today of 48 bills that were contained in the Statutes Amendment Bill, says the Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove.

The Statutes Amendment Bill is a useful vehicle for making minor, technical and non-controversial amendments to a number of Acts. It allows amendments to be made that would not usually receive sufficient priority to be progressed.

Mr Cosgrove said this particular Bill contained amendments to Acts covering subject areas as diverse as health and disability regulation, securities law, and company law.

“Some of the improvements brought about by this Bill include modernising the language used in the Defence Act 1990 to keep pace with terminologies currently in use, streamlining procedural requirements for those seeking relief from the court under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 to make the court process more straightforward and accessible, and streamlining nomination advisory panel meetings under the Racing Act 2003 to achieve greater efficiencies.”

Mr Cosgrove said the Bill contained many common-sense measures, including amendments to correct a number of cross references, for example in the Land Transport Act 1998. Another group of amendments are designed to make commercial practices simpler and easier to comply with - for example, by reducing the number of copies of documents required to be filed when seeking registration of a friendly society.

“Few of the amendments referred to above would have received the necessary priority in the House if they were stand-alone amendments. However, gathered together in a Statutes Amendment Bill, they assist in achieving an aim of all Members; to keep the law up-to-date, accurate, and user-friendly,” Mr Cosgrove said.
