Members of a new advisory board that will oversee a plan to advance the economic development of Pacific women met for the first time today.

The Pacific Women’s Economic Development Advisory Board was announced last month to oversee the implementation of the new Pacific Women’s Economic Development Plan. The Board is chaired by Pele Walker, who is joined by Shirley Sisepi-Fraser, Diane Mara and Caren Rangi.

“These are highly talented Pacific women who have a history of strong leadership and of empowering our Pacific women to achieve,” says Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"Pasifika peoples have made great advances already under the Labour-led government. I am confident these talented women will bring this Plan into fruition and lift the economic potential and prosperity of our Pacific women in New Zealand,” says Laban.

The Plan focuses on key areas for development including education; workforce development; business development and leadership.
