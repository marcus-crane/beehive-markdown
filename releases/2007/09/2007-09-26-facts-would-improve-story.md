Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today dismissed as nonsense some of the reporting on the catch limits for the coming fishing season, which he announced yesterday.

“There’s been a great deal of misinformation in the media. Claims, for instance, that new limits were set for nearly all fisheries. Some simple checking and less assuming would have shown that 20 stocks were changed out of a total 618 in the Quota Management System − that is 3.2% of stocks. Nowhere near all fisheries,” Jim Anderton said.

“Another piece of misinformation appeared in The Press − ‘63 percent was chopped off catches of red cod’ it trumpeted. More nonsense. The catch limit for red cod was cut by 63% from 12,400 to 4,600, but the catch has been falling for some time and this year is expected to be about 2000 tonnes – the lowest ever recorded catch. Red cod catches are not likely to increase any time soon.

“The Press also incorrectly reported that no analysis of economic impacts had been conducted. I certainly did look at the economic impacts and, for example, balanced the effect of hoki cuts on the rebuild of the stock, with the economic consequences of a variety of potential cuts to the hoki catch. I chose the balance that best met my twin objectives of rebuilding the stock, while providing for sustainable levels of fishing.

“That, incidentally, is also my response when challenged by the fishing industry that I have been too soft and have not cut back the quota on hoki sufficiently,” Jim Anderton said.

“I acknowledged yesterday that some of my decisions will have social and economic implications – particularly where I have reduced catch limits. What it is not possible to determine is how many jobs will be lost as this will depend on the cost structures of individual fishing companies and the opportunities for redeployment.”

“My announcement yesterday had some media outlets raise the issue of foreign crews fishing in New Zealand waters. There is no particular link here,” Jim Anderton said. “The issue of foreign crew is separate from sustainability decisions. A fish stock size is affected by how many fish are removed, not whether the fishermen happen to be Polish, Kiwi, Japanese or Canadian. By law, NZ companies and quota owners are free to use whoever they choose to catch their fish and it is over to quota owners to keep NZ fishermen in business, not the Government.

“Furthermore, increased deemed values, which I announced yesterday, will ensure that foreign vessels that have been fishing with little catch entitlement and instead simply paying relatively low deemed values will be squeezed out, protecting the value of quota for New Zealander quota owners.”

The current (2006/07) total all-species catch limit (sum of all TACCs) is about 604,000 tonnes. The net effect of the new season’s limits is to decrease this by 23,500 tonnes, resulting in a 2007/08 total of about 580,500 tonnes (a decrease of 4%, of which a significant portion is not actually being caught).

Jim Anderton reiterated his commitment to the ongoing sustainability of all New Zealand’s fisheries. “My decisions reflect this commitment. We will continue to monitor all stocks, address risks to sustainability, and balance those against potential fishing opportunities.”
