Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton has taken decisive action to protect the sustainability of key fish stocks in setting catch limits for this coming fishing year.

New limits have been set in nearly every corner of New Zealand’s fisheries, including in the deep water, inshore environment and in freshwater fisheries, affecting commercial and recreational fishers alike. These limits will apply from 1 October 2007.

“I have taken a careful and considered approach to setting catch limits in all these fisheries,” Jim Anderton said. “Where fisheries information suggests I need to act, I have. This means increased catch limits in some fisheries and decreased catch limits in others. This reflects my desire, and statutory responsibility, to actively manage the sustainability of this natural resource.

“Orange roughy catch limits are being reduced by 38% in one area, 10% in another and a third area is being effectively closed all together. I have significant reservations about the quality and reliability of the scientific stock assessment of orange roughy fishery on the Chatham Rise and I have directed the Ministry to get this reviewed before next season.

“I have decided to reduce catches in the hoki fishery by 10% and request the fishing industry to reduce catch on the western stock by nearly 50% of current levels. To cushion the economic impact of this reduction on the industry I have suggested a modest increase in the fishery on the eastern stock, which appears to be well above that which is sustainable target level.

“All indicators in the South Island red cod fishery suggest this stock is at a low level. Accordingly I have reduced the catch limit by 63%, with further reductions possible. I have similar concerns about South Island flatfish and have reduced this catch limit by 47%. These are both important commercial species that show ongoing levels of poor catch.

“I also want to bring about a clear improvement in the North Island eel fishery by 2014 and have therefore decided to reduce commercial catch limits by between 13 and 78 percent. The recreational and customary allowances remain unchanged for all stocks, reflecting the cultural importance of these fisheries to New Zealanders.

“The good news is that tarakihi and school shark stocks around the top half of the North Island appear to be in good shape and because of this I have made modest increases in catch limits to provide for greater utilisation.

“I have also spent time re-setting deemed values, the price per kilo fishers are charged for catching more fish than they have entitlement for, to ensure catches remain with limits. Correct deemed values are critical for the integrity of the Quota Management System. They are as important to the sustainability of a fishery and its economic value, as setting catch limits themselves.

“For example, a more appropriate deemed value rate for hoki, together with my hoki catch limit decisions, are the two key elements to improve the rebuild prospects for this fishery.

“In response to my decision to increase deemed value rates there may be a tendency for some irresponsible fishers to try and avoid liability by discarding unwanted fish. This is a criminal act and guilty fishers face large fines and potential forfeiture of quota and vessels. I have asked MFish to step up efforts to detect any possible illegal discarding. Project Protector vessels, and the existing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft will be deployed to detect possible offending.

“I know some of my decisions will have social and economic implications – particularly where I have reduced catch limits. And hoki, particularly, has been difficult for me, as I know hoki cuts may mean job losses in some South Island regions.

“However, I am committed, as we all must be, to the ongoing sustainability of all New Zealand’s fisheries. My decisions reflect this commitment. While some may see these decisions as failures of our fisheries management system, I believe it demonstrates quite the reverse. This is the quota management system responding decisively to information, or the lack of, on stock status, in order to maintain the long-term integrity and sustainability of the fisheries management system.”
