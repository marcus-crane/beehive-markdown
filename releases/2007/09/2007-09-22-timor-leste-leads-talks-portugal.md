New Zealand has a growing profile in Spain and Portugal, and both countries are keen to further develop the relationship, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said at the conclusion of his visit to the region today.

The situation in Timor-Leste dominated Mr Peters' discussions with his Portuguese counterpart Luis Amado in Lisbon.

“Portugal, as the former colonial ruler of Timor-Leste, has a particular interest in its reconstruction and development. They also share our concern about the security situation there, and the recent upsurge in violence," Mr Peters said.

"With Portugal currently holding the European Union Presidency, the EU has a heightened focus on Timor-Leste at the moment, and we value its contribution, particularly in assisting Timor-Leste's recent elections.

“I also took the opportunity to reinforce New Zealand's long-term commitment to Timor-Leste's redevelopment, which is certainly appreciated by Portugal."

In Madrid, Mr Peters met Foreign Minister Miguel Moratinos, as well as the external relations committees of the Spanish Senate and Congress.

“Minister Moratinos and I agreed that this is an opportune time to strengthen ties between New Zealand and Spain. The Prime Minister’s visit in April, and promotional activities around the America’s Cup in Valencia, have increased New Zealand’s profile here, while Spain has just opened an embassy in Wellington, which we hope Minister Moratinos will officially open next year.

"We plan to add further impetus through more academic and scientific exchanges, and the possibility of a teacher exchange agreement. Spain was also receptive to the idea of negotiating a Working Holiday Scheme with New Zealand, as was Portugal.

"We also discussed a range of regional and international issues. New Zealand and Spain are both engaged in peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan and Lebanon, and we discussed our assessment of the respective situations, and how we might work together in those regions,” Mr Peters said.
