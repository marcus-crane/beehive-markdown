Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has challenged the findings of a survey by three accountancy firms that South Island firms are being strangled by red tape, including dealing with PAYE matters.

"I'm disappointed that experienced professionals like accountancy firms appear to be unaware that from 1 October 2006, the Government has been subsidizing small employers who contract out their PAYE work to tax agents."The specific benefits of this programme include:

- the reduction of compliance costs for small businesses;
- improvement of the PAYE system in general - payroll intermediaries provide services to a large number of employers, using their skills and technology to increase the accuracy and timeliness of returns. The improved quality of the PAYE compliance benefits employers whose exposure to penalties for non-compliance is reduced;
- the outsourcing of compliance obligations faced by small businesses allows small employers to focus their efforts on their business, rather than compliance activities.

"Contrary to comments from the accountants, the Government is keenly aware of compliance costs faced by business and is constantly working to implement concrete steps to cut those costs.

"I strongly urge employers who want to know more about the scheme to contact the IRD directly and check the website at www.ird.govt.nz "
