Minister in Charge Treaty Negotiations Mark Burton said, “The Crown and Te Aupouri have today commenced consultation with overlapping claimants on the redress proposals for the settlement of the Te Aupouri historical Treaty of Waitangi claims."

This milestone follows the recent signing of an Agreement in Principle with another Far North iwi, Te Rarawa, at Pangaru on 7 September 2007. Other iwi, including Ngati Kuri, Ngai Takoto, and Ngati Kahu claim interests within the area in which both Te Aupouri and Te Rarawa have customary and historical associations.

Te Aupouri and the Crown have been in negotiations since March 2001. A high level Agreement in Principle was signed on 13 September 2004, which included a quantum of $12 million, the key elements of commercial redress and an agreement to develop a detailed cultural redress package. The parties have now agreed it is an appropriate time to commence consultation, on a without prejudice basis, with other claimants who share interests with Te Aupouri, and to receive feedback about the redress.

Following consultation the parties will begin drafting a detailed Deed of Settlement. The settlement will be subject to ratification by the people of Te Aupouri, the establishment of an appropriate governance entity to receive the settlement redress and the passage of enabling legislation.

Other recent achievements toward the government’s objective of settling all Treaty claims by 2020 include the release of a draft Agreement in Principle to settle Waikato-Tainui’s claims to the Waikato River, the signing of Terms of Negotiation with Turanganui-a-kiwa (Gisborne) iwi and the signing of an Agreement in Principle with Ngati Apa (North Island).
