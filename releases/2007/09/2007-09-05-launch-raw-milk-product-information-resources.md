Every time you walk into a supermarket these days, you can almost guarantee that the cheese section will be full of even more delightful options and surprises than the last time you were there.

There is no doubt that New Zealanders have a love affair with cheese, and it is one that grows more passionate, not less, with the years. The old expression, “smile when I say cheese”, didn’t come out of the blue --- or maybe it did!

I want to welcome everyone to the Beehive this evening for this latest chapter on the cheese-eating of New Zealanders.

Cheese has, of course, been a much-loved staple of our diet for generations. These days attention is often on the specialty and sophisticated cheese makers who are adding so successfully to New Zealand’s reputation for gourmet food, but these cheese makers are part of a wonderful tradition that also embraces early dairy pioneers and includes those icons of New Zealand food, Ches and Dale.

Now our taste experiences are about to be broadened. I’m pleased that a few days ago amendments to our food standards became official, meaning New Zealanders are now able to import some specified raw milk cheeses directly from Europe.

People the world over savour the unique flavours of raw milk cheeses, and I know I have been asked many times over the years as Food Safety Minister why New Zealanders have not been able to enjoy these products here on our home shores.

It’s a complicated situation. In fact, in terms of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority’s duty to protect and promote public health, the path to progress is necessarily often lined with more holes than you would find in an average block of Gruyere, but, as far as I am concerned, that’s a good thing.

NZFSA also has a role to facilitate trade, and it’s this reality that has led to the fresh look at raw milk cheese imports.

NZFSA carried out a risk assessment which concluded that Roquefort presents a similar risk to other high-risk foods which are already commonplace in the diets of New Zealanders, and which are, therefore, a low risk to healthy people.

NZFSA therefore proposed changes to the law and Roquefort can now be imported directly from Europe. We can expect to see more of it in shops and on restaurant menus, and that brings us to the reason for this evening’s event.

As I said, protecting and promoting public health is a key NZFSA role, and when the direct importation of Roquefort was approved, it was also agreed that NZFSA would do more to inform people who fall into ‘at-risk’ groups about the higher risk that this cheese poses for them.

At-risk groups include people who for one reason or another are at a higher risk of getting a foodborne illness, or for whom the consequences of such an illness may be greater.

They need to be aware that this cheese is not suitable for them. NZFSA has developed a programme to communicate this message to affected people and their caregivers, and today we are launching the package of information resources that goes with it.

The resources include:  
•A wallet card for pregnant women, developed as a keep-in-your purse, quick guide to safe and healthy eating in pregnancy. It aims to keep the raw milk cheese message in context with other higher-risk food messages and to provide positive food choices for women during this vital time in their lives.

•A wallet card for other at risk groups, including people having chemotherapy, going through other serious health issues, the immuno-compromised, the very young, and the frail elderly. This card again aims to keep messages around raw milk cheeses in context and lists a range of recommendations for safe food options.

•A point-of-sale flyer specifically about Roquefort has been designed to inform customers about the cheese and the risk it poses for some people, along with some general food safety messaging. This will be on display in delis and supermarkets where people buy the cheese and we hope they’ll pick it up and take its messages on board.

•A flyer for doctors, midwives and other health professionals to display in their waiting rooms and to give to their clients. This flyer also describes the issues with raw milk cheeses and includes the long-term message that more raw milk products could be available within a few years.

Restaurant managers and waiting staff will be also be important in giving information to their customers about eating Roquefort. This group have been targeted with articles in NZFSA’s newsletters and other industry magazines, which remind them that if they have Roquefort on the menu they should alert customers who order it that it’s not suitable for them if they fall into one of the at-risk groups.

The news that Roquefort would be allowed directly into the country was received almost entirely positively by the media, manufacturers, importers and the restaurant fraternity. A media statement released to highlight consultation on the new importing requirements sparked several stories in food magazines and other media outlets.

I’m pleased that most stories celebrated the news and commented “about time”, and others asked when New Zealand’s cheese makers would get a chance to produce their own raw milk cheeses.

NZFSA tells me it has work well underway to look at what needs to be done to allow the importation of other raw milk cheeses and products, as well as at what needs to be done to allow their local manufacture.

This work is being addressed from several angles --- work is being done reviewing existing legislation and standards to find out what changes need to be made to them to allow local production; existing and future science work will contribute to the development of this standard and provide a better understanding of pasteurisation; and an equivalent standard will be provided for imports.

All this work is expected to take at least another year, and then it’s hoped we’ll see a wider range of raw milk products on the market, including local produce, as manufacturers here will have the choice to make raw milk cheeses and other products if they want to.

Thank you again for coming along this evening. I hope you will take some of the new resources back to groups you represent and help spread the message that this new class of cheese is available to be enjoyed, provided the proper caution is taken.

Eat with care is not a bad motto, whatever you are eating! You can now smile when I say “raw cheese”. Thank you.
