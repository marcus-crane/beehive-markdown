The Government has signed off on proposed new police regulations and sent them for drafting into legislation, says Police Minister Annette King.

“This is a major milestone in terms of implementing two important recommendations from Dame Margaret Bazley's Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct,” she said. “It will enable New Zealand Police to implement a new Code of Conduct for all staff by 1 January next year. Police have shown real commitment to getting the work done as quickly as possible.”

Ms King says that Police have also approved 13 new positions in police districts to support the code’s implementation, including training, and its ongoing operation.

“The new Code will ensure police have a more effective approach to performance management and will provide a more appropriate framework than there’s been in the past for dealing with disciplinary issues. It will bring police employment and disciplinary processes more into line with the rest of the public sector and the private sector.”

Ms King says Police already have a range of initiatives underway in response to Dame Margaret’s recommendations. “In particular, they have changed a number of systems relating to the prevention of police misconduct, and reporting and investigating it when it does occur. Any instance of serious misconduct is reported quickly and personally to the Police Commissioner. This ensures that any investigative decisions --- such as whether there is a conflict of interest --- are properly made, and decisions are nationally consistent.

“Additional resources have also been put into investigating misconduct, including, as recommended, merging the Police HR and Professional Standards Groups. Personnel systems are also being enhanced to capture information about an officer's performance, enabling all supervisors to identify and deal with patterns of problem behaviour, and providing an early warning system.”

Ms King says police have almost completed rewriting standards for investigating adult sexual abuse and are advancing a multi-agency approach to establishing victims' centres so all the needs of a sexual abuse victim can be met professionally and promptly.

“Dame Margaret's report also emphasized the need to develop and clearly communicate police policy. Establishment of a new Police policy group is complete. It has a programme underway to collate and reform all Police instructions and policies so that they are nationally consistent.”
