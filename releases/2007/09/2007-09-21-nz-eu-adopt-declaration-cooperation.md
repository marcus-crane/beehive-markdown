New Zealand's relationship with the European Union has been given renewed impetus with the adoption of a joint declaration on cooperation, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in Lisbon today.

The Joint Declaration on Relations and Cooperation between the European Union and New Zealand was formally adopted during consultations between Mr Peters and Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado (Portugal currently hold the rotating EU Presidency) and EU External Relations Deputy Director-General Karel Kovanda.

“The declaration adopted today reflects the many and varied areas of cooperation between New Zealand and Europe,” said Mr Peters.

“We now have a single, modernised document that will serve as the anchor for our relationship for at least the next five years.

“We have moved on from the days when all our discussions with Europe were about trade disputes. The relationship with Europe now covers an enormous range of issues, which is growing all the time.

"The declaration sets out the directions in which the relationship has moved, and explores ways it might be further enhanced. It establishes new areas of cooperation, including new agricultural trade talks, increased cooperation on environment and climate change issues, science and technology cooperation, and exchanges of educational and research personnel.

“The EU is a vital partner for New Zealand. We have strong, long-standing personal links with Europe; it is our second largest trading partner; we work together closely on international issues such as climate change and other environmental concerns, and within the World Trade Organisation.

“The joint declaration is a strong reminder of the important role New Zealand can play as a partner for Europe as the EU increases the range and scope of its influence around the world,” Mr Peters said.
