International visitor arrivals increased by 5.8 per cent in August compared to August 2006, to 164,775 arrivals for the month, figures out today show.

The year ended growth was also strong – up 3.9 per cent to a record high of 2.47 million visitors.

Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said the highlight of these latest figures was the very strong performance over the June to August winter season.

“Over the winter months, international visitors increased by 4.5 per cent, or 20,759 additional arrivals, with the Australian market being the key driver, at 6.5 per cent growth in June, 14.6 per cent in July and 12.3 per cent in August.

“An excellent ski season combined with Tourism New Zealand’s innovative ‘What’s On’ campaign, which is designed to encourage Australians to come here outside of peak seasons, has made New Zealand very attractive to the Aussie travellers this winter.”

Mr O’Connor said the strong growth in the off season was very pleasing.

"This means that tourism businesses are busier in the normally quiet winter months and so are better able to utilise their capital and staff resources.

“The New Zealand Tourism Strategy for the next seven years, which is to be launched in about a month’s time, has clearly identified seasonality as a key challenge to tackle, and so it particularly pleasing to seeing early successes.”

While Australia was very strong, there were mixed performances by other markets in the month of August – United Kingdom was up 4.4 per cent, China up 17.7 per cent, while the United States was down 6.5 per cent, and Japan down 10.2 per cent.
