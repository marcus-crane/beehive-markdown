Education Minister Steve Maharey will today deliver a speech to the New Zealand Home-based Early Childhood Education Association about the importance of building a solid foundation for learning and the unique position of home-based providers in doing this.

“Home-based early childhood providers have the highest uptake of eligible three and four year olds taking advantage of the 20 Hours Free Early Childhood Education policy, with 94 per cent of their children getting their free hours.

“Nearly three quarters (73 per cent) of home-based services have decided to offer this popular Labour-government policy, which lowers costs for parents and boosts access for more than 68,000 families in New Zealand.

“Home-based providers give Kiwi families a unique early childhood service to suit their needs, with more flexible hours to suit parents, convenient locations and comfortable and friendly environments for children.

“Early education is rapidly expanding in New Zealand, with more new centres being built and expanded all the time. Enrolments in Home-based providers increased 14 per cent between 2002 and 2006 – more than twice the growth of enrolments across the whole early childhood sector.

“We are now half way through a 10 year ECE strategy to improve the entire sector, which has seen huge changes so far. The Labour-led government has supported the sector to drive this change, and since 1999 funding has nearly tripled.

“As the strategy continues, this government is committed to investing in more qualified teachers, boosting participation and promoting collaboration within the sector.

“Early Childhood Education is proven to build a solid foundation for the future learning of our children. A child who attends ECE has a much better chance of succeeding in school and later in life, and home-based early education has a unique role in providing this.”
