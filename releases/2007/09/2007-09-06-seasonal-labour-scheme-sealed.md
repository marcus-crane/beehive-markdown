Transitional arrangements towards the implementation of the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme have been signed off following consultation between Department of Labour officials, industry and unions.

Announcing the transitional policy, Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said: “I am delighted at the broad support for this initiative from New Zealand’s horticultural and viticultural industries.

“The RSE recognises the need to underpin progress towards high-quality production through the development of a sustainable and appropriately skilled seasonal workforce.

“The input of the industry, unions and officials has produced a constructive win-win result.

“Policy requires that, wherever possible, Kiwis are employed first. But the growth of the sectors and the strength of the economy have meant a tight labour market. To date indications of worker uptake under the RSE exceed expectations.

“However the Government has listened to and recognised the valid questions, particularly of some smaller employers and growers, around adjusting to the RSE requirements in the short term.

“This Transitional Recognised Seasonal Employer Policy is designed to meet those needs for employers committed to transition into RSE,’’ Mr Cunliffe said.

The scheme will see the introduction of Regional Transition Facilitators; institute a transitional work permit policy for periods of up to four months; will allow visitors to work for up to six weeks; and grant an extra three-months stay to Working Holiday Scheme workers in the horticulture and viticulture industries.

Horticulture New Zealand CEO Peter Silcock said: “Horticulture New Zealand, along with our industry partners New Zealand Winegrowers, Pipfruit NZ and Kiwifruit Growers Incorporated, are satisfied industry’s concerns have been heard.’’

“We are optimistic that these new policies will go a long way towards easing the concerns of growers,’’ Mr Silcock said.
