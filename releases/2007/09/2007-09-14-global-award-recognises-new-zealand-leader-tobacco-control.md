Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor said today he is delighted that New Zealand has received further international recognition for its leading role in combating smoking.

New Zealand, Ireland and Finland were jointly awarded the Global Smokefree Partnership's Extraordinary Award this week in Edinburgh, in recognition of their “exceptional and outstanding commitment” in the development of guidelines for Article 8 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).

“This award is a testament to the high regard in which New Zealand is held internationally in this arena,” Mr O’Connor said.

“New Zealand has played a leading role in establishing international agreement on the guidelines, which were adopted unanimously at the Conference of Parties in Bangkok in July.”

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a World Health Organisation initiative in response to the global epidemic of tobacco addiction. It is the first binding international treaty that provides an agreed approach to tobacco control at a global level in order to protect public health and reduce deaths from tobacco related illness.

The guidelines give national and local Governments clear direction to establish smoke-free environments.

The Convention addresses all aspects of tobacco control including economic and trade issues. New Zealand has been actively involved with the Convention from its inception.

“New Zealand has some individuals who are exceptionally committed to tobacco control, and the Labour-led Government has a proven track record of action and investment in the battle to combat smoking,” Mr O’Connor said.

New Zealand initiatives include:

•New Zealand was the third country in the world, in 2003, to introduce 100% smokefree indoor workplaces (including bars and restaurants). More than 90% of the population support the right to live and work in a smokefree environment.  
•New Zealand is the only country in the world that has a national freephone Quitline which provides subsidised nicotine replacement therapy.  
•As well as the Quitline, New Zealand has a wide range of smoking cesstion providers who can also provide subsided NRT through the Quitcard programme.  
•The Aukati Kai Paipa programme, which was established to provide face to face cessation services to Maori women and their whanau continues to be strengthened.  
•New Zealand is to introduce pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, which is the most effective method of informing smokers, and those considering smoking, of the extremely serious health effects of smoking.  
•The Government has recently committed an extra $43 million over four years to combat smoking.
