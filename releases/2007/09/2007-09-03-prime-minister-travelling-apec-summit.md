Prime Minister Helen Clark goes to Sydney on Friday to attend the APEC Leaders' Summit. This will be the eighth time Helen Clark has attended the Summit.

“This year APEC has returned to Australia as host country. The organisation was launched at a meeting in Australia in 1989,” Helen Clark said.

"At the outset in 1989 APEC embraced 12 economies. Today it brings together 21 economies, comprising over sixty per cent of world GDP and close to half of world trade.

"Priorities for discussion by leaders include issues of climate change and energy security, the WTO's Doha Round of trade negotiations, greater regional economic integration, and reform of the APEC structure itself.

“APEC is critically important to New Zealand as it includes major partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and accounts for more than 70 per cent of our total trade.

“Last year in Viet Nam, New Zealand was instrumental in having the challenge of global warming included in the Leader's communiqué, and, pursuant to that, discussed by Leaders. I am therefore pleased that Australia has made it a major item on this year's agenda. The economic implications of not acting to mitigate climate change compel us to debate the issue.

“Leaders will be meeting at a critical time for the WTO's Doha Round. I hope Leaders can reach agreement in Sydney on how to push the talks forward.

"Greater regional economic integration, including the idea of a regional FTA will also be discussed. While the process is still a long way from reaching any formal commitment to negotiate, New Zealand is keen to continue working on practical, incremental steps toward that end.” Helen Clark said.

Other significant issues for review in Sydney include options for reforming APEC to help it respond better to its growing agenda, and the membership moratorium which was introduced in 1997.

While in Sydney the Prime Minister will also hold bilateral meetings with other leaders attending APEC, including the President of China, the President of Chile, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the Prime Minister of Canada.

Other bilateral meetings with APEC leaders will occur in New Zealand on either side of the formal APEC Summit, involving the President of Mexico, the President of Viet Nam, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

NOTE: APEC includes: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.
