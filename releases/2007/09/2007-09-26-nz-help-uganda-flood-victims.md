New Zealand is to contribute to the international response to severe flooding and landslides in eastern Uganda, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“Many thousands of people in eastern Uganda have been affected by severe flooding and landslides after months of heavy rain. Houses, roads, bridges, and food crops have been destroyed or washed away,” Mr Peters said.

"Aid agencies have identified several priorities for the international aid effort, including securing supplies of food and clean water; providing emergency shelter and non-food items; addressing health and sanitation needs to preventing outbreaks of disease, and re-opening schools.

“NZAID, the government’s international aid agency, will contribute $500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross. The money, which will go via New Zealand Red Cross, comes from NZAID's Natural Disaster fund," Mr Peters said.
