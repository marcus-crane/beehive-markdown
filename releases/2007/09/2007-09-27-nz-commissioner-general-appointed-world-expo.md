Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that career diplomat Phillip Gibson has been appointed New Zealand’s Commissioner-General for the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.

Helen Clark made the announcement during her speech to the Asia New Zealand Foundation annual APEC Business Advisory Council dinner in Auckland tonight.

“Expo 2010 is expected to be the largest ever Expo. It is an important opportunity for New Zealand to highlight our capabilities, reinforce our positive reputation in China, and create new business opportunities," Helen Clark said. ‘

Helen Clark said that the theme for Shanghai 2010 is Better City, Better Life, with a focus on new thinking, new technologies, and new practice in achieving healthy, and sustainable urban living.

"New Zealand will use these broad themes to present itself as an innovative, environmentally conscious, multi-cultural, Asia Pacific nation. The Expo also gives us opportunities to promote New Zealand as a premier tourism destination.

“New Zealand made an early commitment to Expo 2010. We have secured a prime location for our 2000 square metre pavilion. We need strong leadership of a New Zealand Inc team, bringing together government and the private sector.

“I am confident that Phillip Gibson can drive our vision for Expo 2010 and work closely with New Zealand and Chinese interests. He is one of our most senior diplomats and was New Zealand Commissioner-General for the 2005 Aichi World Expo in Japan.

"Mr Gibson is currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to Indonesia. He has extensive experience in Asia, having also been Ambassador to Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. He is also a former Executive Director of the Asia New Zealand Foundation (previously known as Asia 2000). He brings to the role of Commissioner–General strong business and cultural awareness, diplomatic networking and communication skills, and a proven track record of engaging and working with a wide range of stakeholders," Helen Clark said.

To date 147 countries and seventeen organisations have confirmed their participation in Shanghai World Expo 2010. Over 70 million visitors are expected to visit the Expo between May and October 2010.
