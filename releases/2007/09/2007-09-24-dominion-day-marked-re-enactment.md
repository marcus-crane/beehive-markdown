Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that a milestone in the development of New Zealand's nationhood is to be celebrated this week with a symposium at Parliament to mark the centenary of Dominion Day.

"On 26 September 1907 Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward read a proclamation on the steps of the Parliament's General Assembly Library, announcing that New Zealand was no longer a colony of the British Empire," Helen Clark said.

"A day-long seminar will be held at Parliament on Wednesday 26 September, where academic and constitutional experts will debate concepts of nationhood. Speakers will include Sir Geoffrey Palmer, Jamie Belich, Ngatata Love, Giselle Byrnes, Dr Andrew Ladley, Alison Quentin-Baxter, Colin James, David McIntyre, and Charles Royal.

"There will also be a re-enactment of the 1907 illumination of the GA Library on September 25 and 26, between 6.00pm and midnight. The arches and roofline will be lit up, for the first time since 1937.

"Delegates at the Symposium will also be invited to gather for a photograph in the same spot where Sir Joseph Ward read the proclamation.

"The first Dominion Day was a holiday for public servants and every schoolchild received a commemorative medal. A guard of honour and band marched through Wellington, school cadets took part in the parade, a Maori haka was performed, and concerts and fetes were held in other parts of the country.

"Wellington's Dominion newspaper was founded on Dominion Day, and for many years Dominion Day on 26th September was a public holiday marked by banks, and law and accountancy firms, but its significance gradually declined.

"Its constitutional importance was overtaken by New Zealand ratifying the Statute of Westminster in November 1947, removing Britain's right to make laws for New Zealand.

"Dominion Day, however, remains an important symbolic anniversary, marking the end of our colonial status and paving the way for New Zealand to become an important international player in its own right," Helen Clark said.
