Minister Pete Hodgson, acting for the Minister for the Environment, today announced the members of a Board of Inquiry to consider Transpower’s proposal for a new electricity transmission line in the upper North Island.  
“In selecting candidates for the Board I have considered the nature of the inquiry and issues that may be raised by the proposal. The chair will be Judge David Sheppard. He is a former Principal Environment Judge and his experience in Resource Management Act (RMA) decision-making will be invaluable. The other Board members will be Kevin Prime, Dr Deborah Read and John Rutherford,” said Pete Hodgson.  
The members of the Board will bring a combination of skills, expertise and background that are needed for the inquiry, said Pete Hodgson.  
The role of the Board is to consider submissions on Transpower’s proposal, to hold public hearings and to make a final decision. Transpower’s proposal is to build a new overhead electricity transmission line, underground cables and substations, from Whakamaru to Otahuhu and Pakuranga.  
“I am pleased to have people of such a high calibre on the Board and I wish them well with their inquiry,” said Pete Hodgson.
