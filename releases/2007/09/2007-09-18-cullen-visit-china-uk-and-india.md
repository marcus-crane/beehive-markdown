Highlighting economic opportunities and fostering research links will be the focus of Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen's two-week visit to China, the United Kingdom and India starting next week.

"I see tremendous potential in building closer links with China, the United Kingdom and India - each very important economies in their own right and home to many world-class centres of research," said Dr Cullen.

"Strong international business relations and research connections are vital to New Zealand's economic well-being. They are part of the foundation of our transformation to a high-skill, high-value, knowledge-led economy."

In Shanghai, Dr Cullen will visit the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong. He then travels to Beijing for meetings with Premier Wen, Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan, Minister of Education Zhou Ji and Chairman of National Development and Reform Ma Kai.

While in London Dr Cullen will call on the recently-appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Alistair Darling. He will also be meeting with Minister of Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education Bill Rammell and Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King.

Dr Cullen will then visit Delhi, where he will hold discussions with Minister of Finance Sri P Chidambaram, Minister of Science and Technology Sri Kapil Sibal, Minister of Human Resource Development Sri Arjun Singh and Deputy Chair of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

Dr Cullen departs on Saturday 22 September and returns to New Zealand on Thursday 4 October.
