The New Zealand and Australian governments today established the first trans-Tasman joint framework for sustainable government procurement to ensure that public sector organisations in both countries consider the environmental credentials of goods and services they buy.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel, as minister in charge of the New Zealand government's procurement policy, met with her Australian counterparts in Melbourne today to launch the Australian and New Zealand Government Framework for Sustainable Procurement.

The move to work with the Australians on sustainable procurement follows the New Zealand government’s recent announcement on its own mandated environmental standards, guidelines and targets for the public service.

"New Zealand welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with the Australian state, territorial and federal governments through the Australian Procurement and Construction Council on this important issue. The threat of climate change has clearly demonstrated that the world must use its resources carefully. Governments in both countries are taking the lead to ensure that the purchase of goods and services by government are more sustainable,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Framework provides a set of guiding principles and best practice examples for public sector organisations. It will encourage the sharing of experience between governments in both countries and ensure economic, environmental and social considerations are taken into account.

"The sustainability imperative means that we must emphasise the economic, environmental and social impacts of goods and services over their entire lifecycle as part of the value-for-money assessment. In addition, we drive the production of environmentally-friendly and sustainable goods and services. Sustainable procurement and innovation go hand in hand," Lianne Dalziel said.

Participation in the joint Australia New Zealand Framework is part of New Zealand’s Sustainable Government Procurement Project, one of six government initiatives that will help lead New Zealand towards greater economic, environmental and social sustainability in its resource use and way of life.
