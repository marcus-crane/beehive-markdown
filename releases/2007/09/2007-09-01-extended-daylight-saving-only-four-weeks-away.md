Spring is here and that means there is only four weeks to the start of the new period of daylight saving, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today.

Daylight saving begins a week earlier this year, on Sunday 30 September, when clocks go forward by one hour and will end on Sunday 6 April 2008 instead of the usual third Sunday in March. This is the first change to daylight saving since 1990.

“The new period of daylight saving will provide people with an extra hour of daylight in the evening to enjoy the outdoors,” said Rick Barker.

“It will also avoid a clash with the start of the fourth school term, which has caused disruptions for schools and families in the past,” said Rick Barker.
