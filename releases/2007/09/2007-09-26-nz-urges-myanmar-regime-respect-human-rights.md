Foreign Minister Winston Peters today called on the military regime in Myanmar to heed the demands of its people and the international community to allow greater human rights.

"The escalating tensions in Myanmar, and the threats of the regime to crack down hard on protests, are of great concern," Mr Peters said.

"Myanmarese authorities must respect the legitimate right of its people to engage in peaceful protest, and refrain from unwarranted or violent acts of repression.

"It is time for the regime to heed the calls of the international community, and engage in genuine and open dialogue with Myanmar's democratic opposition in order to defuse the current situation."

Tens of thousands of Myanmarese have been taking part in protest marches that were initially against food shortages and rising fuel costs, but have become increasingly political in recent days.

Mr Peters met Myanmar’s Foreign Minister Nyan Win at the recent ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in Manila, Philippines.

"I clearly conveyed to Minister Win New Zealand’s deep concerns about the political and human rights situation in his country, including the need to release political detainees such as Aung San Sun Kyi, and the need for genuine reform," Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters said the government would continue to speak out against the suppression of human rights in Myanmar.

The government's travel advice has also been updated to reflect the risk to travellers associated with the growing frequency and size of demonstrations and the possibility of violence occurring. The travel advice can be found at www.safetravel.govt.nz
