Minister for Auckland Issues and Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard is to sponsor a Private Bill that will ensure stable and sustainable funding for a number of important Auckland public services. The Bill will be introduced to Parliament on 19 September 2007.

The Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill follows the MOTAT and Auckland War Memorial Museum Acts and seeks to establish a legislative framework to secure funding for 11 organisations from the seven Auckland councils.

The 11 organisations that will benefit from the Bill are  
•Auckland Festival  
•Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra  
•Auckland Rescue Helicopter  
•Auckland Theatre Company  
•Auckland Zoo (will not receive funding in the first year as is not yet a separate entity from Auckland City Council)  
•Coastguard Northern Region  
•New Zealand National Maritime Museum  
•NBR New Zealand Opera  
•Stardome Observatory and Planetarium  
•Surf Life Saving Northern Region  
•WaterSafe Auckland

The Bill establishes an initial level of funding from each council, and ensures that future funding will not exceed a maximum of two per cent of the rates take. Funding from councils will not replace existing funding sources such as fees and donations.

The 11 organisations were chosen by an independent assessment group from a shortlist of entities, based on market research with ratepayers. Qualifying organisations will be assessed for their level of annual funding by a new Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Board. There is provision for other approved organisations to receive funding in future, but they must be accommodated within the two per cent cap.

If successful, the Bill will provide regional funding from the seven councils of $9 million in the first year commencing July 1, 2008.
