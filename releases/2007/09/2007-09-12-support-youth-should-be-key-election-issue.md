Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says youth development should be a key issue in every local, regional council and district health board election.

"The way we plan to support the next generation indicates the type of society we value. Young people must be inspired to contribute to the communities they live in,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“[Urban design](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/urban/design-protocol/index.html) needs youth friendly spaces, public transport, recreation and education facilities. For youth, health and well-being are a priority, and councils have a responsibility to ensure that the coming generation is well supported. They are our future. “

Nanaia Mahuta, who is also the Associate Minister of Local Government, said youth have significant voting power, and can be attracted to take part in elections if candidates respond to their needs, and major youth concerns such as the environment and support for a more inclusive society which respects diversity.

"Local leadership on youth development is vital. Our regions' social and economic growth will rest on how we respond to the needs of the next generation."
