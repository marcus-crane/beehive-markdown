The latest figures from Statistics New Zealand show an increase in the number of scientists and other research staff working to advance innovation and keep New Zealand at the cutting edge of research and development, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

The 'Research and Development Survey 2006' released today reveals a 7 percent increase in research staff since 2004.

Steve Maharey says this shows the Labour-led government’s commitment to innovation is paying off, “this government is committed to building a talented skill base to increase our knowledge base and today’s figures prove that’s working.

“With international competition for talented people, it is great to see we are able to attract and retain valuable research staff.”

An earlier summary of the survey released in June showed that total spending on research and development (R&D) increased 10 per cent since the last survey in 2004, to $1.8 billion. That includes public and private expenditure.

Steve Maharey says the figures show private funding is increasing, but much more investment is needed to bring New Zealand businesses into line with other OECD countries.

"The Labour-led government aims to boost private investment with a $630 million tax incentive announced in Budget 2007 for businesses to carry out their own research.

"This will make New Zealand more internationally competitive, overseas companies will find it more attractive to invest in R&D here, and it will help our businesses be more innovative and successful.

"The survey shows the Labour-led government is still the largest funder of R&D providing $785 million, or 43 per cent of funding, in 2006 – up 8 per cent on 2004."
