The release of the next steps in the Labour-led government’s plan to fight climate change could have significant benefits for Mâori - particularly iwi with significant interests in forestry, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

The government today released its plan to fight climate change, New Zealand’s Climate Change Solutions, together with the Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.

The Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Plan of Action and the engagement document Forestry in a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme were also released.

Labour’s plan to fight climate change includes:

- An emission trading scheme to put a price on greenhouse gas pollution
- Measures to encourage forestry and better land use
- Increasing renewable electricity generation to 90% of New Zealand’s total by 2025
- Improving fuel and energy efficiency in buildings, homes and business
- Making the public sector carbon neutral
- Reducing emissions from the transport sector by half by 2040, and encouraging the introduction of electric vehicles.

"Mâori have sizeable areas of land qualifying for post-1989 forestry that currently has limited potential for alternative use. An emissions trading scheme will present options for economic opportunities for Mâori. The proposed scheme allows the Government to devolve carbon credits for growing trees which will provide a major new incentive to Mâori and the wider forestry industry to consider planting or regenerating more forests."

Mâori own about 15 per cent of all plantation forest land, which could increase to over 40 per cent once Treaty claims on remaining land are settled and the land transferred.

"Mâori are inextricably linked to and involved with the sustainable management and use of natural resources through the intergenerational exercise of kaitiakitanga. Climate change is a global issue that will impact on the relationship Mâori have with the environment and in our use of natural resources, particularly in our coastal communities," Mr Horomia said.

"It was made clear during 13 regional consultation hui earlier this year that Mâori wanted action taken on climate change. Fourteen further hui have been scheduled next month to discuss the new proposals to tackle the issue.

"Many areas of Mâori land are steep and in regions vulnerable to storm and erosion. With the onset of climate change, these lands will be even more exposed with the predicted arrival of more frequent and severe storms, and more droughts in the east of New Zealand," Mr Horomia said.

"In the forestry sector, deforestation, is defined as the conversion of forested lands to other land uses, and is one of the leading causes of climate change. The climate change policy proposals are part of the Government’s wider sustainability agenda, for example, higher forest planting rates and increased forest regeneration will reduce green house gas emissions. They will also improve water quality and reduce soil erosion."

"It is likely there will be small increases in electricity prices after 2010 when the cost of greenhouse gas pollution from coal or gas fired power stations are included in the Emissions Trading System," Mr Horomia said.

"The government has made a commitment that there will be compensation for low and modest income consumers for higher electricity prices because they're not in a position to quickly change their energy use."

"It is important that Mâori engage with the Government on the issues raised in both the Emissions Trading Scheme framework and the Sustainable Land Management document."

The government is undertaking a study of the impacts of an emissions trading scheme on Mâori, and has established a Mâori Reference Group to help advise on policy proposals, Mr Horomia said.
