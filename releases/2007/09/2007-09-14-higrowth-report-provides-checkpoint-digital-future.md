Information Technology and Communications Minister David Cunliffe has today welcomed the independent HiGrowth Report Connecting to Our Digital Future.

“The HiGrowth report is indepth, challenging and provocative. It addresses the physical infrastructure needs for the ICT industry in New Zealand and what is required to grow and sustain the industry’s global competitiveness. The report provides a useful checkpoint for advancing discussions about New Zealand’s digital future.

“ICT underpins every successful industry in New Zealand, ensuring we have the infrastructure to support this is critical not just to the ICT industry but to the entire economy.

“There are some strong links between the points raised in the report to work the government is currently doing to build New Zealand’s digital capability.”

The report has a multi-sector impact and calls on the government to work in partnership with industry, business, communities and key stakeholders to make progress in many areas, including, further investment in telecommunications infrastructure and broadband speeds and uptake.

“The proposals put forward by the report are about industry and government working in partnership to find solutions. I have signalled today that the government is keen to do this and to further discussions to assist the way forward to New Zealand’s digital future.

“I agree with many of the findings in the report and will be using the Government’s Digital Future Summit on 28 and 29 November to help us to determine what form those future partnerships and discussions should take.”
