Thank you Gabrielle for the welcome and for the opportunity to be part of this panel, (I acknowledge my co-panellists), which allows us to identify what women need to lead free and fulfilling lives.

When I thought about what I would say, I thought how nice it was to have a topic that shifted the focus from the political to the personal. But when I looked at it from my perspective as Minister of Women’s Affairs, I had to concede that the context for women leading free and fulfilling lives would always be political.

For any woman to lead a free and fulfilling life she must be able to have choices that enable her to participate fully, freely and actively in all spheres of life – social, political, economic, and cultural. It is easy to say that New Zealand is a world leader when it comes to women's rights, leading the world as we did in granting women the right to vote – the 114th anniversary of which we celebrate this Wednesday. And of course with women holding three of New Zealand's top four constitutional positions, well, we have got it made.

But have we? For a start New Zealand women cannot all be lumped together in a single category and by that I mean that there are women who have fewer choices than others, because of their race, their religion, their disability, their sexual orientation and even their parental status.

And then there is the backlash, fuelled by those who are threatened by the diminished power that equality might bring and by those who do not understand why women fought so hard not to be objectified for commercial interests.

I don't know if you have noticed, but advertising is getting very sexist again. And we who object are regarded as lacking a sense of humour. I have asked some young women if they have an issue with this sexist advertising and their answer is no, but that's because they don't see it – it's endemic in everything they watch and read – television programmes, movies, magazines, music videos – dangerously skinny women covered in as much material it takes to make a scarf – why should advertising be any different?

I am very concerned that this generation coming through doesn’t see that the rights they take for granted are not theirs to keep unless they constantly claim them.

For women to lead free and fulfilling lives, their contribution to the workforce, to the home and to the community should be equally valued alongside that of their male counterparts.

We have only had equal pay in law for around 30 years. We had a legal framework for pay equity – equal pay for work of equal value – for a few months in 1990, but before it had the chance to be implemented it was repealed by an incoming government and it was gone by Christmas. The reason it was repealed so quickly is that public hospital nurses were about to have their pay compared to that of police and, although all that would have done would be to identify how much of the difference was down to the fact that most nurses were women and most police were men, it would not fit with the intent of the Employment Contracts Act 1991. This piece of legislation set back public hospital nurses over 15 years in their quest for proper recognition. One national award became 23 separate employment contracts. Once the Employment Relations Act was passed in 2000, the nurses had to bring themselves together into a single multi-employer collective agreement (a MECA) and then the government had to fund a pay jolt that put them back on track to pay equity.

The Minister of Labour is now leading a series of Pay & Employment Equity Reviews within the public service and these have been extended out to the District Health Boards and, you will be pleased to hear, the tertiary education sector as well.

Thinking about other changes that took place in my lifetime, until 1977, there was no law against sex discrimination in the provision of goods and services. And prior to the passage and implementation of the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act in the same year, New Zealand women had to travel to Australia for safe, legal abortions. Until the mid-1980s there was no law against rape within marriage. And until the mid-1990s domestic violence was not treated anywhere near as seriously as other violence, and as we know there is still a way to go.

More recent examples of decisions that indirectly support women, because they provide families with real choices about balancing work and family life, include:

- the introduction in 2002 of paid parental leave and, in 2006, the extension of cover from 13 to 14 weeks, and to the self-employed;
- the Working for Families package, which introduces tax credits for working families;
- significant improvements to childcare and early childhood education, including the 20 hours per week of free early childhood education for all three- and four-year-olds at participating teacher-led early childhood education services, introduced in July this year; and
- a five-year action plan for the development of out of school services.

In the tertiary education sector, the scrapping of interest on student loans for New Zealand-based graduates might be thought of as gender-neutral, but is a particular benefit to women, because it means that if they take time out of the paid workforce to have children then their debt is not increasing.

Eliminating family violence is another important issue where the government is taking the lead and it is amongst my highest priorities as Minister of Women’s Affairs.

I mention this because, if a woman is not safe in her own home, then how can she lead a free and fulfilling life? The government has established a Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families and it is making a real difference; I think because it includes government and non-government agencies, alongside the police, the judiciary and the two relevant Commissioners – for Families and for Children.

Again this Taskforce has had to deal with the backlash brigade, who would say that men and women are equally violent within relationships, without any reference to the one factor that defines the violence and that is the level of fear. The number of women killed by men, with whom they have had an intimate relationship, lies in stark contrast to the number of men killed by women and defines domestic violence as a gender issue.

So in summary, if we women are to live truly free and fulfilling lives then we need real choices in our lives. We have a right to equality in all spheres of our lives and we have the legal protections in place to ensure this. But this is not enough, because de facto discrimination continues to exist as evidenced by domestic violence and pay inequity. This means attitudes have to change. For women to live free and fulfilling lives there needs to be a better understanding of why women's rights are important to us all.

The UN Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, to which NZ is a signatory, recalls that

*"discrimination against women violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity, is an obstacle to the participation of women, on equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries, hampers the growth of the prosperity of society and the family and makes more difficult the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of humanity…"*

As Hilary Clinton said at the World Conference on Women in 1995, women's rights are human rights.

The recognition of the importance of this statement and a commitment to its delivery is what will enable women to live free and fulfilling lives. But this means understanding how important it is to continue to claim those rights and to afford to men the knowledge that they lose nothing but gain substantially from sharing equal rights with women. Sadly this remains the greatest challenge of them all.
