“The Get Ready, Get Thru message will now be available to thousands more New Zealanders for whom, English is not their first language,” said Civil Defence Minister, Rick Barker.

The Get Ready, Get Thru Civil Defence website has now been translated into eight languages; Maori, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese script, Hindi, Korean, Samoan and Tongan.

Mr Barker today launched the extended website which is now one of the most extensively translated public education websites in New Zealand.

“[www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz/) is the online face of the Get Ready, Get Thru public education campaign. I am pleased that now even more New Zealander's will be able to access the site which provides information on disaster awareness and preparedness," Mr Barker said.

"Making Civil Defence information available on-line in many languages is an important part of the Labour-led government’s aim to build resilient communities.

“A significant number of New Zealanders were born in other countries or speak English as a second language and it is important that Civil Defence information is able to overcome any language barriers which may exist. New Zealand also has one of the highest rates of internet use in the world meaning we now have a very effective public education facility right at our fingertips.

“It’s important to understand that we will all be affected by a disaster, including those we rely on to rescue us. Immediately after an event, emergency services and civil defence emergency management staff will have to respond to the most critical demands. This means we all need to know how, and be prepared to, take care of ourselves for at least three days.

“This is why a tool like www.getthru.govt.nz is so important. Everyone needs to get ready now to protect themselves and their families when faced with a disaster.

“Civil Defence preparedness has come a long way under this Labour-led government and today’s launch represents another milestone in our progress towards strengthening our families and our communities,” said Mr Barker.
