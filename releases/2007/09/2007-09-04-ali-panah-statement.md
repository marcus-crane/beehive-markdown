Immigration Minister David Cunliffe has outlined proactive steps taken by the Department of Labour to alter the detention conditions of Iranian detainee, Mr Ali Panah.

“This is an exceptional case. As Minister of Immigration I have sought to strike an appropriate balance between upholding the integrity of the immigration process and its appellate bodies, and avoiding an unnecessary humanitarian tragedy.

However, I would stress that the removal order on Mr Panah remains in force. He has not been granted refugee status, there will be no cost to the taxpayer and neither will he enjoy any other benefits of residence or citizenship.

“Mr Panah has had the full benefit of every legal remedy open to him under the immigration laws of this country and has failed at every step.

“The Department supported Mr Panah’s release into the care of the Anglican Church which has agreed to take full responsibility and care of Mr Panah, including any medical or other expenses. The church has also agreed to be responsible for medical supervision including the reintroduction of a normal diet.

“I am grateful to the Anglican Church through whose good offices this outcome has been made possible.’’

Mr Cunliffe said negotiations with Iranian officials over the issuing of travel documents is ongoing.

“The offer still stands for the New Zealand government to facilitate Mr Panah’s departure to a third country, an offer previously accepted, then rejected, by Mr Panah.”
