The Security Intelligence Service has withdrawn the security risk certificate on Ahmed Zaoui.

Mr Zaoui was granted refugee status in August 2003, and this still applies.

“The Department of Labour will now ensure that Mr Zaoui’s situation and immigration status is regularised as soon as possible, and will be working with his representatives to do that,’’ Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said.

“Mr Zaoui will be able to apply to have his family join him,’’ Mr Cunliffe said.
