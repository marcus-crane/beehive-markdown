Trade Minister Phil Goff left Auckland yesterday, leading a New Zealand Trade Mission on a two week visit to Latin America.

“The focus of this trade mission are the four major food-producing countries in the region, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. I will be accompanied by representatives of more than a dozen New Zealand companies active in the food and agritech sectors and our objective is to encourage New Zealand business engagement in this dynamic and developing region”, Mr Goff said.

“In each country we will be meeting with Government and business leaders to promote awareness of New Zealand technological expertise and leadership in the food production, agritech and agricultural business areas. We will be seeking to develop new relationships and to build on successful existing engagement in the region.

“In Argentina the delegation will meet with the official investment agency and sector analysts to discuss market opportunities before we travel to Uruguay to visit the site of a one of New Zealand’s largest agritech investments in Latin America. From Uruguay we travel to Brazil which is one of the worlds largest food producers and offers significant investment opportunities before ending the mission in Chile which is already benefiting significantly from New Zealand expertise and investment in its growing agricultural sector.

“The visit will allow me to meet with my Ministerial trade counterparts in Buenos Aires Argentina, Montevideo Uruguay, Brasilia Brazil and Santiago Chile. Ministerial discussions will focus on progress and strategy on the WTO Doha round and allow us to discuss bilateral issues and opportunities that exist for the promotion of trade with New Zealand”, said Mr Goff.
