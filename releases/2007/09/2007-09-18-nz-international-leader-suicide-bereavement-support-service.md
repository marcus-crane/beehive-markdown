Associate Minister Jim Anderton today talked about the importance of addressing issues surrounding the experience of loss and grief. He was speaking at a one-day forum in Wellington organized by the National Association of Loss and Grief.

“This work is often demanding, and emotionally exhausting. I hope those of you who do this work also look after yourselves,” Jim Anderton said. “While my particular interest is in suicide, I acknowledge that the issues about loss and grief are much broader.

“I understand that responding to loss and grief has its particular challenges, because everyone grieves differently. There are no rules, and there is no magic wand to wave and make the hurt disappear.”

Jim Anderton talked about the New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy. “I want to make a difference, and to ensure that fewer New Zealanders die by suicide, or make suicide attempts.

“I am also committed to ensuring that those who lose a loved one to suicide are able to access appropriate support to help them work through their loss. And those who are caring for someone who has made a suicide attempt are able to do this while also looking after themselves.“

The New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy was launched last year and has seven goals. “One of these goals is to support families, whanau, friends and others affected by suicide or a suicide attempt,” Jim Anderton said.

New Zealand is leading the way with the Suicide Bereavement Support Service, which forms part of the strategy. “This package of services is unlike anything that is being offered anywhere else in the world. I think we can be very proud of the fact that we are trying hard to find new ways of not only helping those who are suicidal, but also helping those, usually family members, supporting them.”

“While loss and grief are very personal, people can come through these experiences, particularly if they get the help of family, friends and, when needed, professional support.”  
Jim Anderton concluded by acknowledging the importance of the role the National Association of Loss and Grief plays in ensuring opportunities for networking and information sharing.
