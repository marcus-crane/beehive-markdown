Minister for Ethnic Affairs Chris Carter said today he was proud of the response from the local Chinese community to the plight of Qian Xue and the government would do what it could to assist family members who may need to travel here.

Chris Carter understood the shock and sadness of the Chinese community to the plight of Qian Xue, dubbed “Pumpkin” after she was abandoned at a Melbourne train station by her father.

“I can well appreciate why the thought of abandoning a child in a public place was profoundly shocking to the local Chinese community. This is a community that places huge value on the love and respect families have for each other.”

Chris Carter said he was impressed with the response from the local Chinese community to the case.

“There has been a huge outpouring of support for this little girl from local Chinese kiwis, with many offers to look after her and a commendable response from the Chinese community in terms of helping police with their inquiries,” Mr Carter said.

Family violence was all too common in New Zealand and it was extremely important not to judge a community by the actions of a few.

“The Asian Community is the most peaceful community in New Zealand. Crime statistics demonstrate this fact very clearly.”

Mr Carter said the government would consider assistance to Pumpkin’s family in China should they wish to travel here as they would for any family in such a situation.

“Pumpkin’s grandparents are going through a terrible time and we would want to do what we can to help,” Mr Carter said.
