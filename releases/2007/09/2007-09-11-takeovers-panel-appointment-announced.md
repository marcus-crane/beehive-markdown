Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the re-appointment of Kevin O’Connor as a member of the Takeovers Panel from 17 September 2007 for a term of two years.

“Kevin O’Connor has made a valuable contribution to the Panel – from being part of the group that originally drafted the Code to its implementation and enforcement from 2001. His re-appointment will provide continuity in the Panel which has had three new members join it in the last year,” Lianne Dalziel said.
