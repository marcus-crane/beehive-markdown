How the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry prepares for and responds to incursions of pests and diseases is under review, Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

He published a draft MAF policy ‘Policy for responding to pests and diseases (risk organisms)’ and a discussion document ‘Joint Decision-Making and Resourcing for Readiness and Incursion Responses’ outlining a new framework for joint decision-making and resourcing for readiness and incursion responses that directly impact on primary sector industries.

The discussion document is the result of two years’ work by a joint industry-government working group.

It describes the current approach to incursion management, explains why a new framework is desirable, and outlines the proposed framework and its guiding principles.

Jim Anderton said MAF was committed to responding to pests and diseases found here that would have nationally significant impacts.

“But we can improve by working more closely with others to better manage incursions of pests and diseases.”

He said MAF was currently revising its policy, tools and procedures for preparing for and responding to pests and diseases.

“The policy sets out what the Crown will do and what people can expect in respect of responses to pests and diseases. The focus of the policy is on roles and decision-making, using a consistent approach across all sectors, no matter how big or small the response may be.

“The policy essentially sets the baseline for MAF involvement in responses. MAF’s biosecurity interests extend beyond primary production – it is charged with protecting the economy, environment, human health, and our whole way of life from biosecurity risks. This requires hard choices about how limited resources are allocated. And while some industries already invest significantly in surveillance and incursion related activities, they too face resource constraints and decisions over priorities.”

Jim Anderton said an alternative whereby the Crown and industry organisations could enter into agreements for joint decision-making and resourcing was being explored.

“The approach outlined would give industry more say in which pests and diseases we should plan for, including how to mitigate the potential impacts of, and better respond to, pests and diseases of common concern.

“The approach outlined in the discussion paper could offer benefits over the current system by getting MAF and industry parties to work together before a crisis arises. Agreeing in advance to strategic roles and responsibilities will facilitate swift and effective responses to any incursion.“

Jim Anderton said the proposed framework basically involved Government and industries coming together to decide:  
•which pests and diseases of interest to industry will trigger responses;  
•what is required to be ready for a pest or disease incursion;  
•how costs will be shared (based on relative public and private benefits); and  
• how to make rapid, joint decisions for incursion responses if these pests and diseases do arrive.

The new framework should result in:  
•More effective and efficient investment of limited resources, because of a more rigorous examination of costs and benefits and the use of the best combination of Government and industry resources;  
•Clear incentives for all parties to invest appropriately in readiness activities such as surveillance and on-farm biosecurity plans; and  
•Greater certainty for all parties about the likely nature of any particular response and cost sharing arrangements that would apply.
