New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Niue will be career diplomat Brian Smythe, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974, which adds a special bond to a relationship that is founded on strong people-to-people links and shared historical ties,” Mr Peters said.

“A key role for Mr Smythe will be to advance the close cooperation between Niue and New Zealand under the Halavaka ke he Monuina Arrangement.

The Arrangement was signed in October 2004 by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Niue Premier Young Vivian, and covers a new Programme of Strengthened Cooperation with Niue for a five-year period.

“This programme, and additional funding, covers mentoring, training, policy advice, and other support from New Zealand government agencies that will assist Niue to increase the capacity of its public service.

“The arrangement also assures continued budgetary support, and an additional programme of capital and infrastructure projects,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Smythe is currently Pacific Regional Trade Advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Wellington and has been working on Pacific issues for a number of years. He previously served as High Commissioner to Tonga and, on two occasions, as High Commissioner to Vanuatu.

Mr Smythe takes up his appointment in January, replacing Anton Ojala.
