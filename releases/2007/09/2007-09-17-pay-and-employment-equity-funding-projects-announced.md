Labour Minister Ruth Dyson has announced funding for 14 new projects from the Pay and Employment Equity contestable fund.

The $1 million annual allocation is available to public service, public education and public health employers and unions to undertake specific projects to support pay and employment equity education and training in their organisation.

"The projects being funded include reviews of gender equity issues and developing response plans in public service departments, and throughout the public health and public education sectors.

"The funding enables project managers to be employed to work with review committees on data analysis, communication, and consultation," said Ruth Dyson.

Other projects include an equitable job evaluation project and support for union organisers and members involved in pay and employment equity activities. All of the projects are building understanding of pay and employment equity issues and solutions.

The following organisations have received funding:  
The Department of Corrections  
Crown Law  
Government Communications Security Bureau  
Land Information NZ  
Ministry of Economic Development  
Ministry of Fisheries
