Prime Minister Helen Clark said that New Zealand tertiary students can now work and travel in America for up to a year under a new arrangement signed in Auckland today.

"The extension to the US State Department’s tertiary student summer work travel programme will open up more opportunities for young New Zealanders considering working and travelling in the United States as part of their OE.

“It is also consistent with New Zealand’s interest in enhancing people-to-people links with the United States which help to underpin our broader bilateral relationship," Helen Clark said.

The arrangement was signed on New Zealand’s behalf by Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Murdoch, and for the United States by Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill at the Partnership Forum in Auckland this morning. The extension from four to twelve months takes effect immediately and will be trialled for two years.

“The extension signed today also goes some way to reciprocating New Zealand’s Working Holiday Scheme for the United States.

"Since 2004 United States citizens aged between 18 and 30 have been able to work and study in New Zealand. The New Zealand Government also increased the number of places available to US citizens under the working holiday scheme from 1000 to 5000 last year," Helen Clark said.

A similar arrangement was signed between the United States and Australia last week.
