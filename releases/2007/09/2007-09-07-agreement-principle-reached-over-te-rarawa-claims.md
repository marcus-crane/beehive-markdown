Te Rûnanga o Te Rarawa today signed an agreement in principle with the Crown to settle all Te Rarawa’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims. Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations Mark Burton, Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia, Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui and Minister of State Dover Samuels represented the Crown at the signing ceremony.

Te Rûnanga o Te Rarawa and the Crown have been in negotiations since December 2002. “The Agreement in Principle’s history goes back to the work of Dame Whina Cooper, who led the Land March in 1975 from Te Hapua in the Far North to Wellington to protest against the loss of Mâori land,” Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton said. Dame Whina’s son, Joe Cooper, now sits on the Te Rarawa negotiating team.

“This is a significant milestone for Te Rarawa and the Crown," said Mark Burton. "The Agreement in Principle is a major step towards settling Te Rarawa’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, and achieving resolution of long-standing grievances." He said.

The Agreement in Principle includes cultural redress with the transfer of ten sites of high cultural and historical significance to Te Rarawa. Current leaseholders' rights and the interests of third parties will be protected. Where appropriate, public access will be provided for.

Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia said "This milestone is an important step by Te Rarawa in moving forward and forging a bright future for their people. In particular the transfer of ten sites with significant cultural and historical importance to the people of Te Rarawa.”

A key feature of the Agreement in Principle is redress that provides for Te Rarawa’s increased involvement in the management of conservation land at all levels.

“The Agreement in Principle reflects Te Rarawa’s commitment to conservation outcomes for the benefit of all New Zealanders.” Mark Burton said.

“The Department of Conservation has played a key role in negotiations over Te Rarawa’s cultural redress package. The existing positive relationship between Te Rarawa and the Department of Conservation was an important foundation for these discussions.” He said.

The settlement includes commercial redress comprising a quantum of $20 million, the opportunity to purchase 29 percent of the Aupouri Forest and other Crown properties, and a commitment by the Crown to explore buying two Landcorp farms that Te Rarawa will have the opportunity to acquire over time.

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised and addressed in a peaceful and constructive way," Mark Burton said.

The Crown will now begin a process of consultation with third parties and overlapping claimants on the Crown’s settlement offer. The Crown and Te Rarawa will work towards a detailed Deed of Settlement, which will be subject to ratification by all members of Te Rarawa.
