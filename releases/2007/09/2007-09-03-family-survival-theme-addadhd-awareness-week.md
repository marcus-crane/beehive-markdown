Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson is asking the public to learn more about people with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) & ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) this week, in order to better support their families.

"Survival of the Family" is the focus of this year’s ADD/ADHD Awareness Week running from 3 - 9 September.

“Families need to make sure they get a network of friends, health professionals and support groups around them. Those with ADD/ADHD are increasingly being recognised as needing extra support and there are now groups where they can meet others who understand what they’re going through.”

ADD/ADHD affects approximately five per cent of the population (about 200,000 people in New Zealand) including 45,000 young people from 5 to 18 years old. 70 per cent of these will continue to have symptoms as adults. Three times as many males as females have ADD/ADHD.

The three main characteristics of ADD are difficulties with:  
\- Sustaining attention, effort and persistence;  
\- Inability of controlling emotions, impulses to act and delaying responses.  
\- Lack of organisational skills.

Events and seminars will be held around the country to mark the Awareness Week and on Thursday mroning Ruth Dyson will visit the ADD Assessment and Family Support Centre at the Home of Compassion, Island Bay, Wellington.
