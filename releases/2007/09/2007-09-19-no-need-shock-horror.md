“Sue Kedgley is, as usual, being simplistic over the issue of country-of-origin food labelling,” Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today. “She says she is in a state of shock that the government should be in discussion with the US government over the issue and she claims that consumers’ rights to know where there food comes from are being undermined. What nonsense.”

“The Government is not opposed to voluntary country of origin labelling of food products, but it is a further big step to make such measures compulsory,” Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“With mandatory country-of-origin labelling the issues are not black and white,” Jim Anderton said. “Mandatory labelling would pose some significant risks to New Zealand exporters while offering few benefits to consumers. For example, where ground beef from different countries is blended, as is the case for New Zealand beef exported to the United States, mandatory labelling would merely increase costs without providing the consumer with any useful information about food safety and biosecurity.

“The Labour-Progressive Government is certainly concerned to ensure that all food sold in New Zealand is safe to eat. There are robust systems in place to ensure food safety, including requirements that imported food meets the same standards that apply to food produced in New Zealand, and that relevant pesticide or agricultural chemical residue standards are complied with,” Jim Anderton said. “The Government also administers strict biosecurity regulations designed to prevent the importation of unwanted pests and organisms, and imposes sanitary and phytosanitary standards related to trade in fresh produce.

“Right now our agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and their associated processes and services, contribute around 17 percent of GDP. They provide around two thirds of our total merchandise exports, and have long been the greatest contributors to our export earnings. Not supporting mandatory country-of-origin labelling is not, as Ms Kedgley suggests, about setting aside the rights of New Zealanders in the interests of the meat and dairy industries, it’s about maintaining a strong economy, from which all New Zealanders benefit.

“Country-of-origin labelling provides information to consumers about where the product comes from but not about food safety. It is more appropriately a voluntary commercial measure, aimed at creating a marketing advantage.

“If producers find it advantageous to identify their products as being ‘New Zealand grown’ as a point of differentiation in response to consumer demands, and reflecting the positive reputation that New Zealand products have with consumers, they have the right to do so now,” Jim Anderton said.
