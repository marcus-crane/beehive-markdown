“New Zealand’s Digital Content Strategy, launched today, will help Kiwis create, share and use new digital content,’’ said Minister for Information Technology David Cunliffe and Minister Responsible for the National Library Judith Tizard.

Digital content includes the stock of official information, commercial content and the on-line stories of ordinary New Zealanders.

“We need to build our own Kiwi content to grow our high-tech businesses, strengthen our unique national identity, and provide a rich stock of creative material for future generations,’’ the Ministers said.

The strategy provides a framework for approaching the opportunities and responsibilities presented by a digital environment. It incorporates feedback from the community and businesses to ensure it meets the needs of New Zealanders.

“The strategy takes the first steps towards unlocking content, digitising and preserving that content, promoting standards, and generating new industry opportunities. These steps will be built on over time.

“Our focus is on ensuring that our content works for us, and that it is visible and relevant. New Zealand is full of world-beating creative companies. Digital content strategies will help them find new market opportunities.

“We look forward now to the Digital Future Summit 2.0, Auckland, 28/29 November 2007. This will be an opportunity to reflect on progress over recent years and map out a robust approach to take advantage of digital technology."
