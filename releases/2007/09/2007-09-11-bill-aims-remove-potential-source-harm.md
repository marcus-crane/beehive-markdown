Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton today gave the first reading in the House of the Misuse of Drugs (Classification of BZP) Amendment Bill.

He urged MPs to take the precautionary approach over BZP. “We have enough harmful legal drugs to control by regulation already. Tobacco and alcohol cause far more harm than any other drugs in New Zealand. Why add another? This Bill will remove at least one potential source of harm,” Jim Anderton said.

The Bill, if passed, will classify BZP as a class C1 drug. “This parliament should vote in favour of classifying these psychoactive substances because there is a potential for serious side effects and even fatalities associated with their use.

“BZP and related party pills were first introduced to New Zealand under the guise of dietary supplements and were marketed as ‘herbal,’ not only suggesting that they were safe, but also that they were good for you!

“We now know that BZP has adverse side effects and the potential for severe toxicity in some individuals,” Jim Anderton said.

In November last year the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs advised that the research on BZP and related drugs, commissioned by the government, showed that the drugs pose a moderate risk of harm.

“The committee's advice was straightforward: the drug should be classified C1,” Jim Anderton said. “In my view the entire purpose of this Bill is to better protect the rights of people, particularly young New Zealanders.

“Public safety must always be of prime importance in considering these matters.  
I believe we will be enhancing human rights − and indeed it is our responsibility to do so for our young people in particular,” Jim Anderton said.

The Bill as drafted has a commencement date as an Act of Parliament of 18 December.
