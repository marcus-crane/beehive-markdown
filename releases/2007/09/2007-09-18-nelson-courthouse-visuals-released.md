Visuals for the new Nelson District Courthouse were made public today by Courts Minister Rick Barker and are part of the largest courts capital investment programme in New Zealand’s recent history.

“Under Labour, New Zealand’s courts are experiencing the largest investment in refurbishment and construction in a long time. This is a result of our concerted effort to modernise courts after a decade of neglect and real-term cut backs under the previous National administration," Rick Barker said.

“As one of the highlights of this investment programme, the expansion and refurbishment of the Nelson Courthouse will add two additional courtrooms to the existing three courtrooms. The courts’ floor area will be doubled and administration and public waiting spaces will be increased

“The refurbished Nelson courthouse is designed to meet the current and future needs of the community, and includes extra space for judges. The refurbishment is testament to Labour’s ongoing commitment to improvement over time throughout the court system,” Mr Barker said.

“The expansion and refurbishment of the existing courthouse will include extensions on the current Bridge Street site.

“As well as being bigger, the refurbished courthouse will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology, including video conferencing and evidence recording services introduced over the last year in courts throughout New Zealand by the Labour-led government.

“Where possible, environmentally sustainable design practices will also be incorporated into the concept for the courthouse. By investing now we are better placed to provide long term savings and solutions to ongoing concerns for our environment in the future.”

The expansion and refurbishment of the Nelson Courthouse is scheduled to begin in mid 2008 and is expected to be complete by mid to late 2009.

Since being elected in 1999 the Labour-led Government has completed five new courthouses and 28 major courthouse refurbishments. Four courthouses are currently being built and eight more major refurbishments either planned or underway.
