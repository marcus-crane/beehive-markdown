Thirty-one leaders across business, agriculture and forestry, science and the environment, the union movement, and non-government organisations have joined a high-level group to advise the government on emissions trading and related issues.

Climate Change Minister David Parker announced today that prominent businessman Stephen Tindall has agreed to lead the Climate Change Leadership Forum.

David Parker says the Forum will help the government to develop climate change solutions which are durable and broadly supported by the wider community.

"It is important that the government works closely with representatives of key sectors across the economy and society in the detail of the emissions trading scheme to deal with climate change and put New Zealand on a more sustainable footing."

Mr Parker said that considerable work had gone into the scheme of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, but that public engagement before the final government decisions on the design and implementation of the scheme were needed.

"The Climate Change Leadership Forum will be an important element in our engagement process.

"The members will provide fresh perspectives on policy related to climate change and emissions trading, assist with communicating proposals developed by government and industry with the wider community, and facilitate discussions with broader groups in the community.

"I would like to thank the members for agreeing to give up their valuable time to take part in this forum."

The Forum will report directly to Ministers of Finance and Climate Change through monthly face-to-face meetings, with the first meeting in October.

A list of the members of the Forum is attached.
