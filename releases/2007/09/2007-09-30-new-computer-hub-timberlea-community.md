The Timberlea community in Upper Hutt is to have a permanent Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centre of their own, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Speaking at the launch today, Laban said the new Timberlea Computer Hub will not only enable people to access the Internet, but the facility will also provide a venue for after school programmes, computer education and the development of a community website.

Located in the Timberlea Community House, the new Hub will help overcome some local barriers to using ICT, such as lack of telephone lines in homes.

The Computer Hub was made possible through a partnership between the Upper Hutt City Council, Timberlea Residents’ Association and the Wellington Regional 2020 Communications Trust. The project received a $58,275 grant from the Labour-led government’s Community Partnership Fund.

“This project is a great example of central and local government joining with business and communities to find local solutions to local problems,” said Laban.

“I am moved by the way so many local people have worked hard to build a place where this proud community can come together and connect with the world.

The $17 million Community Partnership Fund is a part of the Labour-led government’s Digital Strategy. The Fund focuses on connecting communities and building local confidence in the use of ICT.
