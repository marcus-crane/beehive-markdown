Energy Minister David Parker has rejected a proposal from Federated Farmers for landowners to be paid annually for power pylons already on their property.

“Land owners buy these properties aware that there is a power pylon or pylons on them. There is no good reason for power consumers to be expected to cough up for millions of dollars annually. What Federated Farmers want would cause price increases for all electricity users.”

David Parker met today in Wellington with representatives of Federated Farmers, who are claiming annual rents for pylons on their property, most of which have been there for decades.

“I am advised that Federated Farmers’ request would increase consumers’ annual electricity costs by some $100 million a year,” David Parker said.

“The Labour-led government does not support this and I’d be surprised if any other parties did either.”
