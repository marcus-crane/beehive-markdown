Minister for Auckland Issues and Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard this evening introduced to Parliament a Private Bill designed to ensure stable and sustainable funding for a number of important Auckland public services.

"The Labour-led Government is committed to securing Auckland's position as a world-class city. Ensuring that Auckland can sustain the organisations that contribute to a vibrant, intelligent, and safe community is a vital part of that equation," said Judith Tizard.

"The Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill seeks to secure funding for 11 organisations that deliver services and experiences that make Auckland an international city."

The Bill seeks to establish an initial level of funding from each council, and ensures that future funding will not exceed a maximum of two per cent of the rates take. At this level, the impact on ratepayers will be less than $20 per year. Funding from councils will not replace existing funding sources such as fees, entry charges, and donations.

The Bill follows the Auckland War Memorial Museum and MOTAT Acts and seeks to establish a legislative framework to secure funding for the 11 organisations from the seven Auckland councils.

The 11 organisations that will benefit from the Bill are  
•Auckland Festival  
•Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra  
•Auckland Rescue Helicopter  
•Auckland Theatre Company  
•Auckland Zoo (will not receive funding in the first year as is not yet a separate entity from Auckland City Council)  
•Coastguard Northern Region  
•New Zealand National Maritime Museum  
•NBR New Zealand Opera  
•Stardome Observatory and Planetarium  
•Surf Life Saving Northern Region  
•WaterSafe Auckland

The Bill establishes an initial level of funding from each council, and ensures that future funding will not exceed a maximum of two per cent of the rates take. Funding from councils will not replace existing funding sources such as fees and donations.

The 11 organisations were chosen by an independent assessment group from a shortlist of entities, based on market research with ratepayers. Qualifying organisations will be assessed for their level of annual funding by a new Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Board. There is provision for other approved organisations to receive funding in future, but they must be accommodated within the two per cent cap.

If successful, the Bill will provide regional funding from the seven councils of $9 million in the first year commencing July 1, 2008.

Following First Reading the Bill will be referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee.
