West Coast District Health Board (DHB) is moving to ensure a more consistent approach to what people pay to see their family doctors on the West Coast by introducing very low cost fees to 3 areas from 1 October 2007, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

Three areas: Ngakawau, Dobson and South Westland were designated remote areas of New Zealand, where salaried medical officers provided free (or subsidised) general medical services to residents. However, these Special Medical Areas (SMAs), ceased to exist as legal entities in 1993. Some patients in Dobson have already been paying a fee to see their doctor and consultation throughout the DHB has resulted in calls for a fairer overall approach.

“The Labour-led government has invested $2.2 billion dollars into primary health over the last seven years to halve the costs associated with seeing the doctor for everyone. We want people to seek medical help early and get advice on how to stay healthy,

“Nearly 1 million New Zealanders pay very low fees to see their doctor- maximum of $15.50 for adults 18 years and over, $10.50 for children 6-17 years and continue to be free for children under six and the people of these former SMAs will be part of this lowest paying group.”

Residents in South Westland and Ngakawau, who previously received free care, will pay very low fees - maximum of $15.50 for adults 18 years and over, $10.50 for children 6-17 years and continue to be free for children under six. The changes will come into effect from 1 October 2007. This puts them on a similar footing to other people accessing services from practices owned by the West Coast DHB.
