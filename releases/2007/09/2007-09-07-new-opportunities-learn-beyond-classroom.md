Young New Zealanders will be able to get hands on experience of the Dunedin albatross, visit historic ships in Auckland or see native birds in their natural habitat in Wellington because of the latest funding by the Labour-led government.

Education Minister Steve Maharey says twenty one organisations across the country have been awarded $2.1 million to take students out of the classroom and give them real, interactive learning.

“The ‘Learning Experiences Outside the Classroom’ (LEOTC) initiative funds 350,000 students a year to get out and about to learn new things. This years round focuses on the social sciences and successful organisations include museums, local and regional councils and heritage parks.

“Young people learn most when they can see, touch and interact with things to find out more about what they’re made of and how they work. This kind of learning increases students’ awareness of their community and gives them hugely valuable experiences that can’t be recreated in the classroom.”

The successful projects, which have a three year contract from July this year, are:

•Nelson Provincial Museum  
•Otago Museum  
•Whanganui Regional Museum  
•Rutherford's Den  
•Otago Settler's Museum  
•Hawke's Bay Museum and Art Gallery  
•Puke Ariki  
•The Lakes District Museum and Gallery  
•Wellington Museum of City and Sea  
•The Royal Albatross Centre  
•Tairawhiti Museum and Art Gallery  
•Karori Wildlife Sanctuary  
•Rotorua Museum of Art and History  
•The Marlborough Museum  
•South Canterbury Museum  
•Shantytown  
•The Auckland War Memorial Museum  
•The Museum of Transport and Technology  
•The New Zealand National Maritime Museum  
•The Department of Conservation: Southland Conservancy  
•Te Awamutu Museum.
