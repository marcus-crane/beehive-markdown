Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton today announced that MAF Biosecurity New Zealand will do further research into the use of chelated copper as a potential emergency response control tool for the invasive alga, Didymosphenia geminata (didymo).

“Results of field trials of a chelated copper compound (Gemex) earlier this year confirmed it has some potential as an emergency control measure,“ Jim Anderton said. “But more research needs to be done about where and when it can be used and any possible effects it may have on non-target species such as molluscs, eels, koura (freshwater crayfish), and other algae.”

“People should be aware that chelated copper is not a ‘silver bullet’ for removing didymo,” Jim Anderton cautioned. “The best way to control the spread of didymo is for all freshwater users to check, clean and dry their equipment between waterways. It makes better sense to prevent it getting into waterways in the first place than trying to remove it once it’s there.”

Chris Bicknell, Didymo Response Manager MAF Biosecurity New Zealand (MAFBNZ), said “We believe chelated copper is likely to be useful only in waterways with low levels of didymo and rivers below a certain size/flow. This targeted research will allow us to make more informed decisions around any possible use of the tool.”

The research programme will include:  
•Analysis of research to date to identify a list of criteria for assessing where chelated copper could be used to eliminate or control didymo in North Island waterways  
•Laboratory trials to assess the impact of chelated copper on selected non-target species  
•Further monitoring of the Princhester Creek trial site for didymo and assessment of the longer term impacts of chelated copper on the river’s ecology

$325,000 has been allocated for the research, which is expected to be completed by June 2008.
