Syd Jackson was a courageous indigenous leader who battled for the rights and wellbeing of tangata whenua on many fronts, says Māori Affairs Parekura Horomia.

“Syd was an icon in his own right and will be remembered for his firm and fearless advocacy of social changes which were often considered radical at the time, but which today are widely accepted as necessary, fair and just.’’

“I refer in particular to his campaigning for recognition of the Māori language, the Treaty of Waitangi and of the need for greater Māori self-determination during the time he led Nga Tama Toa.

“Syd also played a big role in the union movement, fighting not only for the rights of workers, but for its overall modernisation and for recognition of the distinct Māori voice within it,” Mr Horomia said.

“More recently he focused his attention on the health movement, spearheading the establishment of the award-winning Turuki Healthcare in South Auckland and advocating on behalf of those with cancer.”

“He was also a good friend and will be sorely missed. I extend my condolences to his whānau,” Mr Horomia said.

“Haere rā e te rangatira, e te kaitautoko kaha o ngā tika mō tō iwi Māori. Moe mai, okioki.”

He kaiārahi taketake, manawanui a Syd Jackson, I whawhai mō ngā tika me te oranga o te tangata whenua ki ngā taumata maha, e kī ana te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia.

“He tangata rongonui a Syd ka maumaharatia mō āna taunakitanga whakamau, matakukore, ki ngā whakarerekētanga tauwhiro hapori, I ētahi wā ka whakaarotia he mahi wāwāhi tikanga, ëngari I tēnei wā kua whakaāetia he mahi tika, he mahi tōtika.

“Kia titiro whakamuri ahau ki āna pakanga kia whakamanatia te reo Māori, te Tiriti o Waitangi, me te hiahia kia kaha ake te mana motuhake Māori i te wā ko ia I te ārahi a Ngā Tama Toa.

“He tūranga nui tonu tā Syd I roto I te rōpū uniana, I pakanga kahore anake mō ngā tika a ngā kaimahi, ëngari mō te whakahoutanga I te rōpū, me te whakamanatanga o te reo Māori I roto I te rōpū,” e kī ana a Horomia.

“Inātata nei I te arotahi atu ia ki ngā kaupapa hauora, te arataki I te whakatūtanga o te rōpū whiwhi tohu, a Turuki Healthcare, ki Tamaki ki te Tonga, me te whakataunaki mō rātou e māuiui ana I te mate pukupuku.”

“He hoa pai anō, ka mokemoke te katoa mōna. Aku mihi aroha atu ki tōna whānau.”

“Haere rā e te rangatira, e te kaitautoko kaha o ngā tika mō tō iwi Māori. Moe mai, okioki.”
