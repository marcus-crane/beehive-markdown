The Crown today signed a new deed of settlement with the Tûwharetoa Mâori Trust Board regarding Lake Taupô.

The deed updates a 1992 deed which vested ownership of the bed of Lake Taupô - including the Waikato River to Huka Falls and tributaries flowing into the lake - with the Board while guaranteeing public access.

Since 1926, the Crown paid Tûwharetoa an annuity and a share of revenue from things such as trout fishing licences and boating facilities. But the value of the annuity decreased over time and the Crown and the Board wanted to clarify rights under the 1992 deed.

The new deed includes a one-off, lump sum payment of approximately $9.85 million plus an annual, non-reviewable payment of $1.5 million. The lump sum compensates the Board for increases it would have been entitled to in perpetuity under previous arrangements.

The Board will also have the right to licence commercial users of the lake and new Crown and private structures. It has already entered into an agreement with at least one commercial operator.

Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said he was pleased matters left outstanding from the 1992 settlement had been resolved.

"Under the agreement the trust board's rights on a number of fronts have been clarified, including in regard to commercial tourism operators where the board will have the ability to charge fees similar to those charged by DoC on Crown land."

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said the Crown would continue to own and manage the trout fishery.

“This is a significant document which will lead to a stronger and clearer relationship between the Crown and Tûwharetoa while continuing to protect public access to the lake in perpetuity,” Mr Carter said.  
Local Government Minister and Taupô MP Mark Burton welcomed the signing saying: “I’m pleased to see that the discussions have resulted in a deed which provides clarity for tourist operators, the Crown and other users of Lake Taupô.”

I te rangi nei i hainatia e te Karauna, me te Poari Kaitiaki o Tūwharetoa, he kirimini hou, e pā ana ki te Moana o Taupō.

Ka whakatikaina tēnei i te kirimini o te tau 1992, nāna nei i whakawhiti I te mana pupuri i te papa o te Moana o Taupō - tāpiri atu ki ngā papa o te Awa o Waikato, atu ki ngā Waihīrere o Huka, me ngā papa wehenga awa, e rere ana ki te Moana – ki te Poari, me te whakapūmau kia wātea tonu ngā huarahi mō ngā tāngata tūmatanui katoa.

Mai i te tau 1926, e utua ana e te Karauna he utu-ā-tau ki Tūwharetoa, me tētahi wāhanga o ngā painga moni mai i ngā mea pēnei i ngā raihana hī taraute, me ngā taunga waka. Engari i te mea e heke ana te uara o te utu-ā-tau i runga i te wā, ka mahi te Karauna me te Poari ki te whakamārama i ngā tika i raro o te kirimini o te tau 1992.

Kei roto i te kirimini hou, he utunga nui, kotahi, he āhua $9.85 miriona, āpiti atu ko tē utunga ā-tau e $1.5 miriona, e kore e taea te arotake. He utu kāpeneheihana te utunga kotahi nei ki te Poari mō ngā pīkinga uara, mō ngā wā, e āhei ana te Poari, i raro i ngā whakaritenga o mua.

Ka riro anō ki te Poari te mana ki te whakaraihana i ngā kaiwhakamahi arumoni o te moana me ngā mahi hanga hou a te Karauna me te hunga tūmataiti. Kua oti kē e te Poari tētahi kirimini ki tētahi kaiwhakamahi arumoni hou.

Ki tā Parekura Horomia, te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, e harikoa ana ia kua whakatikaina ngā take kahore i tutuki i raro i te whakataunga o te tau 1992.

“I raro i tēnei kirimini i whakamāramatia ngā tika a te poari kaitiaki i runga i ētahi whakaritenga, tāpiri atu ki ngā kaiwhakamahi tāpoi arumoni, ka riro ki te poari te mana ki te tango utunga e rite ana ki ngā utunga a Te Papa Atawhai ki runga whenua Karauna.”

E kī ana te Minita Papa Atawhai, a Chris Carter, ka mau tonu ki te Karauna, te mana pupuri me ngā tikanga whakahaere i te pāmu whakatipu taraute.

“He pukapuka whakahirahira tēnei ka whakatinana hononga mārama ake i waenga i te Karauna me Tūwharetoa, me te whakamau anō i te huarahi wātea tūmatanui ki te moana mō ake tonu atu,” i kī a Carter.

I tautokona anō e te Minita mō ngā Kāwanatanga Ā-rohe, te Mema Pāremata o Taupō, a Mark Burton, te hainatanga, me tana kī:” E harikoa ana ahau ki te kite I ngā whiriwhiringa kua tau ki runga i te pukapuka nei, ka whakawhiwhi māramatanga mō ngā kaiwhakamahi tāpoi, mō te Karauna, me ērā ake kaiwhakamahi o te Moana o Taupō.”
