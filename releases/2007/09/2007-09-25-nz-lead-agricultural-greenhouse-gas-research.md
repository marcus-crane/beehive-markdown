New Zealand will play its role in international efforts to address climate change by taking the lead in international research on how to reduce agricultural greenhouse emissions, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard told the United Nation’s High Level Climate Change Event in New York today.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon arranged the one-day meeting to galvanise international political will ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali in December. Trevor Mallard was speaking to the meeting's Technology Thematic Plenary session about the role of technology in addressing climate change.

The New Zealand government believed that technology alone would not resolve the climate change problem, he told the meeting.

"Lifestyle and behavioural change and better urban design are among the other solutions. There is no single silver bullet for addressing climate change. A broad, multi-faceted approach is required," Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealand believes that it would make sense for the world to concentrate on developing and deploying two or three core technologies which offer the greatest and most cost-effective emission reduction opportunities."

Several options deserved particular attention, including carbon capture and storage; battery technology; electric vehicles; and renewables, such as marine, advanced biofuels, and wind power.

"While New Zealand will be largely a technology-taker with respect to many of these options, there are areas where we can lead innovation.

"For this reason New Zealand is taking the lead in fostering international research efforts to reduce emissions from pastoral agricultural production. This focus reflects both the vital role this sector plays in our own economy and the significant contribution which pastoral agriculture makes to New Zealand’s emissions profile, accounting for 49 per cent of our emissions. We warmly welcome collaboration with other countries in this important area of technology development."

Markets would also be important in driving the adoption of new technologies.

"New Zealand believes that economic instruments, such as emissions trading schemes, are critical in giving businesses financial incentives to adopt new, low carbon technologies.

In the past week the New Zealand Government announced its decision to implement a domestic emissions trading scheme. This scheme will be a world first in that it covers all economic sectors as well as all greenhouse gases.

The scheme will send a carbon price signal through the whole economy, encourage the adoption of new technology, and help set New Zealand on a low emissions pathway."
