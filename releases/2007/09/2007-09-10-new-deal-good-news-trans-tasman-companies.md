A government initiative has lowered regulatory and compliance requirements for companies doing business on both sides of the Tasman, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

A joint information sharing arrangement between the New Zealand Companies Office and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) means that the almost 1500 companies incorporated in either New Zealand or Australia who are registered to do business on the other side of the Tasman no longer need to file identical information with both the [Companies Office](http://www.companies.govt.nz/cms) and [ASIC](http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/New+Zealand+companies+operating+in+Australia+?openDocument), Lianne Dalziel said.

Instead, where the two agencies require notification of duplicated information, a New Zealand company can file the information with the Companies Office. The Companies Office will electronically lodge the updated information with ASIC, and vice-versa for Australian companies.

The following company changes covered by this initiative include: changes to registered office address; changes to company constitution; changes to names and addresses of company directors; resignation of company directors; and, lodgement of financial statements

As well as saving time – as in many instances businesses will now only need to file documentation with one agency rather than two – it also saves money. Where a change is lodged using the information exchange, the fee that may have previously been charged by the Trans-Tasman agency is no longer incurred. A set of ASIC-compliant financial statements lodged with the Companies Office that are then electronically submitted to ASIC saves the company $AUD1000 in filing fees. This translates into $500,000 in savings to New Zealand companies in financial statement filing fees alone.

Lianne Dalziel said this was one of the many positive outcomes the government had envisaged as part of its Business Law Co-ordination Review – the framework that lies behind this initiative.

"This is just one of the many initiatives that demonstrate the Labour-led government’s commitment to reducing regulatory compliance obstacles for business. As well as making a real difference to companies right now in terms of both time and money, it provides us with another win on the Single Economic Market agenda."
