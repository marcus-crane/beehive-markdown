Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter says while tonight’s Moon Festival in Waitakere City will be tinged with sadness over the death of An An Liu, it is important to remember the event is an opportunity for all communities to come together to value what they have.

“It is right that we observe a minute’s silence for An An Liu at the festival and that we spare a thought for the tragic situation this family now finds itself in,” Mr Carter said.

“What we must also do is come together tonight to promote tolerance and cultural understanding and to doubly value the love and friendship we find with our families and friends.”

The Moon Festival is always held during the rising of the new harvest moon. It is an occasion for family and friends to gather and enjoy food, dance, music and festivities. Lanterns of various shapes and sizes are lit and given to children.

The traditional three stages of celebration are the welcome, gazing and farewell of the moon. The eating of mooncakes during the festival is another important tradition, believed to date back to the 14th century

Waitakere's Moon Festival will feature storytelling, Chinese fortune-telling and food and entertainment and gives New Zealanders a glimpse into a culture other than their own in an effort to promote greater cross-cultural understanding.

The festival opens tonight at the New Lynn Community Centre at 45 Totara Avenue in Waitakere City and continues tomorrow.

“The festival is a particularly significant time for the Chinese community and I urge everyone to come along and take part,” Mr Carter said.
