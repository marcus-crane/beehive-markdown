An authentic Kiwi made television commercial kicks off this Sunday (23 September) featuring Kiwi media icon, Oliver Driver, on the assembly line.

“This is an ad that really celebrates Kiwi manufacturing,” says Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson on Buy Kiwi Made.

“We’ve worked closely with Buy NZ Made to ensure the message is clear – if we buy Kiwi, we’ve got it made.”

The advertisements feature a robotic assembly line, skilled workers and a soundtrack from Kiwi band, SJD’s, latest album, Songs from a Dictaphone.

“Almost everything about this advertisement reflects Kiwi made,” said Ms Bradford. The film shoot took place at Kiwi wine manufacturers, Villa Maria Estate, and the exterior countryside shot is Tawawera Road in Parakai, looking north towards the Kaipara Harbour.

“The coach building of the truck was undertaken by Wairau Truck Bodies, Oliver is wearing Kiwi made clothing by LWR, Huffer, Zambesi, and NZ Safety, while other actors also wear apparel made in New Zealand by Deane Apparel, Para Rubber, Little Brother, and 3M.”

New Zealand-based agencies M&C Saatchi, Curious, and Oktobor worked on the advertisements with a range of New Zealand suppliers and individuals.

Ms Bradford said the series of television advertisements will run through to 2008 and complement a wide range of other marketing activity such as outdoor, magazine, press and radio advertisements and direct marketing.

“We’ve made a classic Kiwi advertisement. It’s based on sound consumer research,” said Ms Bradford. “We’ve delivered what consumers told us would have the greatest impact - a really high quality advertisement to portray modern manufacturing that is also entertaining.”
