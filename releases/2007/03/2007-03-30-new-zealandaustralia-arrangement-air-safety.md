A joint commitment between the New Zealand and Australian governments which enables mutual recognition of aviation safety certification between the two countries takes effect today.

In a meeting in Adelaide, New Zealand Transport Minister Annette King and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mark Vaile exchanged diplomatic notes advising the other country that mutual recognition of aviation certification will come into effect today.

Mutual recognition allows airlines eligible under the 2002 Air Services Agreement to conduct air services between and within Australia and New Zealand without the need to be issued with Air Operator Certificates (AOCs) from both civil aviation authorities. Instead they will operate solely on the certificate issued by their ‘home’ safety authority.

“Airlines are currently able to set up organisations and operate both in Australia and New Zealand and the arrangement will reduce the cost of establishing such operations by removing the need to duplicate effort, resourcing and certification processes.

”However, airlines will not be able to ‘shop around’ for the regulator that suits them commercially because relevant legislation ensures that the aviation authority that provides safety oversight is the one where the majority of the airline’s flight operations occur,” the Ministers said.

“Importantly, the arrangement maintains New Zealand and Australia’s high standards of aviation safety,” the Ministers said. “Mutual recognition is possible because the regulation of airline safety in both countries is of a high standard and comparable with international best practice.”

Information on conditions of eligibility and an outline of the mutual recognition policy are at the New Zealand Ministry of Transport website at www.transport.govt.nz.
