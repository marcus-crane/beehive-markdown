Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard says the overhaul of the legislation governing real estate agents is good news for consumers.

The Minister's comments were made in response to Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove's announcement today of a full overhaul of the legislation, citing the need for better accountability and transparency within the real estate sector plus an independent complaints system, in order to better protect consumers.

"I am very pleased about this announcement as I have received many complaints about the behaviour of some real estate agents over the years," says Judith Tizard.

"Buying a house is the biggest investment for most New Zealanders. We need to have confidence in that process. And if something goes wrong, then consumers need to know that they'll get a fair hearing and a fair outcome.

"It’s time to get rid of the closed shop complaints process run by the real estate industry and to ensure that consumers get a fair go."

The Minister says that the reforms will give people the opportunity to come forward with their concerns and to actively participate in shaping a new legislative framework.
