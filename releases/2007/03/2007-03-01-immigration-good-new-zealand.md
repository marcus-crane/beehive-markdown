Net migration figures show immigration is making a positive contribution to New Zealand, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"Migration flows in the [year to December 31 2006](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/external-migration/external-migration-dec06yr-hotp.htm) showed a net gain of 14,609 people," Mr Cunliffe said. "This is roughly twice the net migration gain of 6971 in 2005.

"This data, combined with research done for the Department of Labour, shows a consistent story that immigration is benefiting New Zealand."

- In the report [Life in New Zealand: Settlement experiences of skilled migrants](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publication-view.asp?ID=217), 90 per cent of skilled migrants said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with living in New Zealand, with 89 per cent saying they would recommend New Zealand to friends and family overseas.
- The other report [Skilled Migrants in New Zealand: Employers' Perspectives](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publication-view.asp?ID=208), found that 81 per cent of employers were impressed with the performance of their skilled migrant staff.

"New Zealand needs to grow, and we need people with skills to undertake the economic transformation we need for a prosperous future," the minister said.

"This Labour-led government is putting great emphasis on education and training for New Zealanders, but Kiwis have always liked to travel and we need skilled immigrants to replace people who move permanently overseas in what has become a global marketplace for skills.

"However, the net gain through migration is not so large as to have a radical impact on our communities. Without our immigration programme, there would have been a net population loss, something we cannot afford.

"Immigration must build upon the important foundations of Kiwi society including respect for the tangata whenua and the Treaty of Waitangi. This government is committed to that."
