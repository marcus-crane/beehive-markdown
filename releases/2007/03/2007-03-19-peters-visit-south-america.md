Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves tomorrow on a two-week visit to South America, where he will visit Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.

Mr Peters will meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva, Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, and Uruguayan Foreign Minister Reinaldo Gargano. It is expected that Mr Peters will also meet Uruguay’s President, Dr Tabaré Vazquez.

"Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay are our priorities under the government’s Latin America Strategy, which aims to build closer political, economic and personal links with the region," Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand's links with Brazil have strengthened since our embassy opened in Brasilia in 2001. As South America’s largest country, Brazil is a valuable partner for us on many multilateral issues, and there is huge scope for expanding the economic and political relationship.”

In Argentina, Mr Peters will look to develop relationships with political leaders.

“The Working Holiday Scheme with Argentina has been a great success since it began in 2003, with 1000 young Argentines now coming to New Zealand each year. There is an obvious affinity for New Zealand that can be built on at the highest levels.

"The visit to Uruguay comes at a time of increased New Zealand investment in Uruguay’s agricultural sector.

"We have enjoyed a close relationship with Uruguay on agricultural issues for many years, and there is a lot for us to discuss, given we are countries of a similar size, facing common issues,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters will also visit sites in Uruguay commemorating New Zealand’s involvement in the Battle of the River Plate during the Second World War, which resulted in the scuttling of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee.
