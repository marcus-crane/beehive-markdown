This is a very significant day for all of the stakeholders involved in this project.

Yesterday was the statutory deadline for all non-casino gaming machines in New Zealand to be connected to an electronic monitoring system.

I’m happy to report that we have all met this landmark date. In fact, 20,289 machines around the country were connected well before yesterday’s deadline.

The first of the country’s 1,600 venues was commissioned in May 2006, and the final class 4 venues were connected on 9 March 2007.

As Minister for Internal Affairs, I would like to acknowledge the significant effort and support of all stakeholders involved throughout the development and implementation phases of the EMS.

This has been a complex and challenging project. It involved the connection of venues from the Mussel Rock Bar in Kaitaia to the Railway Hotel in Nightcaps, from the Hotel Chathams to Stumpers in Hokitika and the Moose Bar in Te Anau. Spanky'z, Tote & Poke, The Last Post and even our "local" the Backbencher are all connected to the EMS.

Internationally, most electronic monitoring systems roll out at the same time gaming machines are first introduced into a jurisdiction.

Few jurisdictions have attempted to introduce monitoring into existing gaming machine venues, and when this has been attempted I understand that the implementation has been nowhere near as successful as this EMS.

I also understand that, from Intralot's perspective, the roll out process has worked well.

There will always be challenges with such a major project, particularly where significant logistical issues exist, and where there are significant differences in the size and resources of the gambling operators. As a company that does business in many parts of the world I know Intralot appreciated the straightforward and practical approach that you brought to the project.

The Department of Internal Affairs has been responsible for the oversight of the entire EMS project. This included setting the regulations and fees, and scheduling the roll out.

Considerable resources have been used to support and inform stakeholders during the course of the EMS project. The Department conducted three national “road shows” where seminars were presented to interested parties. In addition numerous newsletters, updates, bulletins and mail-outs were distributed to ensure that all stakeholders were aware of issues and kept up-to-date with developments.

The timely completion of the project was only made possible through the full support and cooperation of the many different parties involved. This included the corporate societies, venue operators, gaming machine service agents and manufacturers, Intralot of course, CMT, and telecommunications and cabling suppliers.

Again, I would like to acknowledge the support of all stakeholders in the successful implementation of the EMS.

I recognise that the EMS has resulted in some additional costs for societies, but it is my firm belief that all stakeholders and the wider community stand to benefit significantly from the new monitoring system.

The EMS will:

- limit opportunities for crime or dishonesty in the operation of gaming machines
- help ensure the integrity and fairness of games
- improve transparency of the money that is spent in gaming machines
- assist to identify problems with gaming machines
- enhance the collection of data to support policy development; and
- inform New Zealanders about gaming machine operations in their communities.

EMS is much more efficient than the old manual systems. Information from the EMS will be an invaluable resource for the setting of national and regional policy, for keeping communities informed, for limiting opportunities for dishonesty, and for assisting gambling operators to manage their responsibilities under the Gambling Act.

Initial feedback from societies and operators about the benefits of the EMS has been pretty positive, and has included reference to the benefits associated with the gathering and management of information.

While societies will generally benefit from the EMS, it must be understood that such advantages are largely incidental. Parliament's insistence on the introduction of an EMS had little to do with any benefits that may accrue to individual societies. The purpose of the EMS has always been to safeguard the wider community. However, as I'm sure all gaming machine societies are very well aware, the EMS can only enhance public confidence in the sector and that, of course, is in everyone's best interests.

EMS heralds a new era for the collection and use of accurate gaming machine related information in this country. I am pleased that I have had the opportunity to be a part of this process and I thank you all for your help in making this transition so successful.
