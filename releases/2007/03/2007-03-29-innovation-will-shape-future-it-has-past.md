Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today that the innovation that has always characterized New Zealand farming was as important to its future as it has ever been.

He was speaking at the opening of the 13th World Corriedale Congress held at Lincoln University. "The Corriedale sheep story contains a lot of insight into the ingredients of New Zealand's development. The Corriedale is the product of innovation - mentored by need, and sustained in the face of scepticism and even sneering. It was developed by mixing our natural advantages with the best ideas from around the world."

"But the breed was not inevitable - it took experimentation, innovation and some courage. The owner of the Corriedale station was ridiculed by his neighbours when he let James Little cross his British breeds with Merinos - even though Little's sheep were getting high prices and awards at shows," Jim Anderton said.

Wool became one of New Zealand's most important industries and in 1950 was worth 40.6 percent of merchandise trade exports. However, wool productionnow only accounts for 2.2 percent of trade exports.

"But wool is still a very important crop. 175,000 clean tonnes is of significant value to the country and to individual farm businesses," Jim Anderton said. "Our challenge is to work hard to return wool to its former and deserved iconic status."

The government will put two million dollars into the industry over the next three years, with matching funds from Meat and Wool New Zealand. "The Network will work on a strategy to boost collaboration and innovation in the wool industry. It will take innovation in final products, marketing and production and it will take investment in research and science to restore the status of wool among our leading export goods," he said.
