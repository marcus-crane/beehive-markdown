The New Zealand Labour Department is using Tourism New Zealand’s successful tourism marketing campaign in Australia to encourage our trans Tasman neighbours to live and work here.

Immigration Minister David Cunliffe and Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor say the new campaign centred on the Department of Labour’s New Zealand Now programme starts in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane today in conjunction with Tourism New Zealand’s What’s On marketing campaign.

“Following the launch of New Zealand Now and ‘What’s On’ last year, it is exciting to build on an already successful campaign to talk to many more expat Kiwis and Australians about the unique benefits of this country and the opportunities here,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“New Zealanders realise that Australia has its share of attractions – which is why an estimated 455,000 of them live there – but New Zealand also has plenty going for it and that is the strong message this campaign is sending across the Tasman.

“New Zealand’s economic growth has equalled that of Australia over the last six years. This has led to very strong job growth and New Zealand has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world, at 3.7 per cent. With participation rates at 67.9 per cent, we are experiencing skill shortages across most sectors.

“The Government has made a commitment to encourage Kiwi expats to return home and to attract the skilled international people employers need. This new campaign will spread the word that New Zealand is a premier destination to live and work – and the time to be here is now,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor says the marketing approach will make both campaigns more effective.

“We are delighted to work with the Department of Labour on what we believe is the first marketing campaign of this type anywhere in the world. Only a few weeks ago, Tourism New Zealand launched its autumn 100% Pure New Zealand ‘What’s On’ marketing campaign in Australia, and it is attracting much attention in this market.

"With over 900,000 visitors a year, Australians are our largest source of tourism. We hope that some of this attention and recognition will assist to get expat New Zealanders and Australians to think about New Zealand as a place to live and work as well,” Mr O’Connor said.

The Department of Labour was able to use Tourism New Zealand's well established relationships with media to increase its marketing and purchasing power.

Mr Cunliffe says that New Zealand cannot afford to ignore the large numbers of  
New Zealanders living overseas, especially as the international competition for skilled people remains strong.

“We need these people to ensure the growth we need for the economic transformation of this country.

“At the same time, it makes sense to tap into the huge potential that Australia offers as a labour source. With a common labour market, New Zealand employers have access to 24 million people and Australians can move freely to this country.

Research conducted by the Department of Labour last year showed that 46 per cent of New Zealanders living in Australia and 22 per cent of Australians, aged 25 to 44 living in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane would consider moving to New Zealand to work.

“This campaign is a golden opportunity to show Australians what New Zealand is really like. They realise we have stunning landscapes, but we also have cities and jobs and they can live and work here,” Mr Cunliffe said.
