Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today called for environmental champions to be nominated for the [2007 Green Ribbon Awards](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/awards/green-ribbon.html).

Nominations for these prestigious awards are open to all individuals, businesses and community organisations who are sustaining, protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment.

“New Zealanders are committed to environmental sustainability,” says Mr Benson-Pope. “Throughout the country there are people putting this commitment into action in their own backyards, communities and workplaces, and we want to hear about it.”

The annual Green Ribbon Awards publicly recognise this exceptional contribution.

“It takes initiative, dedication and sheer hard work to make environmental action happen. We will be celebrating the very best of these achievements,” says Mr Benson-Pope.

The categories for this year’s nominations are:

- Rural sustainability
- Urban sustainability
- Caring for our water
- Sustainable business and household
- Young people making a difference
- Community action for the environment.

“Each year, the quality of nominations continues to rise,” says Mr Benson-Pope. “I’m looking forward to hearing about this year’s inspiring environmental actions.”

Nominations close on 20 April. Winners will be announced on World Environment Day on Tuesday 5 June, followed by a presentation ceremony on 6 June.
