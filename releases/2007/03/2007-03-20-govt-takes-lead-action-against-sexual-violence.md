The Labour-led government is acting to effectively address sexual violence by responding to community calls for a taskforce on this complex issue.

Justice Minister Mark Burton and Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the establishment of a ministerial group supported by an expert taskforce to provide leadership and greater co-ordination of services, reinforcing the government's commitment to combatting sexual violence.

Lianne Dalziel said the impact of sexual violence on its victims cannot be overstated.

"We know that many victims may choose not to report attacks because the investigation and trial process is difficult, traumatic and embarrassing. Victims fear that they may not be believed. Many victims drop out of the criminal justice system well before a conviction is obtained and we've already committed to research looking at how to best support them through the system.

"As well as the physical and mental health impacts on victims, the cost to the community through the health, justice and social systems is significant, so eliminating sexual violence must be a priority," Lianne Dalziel said.

Justice Minister Mark Burton said sexual violence is an important and far-reaching issue which is already the subject of work being undertaken by a range of dedicated and skilled people and agencies.

“We need the combined wisdom and experience and then a co-ordinated response from everyone working in this area in order to be more effective in targetting, resourcing and managing this serious social issue,” Mark Burton said.

The sexual violence ministerial group comprises the Ministers of Justice, Women’s Affairs, ACC and Police. This group will be supported by a taskforce comprised of chief executives of relevant departments, independent Crown entities, non-governmental organisations and the Chief Justice or her representative. The taskforce’s role will be to advise the government on how to reduce the incidence and impact of sexual violence and to take a strategic view of where government money is best spent to tackle it.

The new group is modelled on the highly effective family violence ministerial group and its supporting Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, but the issues are different and require targetted action, Mark Burton said.

The draft terms of reference will be discussed with groups working in the field of sexual violence at a sexual violence hui later this week (24-25 March).
