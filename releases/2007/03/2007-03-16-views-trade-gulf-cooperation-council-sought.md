Public views on free trade talks with the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are being sought by the Government.

Trade Minister Phil Goff said the views of exporters, importers, manufacturers, producers, investors, and non-government agencies were being sought prior to the commencement of negotiations with the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

”Officials are preparing for a first formal negotiating round in June and it is critical that they hear from people and groups with an interest in New Zealand’s trade with the GCC,” Mr Goff said.

“The GCC is a significant market for New Zealand, and I urge all those who trade with GCC states now, or who plan to in the future, to engage with our negotiators.

"Economic growth indicators for the GCC underline the importance of New Zealand securing a stable, strategic economic partnership on a par with other countries, and recognition as a supplier of choice.

"New Zealand exports to GCC states were worth $791 million in 2006, and a range of key issues will be pursued through free trade talks including the protection of existing markets and market share in agriculture, eliminating more barriers to trade and improving market access in key areas such as services", said Mr Goff.
