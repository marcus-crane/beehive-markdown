Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that New Zealand's contribution to the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Timor Leste will be increased.

Helen Clark said that the Royal New Zealand Air Force will deploy two Iroquois helicopters to Timor Leste for up to twelve months with a third on stand-by, if needed. A senior officer will also take up the appointment of Deputy Force Commander of the CJTF.

"This increase in New Zealand's commitment to the CJTF comes ahead of what is expected to be a particularly volatile period in the lead up to, and following, elections in April", Helen Clark said.

"The helicopters will provide additional transport to the CJTF as it supports UN operations in what is a mountainous country with a poor road network and where helicopters are essential for moving personnel.

"New Zealand has been part of the CJTF since it deployed in 2006. There are currently over 900 Australians and 150 New Zealanders deployed to Timor Leste with the CJTF.

"In addition, two New Zealand Defence Force personnel and 25 NZ Police are in the country as part of the UN mission, and two NZDF personnel are attached to the Timorese Defence Force as advisors.

"The threat to NZDF personnel is assessed as low to medium.

"New Zealand first became involved in peace support operations in Timor Leste as part of UN and regional operations in 1999. The current deployment builds on our efforts to improve regional security", Helen Clark said.
