Courts Minister Rick Barker today revealed the initial concept designs for the new Hastings District Court building.

“I’m delighted to see that work on the new courthouse is progressing. This concept design will help people visualise the end result of the 18 month building project we are about to embark on,” said Rick Barker.

“The new building will be built next to the existing courthouse on a site on the corner of Eastbourne Street West and Market Street South.

“As the concept designs show it will be a much bigger and better courthouse. It will be three times larger than the existing courthouse, and will have four courtrooms, mediation and hearing rooms, and generous public facilities and waiting areas.

“Site clearance work is expected to start mid 2007 and the building project should be complete by the end of 2008.

“The courthouse is a key public building for the Hastings community which many people will use. We want to ensure that new courthouse promotes access to justice for the whole community,” said Rick Barker.

“Hastings courthouse will be one of the first new court buildings in the country to focus on the sustainable elements in the Ministry for the Environment’s Govt³ programme, an initiative designed to ensure that public sector organisations behave in an ecologically responsible way.

"The building of the new Hastings Courthouse is part of what has become the largest court building programme in recent history. I have recently opened new courthouses in Greymouth and Queenstown, and courthouse renovations and extensions are occurring right across the country.

“The Labour-led Government's investment in courts infrastructure is lifting the standard of courthouses across New Zealand and ensuring that the needs of families and communities are met today and in the future", said Rick Barker
