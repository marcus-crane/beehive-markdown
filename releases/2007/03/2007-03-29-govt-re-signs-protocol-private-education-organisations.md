Private education providers will continue to have a valued and secure place in the publicly funded tertiary education system, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen's comments follow the signing of an updated protocol with the New Zealand Association of Private Education Providers, which outlines the government’s continued commitment to consultation with private education providers on tertiary education policy changes.

The protocol was first developed in 2003 and Dr Cullen said it had laid a good platform for the consultation the government is currently undertaking with the New Zealand Association of Private Education Providers and other sector bodies on the tertiary education reforms currently underway.

“The reforms are focused on improving the quality and relevance of the tertiary education sector and ensuring that it can help drive our economic transformation and social goals,” Dr Cullen said.

“Individual Private Training Establishments will contribute to a broad, comprehensive, flexible, efficient and effective network of tertiary education provision which is focused on meeting the needs of stakeholders.”

The protocol, which was not a legally binding document, would support the continuation of current consultation practices undertaken by government tertiary education agencies.

It included a commitment on the government’s part to consult with NZAPEP on relevant policy changes and a commitment on the NZAPEP’s part to fully and fairly inform its members of the information it receives from government.

“It is a good faith agreement that will have ongoing benefits for tertiary education,” Dr Cullen said.
