Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Hon Mahara Okeroa is delighted with the news that the museum in Chicago has agreed to return 14 tattooed Maori heads (Moko Mokai) dating back more than 150 years, to Te Papa in Wellington.

The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago told Prime Minister Helen Clark today that it has agreed to return the heads of Maori Ancestors after several years of negotiations with New Zealand.

"I am very grateful, along with all Maoridom, to the Chicago museum for their agreement to repatriate these ancestral treasures home to Aotearoa New Zealand after being away for such a long time. Kei te tatari mai te whenua mo ana mokai Tupuna, The land awaits its descendants", said Mahara Okeroa.

The curator of Pacific Anthropology at the Field Museum of Natural History, Dr John Terrell says the museum has been considering returning the bones for the past two or three years but the board only made the final decision on Monday.

He said it was decided to return the bones because the request from Te Papa in  
Wellington was genuine and sincere.

There will be further discussions with Te Papa to finalise the details.

Te Papa's policy on human remains is that they should be returned to New Zealand if possible. It is believed that more than 200 heads remain in overseas institutions.

"With the returning of this sacred taonga it will be a time of sad reflection on the journey these ancestors have taken, but also a sense of joy that they will be finally returning home”, said Mahara Okeroa.

Once returned to New Zealand the taonga will be placed in Te Papa Museum's wahi tapu section until research can confirm their tribe, or iwi, of origin. The museum repatriates ancestral remains to iwi several times a year, a policy supported by the government.
