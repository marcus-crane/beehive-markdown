The government is strengthening the regulatory impact analysis regime from April 1, 2007 to improve the quality of new rules and to give business more input into determining the costs and benefits, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel says.

The changes include giving more teeth to the standalone unit that assesses the quality of regulatory impactment statements and requiring discussion documents to include a draft regulatory impact statement, including questions about the likely effects of proposed regulation. This will allow those affected to have input early on in policy development.

Policy proposals must currently be accompanied by a regulatory impact statement (RIS) to ensure that the regulations proposed are justified, cost-effective and do what they're supposed to. From April 1 the RIS will be more explicit in outlining the range of options and reasons why some are preferred over others, Lianne Dalziel said.

"We're looking at better identifying exactly what is it we're trying to fix and how big the problem actually is. We will spell out all the options for tackling the issue. Regulation is not always the only answer, so we want to ensure that we explore all non-regulatory solutions too. We need to ensure that existing regulations are taken into account. We want to ensure that we are not duplicating requirements or adding complexity. The risks and opportunities of each option will be examined alongside the costs and benefits, in consultation with those likely to be affected. "

A standalone unit already exists to check that the design of discussion documents or other forms of consultation will produce an adequate final assessment of the likely regulatory impact of the proposal. From April 1, the regulatory impact analysis unit (RIAU) will focus on policies that impact on economic growth and will be able to jump in at the design stage of policy proposals to ensure all the options are canvassed, the right questions asked and the right people consulted, Lianne Dalziel said.

"From April 1 the RIAU will also be able to send regulatory impact statements back to the relevant department for more work if they aren't up to scratch.

"The improvement of this process is a key part of the [Quality Regulation Review](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____19894.aspx) which is looking at the impacts regulatory requirements have on business.

"The changes will ensure that Ministers will have the best information in front of them when making decisions. It will enhance confidence in the government's analysis of proposed laws and rules and, will ensure the debate and investigation around the possible impacts of new regulations is wide, transparent and open to scrutiny."
