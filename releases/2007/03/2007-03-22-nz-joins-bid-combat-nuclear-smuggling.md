New Zealand will join a US-led project helping to combat nuclear smuggling as part of an international project against weapons of mass destruction, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

“New Zealand has decided to work with the United States to deal with an issue of mutual concern – the smuggling of nuclear and radioactive materials,” Helen Clark said.

“New Zealand’s funding of more than $680,000 will be helping the US Department of Energy to train officials and provide better detection equipment on the Ukrainian border with Russia. This assistance will help the Ukraine battle those who might be trying to smuggle nuclear and radioactive material.

“The project in the Ukraine has already attracted support from Canada, and will receive technical support from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

"New Zealand’s contribution will be as part of the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, which was launched in 2002. The Partnership's objective is to increase international co-operation to prevent WMD and related materials falling into the hands of non-state actors, with an initial focus on securing the WMD legacies of the former Soviet Union.

“There is a large amount of such material still present in post-Soviet countries, and a very real risk it could be used to build weapons or be involved in illicit activities.

“This is the second time that New Zealand has partnered with the US to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction as part of the broader G8 programme. Last year we co-operated with a US project working to shut down the last plutonium-producing nuclear reactor in Russia, in Zheleznogorsk.

“As a contributor to the G8 Global Partnership, New Zealand has also previously worked with the United Kingdom on the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles.

“After the success of our previous co-operation with the US in this partnership, I am very pleased that we can continue to work together to improve international security,” Helen Clark said.
