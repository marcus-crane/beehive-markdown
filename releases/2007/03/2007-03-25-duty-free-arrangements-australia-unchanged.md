There will be no change to the current duty free arrangements with Australia when new security measures relating to liquids, aerosols and gels come into effect on 31 March, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven confirmed today.

“Last month I announced new security measures that restrict the amounts of liquids, aerosols and gels that passengers can take on an aircraft in their carry on luggage. Since this time, the New Zealand Government has been working with Australia to ensure that, after passengers have been through security screening, they will continue to be able to buy duty free liquids, aerosols and gels in New Zealand, and travel to Australia with these items in their carry on luggage. These include items such as liquor and perfume, and also drink or food purchased in the airport after passengers have been screened. I can confirm that there will be no change to these duty free arrangements.

"Australia acknowledges that New Zealand has high quality security measures in place for such items that are sold in the duty free area of the airport. Aviation security officers check duty free stock to ensure that items are what they appear to be, and that they have not been tampered with.

"Buying and travelling with your duty free and other retail purchases will not change for most passengers. Travellers flying direct to their final destination from a New Zealand airport can purchase duty free and other retail products as usual, once they have passed through security screening. The smaller number of passengers who have more than one international flight to reach their final destinations and are transiting may, however, be re-screened when they change flights. At this point, these passengers may be affected by security measures in place in the countries they are transiting through. Passengers should check with their airlines before travelling," said Harry Duynhoven today.
