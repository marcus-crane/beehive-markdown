Three thousand [Modern Apprentices](http://www.modernapprenticeships.co.nz/en/) have now completed their training – proof that the Labour-led government's revitilisation of trades training is continuing to bear fruit, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen made the announcement during a visit to congratulate Auckland carpenter Phillip Newport – the 3000th Modern Apprentice to complete his training.

Phillip, 23, trained with Colin Bird Building Services Ltd and gained his National Certificate in Carpentry Level 4 through the Building Construction ITO.

"Phillip typifies the smart, young trainees coming through the system who have acquired valuable skills to serve them and their employers well in the future," said Dr Cullen. "If we are to transform New Zealand into a higher growth, higher skilled economy we need more workers like Phillip."

Phillip spent four years training as a Modern Apprentice. He loves building and hopes to set up his own business as a builder one day. "My boss, Colin Bird, was a great inspiration and a great teacher."

Colin currently employs three apprentices and said the training system today was far more effective than when he trained. "I just love training young people and see them pick up the same skills and enthusiasm that I have. I am very proud of Phil, he's the most exceptional apprentice I have dealt with."

"We need more employers like Colin," said Dr Cullen. "I am pleased that a recent independent evaluation of the scheme found that most employers surveyed would recommend the programme to young staff and other employers."

Latest [industry training statistics](http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary.aspx?id=1205) show that at 31 December 2006 there were 9466 Modern Apprentices in training, 13 per cent more than December 2005. Total industry trainees numbered 123,859, up 5 per cent.

The Modern Apprentice scheme was introduced by the Labour-led government in 2000 to improve the participation of young people in trades training.

"It's great that thousands like Phillip are now making a valuable contribution to the economy by easing skill shortages and improving business productivity."

The Labour Department's latest labour market report shows 29 per cent of firms having difficulty finding skilled staff, down from a high of 61 per cent in late 2004.

"I congratulate Phillip. He is shining example to others and I am confident he will have a rewarding future," concluded Dr Cullen.
