New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the European Union and Belgium will be career diplomat Peter Kennedy, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

It is proposed that Mr Kennedy will also be accredited to Luxembourg and the EU's two newest member states, Romania and Bulgaria.

“This year is the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the European Community, and as it has grown from six members to 27, the depth and breadth of New Zealand’s relationship with it has also grown," Mr Peters said.

“The European Union is now our second largest market, a significant source of tourists, and a strong partner for us in a number of multilateral areas.

"We have an excellent relationship, underscored by the similar views we hold on many issues of mutual concern, and the ability to have robust and constructive dialogue in areas such as the WTO Doha Development Round.

"A particularly pleasing aspect of that close cooperation has been the increased attention the EU is giving to issues in the Pacific,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Kennedy, who was the Prime Ministerial foreign affairs adviser from 1990 to 1993, is currently Director of Europe Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His previous postings include Ambassador to Korea, Apia, and Geneva, where he was Chair of the GATT Technical Barriers to Trade Committee.

He will take up his assignment in June, replacing Wade Armstrong.
