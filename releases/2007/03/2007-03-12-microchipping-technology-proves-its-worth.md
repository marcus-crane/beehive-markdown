The successful reunification of a prized family pet with its owners thanks to a microchip, highlights the benefits of the technology for all dog owners, says Associate Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Haurua family of Ponsonby lost their two-year-old Rottweiler Levi in November last year and had given up hope of ever seeing their pet again.

Despite Levi's collar and registration tag being lost, he was able to be identified by animal control officers because he had been microchipped. He was subsequently reunited with his family last week.

"Levi's return is great news for the Haurua family, and it also highlights the real benefits of microchipping for other dogs and their owners," Nanaia Mahuta said.

"[Microchipping](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Dog-Control-Index?OpenDocument) is a simple, lifelong way to identify dogs and link them to their owner, and as this case highlights, results in the speedier return of lost, stolen or injured animals.

"As time goes by and more dogs are progressively microchipped, I think we will start hearing more stories like this in which missing animals are successfully reunited with their owners," Nanaia Mahuta said.

The Government passed legislation last year requiring all dogs registered for the first time after 1 July 2006, to be microchipped. The law change was just one of a range of measures introduced to improve public safety around dogs.

Microchipping affects mainly puppies and imported dogs. Working farm dogs are exempt from the requirement.

Other dogs do not need to be microchipped unless they:

- have been classified as menacing or dangerous on or after 1 December 2006
- are unregistered and have been impounded
- are registered and have been impounded twice since 1 July 2006.
