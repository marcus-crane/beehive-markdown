Bill English has again poured cold water on the personal tax cuts his co-leader John Key so desperately wants to pursue, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

On Morning Report this morning Bill English said "now is not the time to be giving extensive tax cuts."

Contrast that with Mr Key who just last week was saying "there's no doubt there will be tax cuts"* because of the "$11.5 billion surplus". He dismissed the inflation consequences of large tax cuts, saying they were "not a huge issue".

The divide between the two couldn't be wider. Bill English believes bigger surpluses are needed – tighter fiscal policy, John Key wants tax cuts and more spending – a looser fiscal policy.

Dr Bollard said in a select committee hearing yesterday that private sector  
spending was still the "number one" problem, not government spending.

Bill English's only solution is to ignore that and "haul back" on planned new government spending over the next two years and the business tax package.

Mr English is not only going cold on the personal tax cuts John Key wants, but now he wants to scrap the business tax measures which Dr Bollard himself said would boost business investment.

"National's economic policy is quite simply, confused.

"We have got the balance right – we're delivering a quality public service New Zealanders want, we are making tax changes and investing in infrastructure to boost economic growth and we are leading by example by saving for the future through the Superannuation Fund.

"Mr English needs to come clean and explain which part of this doesn't make sense," Dr Cullen concluded.
