"New Zealand has a drug problem. New Zealand has an alcohol problem. And New Zealand has a problem admitting the seriousness of the problem," Jim Anderton said at the launch of the latest New Zealand National Drug Policy (NDP), which he hosted at Parliament today.

The policy is the Government's five-year framework for preventing and reducing harm from alcohol, tobacco, illegal and other drugs.

The new policy builds on the previous NDP. "The new, broader policy aims to encompass the social, economic and health harms caused by drugs and was finalised after an extensive public consultation process undertaken last year."

"It was vital that those affected by the drug policy were given the opportunity to have input into it, and the document is better for it," he said.

The new policy better reflects the current New Zealand 'drug culture', which has seen some major changes in the last ten years, such as the establishment of methamphetamine, the availability of party pills, increased binge drinking and the continued bedding in of cannabis use.

"We're not starting from scratch in combating these problems and have made a significant difference already. There has been a change in attitude to tobacco; there is stronger enforcement around methamphetamine and its ingredients; we now have research into BZP; we have established community action programmes around drugs; and we have embarked on the culture change campaign aimed at binge drinking.

"Under this new National Drug Policy we will continue to make a difference – not by hectoring, not by hand-wringing, not by hoping. We will make a difference by bringing government and non-government agencies together around a strong policy, and the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy, which I chair, is committed to keeping the pressure for strong actions well and truly on," Jim Anderton said.

What is the National Drug Policy (NDP)?  
The NDP 2007-2012 is the Government's five-year policy framework for preventing and reducing the harm from alcohol, tobacco and illegal and other drugs. It is an inter-agency policy developed by the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy. This second National Drug Policy builds on the first but with a broader focus to encompass the social, economic, as well as health harms caused by drugs.

Why have the NDP?  
The National Drug Policy is an umbrella document to bring together government and non-government policy and responses to drug issues. It is a way for Government to show leadership on drug policy and coordinate the actions of all the different Government agencies that address drug-related harms.

What are the objectives of the NDP?  
To prevent or delay the uptake of drugs, reduce drug-related harms, make families and communities safer and reduce the cost of drug abuse to individuals, society and government.

How will the NDP be implemented?  
There are a number of current action plans or strategies which fall under the general auspices of the National Drug Policy, and further action plans will be developed over the next five years. Not only is collaboration between government agencies a key feature of the National Drug Policy but working with NGOs and communities will also be an important focus for future action plans. One of the most important aspects of the second National Drug Policy will be access to current information on drugs through 'Evidence On-Line', which will provide an accessible portal to a range of data from across Government as well as regular updates on emerging evidence.

SUMMARY OF STATISTICS ON DRUGS  
1.1Tobacco  
Tobacco is responsible for approximately 5000 deaths per year.

Health effects include cancers, blindness, chronic respiratory disease, heart disease, stroke, and SIDS.

The prevalence of cigarette smoking has decreased over the last 10 years, from 27% in 1995 to 23.5% in 2005.

Over 2004 and 2000, prevalence of smoking in year 10 students has decreased from 16.3% to 10.7% in girls and from 14.0% to 7.2% in boys.

1.2Alcohol and youth  
Over 81.2% of New Zealanders have drunk alcohol in the last year. Over half of youth aged 12-17 years ('youth drinkers') had consumed alcohol in the last 12 months, and about one in eight of these said they had consumed large amounts of alcohol at least once a week. Over three-fifths (62.5% of youth drinkers reported that someone had purchased alcohol for them in the last 12 months.

Alcohol-related harms include:  
haemorrhagic stroke, cancers of the mouth, throat, breast and liver, and cirrhosis of the liver mental health conditions, such as dependence and depression birth defects, including foetal alcohol syndrome and other permanent disabilities economic and social harms such as poverty, unemployment, low productivity, family breakdown and child neglect non-fatal and fatal injuries, either intentional (eg, from violence or self-harm) or unintentional (eg, from road traffic crashes).

There are markedly different drinking patterns for different age groups, in the frequency and amount of alcohol consumed. People aged 18–24 years did not consume alcohol as frequently as people aged 55–65 years but were significantly more likely to consume large amounts of alcohol on a typical drinking occasion.

1.3Cannabis  
Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in New Zealand. Related harms include adverse effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular system and increases the risk of major psychological problems.

One in seven New Zealanders (13.7%) has used cannabis in the last year.

1.4Stimulants  
5.3% of surveyed people reported having used an illegal stimulant in the last year.

Methamphetamine is a particularly problematic stimulant and is most commonly identified with violence, anti-social behaviour and mental health problems in New Zealand.

1.5Hallucinogens  
Hallucinogens include LSD and ‘magic mushrooms’.

1.2% have reported using LSD, 1.1% have reported mushrooms.

1.6Opiates  
The prevalence of opiate use has remained low at around 0.1%.

Although the prevalence of opiate use is relatively low, the associated social and health harms (eg, crime and the potential spread of blood-borne viruses) are serious.

1.7Inhalants and volatile substances  
Solvents include petrol, glue, butane gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

Solvent use has been associated with a number of deaths. During the period 2004 and 2005 the Wellington coroner investigated solvent-related deaths of young people that occurred from 2003 and 2004. In 2003 0.1% of people surveyed had used solvents in the previous year.

1.8Performance and image-enhancing drugs  
So far PIEDs have not been included in national drug use surveys in New Zealand, so there is a lack of information about the prevalence of their use.

1.9Diverted pharmaceuticals  
Currently there is no way to measure the volume of diverted pharmaceutical drugs on the illicit drug market.

Pharmaceuticals of particular concern include morphine, methadone and other opioid-based pharmaceuticals, amphetamine, benzodiazepines, codeine, methylphenidate (eg, Ritalin), sildenafil citrate (eg, Viagra) and ketamine.

1.10Legal highs  
20% of people have tried legal party pills at some time and 15% had used them in the last year. (The highest use isby people aged 2024 years).
