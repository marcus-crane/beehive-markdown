Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker will travel to Whangarei tomorrow to see first hand the extent of the flood damage.

“The response to the flooding is being well managed by the Northland Regional Council, Far North District Council and Whangarei District Council, and Emergency Operation Centres have been activated,” said Rick Barker.

"While a civil defence emergency hasn't been declared the Beehive’s National Crisis Management Centre has been activated and is monitoring the situation. Civil defence staff are available to meet any requests for additional resources from those leading the response.

“The first priority is to ensure that people are safe, and are being given assistance as necessary to return to their homes as soon as possible. If their homes are uninhabitable, continued accommodation and support will be provided.

"My visit tomorrow will allow me to get a better understanding of the situation and the problems emergency workers are facing on the ground,” said Rick Barker.

Accompanying Rick Barker will be local Labour MP Hon Dover Samuels and the Director of the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, John Hamilton.
