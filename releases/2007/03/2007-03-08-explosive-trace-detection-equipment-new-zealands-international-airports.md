New Zealand's high aviation security standards will be further enhanced with the introduction of new explosive trace detection equipment at our international airports from around June this year, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven announced today.

“Luggage carried in the hold is already tested for traces of explosives. New, state-of-the-art equipment designed to detect a wide range of explosives will be used for screening international passengers’ carry-on luggage," said Harry Duynhoven.

Explosive trace detection is a quick process that will be carried out on randomly selected passengers once they have walked through the metal detector, and their carry-on luggage has been x-rayed. A swab will be run across a passenger’s travel documents or luggage. The explosive trace detection equipment then analyses the swab for residue of explosive materials. If any explosive residue is detected, the passenger is subject to additional screening. Once cleared, the passenger is free to continue boarding.

"Technology is not yet at the point where it can simply and easily detect all explosives. For example, certain liquid explosives cannot be detected. Because of this, as I have previously announced, New Zealand is also introducing restrictions on liquids, aerosols and gels from 31 March," said Mr Duynhoven.

Under these restrictions, all international air travellers leaving New Zealand will only be able to carry onto an aircraft liquids, gels and aerosols in containers of 100ml or less, and only as many containers as fit into a single re-sealable plastic bag of one litre volume. These measures are in line with those in place in Europe, the United States, and Canada. Australia is introducing the measures on all flights to and from Australia from 31 March 2007. An increasing number of other countries are also introducing the measures.

“Explosive trace detection screening is increasingly common in international airports worldwide. With the introduction of explosive trace detection equipment, and the new measures limiting liquids, aerosols and gels, we are further enhancing our high aviation security standards," said Mr Duynhoven today.

**Frequently asked questions**

**What is explosive trace detection and how does it work?**

Explosive trace detection is state-of-the-art technology capable of screening for a wide range of explosives.

The explosive trace detection process is a non-intrusive method of testing to see if explosive residue is present. Any explosive residue that a person has been handling is likely to have been transferred to other items they come into contact with. For this reason a swab is taken from either a passenger’s travel documents or their carry-on baggage. This swab is then analysed by placing it in a machine that detects whether certain types of explosive residue are present or not.

This technology is already being used in New Zealand by the Aviation Security Service as part of the screening process for international hold baggage before it is loaded onto the aircraft. Explosive trace detection is currently being used in countries including the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union, to test passengers and their carry-on baggage for explosives.

**When is explosive trace detection being introduced?**

Explosive trace detection will be introduced at international security screening points to screen passengers’ travel documents and cabin luggage for explosives from about June 2007.

**Why is it being introduced in New Zealand’s international airports?**

Explosive trace detection screening is increasingly common in international airports worldwide. With the introduction of explosive trace detection equipment, and the new measures limiting liquids, aerosols and gels, we are enhancing our already high aviation security standards, and ensuring international consistency.

**What types of substances does the unit detect?**

The explosive trace detection unit will detect a wide range of explosives.

**Will this process cause me additional delays at the screening point?**

No, explosive trace detection is a relatively quick process. Assuming no traces of explosives are detected we estimate that the average time it will take to process a passenger will be between 30 to 40 seconds.

Because passengers will be selected on a random basis for traces of explosive it will not cause delays in processing.

**How is the introduction of explosive trace detection being funded?**

It has already been indicated that as part of the introduction of the new screening standard for liquids, aerosols and gels, there will be an increase in the international aviation security charge. Explosive trace detection makes up a small component of that increase. The overall increase will be approximately $4.50. This charge is levied on airlines, which are likely to include it in the total price of your airline ticket.

**Will additional staff be required to undertake the screening?**

No additional staff are required for the introduction of explosive trace detection, beyond those already announced for implementing the new liquids, aerosols and gels screening.

**Will everybody be screened?**

No. Passengers will be selected at random.

**Where will the screening take place and who will carry out the testing?**

The screening will take place once a passenger has walked through the metal detector, and their carry-on luggage has been x-rayed.

The screening process will be carried out by trained Aviation Security Officers.

**What will happen when I am tested?**

The screening process will involve a swab being wiped over a passenger’s travel documents or hand luggage. This swab is then analysed in the unit for any residue of explosive materials. When the passenger has completed the process they will be free to continue on through to the departure lounge.

If any explosive residue is detected then the passenger will be subject to additional security measures. Where aviation security officers ascertain that no explosives are present, the passenger and baggage will be cleared to board the aircraft.
