New Zealand is one of the first countries in the world to introduce sign language into the school curriculum, to support it being made an official language under the [New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Act 2006](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1590191240&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B6A608%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC), says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"Today's launch of a unique school curriculum for sign language is a landmark event, creating more access to sign language for both deaf and hearing students, to increase the pool of learners and users of the language.

"The NZSL curriculum now positions sign language as a choice alongside other languages offered in schools, to be learnt by all students. It's a unique and now official kiwi language, giving it equal status to a spoken language."

Minister for Disability Issues, Ruth Dyson, says the [curriculum](http://www.tki.org.nz/e/community/language/nzsl/) is another huge step forward in the recognition of sign language, and is contributing towards a more inclusive New Zealand.

"The publication of these guidelines firmly places NZSL within the mainstream, giving hearing students access to the language and culture of the Deaf."

The ['New Zealand Sign Language in the New Zealand Curriculum'](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/language/curriculum/nzsl/index_e.php) has been developed over the past four years in partnership with the deaf community, and sets out how students' learning will progress and the outcomes to be achieved.

Steve Maharey says the curriculum will help teachers encourage students to broaden their knowledge of sign language, and teach them how to communicate it with users in a range of social situations.

"The curriculum also contains guidelines for teaching and learning NZSL in early childhood education centres aligned with ['Te Whâriki', the Early Childhood Education Curriculum](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=3567&indexid=3612&indexparentid=10945) Framework.

"Teaching materials to support the curriculum’s implementation will initially focus on years 7 – 8, and will eventually be rolled out to increase language learning from years 7 – 10."
