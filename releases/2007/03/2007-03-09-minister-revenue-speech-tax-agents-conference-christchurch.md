Thank you for inviting me to speak at your annual conference. As Minister of Revenue, I welcome this opportunity to update your members on developments in the government’s tax reform programme.

I use the word “programme” deliberately, because it describes a clear and measured progression. Our programme is about improving the way our tax rules work for everyone, in a pragmatic way, and by listening to the views of those affected.

That means getting people to pay the taxes they should, and enforcing the rules in a reasonable way.

It means making the rules easier for businesses to comply with and to complete globally. And it means using the tax system to lift the living standards of families and their children and encouraging them to save towards their futures.

From 1 April this year, for example, more than 150,000 families are expected to benefit from increases in the Working for Families Tax Credits. This is as a result of the increase in the family tax credit of $10 per week per child that was signalled in the Working for Families package announced in 2004.

In addition, low-income working families will benefit from the increase in the amount of the minimum family tax credit to $18,044 a year that also comes into effect on the 1st of April this year.

This year also sees the start-up, in July, of KiwiSaver, which is a key part of the government’s strategy to increase personal savings, and the country’s economic performance. KiwiSaver will make it easier for people to save for their retirement by building up their financial assets. And by making KiwiSaver employer contributions tax-free, it’s hoped that employers will see KiwiSaver as a valuable way of contributing to the long-term financial wellbeing of their employees. Much effort has gone into designing a scheme that can easily be supported by employers to ease the transition to KiwiSaver and ensure that costs and compliance are kept to a minimum.

Hand in hand with these strategies is the government’s commitment to creating an environment that enables New Zealand business to thrive in the global economy.

The key components of the tax reform programme are based on the confidence and supply agreement that was signed between Labour and United Future.  
A key plank of the agreement was a major review of our business tax rules, with a view to ensuring that the system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

In fact, a number of our reforms that are under way have an Australian focus, such as the international tax review, which takes as its starting point the Australian rules on taxing offshore income.

The same goes for our officials’ review of the taxation of life insurance which was released for public feedback last week. The review also looks at developing rules that have certain conceptual similarities to Australia’s rules.

While I agree that we can improve our way of doing things by doing some of what Australia does, not everything is right for New Zealand.

Take Australia’s capital gains tax, for example, a measure that I would not like to see introduced here.

That’s why we are talking with New Zealand business to develop rules that are not only appropriate in the New Zealand context, but also meet our goal of being competitive with Australia.

The driving force behind the ideas set out in the Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July last year, is the strong desire to strengthen the ability of New Zealand businesses to grow and compete in an increasingly borderless international economy.

It represents the most comprehensive review of business tax arrangements since 1988. When you consider the scope of changes in the international environment and the advance of technology in that time, I think you will agree, a review was long overdue.

Our initial proposals were released for public consultation in July last year.

They included a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 cents; and improved assistance for research and development, as per United Future's policy.

They also included proposals for new tax incentives to boost export market and skills development, matters of particular interest to the Labour Party, and a series of more technical changes to depreciation and asset write-offs, building on the substantial changes introduced in the 2005 Budget.

Altogether, they amounted to a programme which, if implemented in full, would cost just under $2 billion a year.

A corporate tax rate of 30 cents, without the accompanying capital gains tax, stamp duties, or compulsory superannuation levies, would certainly achieve the goal of retaining competitiveness with our major trading partner, Australia, in the first instance.  
But that is not the only step we believe we should consider, which is where the targeted incentives for research and development, export markets and skills development come in.

The excesses of the 1970s and early 1980s have understandably given tax incentive schemes of this type a bad name, and one of the real challenges we have to confront is the cynicism that we are about to repeat the worst aspects of the earlier schemes all over again.

But equally, one of the lessons of the later 1980s and the 1990s is that the preoccupation with things working in theory ahead of practice has been just as detrimental, so what has characterised our discussions on these issues has been the pragmatism I spoke of earlier.

We are looking for solutions that work, not fit a pre-determined ideological grid.

I expect detailed announcements to be made on the business tax proposals in the Budget, with legislation to follow shortly thereafter.

Complementary changes are being considered as part of our review of New Zealand’s international tax rules.

The discussion document released late last year examines the principles underlying the current tax rules for offshore income and concludes that there is a good case for revising the current paradigm, which seeks to tax all offshore income as it is earned.

New Zealand is the only country that follows this approach to taxation, with the result that our rules are out of line with those of our major trading partners, in particular Australia.

And the costs of being different have grown.

The discussion document also looks at the case for reducing rates of withholding tax in New Zealand’s double tax agreements.

Lower rates would encourage inward investment and benefit New Zealand firms investing offshore.

The discussion document examines a comprehensive reform of the current system − since simply tinkering would obviously not be enough.

The cornerstone of the new paradigm is an exemption from taxation for offshore active income, regardless of where it is earned.

Providing such an exemption would represent a fundamental departure from the principles underlying New Zealand’s current tax system and therefore requires a rethinking of all of the provisions related to the taxation of income from foreign direct investments.

While the discussion document establishes a new approach to taxation, it deliberately does not put forward concrete proposals on how to implement it.

Rather, it canvasses the many provisions other countries have employed in implementing an active-passive distinction.

As Dr Cullen and I said in the discussion document, we hope to draw on international experience in conjunction with our consultation process, to develop a set of proposals that are appropriate in the New Zealand context.

The development of the new rules depends crucially on input that we receive from New Zealand businesses.

Four principles will guide the development of the new system. They are:

- First, the tax system should not discourage firms from undertaking expansion of business operations offshore to take advantage of market opportunities or gain production efficiencies.
- Second, the new rules should take into account the legitimate business arrangements and methods of operation that New Zealand businesses use in their offshore operations.
- Furthermore, the rules should maintain a level of protection for the domestic tax base.
- And finally, the rules should, as much as possible, reduce compliance burdens.

Obviously, it will be necessary to make trade-offs among these objectives.

The government is prepared to make them, to achieve a balance among the objectives, and we hope that business too will recognise the need for a reasonable balance to help us determine the appropriate mix of policies.

The point I am making here is that we are listening and that input from businesses will be influential in determining the rules which will be adopted.

As Minister of Revenue, one of my major interests lies in ensuring that our tax and tax-related social policy laws work well, so it is easy for people and firms to comply with the law and to meet their responsibilities.

For example, in October last year I released a discussion document proposing liberalisation of a range of tax penalties and associated legislation, to encourage voluntary compliance with the law.

The idea was to have tax penalties that reflect the seriousness of the offence, since people comply with the law more willingly when they see it as reasonable.

We have considered a wide range of submissions on these issues, and it is expected that changes will be included in the taxation bill planned for introduction in May.

There are, for example, several areas in the law where the rules about what behaviour attracts a penalties could be made clearer, more consistent and better targeted at making people want to comply with the law.

One of the main changes to be introduced will reduce the number of penalties faced by people who have a tax shortfall if they tell Inland Revenue about it before advised that they are to be audited. In that case, penalties will not be imposed on them for not having taken reasonable care or for having adopted an unacceptable tax position. As I announced earlier this week, this change will apply from the date the relevant legislation is introduced.

Other changes include updating the definition of “tax agent” to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exclude certain people from the definition in limited circumstances. This is expected to happen only rarely, and only when it is considered necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system.

The new legislation will also clarify when a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care may be imposed on taxpayers who have used a tax agent, an area which is not black and white under current law.

The scope of the penalty for having taken an unacceptable tax position will be narrowed, to apply only to income tax. That will relieve the problem of people being harshly penalised in relation to GST returns, which are often prepared without the help of a tax agent or similar professional advice.

First time late payers will not automatically attract a penalty – instead, they will be notified by Inland Revenue that they are late with their payment and be given time to pay the amount owing before a penalty is imposed.

Similarly, the shortfall penalty for underpayments of PAYE will be graduated for employers who file an employer monthly schedule in time but do not pay the associated PAYE.

Also on the similar theme of making the tax laws easier for people to comply with is legislation now before Parliament which makes improvements to the administration of the student loan scheme, particularly in relation to borrowers who are overseas.

Compliance is low amongst those borrowers, and the legislation may be creating disincentives for them to return.

Changes to simplify the administration of the loan scheme include allowing data matching between Inland Revenue and the Customs Service, to ensure borrowers not based in New Zealand do not have access to interest-free loans.

At the same time, however, the bill introduces new, more realistic rules for borrowers going overseas that will make it easier for them to repay their loans, and offering them the chance of a “fresh start” to those who have fallen into arrears.

Further data matching between Inland Revenue and Customs will be a feature of child support legislation to be introduced in May.

The proposed changes will allow Inland Revenue to use cross-border departure and arrival information to help in the recovery of outstanding child support payments.

Child support is an area where it is especially challenging to reach a reasonable balance between the interests of those liable for support and those caring for children.

As Minister responsible for this area, I am committed to ensuring that liable parents meet their obligations but in a reasonable way.

There will be several other major policy events this year.

As you may know, the government is in the process of codifying the tax rules on general partnerships and introducing new rules on limited partnerships.

This is part of the wider aim to introduce modern limited partnership rules that seek to remove regulatory barriers to the flow of venture capital investment into New Zealand. A bill effecting these changes is expected to be introduced by the middle of this year.

The Income Tax Bill, which is currently before Parliament, is expected to pass in August, all going well.

The bill represents the final stage of the 15-year rewrite of the Income Tax Act, and its completion is an impressive achievement.

The purpose of rewriting the Act, as you may know, is to reduce compliance costs by producing tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent.

I must pay a special tribute here to the contribution of Sir Ivor Richardson to this mammoth task, because without his dedication, and commitment, I doubt the process could have been completed.

Also this year, there will be major announcements relating to charities and charitable giving, the result of another key feature of the Labour-United Future confidence and supply agreement.

The government last year released a discussion document canvassing views on possible tax incentives to encourage charitable giving of money, skills and time.

We have analysed the many submissions received on the ideas put forward in the discussion document, and I expect that we will soon be able to announce changes that recognise the invaluable contribution to New Zealand society made by the charitable, community and voluntary sectors.

I’ll conclude by saying that last year was an extremely demanding year in tax policy.

It was demanding of government and the private sector alike, and meant a lot of work from all parties who participated in our tax policy development.

This year is expected to be at least as heavy as a result of tax initiatives resulting from the Business Tax Review and the international tax review, as well as all the other reforms that are under way.

I believe that the end results will be worth that effort in terms of improving the way our tax rules work and making it easier for people to comply with their obligations.

Thank you and best wishes for your conference.
