Eligibility requirements for seasonal work are being relaxed to cover the transition to a new Pacific seasonal labour policy, says Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope.

From next month, Kiwi horticulture and viticulture employers can start recruiting under the new [Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) policy](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/community/stream/employ/employmentprocesses/employingtemporaryworkers/whatisrequired/rse/), which encourages recruitment from the Pacific.

"However, the Government recognises that employers still need to meet immediate labour requirements while the new scheme is rolled out," Mr Benson-Pope says.

"In response, we are:

- Allowing both new and current holders of seasonal work permits to apply for a permit until 30 September 2007
- Expanding the pool of workers eligible for a seasonal work permit by allowing visa-required people who were in New Zealand on 15 February 2007 to apply. Previously this date was 15 September 2006.

“The number of permits available under the current Seasonal Work Permit policy – which is being replaced by the RSE - for the year to September 2007 remains at 4000. However, these changes will support employers while they apply for RSE status and familiarise themselves with how to recruit from the Pacific.

“It’s important for horticulture and viticulture employers to remember that the Seasonal Work Permit policy and approval-in-principle process will expire on 30 September 2007.

“Employers who want to recruit offshore after this date must do so under the RSE policy," says Mr Benson-Pope.

The RSE policy creates an opportunity for up to 5,000 workers to work in New Zealand for up to seven months in the sector, with the opportunity to return the following year. Workers from Pacific Forum countries (excluding Fiji) will have preferential access under this policy.

“Employers will be encouraged to build relationships with groups of workers who can apply to work in New Zealand year after year – increasing skills and productivity,” says Mr Benson-Pope.
