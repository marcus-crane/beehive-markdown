Legislation to strengthen New Zealand’s aviation security has been introduced to Parliament, Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven announced today.

“In today’s aviation security environment we are faced with new and evolving threats to personal and national security. The provisions contained in the Bill will enable New Zealand to strengthen our aviation security and to continue to comply with existing security standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as well as meet new standards.

"Failure to meet these standards would undermine international confidence in New Zealand’s aviation security, damage our ability to maintain air links with other countries and could also have significant economic and social impacts for New Zealand," said Mr Duynhoven.

The main objectives of the Bill are to:

Provide aviation security officers with a power to search for and seize items prohibited or restricted from being taken on aircraft;

Enable the screening and searching of airport workers;

Provide a power for aviation security officers to search passengers’ outer garments and undertake pat-down searches;

Require that airlines deny carriage to passengers who refuse to be searched;

Provide a power for aviation security officers to seize potential weapons;

Enable foreign in-flight security officers to enter and depart New Zealand and enable New Zealand to deploy in-flight security officers, should the Government decide to do so in the future;

Formalise the process for checking the background of people working in areas critical to aviation security.  
"This Bill will help ensure continued confidence in the security of New Zealand’s aviation services both domestically and abroad. It will also strengthen the legal framework for New Zealand’s aviation security system, and contribute to the goals of the New Zealand Transport Strategy," said Harry Duynhoven today.
