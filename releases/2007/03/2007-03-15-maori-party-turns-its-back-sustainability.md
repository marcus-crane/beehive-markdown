Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today that the Maori Party appears not to be in favour of managing New Zealand's fish stock sustainably.

"The Maori Party was the only party in Parliament to vote against the Fisheries Amendment Bill at the completion of its first reading today. Clearly they don't support sustainable management of the fisheries; they don't support taking the precautionary approach; and they're not in favour of recognising our international obligations, such as the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement."

“To vote against this bill is simply breathtaking. I would have thought a political party that purports to represent indigenous people and kaitiakitanga would have shown more concern for the environment than this,” said Jim Anderton

There were 115 votes in favour of the Bill, which amends the Fisheries Act 1996 to better reflect the widely accepted international interpretation of the precautionary approach, as it applies to fisheries management decisions in New Zealand where information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate.

Jim Anderton said fisheries management must aim to get the best value from our fisheries, not just for today, but for the future. “Sometimes you need to sacrifice one fish today for the opportunity to catch 10 fish tomorrow. This afternoon the Maori Party voted for short-term gain at the expense of long-term, sustainable development. Tangaroa must be ashamed."
