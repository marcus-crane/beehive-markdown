Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that further changes to the Parole Act will be considered to enable the Parole Board to respond more effectively to cases like that of Graeme Burton.

Helen Clark said that the Parole Board Chair, Judge Carruthers, believes that the Board needs to have the power to call witnesses, so that it can test information made available to it. This proposal is supported by the Law Commission. Helen Clark released Judge Carruthers’ letter to the Law Commission on this issue, and the Law Commission's advice to her today.

Helen Clark said that information about Graeme Burton was provided to the Parole Board through the psychologist’s report, but that the Board had concluded that it could not consider the information, because it was unproveable.

"As the Law Commission report makes clear, however, the recent High Court decision in King v New Zealand Parole Board makes it clear that the Board can take into account any material it wishes, whether sworn or unsworn, and whether disclosed or not disclosed to the applicant.

"It is a matter for the Board to determine what reliance it will place on such information. Its ability to weight such information would be assisted if it had a clear power to call witnesses and ask for further information.

"The advice available to me suggests that a high standard of proof is not appropriate in these cases and is not the standard requried by the Act.

"There is an opportunity to include provision for the Board to call witnesses in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament. I am asking officials now to consider urgently Judge Carruthers’ request and the Law Commission's advice.

"The sole objective of any changes is to enable the Parole Board to make the best possible judgement about the risks an applicant for parole poses to the community.

"With respect to the report from Corrections on the management of Graeme Burton, the lack of action taken during the week's leave of his probation officer meant there was an untimely response to his non-compliance with his parole conditions.

"Zero tolerance of non-compliance must mean exactly that. I welcome the Department of Corrections’ intention to increase the frequency of reporting for such offenders.

"These changes in law and practice, alongside the current proposal to give the police the power to apply directly to the Parole Board for recall of a parolee where they consider there is undue risk to public safety, are important in providing greater assurances of public safety," Helen Clark said.
