The roll out of the first phase of the Aotearoa People’s Network is another great step towards creating a digital future for all New Zealanders says National Library Minister Judith Tizard.

The Minister says, "I applaud this project which will kick start twenty-two public libraries into the digital future by providing them the hardware, software, staff training and tools to take them forward into an internet-based information environment."

"The Aotearoa People's Network will eventually give every public library in New Zealand - and therefore every New Zealander - fast and easy access to the information they need and that is important to their lives," says Judith Tizard.

"All New Zealanders will be equal passengers on the journey towards our digital future."

Public libraries in Wairarapa/Tararua, Taranaki, the West Coast of the South Island, and in Kawerau (Eastern Bay of Plenty) have been chosen as the first libraries to connect to the project.

The Aotearoa People’s Network is a collaborative project between National Library of New Zealand, New Zealand’s public libraries, Sun Microsystems, and Telecom New Zealand.

It is expected the first phase of the People’s Network will be fully operational by September 2007. Plans will then be developed to take the project nationwide.

Phase One of the Aotearoa New Zealand People’s Network has been partially funded by the Community Partnership Fund, which is part of the Government’s Digital Strategy.

The Aotearoa New Zealand People’s Network is modelled on the hugely successful United Kingdom People’s Network. That project put 30,000 computer terminals into 4,300 public libraries, upskilled United Kingdom citizens, and connected them with high speed access to each other and the world.
