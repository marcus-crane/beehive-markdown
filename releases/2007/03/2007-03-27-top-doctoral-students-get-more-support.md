Fifty top New Zealand doctoral students have been awarded more than $4.7 million in scholarships over the next three years, the Minister for Tertiary Education Hon Dr Michael Cullen announced today.

"Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships are a great investment in our brightest scholars who are involved in the types of research that are underpinning our transformation into a knowledge economy," Dr Cullen said.

"The scholarships also build on the Labour-led government's policy of expanding support for students through interest free student loans, fee stabilisation and improved allowances." Since December 1999 when Top Achiever Doctoral scholarships were first awarded, almost $68 million has been awarded to 678 scholars, including the latest recipients.

The scholarships are awarded to students undertaking research in a variety of disciplines at a New Zealand or overseas tertiary institution. If research is done overseas, the student must return to New Zealand on the completion of the scholarship for a period equal to that of the scholarship.

Some examples of the newly awarded Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships include:

- research on developing a vaccine for treatment of cancer patients.
- development of a rigorous financial risk assessment tool for loss estimation in case of earthquakes. The research will also look at how buildings could be designed better so that they are more enduring and safer during an earthquake.
- research on motivations and behaviours of people who are interested in building environmentally sustainable homes. This will help towards getting a better understanding of why the majority of New Zealand residents are not adopting sustainable design and how that could be changed.

"I’m pleased to see the rich variety of research that will be supported by the new scholarships. It is the creative and imaginative ideas of our researchers that are providing New Zealand with the opportunity to become an innovation-led country," Dr Cullen said.

The Tertiary Education Commission administers the scholarships. The next round of applications closes on 2 May 2007. The list of successful recipients can be found [here](http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/standard.aspx?id=673)
