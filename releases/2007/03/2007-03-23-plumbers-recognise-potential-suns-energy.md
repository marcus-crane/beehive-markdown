Sixteen craftsmen and registered plumbers will be spending the next three days learning more about solar water heating systems in the first Government-subsidised course on solar water heating installation being held at the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec).

Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons is visiting the Wintec solar water heating installation course today.

“I congratulate the course participants for recognising the potential business opportunity from solar water heating. They will be well placed to respond as the market for solar water heating installations grows,” said Jeanette Fitzsimons.

“Solar water heating could help many New Zealand families reduce their power bills while also reducing their impact on the environment.

“To meet our goal of doubling the number of solar water heating systems being installed in New Zealand by 2010, we need to have enough plumbers with the knowledge and experience to install systems so that they maximise the capture and transfer of the sun’s energy.”

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), has worked in partnership with the Solar Industries Association and Wintec to develop a short course in solar water heating installation for craftsmen and registered plumbers. Currently courses are being held at Wintec and tertiary institutions in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch will also run the course later in the year. The new subsidy meets around 50% of the course fees and is available for a limited time.

Training courses on solar water heating installation are part of the progressive roll-out of the new solar water heating programme agreed between the Government and the Green Party. The programme includes:

- •The Solarsmarter website, providing independent information to help consumers decide whether solar is suitable for them;
- •Performance modelling of systems and informing consumers;
- •Motivating demand through promotion;
- •Improving information and capacity issues by working with industry;
- •Providing financial assistance to home owners;
- •Encouraging solar water heating systems on publicly owned buildings; and
- •Guidelines for local authorities to reduce the cost of building consents
