New Zealand's Light Armoured Vehicles (NZLAV) are state of the art armoured vehicles designed to provide high protection to New Zealand defence personnel should they be deployed in high risk environments said Defence Minister Phil Goff.

"At present we are fortunate that the situation on the ground in our major deployments Afghanistan, Timor Leste and The Solomon Islands are not at the level of risk which has required the NZLAV to be deployed.

"However there are no guarantees that future deployments or even current deployments, if the situation were to deteriorate, will not involve the level of risk that necessitates use of the NZLAV.

"That is why the vehicles were purchased, they are available at short notice to be used operationally in the numbers that may be required.

"Any decision to deploy the NZLAV will be made on the advice of experienced military leaders such as the Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae, not amateur warriors with limited experience like Dr Wayne Mapp whose comments on this matter are fatuous", said Mr Goff.
