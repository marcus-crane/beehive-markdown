Air crew from New Zealand will no longer have to apply for visas to enter China for seven days or less, under an agreement reached between the New Zealand and Chinese governments.

Deputy Prime Minister Dr Michael Cullen and China’s Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan announced the agreement after meeting in Wellington today.

"I am very pleased we have been able to conclude this agreement. New Zealand and China have an increasingly broad relationship and the launch of the first direct flights between New Zealand and China in November last year helped keep up this momentum," Dr Cullen said.

"This agreement will simplify procedures for the crew."

Under the Immigration Act 1987, New Zealand already grants foreign air crew an exemption from the obligation to hold a permit for up to seven days. This agreement reciprocates that arrangement.
