Telecommunications Commissioner Douglas Webb has agreed to continue in his role until 11 July 2007, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

Mr Webb’s term as commissioner is due to finish on 11 March. The extension of his term will provide continuity with the new appointee.

"The appointment process for a new commissioner is well advanced, with a number of excellent candidates interviewed," Mr Cunliffe said.

"However, a new commissioner is unlikely to be able to take up the role before July.

"Mr Webb’s continued presence will provide stability and continuity at an important time for the New Zealand telecommunications industry."
