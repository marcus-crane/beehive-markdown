Auckland Issues Minister and Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed the new appointments to Auckland's Regional Land Transport committee.

"This committee is hugely significant for all Aucklanders – it's looking at transport planning which will shape the region over the next 30 to 50 years," says Judith Tizard.

"The calibre of these new members is a huge vote of confidence in the transport plan which the central, regional and local government along with ARTA have put in place for Auckland."

"The plan needs the support of the community and businesses to help get it off the ground. These new members who have come forward show a real commitment and confidence that we are going in the right direction."

"Together we will get Auckland moving so that people and goods can move rapidly through the city."
