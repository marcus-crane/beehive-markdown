Energy Minister David Parker says calls by the National Party for a review of legislation to be called off could see rural communities plunged into darkness after 2013.

"I can't believe the National Party cares so little about rural communities that it would like to see this happen," David Parker said.

"I can only conclude Gerry Brownlee is confused by the legislation – and this from a politician who fancies himself as energy minister."

Gerry Brownlee has demanded that the government halt a review of S.62 of the Electricity Act.

David Parker told the House today that if S.62 is not reviewed, the legislation that requires power companies to supply electricity to remote rural areas will lapse after 2013.

"Gerry Brownlee's confusion has occurred despite the fact – somewhat ironically – that it was a National government that created the legislation in the first place."

"Luckily this government is on the ball, and is working to tidy up the legislation National put in place, to ensure that the lights stay on for rural users," David Parker said.
