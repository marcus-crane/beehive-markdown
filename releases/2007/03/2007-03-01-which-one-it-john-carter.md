National's local government spokesman can't seem to decide if he wants the Independent Inquiry into Local Government Rates sped up or slowed down, Local Government Minister Mark Burton said today.

"In November John Carter lamented that the Inquiry 'won’t report back ‘til the middle of next year'.

"Today, he's calling for more meetings saying 'he doesn't care' what impact this has on the timetable.

"Which one is it?

"I am confident that the Inquiry panel will conduct an independent process that will canvass the broad range of issues related to the funding of local authorities. I look forward to the Inquiry's final report."
