Israel and the new Palestinian National Unity government should underpin the agreement of their leaders to meet regularly by taking concrete steps towards addressing international concerns, says Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed overnight (NZ Time) to meet every fortnight in an effort to build confidence between the two states.

Mr Peters said he hoped the meetings would help further reduce tensions in the region, following the recent agreement by Hamas and Fatah to form a Palestinian government of unity.

“Considerable effort went into negotiating the Palestinian National Unity government. The result reflects a willingness by both factions to compromise in the interests of the Palestinian people," said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand commends those involved in the process but now calls on the unity government to address international concerns regarding its commitment to non-violence, respect for previous agreements with Israel, and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist.

"Violence will not resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. We hope the new Palestinian government will pursue negotiations with Israel, and strive to create an environment in which peace might be possible. A positive first step would be to secure the release of captured Israeli soldier Corporal Shalit.

"At the same time Israel must release detained Palestinian officials and the Palestinian tax revenues it is withholding. It should also increase the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the interests of humanitarian relief.

“The new Palestinian government must be given a chance to govern effectively by allowing resources to flow into the Palestinian Territories. Stabilising the situation there remains the best hope for resuming a pathway to a comprehensive and lasting peace," Mr Peters said.
