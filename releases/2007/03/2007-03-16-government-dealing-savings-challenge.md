From 1 July thousands of New Zealanders will have a great opportunity to develop a long term savings habit to help them secure their retirement dreams, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"[KiwiSaver](http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/) is the most significant savings initiative in a generation to deal with the challenge of helping New Zealanders lift their savings rate. That will be good for Kiwis and good for the economy," said Dr Cullen.

He was responding to claims from Dr Brent Layton in today's DominionPost who claimed the country's low rate of savings was caused by the increase in the top rate of income tax for those earning above $60,000 in 2000.

"I am pleased Dr Layton agrees there is a savings problem. However, to suggest that the tax change is the cause is simplistic when the biggest savings challenge is for those earning less than $60,000.

"The 2001 Household Savings Survey showed that only 15 per cent of individuals and 17 per cent of couples in the $15 - $50,000 income bracket had superannuation assets – the very people who would not be affected by the top income rate tax change. These are the people KiwiSaver is targeting.

"Our savings rate has also steadily declined since the 1980s, not just since 2000, (see attached graph) and there are a variety of complex reasons behind it.

"For example, an easing of credit restrictions in the 1980s made it easier to borrow, there was a move away from workplace savings schemes in the 1990s which followed National's labour law changes and the wealth effects of rising house prices have fuelled consumption, not saving.

"We are not alone, many countries have experienced declining savings rates since the 1980s. However, as the Reserve Bank identified last week, the savings problem is acute in this country – we have one of the lowest savings rates in the developed world.

"On average, for every dollar a household earns, it spends about $1.15. This is clearly unsustainable.

"However, other countries have dealt with the problem with policies that encourage savings. We have not had such policies till now so it is not surprising our savings rate is still so low.  
"Dr Layton seems to suggest tax cuts are the answer. National's income tax changes in the 1990s didn't change the downward trend in savings rates. Personal tax cuts would not only be inflationary in the current environment, but to be of a sufficient size to encourage greater savings amongst those who need it most, they would need to be funded by cuts to public services.

"Dr Layton is also ignoring Westpac research this week that suggests a cut in the top tax rate to 33 per cent would result in sharply increased rents, so affecting many lower income earners, the very people who find saving such a struggle.

"KiwiSaver is a far more effective way of giving New Zealanders who face the greatest savings challenge a helping hand.

"KiwiSaver, along with the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, shows how this  
this government is actively dealing with the savings challenge.

"We have also lowered the tax on superannuation investments, capping the tax on returns at 33 per cent and ensuring lower income earners are only paying tax according to their marginal rate of tax.

"We understand how important savings is not only to people's financial security, but also to the economy.

"Greater savings will reduce the reliance on the savings of foreigners and so help retain ownership of Kiwi companies in New Zealand. It lowers the cost of capital for our companies, reduces inflationary pressures by switching consumption into savings and helps reduce the current account deficit – our indebtedness to the rest of the world.

"Greater savings will not only secure a better future for this generation, but for generations to come. This government is rising to that challenge," Dr Cullen concluded.
