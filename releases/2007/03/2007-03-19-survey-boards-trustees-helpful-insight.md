The Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, is welcoming a report on school governance on the attitudes of principals and Boards of Trustees, which finds the system should be further strengthened.

"The report, 'School governance in New Zealand: how is it working?' is full of interesting information that will contribute to a Ministry of Education stock take, announced in 2006, looking at how the system can be improved.

"This survey finds the majority of trustees are very positive about their role, confirming that boards of trustees are an important and integral part of New Zealand's education system."

The report says most principals and board members thought their board is either on top of their task, or making steady progress (87 per cent of principals and 88 per cent of trustees), and parent levels of satisfaction with their child's quality of education are high (79 per cent are generally happy).

"The report also highlights that boards of trustees could benefit from additional support, and the government will consider that in its current stock take of school governance.

"More than 12000 parents sit on boards of trustees, giving their valuable time and expertise to making our schools a better place for students, teachers and principals. Trustees help keep the focus of our education system on their children's learning."
