Minister of Health Pete Hodgson today announced the commencement of a public consultation process to ask the public’s views on the future storage, retention and use of New Zealand’s collection of blood spot, or ‘Guthrie’, cards.

Every year more than 59,000 babies have a small sample of blood taken from their heel soon after birth. The blood is then transferred onto a Guthrie card, which is used to test for a range of rare but life-threatening metabolic disorders.  
Pete Hodgson emphasised the importance of screening newborns.

“The small amount of blood obtained for the blood spot cards fulfils an extremely valuable purpose. It enables the early identification of potentially life-threatening disorders in the nation’s newborns. Early identification minimises the impact of any damage and enables effective treatment to be put in place. It’s an extremely effective and valuable programme that makes a huge difference to the lives of a number of families every year,” he says.

However, he said that the primary purpose for which the blood is collected is essentially over once the analysis of the blood spot sample has been completed. The public is being asked to have a say on what should be done with the cards after the analysis has been finished.

Pete Hodgson says, "There is potential to use the Guthrie Cards for other purposes, such as research. This topic is of national and international debate which is why a consultation period will begin this year to gauge the views of New Zealanders."

The cards are stored securely for an indefinite period of time, except when families request the cards be returned. There are no international standards for storage time, which varies from three months in some countries to indefinitely, as is the case in New Zealand.

The consultation is also seeking the public’s views on the informed consent processes for the Programme.

The public can have their say by completing a questionnaire which is available on the Ministry of Health website -[www.moh.govt.nz](http://www.moh.govt.nz)  
The public has until June to make a submission.
