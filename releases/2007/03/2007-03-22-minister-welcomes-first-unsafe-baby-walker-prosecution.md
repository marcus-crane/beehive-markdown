Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed the first prosecution for selling unsafe baby walkers.

A Christchurch trader has been fined $10,000 for selling baby walkers that were structurally unsound and did not meet the Product Safety Standard regulations.

"I am pleased to see that the system is working and that unsafe baby products are being removed from the market, and those involved are being prosecuted by the Commerce Commission."

"Under the Fair Trading Act it is illegal to sell baby walkers that do not comply with the standards," says Judith Tizard.

"Babies and children are our most vulnerable consumers – that's why we have special mandatory standards in place to protect them."

There are mandatory safety standards for cots; toys for children under three years of age; children's nightwear; pedal bicycles, cigarette lighters as well as baby walkers.

"If you have concerns about the safety of one of the above products then please contact the Commerce Commission – 0800 943 600."

The Minister says that parents should check that these products come with information about their proper use.

"The onus is on manufacturers, suppliers and retailers to be aware of any rules for the products they sell."

Traders can be fined up to $60,000 for an individual and up to $200,000 for a company for each for each breach of the Fair Trading Act.

The Commerce Commission says that one of the baby walkers collapsed with the baby in it only a few weeks after purchase. The seller attempted to repair the damage to the walker with a piece of string.
