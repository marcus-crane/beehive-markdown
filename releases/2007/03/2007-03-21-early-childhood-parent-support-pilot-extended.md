Ten more Early Childhood Education Centres (ECE) are to join a pilot programme offering support for parents to get more involved in their child's education, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The ten centres are in addition to eight that have been in the pilot programme since July last year, providing more than 300 families with extra health, welfare and social support."

"The help offered by this pilot programme includes facilitating regular visits from a public health nurse through the ECE centre, home visits by teachers and creating links through centres to community social services.

"For example, Taitoko Kindergarten in Levin has opened a Whanau Tangata Centre this month, which provides a place for health visits and other community support. The kindergarten also employs local cultural Kaimahi, or a liason person, to strengthen links between the centre and local families and whanau.

"The ten new centres will also benefit from group parenting workshops or in some cases the introduction of a family support worker offering a one-stop shop for a range of services.

"The idea is to use ECE to reach out to parents needing support, by identifying local needs and then addressing them. This support project is in addition to the Labour-led Governments 20 Hours Free ECE policy, which is available to all three and four year olds in teacher-led ECE centres from 1 July."

Eighteen centres are now involved in the pilot of the Early Childhood Education Centre-based Parent Support and Development Project.

$2.4 million will be spent rolling out the pilot project to the 10 new centres, as part of the cross-government Early Intervention Initiative.
