Talks to build science links between New Zealand and the European Union have been hugely successful, says the Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey following a meeting in Brussels with the EU Commissioner for Research, Janez Potoènik.

"These discussions will provide new opportunities for EU-NZ science collaboration, including building access to the EUs new science framework programme (FP7), which could allow New Zealand to participate in projects worth up to $500 million.

Steve Maharey was the only minister from a non-European country to be at the launch of FP7, a programme with a budget of $100 billion over the next 7 years, and he says hopefully New Zealand will become a full cooperating partner.

"New Zealand participated in projects worth $130 million under the EUs previous smaller scale programme, FP6, but the wider scope of FP7 gives even more opportunities for New Zealand scientists."

The EU Commissioner for Research, Janez Potoènik, says EU funded research is about more than just the European Union.

"It's about common challenges and joint opportunities… We want to build up the pool of countries who can provide and benefit from European research expertise."

During his visit to Europe last week, Steve Maharey also found a strong commitment to concluding a Science and Technology Agreement with New Zealand, which would further enhance New Zealand involvement in EU research activities.

Mr Maharey also held talks with the Director General of two key research directorates in the European Commission.

"I was pleased to find a huge amount of recognition in Brussels of the value of science links between New Zealand and the EU, and both sides are now ready to build on those ties and opportunities set up during my visit to Europe."
