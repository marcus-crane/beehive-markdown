Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne is pleased the Researched Medicines Industry Association is eager to be involved in the development of a medicines strategy for New Zealand.

“I have welcomed the perspectives that they have shared to date, but I'm disappointed that the RMI appears to be misinformed about the Government consultation process," he says.

"The RMI claims there is no formal Government consultation planned, which is just plain wrong.

"Towards a Medicines Strategy for New Zealand is currently out for consultation and it identifies that the development of a robust strategy and its effective implementation requires the involvement of all groups, including the industry, consumers, health practitioners and service providers.

"Written submissions close at the end of March. The long consultation period was chosen because I wanted to ensure that interested stakeholders had adequate time to consider the proposals in the document. I am also aware that this is a complex area of policy and that stakeholders in the sector have different roles and different perspectives.

"Once written submissions are received and considered I am planning further discussion with stakeholders, including the RMI, Maori and Pacific peoples and other key stakeholders on what the submissions say."

Following the consultation period, the next step is for policy advice to be put to the Government with a view to a New Zealand medicines strategy and a list of initiatives for action being released later in 2007.

Mr Dunne welcomes the RMI's involvement in the process, but is keen to correct the wrong impression there is no formal Government consultation.

Copies of the consultation document Towards a Medicines Strategy for New Zealand can be obtained from the Ministry of Health.
