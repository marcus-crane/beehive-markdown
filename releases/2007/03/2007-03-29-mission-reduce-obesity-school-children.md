A new initiative to promote healthy, active children and reduce obesity in schools has been launched today by the Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"This is the first time early childhood education services and schools have been targeted by the $67 million government-wide Mission On campaign, a broad range of programmes to improve nutrition and make children more active."

The 'Food and Nutrition Guidelines' and toolkit are being launched at Wellington's Mount Cook school today by the Education Minister Steve Maharey and Green Party MP Sue Kedgely.

Steve Maharey says the initiative will help children make healthy lifestyle and food choices, to improve their educational achievement as well as their physical health.

"An Otago University study of five hundred primary school children has found that simply promoting physical activity and giving nutrition advice at schools can significantly impact the weight gain of children over a short period of time.

"The APPLE programme* observed smaller waist lines, lower blood pressure, greater fruit intake and lower consumption of sugary drinks, in a two-year project which encouraged physical activity and gave dietary advice."

The Green Party MP Sue Kedgley says she's delighted that funding from the Green Party’s $12 million Nutrition Fund\** will be used to help schools implement the guidelines, and provide training for two people from every school in New Zealand.

"Hopefully, the days of kids scoffing pies and chips and fizzy drinks for lunch will be a thing of the past, and instead they will be offered a range of healthy, nourishing foods that will support their health and learning."

The Nutrition Fund will be used to help early childhood education services and schools implement the Food and Nutrition Guidelines. The first step will be to train staff and managers about this initiative.
