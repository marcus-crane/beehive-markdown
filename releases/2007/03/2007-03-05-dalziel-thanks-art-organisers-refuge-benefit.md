Women’s Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel today thanked the organisers of an art exhibition that raised $300,000 for Women’s Refuge.

The North Shore charitable trust, Friends of Women’s Refuges, raised a record $300,000 through commissions on sales of art and tickets to view the New Zealand Sculpture OnShore exhibition held in Devonport.

“The extraordinary efforts of this small group is making a positive difference to women and children who suffer from domestic violence in New Zealand,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“It’s fantastic to see individuals taking the initiative like this. The efforts of these 16 women in organising this major art event not only contributes something of practical value to victims, it helps to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence.”

“The government has made ending family violence a priority, but the law doesn’t of itself change attitudes. Family violence will only end when we as a society no longer tolerate it,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Most of the money will be used to buy emergency essentials, such as clothes, toiletries and school items, for children escaping with their mothers from violent homes. Some of the money will be used to reprint the resource book Fresh Start so that every woman entering a refuge will receive a copy.

Two years previously the group raised $200,000 by running a similar event.
