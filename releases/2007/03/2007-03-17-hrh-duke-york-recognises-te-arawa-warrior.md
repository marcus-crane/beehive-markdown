A controversy which has troubled a group of old soldiers and members of the Te Arawa people for more than twenty years is expected to be laid to rest in Rotorua today, says Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi (Te Arawa) was a member of B Company of the 28th (Maori) Battalion and was recommended by his commanders in the field for a Victoria Cross for his courageous actions during the battle of Takrouna Ridge, North Africa, during WWII. But the recommendation was later altered to a Distinguished Conduct Medal, the next award down.

“In 1985 a committee led by Sir Charles Bennett, a former commander of the 28th (Maori) Battalion, was formed to press for the original recommendation of a Victoria Cross to be awarded to Haane Manahi,” says Mr Horomia.

“A claim was also taken to the Waitangi Tribunal that the New Zealand government had not yet exhausted all available efforts to have a Victoria Cross awarded. While the tribunal did not uphold the claim, it did suggest that the Crown and committee should work together on a joint submission and a formal approach to Buckingham Palace.

“We agreed with that, and made the approach in May last year. While it didn’t result in a Victoria Cross being awarded, it did result in a negotiated settlement.

\`\`In responding to the submission in July last year, the Palace reiterated the Queen’s great admiration for the remarkable bravery of Lance Sergeant Manahi, and noted that the reports of witnesses and commanders at the time are evidence that a recommendation for the award of the Victoria Cross was by no means unjustified.

“The Palace explained, however, that the Queen places great importance on the decision made by her father, that no further awards for WWII be made; King George VI having decided this in 1949.

\`\`I’m happy to say that today the Queen’s second son His Royal Highness the Duke of York – Prince Andrew – is in Rotorua to deliver the alternative settlement,” says the Minister.

He will be welcomed into Te Papaiouru Marae where amongst other things he will  
present a sword from the royal collection to mark Haane Manahi’s gallantry.

On its blade will be inscribed the words ‘Presented by Her Majesty The Queen to the Te Arawa people in respectful remembrance of the gallantry of Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi. 17th March 2007’.

“While Haane Manahi survived the fierce battle for Takrouna, during which he fought his way to the summit three times over three days, tragically he died in a motor accident near Te Puke in 1986. He’s buried in the cemetery near St Faith’s Church and part of Saturday’s ceremonies will see poppies laid on his grave.

“I’m hoping that the functions today will bring closure for the Manahi family and Te Arawa on this matter,” says Mr Horomia.
