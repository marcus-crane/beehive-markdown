Courts Minister Rick Barker today warned people with unpaid fines to pay up or risk having their cars seized.

“Bailiffs are poised to move systematically through the country, tracking down people with unpaid fines,” Rick Barker said.

“This year we’re extending our usual blitz to cover several months, and we’re moving bailiffs around the country to target particular areas at certain times.

“The bailiffs won’t be listening to any lame excuses. If you haven’t paid your fines, get onto it – pay in full or get in touch and talk it over.

“If fines are not paid, bailiffs have the power to take and sell property and clamp or confiscate cars.”

Rick Barker said people with unpaid fines had had plenty of opportunities to pay up. This especially applied to people with traffic infringement fines such as speeding tickets, who would have had several months receiving a series of polite notices and reminders from New Zealand Police or the relevant local authority before reaching the justice system.

“Just being on the justice system with an unpaid fine means someone has ignored weeks of very reasonable requests to pay and has turned down the opportunity to discuss payment options.

“There’s only one way of making unpaid fines go away, and that is to pay them,” said Rick Barker.
