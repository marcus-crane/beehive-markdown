The first two months of this year saw the number of visitors from China increase by 42 per cent on the same period last year, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The figures were released today by Statistics New Zealand. In January and February, 24,503 visitors arrived form China, compared with 17,258 in the same period in 2006.

China has replaced Korea to become New Zealand’s fifth largest source of visitor arrivals after Australia, UK, USA and Japan, Mr O'Connor said. The increase in visitor numbers comes after increased marketing activity following Air New Zealand’s new direct air services to Shanghai.

Mr O'Connor said persuading more visitors to come to New Zealand from one of the world's biggest markets was a great start.

"The growth in visitor numbers is a real boost. But to make the most of our increasing popularity in this fast-developing and exciting market, we need to ensure we increase the value from each one of these visitors.

"Attracting high yield visitors with high quality experiences will need to be at the core of New Zealand's tourism strategy moving forward."

In 2006, Chinese visitors spent $352m in New Zealand.

Mr O'Connor said February saw an increase in international visitors overall, up 15,000 or 6 per cent on February 2006, with bookings looking strong for the next few months.
