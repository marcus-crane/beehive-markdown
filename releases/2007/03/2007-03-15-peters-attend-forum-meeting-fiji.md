Fiji will be the focus when Foreign Minister Winston Peters attends a meeting of Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers in Port Vila, Vanuatu, on Friday.

“This is a particularly important meeting for the future of Fiji and the region. Rarely has the Forum had to deal with such a complex and disturbing situation as has arisen in Fiji as a consequence of the December 5 coup," Mr Peters said.

"Friday's meeting will consider the report of the Eminent Persons Group that Forum foreign ministers sent to Fiji in the wake of the coup.

"The Eminent Persons Group took the time to study in depth the long-standing political issues that formed the background to the coup, and to come up with an excellent report that charts the way forward for Fiji.

"After the report has been presented, Fiji will be offered the chance to address the meeting.

“It is to be hoped that Friday's discussions will help advance the earliest possible return to constitutional democracy in Fiji, along with the restoration of human rights and democratic freedoms there, and the country's full participation in international and regional affairs.

"The sooner that happens, the better,” Mr Peters said.
