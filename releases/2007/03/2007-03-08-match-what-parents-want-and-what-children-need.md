Women’s Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel is releasing key findings into out of school services to mark International Women’s Day (Mar 8) as it is a day founded against a backdrop of campaigns to improve conditions for working women.

Lianne Dalziel said she felt it was a fitting [day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/) to release the Ministry of Women's Affairs report [Out of School Services: Child and Family Outcomes.](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/news-and-pubs/publications/work-and-enterprise/osslitrev.pdf/view?searchterm=out%20of%20school%20services) These services (OSS) care for children before and after school and during the school holidays.

“One of the modern day barriers to equality in the workplace is access to out of school services,” Lianne Dalziel said.

"When I talk to women's groups I am often confronted with the difficulties they face with childcare while they are at work. With the Labour-led government's commitment to improvements in access to quality early childcare education, there is an increasing demand for out of school services for school-age children," Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel said that the report presents key findings from New Zealand and international research about child and family outcomes arising from their use of OSS. The literature suggests that not only does the provision of quality out of school services meet the needs of families, it can also lead to children performing better at school and is linked to higher self esteem, less delinquency and reduced violence and drug and alcohol use.

“For children with poor records of school attendance and achievement, this study indicates that as long as their attendance at high-quality OSS is regular and frequent over several years, their engagement with school is likely to improve. This, in turn, leads to improved academic achievement.”

Lianne Dalziel says it is important to emphasise the significance of the quality of the services as some studies have suggested negative effects resulting from poor quality services.

When the international literature is compared to what parents say they want for their children and what children say they want for themselves, there is a definite match, Lianne Dalziel says. This is reinforced by the results of consultation the Families Commission recently carried out with over 1,000 parents, caregivers and children. The Commission’s report of that consultation, When School’s Out, noted that most people said they did not use OSS but would if services were affordable, appropriate and available.

“In that study, parents said they wanted more than a babysitting service. They want quality services that offered children real choices between relating, fun, educational and recreational activities. Some families also identified the need for culturally appropriate services,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Both the OSS study and the Families Commission findings, will inform the cross-agency work of the government’s five-year [Action Plan for Out of School Services](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/families-whanau/out-of-school-services.html), led by the Ministry of Social Development, Lianne Dalziel says.

“The government’s aim is to achieve quality, affordable, age-appropriate care for our school-age children. The five year action plan is part of the wider government action plan [Choices for Living, Caring and Working.”](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/general/gen-choices-for-living.asp)

"When we think of the issues that women in the paid workforce had to face a century ago, then we can see how far we have come, but there is still some way to go before women can say they have achieved the equality that we still strive for. That is why policies like Choices for Living, Caring and Working are so vital, because they promote equality of opportunity for women, and this research will help ensure that the policy is implemented in a way that benefits working parents and their children," Lianne Dalziel said.
