Race Relations Day today is a great opportunity to celebrate New Zealand's increasingly diverse youth population and promote racial harmony among future generations, says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The theme of this year's Race Relations Day is New Zealand/Aotearoa: 4 All of Us, with a focus on inclusion among the younger generation.

"The day is a real opportunity to focus on diversity and harmonious race relations in our schools, workplaces, marae, churches, families and communities, and to focus on what we have in common, rather than what divides us," Nanaia Mahuta says.

"New Zealand's young people are unique in that there is such a diverse range of cultures, histories, experiences, opinions and tastes, and this is reflected in an increasingly multi-cultural youth population.

"Along with a higher proportion of Asian and Pacific young people, there are also an increasing number of youth identifying themselves as Maori, which adds to this increasingly rich ethnic mix. This brings new skills, ideas and values, which benefit our country and provide new opportunities for the future," Nanaia Mahuta says.

All over the country, people will mark the day by celebrating the diversity of their cultures in a series of local and national events. More information is available from: http://www.hrc.co.nz/

Meanwhile, the Labour-led government is also developing a new programme to strengthen relationships between New Zealand's different ethnic, cultural and religious communities.

Called Connecting Diverse Communities, the programme is to be led by Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter and Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope. Consultation about the programme is beginning with interested groups before further initiatives are finalised. More information can be found at www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz
