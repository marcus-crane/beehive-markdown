Another widening in the current account deficit for the December quarter underlines the need for New Zealanders to think harder about saving, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

In the December quarter of last year the deficit, representing the balance between what we earn and borrow from overseas, was $3.5 billion, $329 million more than the September quarter.

The annual deficit of $14.4 billion represents 9 per cent of GDP – a slight improvement over the year thanks to stronger exports, largely driven by high dairy volumes and good prices.

"But the deficit is still too high. The worry is that the international investment balance, which includes the cost of our borrowings overseas is still rising because we as a nation are still willing to take on more debt, much of it in the household sector.

"While the government has been saving, New Zealand households have been borrowing more to finance consumption.

"Our net international investment position in the December quarter of negative $143 billion represents 89 per cent of GDP compared to 62 per cent in Australia. It's lower in Australia partly because of more active savings policies in recent decades.

"The deterioration here has been driven by increased borrowing overseas by banks - $24 billion in one year. Much of this is for the household sector. In contrast, the government has been saving, its borrowing falling by $2 billion over the same period.

"This is another timely reminder about New Zealanders' willingness to take on debt to fund housing and other consumption.

"If we are to own more of our own assets, we must save more. If we are to help New Zealand companies to invest for expansion, we must save more. If we save more, we put less pressure on inflation and so interest rates.

"That's why this government is actively encouraging saving through [KiwiSaver](http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/) from 1 July and the [New Zealand Superannuation Fund."](http://www.nzsuperfund.co.nz/)
