Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced a grant of $35,000 to fund the co-ordination of initiatives against sexual violence.

The community agency NNEST (National Network: Ending Sexual Violence Together) has played a pivotal role in focussing government and community attention on the problem of sexual violence and will undertake the crucial co-ordinating role, Lianne Dalziel said.

"Government needs to tap into the incredible knowledge and experience that NNEST has in this area. It is also very useful for us to have a single group that represents the sector, with which we can liaise."

Government agencies are meeting with NNEST and other agencies who deal with sexual violence at a hui at Porirua Police College north of Wellington this weekend. The hui is discussing government plans, announced last week, to establish a sexual violence taskforce that will co-ordinate and lead action against sexual violence.

Lianne Dalziel said the multi-agency taskforce, led by a ministerial group, is needed because sexual violence is so complex.

"There are a range of issues that must be confronted if we are to tackle the appalling statistics which represent the victims of sexual violence and the terrible social and economic toll that the violence exacts on individuals, families and communities," Lianne Dalziel said.

Last month the government committed $900,000 to fund research to identify the barriers to adult victims reporting sexual violence attacks, in order to better support victims through a difficult process and achieve better conviction rates.

"The perpetrators of sexual violence rely on their victim’s silence to avoid being held to account for the damage they do. If we are to effectively address sexual violence in our communities, in our streets and in our homes, then we must be prepared to break the silence and challenge the victim-blaming that enables it to occur," Lianne Dalziel said.
