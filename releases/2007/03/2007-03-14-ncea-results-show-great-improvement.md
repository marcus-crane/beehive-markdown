The latest statistics on NCEA performance show student achievement continues to improve this year after increasing steadily over the past three years, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Standards are going up and students are achieving more, with the percentage of students gaining NCEA qualifications rising further. For example, the percentage of Year 12 students gaining NCEA level 2 is up from 57 per cent in 2004 to 63 per cent in 2006.

"I congratulate all of our NCEA students, their teachers and schools, for their hard work this exam season, which has shown yet another lift in standards and more students achieving qualifications overall.

"The Labour-led government is committed to delivering a world-class education system, and the latest statistics highlight the success of the NCEA system, which we will continue to develop and refine further."

Literacy and numeracy is also continuing to improve. Achievement of literacy for NCEA Level one in Year 11 is 75 per cent in 2006, up from 70 per cent in 2004, and the requirement for Year 11 numeracy rose 6 percentage points, to 82 per cent.

To support these top results, a survey of candidates views of this years NCEA exam process carried out by NZQA, shows more than half said they were 'well' or 'very well prepared' for their external assessments, and a third said 'there were no surprises'.

This year, students sat 1.9 million papers, marked by 1920 markers and watched over by 4000 exam supervisors

Mr Maharey says system improvements meant students got their results online and in the post a week earlier this year, and schools got their results sooner than ever before, a full month earlier than 2006.

Full details of the national statistics and the NCEA survey results will be available this afternoon on the Qualifications Authority website [www.nzqa.govt.nz](http://wwww.theURL.com)
