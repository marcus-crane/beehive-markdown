Buy Kiwi Made is on a roll with this week's Cabinet meeting signing off a $6.3 million media marketing campaign and the [Buy Kiwi Made website](http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz) going live today.

"I can also announce details of the regional New Zealand Made showcases," Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made Sue Bradford said today.

Six regional events will be held around New Zealand in April and May. These will be:

- Thursday 12 April Dunedin
- Friday 13 April Christchurch
- Friday 20 April Napier
- Thursday 26 April Hamilton
- Friday 27 April New Plymouth
- Friday 4 May Auckland

"The regional events will showcase Kiwi made products to the public to increase awareness of them and encourage domestic producers to label their qualifying goods as New Zealand made. The first such event was held in Parliament late last year and was a great success, featuring 34 exhibitor companies. Companies in each region will be approached for participation."

As well as the regional events, the Government’s $11.5 million Buy Kiwi Made programme also includes a [fund to support Buy Kiwi Made](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____25001.aspx) sectoral and regional objectives. [Applications close later today](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____23149.aspx) for the first round of funding and Ms Bradford said there had been a steady stream of inquiries on the fund.

"There will be two further application rounds for the new fund over the next two years with the second round, of up to $1 million, opening for applications in October this year, and the final round in March of 2008," Ms Bradford said.

The initial round was for up to $1.5 million. The Ministry of Economic Development is administering the fund, with final decisions to be made by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry and Regional Development along with the Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made.

Progress was also being made with the Buy Kiwi Made media marketing campaign.

"The Cabinet this week approved funding for a media marketing campaign to start in the second half of 2007, which will focus on creating awareness and pride in the quality of New Zealand produced goods," Ms Bradford said.

"The campaign will celebrate and promote New Zealand innovation, entrepreneurship and manufacturing successes. It also aims to increase consumer recognition of branding that identifies products as New Zealand-made and promote voluntary branding and labelling for that purpose."

Those agencies short-listed in a selection process last year will be invited to update their proposals for running the campaign.

Ms Bradford said a Buy Kiwi Made website launched today would be a key source of information on the programme, and initiatives such as the regional events series and the regional and sector initiatives fund. The website address is [www.buykiwimade.govt.nz](http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz)

The Buy Kiwi Made campaign has been developed in close co-operation with Business New Zealand, which operates the "kiwi in a triangle" Buy New Zealand Made brand, Ms Bradford said.
