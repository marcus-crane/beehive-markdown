Christchurch lawyer Paul René Kellar has been appointed a District Court Judge, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today.

In 1978 he joined Harper Pascoe & Co in Christchurch and was co-managing partner during the merger of Harper Pascoe & Co and Anthony Polson. His work there initially covered a wide range of criminal, family and civil litigation but by the time he left the firm, had focussed on banking law, defamation, admiralty and commercial litigation.

His principal areas of practice now are administrative law, ADR, banking law, company liquidations, contract/tort, defamation, interim injunctions (arising in contract, tort and under consumer legislation), insolvency, medico-legal, property law, wills, trusts and estate administration.

He served as an independent reviewer under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Other professional roles include Member of the Canterbury Medical Ethics Committee and member of various Canterbury District Law Society Committees. He is also a past member of St Patrick’s School Board of Trustees.
