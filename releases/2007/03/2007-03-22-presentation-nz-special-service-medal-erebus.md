Twenty two individuals involved in the response to the 28 November 1979 Mount Erebus crash of Flight TE 901 are today becoming the first to receive the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus).

Police Minister Annette King is making the presentation at a Parliamentary ceremony from 3pm today. A number of other people will also receive the medal at separate ceremonies around the country over coming months.

Ms King says the NZSSM is being presented to people representing a range of organisations and agencies from police and defence staff to forensic pathologists, air accident staff, mortuary technicians and a member of the media.

"On the 28th of November last year – the 27th anniversary of the crash – Prime Minister Helen Clark, Defence Minister Phil Goff and I announced the NZSSM would be awarded to police and other personnel involved with the body recovery, crash investigation and victim identification phases associated with Operation Overdue,” she said.

"This medal recognises the work of extraordinary individuals who undertook the recovery, investigation and identification work in the aftermath of the Erebus disaster, an unparalleled tragedy in our history."

Ms King says the NZ Special Service Medal was instituted by the Government in 2002 to ‘recognise service or work for New Zealand in very difficult, adverse, extreme or hazardous circumstances that fall outside the boundaries of what individuals could normally expect as part of their routine duties or work.’

"The work of personnel involved in the Mt Erebus phase of ‘Operation Overdue’ far exceeded the boundaries of what could be expected in the course of normal police, search and rescue, or air accident investigation duties. The medal also recognises the traumatic demands faced by those who worked to successfully identify 214 of the 257 victims. Their complex work was exhaustive, painstaking, and innovative --- setting a world standard for victim identification.”

The NZSSM was last awarded in 2005 to recognise New Zealanders, including many police, who were involved in rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts in areas devastated by the Boxing Day 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
