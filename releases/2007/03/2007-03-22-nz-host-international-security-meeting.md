New Zealand will host officials from 20 countries at a meeting of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in Auckland next week, Defence Minister Phil Goff said today.

“The PSI aims to foster cooperation among participating states to counter the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), in line with relevant domestic and international law. New Zealand’s participation is consistent with our broad non-proliferation objectives.

“The PSI provides a clear deterrent to WMD movements, and a means of preventing or stopping those movements if deterrence alone is not enough.

"Under the auspices of the PSI a cooperative network of countries has been established to prevent terrorists and rogue states getting hold of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

"The PSI was formed in 2003 in Krakow, Poland and New Zealand endorsed the PSI principles in 2004 and eighty countries now participate in the PSI.

"Officials from twenty of those nations, including Australia, Japan, Singapore, Argentina, the UK and the United States, are expected to attend the Auckland meeting. Participants will review recent developments, discuss future exercises and provide strategic direction for the coming six months", said Mr Goff.
