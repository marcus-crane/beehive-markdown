"We often start off a discussion about trade with Europe by talking about Europe's trade barriers, its tariffs and subsidies. But the starting point should be what we as New Zealanders are doing ourselves to maximise the opportunities we have," Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He was speaking at a seminar organized by the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs in Christchurch to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome. The theme of the seminar was 'New Europe, New Governance, New Opportunities, New Partnerships'.

After Australia, Europe is New Zealand's biggest trading partner. In 2006 one and a half billion dollars of sheep meat were shipped there, and kiwifruit, wool, butter, apples, wine and venison are each worth well over two hundred million dollars a year. "But," Jim Anderton said, "if our profitability is to grow, we need to move from bulk commodity production to niche products that command a premium.

"We have to compete by being innovative, and through our skills, creativity and knowledge. We must also work closely with Europe on science, research and development," he said.

Jim Anderton also sees climate change as offering New Zealand opportunities. "Europe is one of the leading voices of concern about climate change. If we can achieve the government’s vision of becoming the world’s first truly sustainable country, and carbon neutral, then we can earn a premium from our position."

Trade barriers, on the other hand, continue to present a challenge. Europe spends nearly fifty billion Euros a year on farm subsidy payments. Almost NZ$3 billion a year goes on export subsidies on dairy products alone. "Of course we are arguing through the Doha round of WTO negotiations for reform of global agricultural rules. As the world's largest exporter of butter, skim milk powder and casein, and the second largest exporter of cheese and whole milk powder, we have a very large stake in the success of those talks," Jim Anderton said.

He went on, however, to reflect on the formation of the European Union. "It paved the way for half a century of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Co-operation through a rules-based trade agreement, not the common agricultural policy, brought peace and prosperity to Europe.

"Overall, the future of our relationship with Europe will be built around some areas of co-operation, such as science and work on climate change. With regard to access for our primary production we will need to keep the pressure on, but also steadily develop new markets and be vigilant about the access we have to all of them," Jim Anderton said.
