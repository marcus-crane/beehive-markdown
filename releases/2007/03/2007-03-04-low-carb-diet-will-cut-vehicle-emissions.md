New Zealanders are being urged to reduce their carbon footprint by going on a ‘low carbon’ diet, in a campaign launched today by Associate Minister of Transport Judith Tizard.

The radio, billboard and print advertising focuses on fuel economy and climate change. In a series of entertaining ads, people are urged to leave the car at home and take a bus, walk, or cycle; remove unneeded car roof racks; ensure their car tyres are correctly inflated and car pool, as part of their carbon reduction diet.

Judith Tizard says while the campaign takes a light-hearted approach, the message is serious.

“Carbon dioxide is the man-made greenhouse gas that has accumulated the most in the atmosphere and is presently having the greatest cumulative warming effect on our planet.

“It’s news to no one that if we don’t take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, New Zealand, like many other countries, will experience further climatic changes such as higher temperatures, increasing sea levels, more frequent extreme climatic events and a change in rainfall patterns.”

She says transport is one of the biggest growth areas of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.

“About 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions come from transport, mainly private cars. So there are huge opportunities for us to reduce our ‘carbon footprint’ by making a few simple changes.

"For example, by keeping your tyres inflated, you’ll use less fuel. By carpooling you’ll cut down on petrol and parking costs and wear and tear on your vehicle, as well as reducing congestion and pollution.”

The radio ads will be heard country-wide, while billboard and print advertising will be seen in Auckland, Waikato, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

The campaign if the second phase of the Choke the Smoke campaign launched by the Minister in August last year. For further information, and to view the advertising and hear the radio ads, go to www.chokethesmoke.govt.nz.

Choke the Smoke – Questions & Answers

The Choke the Smoke campaign aims to highlight the damage caused by vehicle emissions, and encourage people to reduce their emissions.

Phase one, which was launched in August 2006, asks motorists to keep their vehicles tuned to help reduce emissions that are harmful to health and the environment.

Phase two, launched on 4 March 2007, encourages people to reduce their carbon footprint by going on the ‘low carbon diet’.

What's the purpose of the campaign?

The campaign provides information about the effects of vehicle emissions and encourages people to reduce vehicle pollution.

Last year it included information about the next step in reducing vehicle emissions, the “visible smoke check”, which was introduced on 27 October 2006. The check is carried out during a vehicle’s warrant or certificate of fitness.

What does the campaign involve?

The campaign includes radio advertisements, billboards, and print advertising. Phase one messages include ‘living with untuned cars, it’s exhausting’, with an accompanying visual of a clean, blue-skied New Zealand city showing through a fog of exhaust fumes. The message, ‘there’s a little bit of your untuned car in every body’, is accompanied by a visual showing tiny cars in a person’s blood stream, going into and away from the heart.

The phase one radio advertisements encourage people to tune their cars, provide details about the visible smoke check, and the benefits of car pooling and taking the bus.

Phase two has a focus on fuel economy and climate change. In a series of spoofs on weight-loss ads, people are urged to leave the car at home and take a bus, walk, or cycle; remove unneeded car roof racks; ensure their car tyres are correctly inflated and car pool.

Why do we need a campaign?

Exhaust emissions include particulates, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and Hydrocarbons. Research suggests the most damaging of these to people’s health and wellbeing are particulates and carbon monoxide. Associated mainly with diesel engines, particulates are very fine particles that settle in the bronchial pathways and lungs. They make a number of respiratory problems such as asthma and bronchitis much worse and in the case of small particulates PM10 can also be absorbed into the bloodstream causing health problems in the future.

Carbon monoxide is mainly associated with petrol vehicles. It makes heart disease worse, causes drowsiness and has been linked with learning difficulties. The effects of carbon monoxide are greater in cities where there are high traffic and congestion rates.

Another harmful gas for the environment is carbon dioxide (CO2). It is a greenhouse gas which is being held largely responsible for climate change. About 40 percent of New Zealand’s carbon dioxide emissions come from transport, mainly private cars. Keeping their vehicles well maintained is one of the steps vehicle owners can take to ensure they keep their vehicles as fuel efficient as possible thereby lowering their CO2 emissions. It will also ensure that emissions of other harmful substances are reduced.

What are carbon emissions?

Although carbon dioxide is naturally occurring, much of today’s emissions are a result of human activity such as transportation, industry, energy production, agriculture and deforestation. These activities release carbon dioxide or CO2 into the atmosphere. The amount of CO2 produced relates to the amount of fuel consumed.

Carbon dioxide is what’s known as a greenhouse gas. Other greenhouse gases include methane and nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide is the second most common greenhouse gas, the first being water vapour. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the earth and trap in the sun’s heat.

Why is carbon dioxide harmful?

Carbon dioxide is accumulating faster than the earth can absorb it. The earth’s natural processes can absorb some of the carbon dioxide emissions produced each year, but not all, leading to a positive imbalance between emissions and absorption. This results in the continuing growth in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Too much greenhouse gas causes the earth to heat at a faster rate and carbon dioxide is presently having the greatest cumulative warming effect on our planet. Since this global warming affects our weather patterns and climatic conditions, it is referred to as climate change.

Where does carbon dioxide come from?

There are many sources. Cars, power plants, and anything else that burns fossil fuels will produce carbon dioxide. Cement production also releases the gas. Rotting materials produce carbon dioxide, so landfills may be a big contributor. And plant life gives off carbon dioxide at night. But about 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions come from transport, mainly from private cars. Transport is one of the biggest growth areas of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions.

The amount of CO2 produced relates to the amount of fuel consumed.

How can I reduce my carbon emissions?

You can go on the low carbon diet! This includes ensuring your tyres are inflated to the recommended pressures, removing your car’s roof rack when not in use, using alternative forms of transport if possible, and reducing your speed thus using less fuel.

Maintaining your vehicle is also crucial for lowering your carbon emissions. From 27 October 2006, a five-second visible smoke check was introduced for vehicles as part of warrant of fitness and certificate of fitness inspections.

See the Choke the Smoke website for 10 tips on reducing your carbon footprint: www.chokethesmoke.govt.nz.

What is the visible smoke test?

The visible smoke test was introduced on 27 October 2006, and is part of every vehicle’s warrant or certificate of fitness. Inspectors check for smoke coming out of the exhaust by running the car for five seconds while the engine idles and then visually check for smoke again when the engine speed is increased to half its maximum – about 2,500 revs per minute.

They are checking to see if there is smoke that is visible and dense which indicates that there is a problem with the engine. If a vehicle emits visible exhaust fumes, it is an indication that the engine is not running properly, resulting in higher maintenance costs to the owner and negative effects on the environment. Poorly maintained vehicles can release as much as 10 times the emissions as a well maintained vehicle.

If the vehicle fails the smoke test, it needs repairing. This could require something as simple as a service and tune up, before it passes the warrant of fitness inspection.

How else can vehicle emissions be reduced?

The Ministry of Transport is committed to reducing vehicle emissions and is working on achieving this in a number of ways. The visible smoke check builds on existing measures to control motor vehicle emissions and improve air quality, and will pave the way for more sophisticated testing of vehicle emissions that might be introduced in the future.

Other measures to reduce vehicle emissions include:

•the existing 10-second smoky vehicle rule – it is an offence to emit excessive on-road vehicle smoke for more than 10 seconds

•the introduction in January 2004 of a requirement for vehicles entering the country to meet an approved emissions standard

•the introduction in January 2006 of a requirement for revised diesel fuel specifications to be met, reducing the sulphur content in diesel fuels to 50 parts per million, making New Zealand diesel cleaner and bringing it in to line with European standards. This reduction is expected to substantially reduce emissions from diesel vehicles already in New Zealand.

The Ministry of Transport is working toward removing the barriers to the introduction of renewable transport fuels – including ethanol petrol blends and bio-diesel – as biofuels generally have lower levels of harmful emissions.

The Government has also requested the Ministry of Transport to investigate the costs and benefits of requiring imported-used vehicles to have been built to specific minimum standards. They will report back on this at the end of this year.

What will happen if I do nothing?

If we do not take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, New Zealand, like many other countries, will experience further climatic changes such as higher temperatures, increasing sea levels, more frequent extreme climatic events (eg, droughts and floods) and a change in rainfall patterns. This could mean that whole islands and coastal cities are flooded whilst entire forests, like the Amazon, could be destroyed. Your activities at home, on the road and on the farm contribute to the amount of carbon dioxide being produced.

THE LOW CARBON CHECKLIST

Want to go on the low carbon diet, but don’t quite know where to begin? Here are some simple things you can do to reduce your carbon emissions.

1\. Check your tyres √

Keeping your tyres inflated to the manufacturer’s specifications means you’ll use less fuel. You can usually find out what the correct tyre pressure rating for your car is on the door jamb or in the vehicle handbook. Even when you're not driving, tyres can still lose pressure and oxygen slowly escapes through the casing so it's a good idea to check pressures at least once a fortnight. Check your tyres when they’re cold as when they’re hot, air expands and can give the wrong reading.

Make sure you have dust caps on every tyre valve. Dust caps prevent dirt and moisture entering the valve mechanism preventing sudden tyre deflation through the valve. Service station air filling machines are not always accurate so buy a quality gauge to keep in your glove box. Keep the dust cap in your hand – it’s easy to forget if you leave it on the ground!

And don't forget to check the spare wheel. The last thing you want when changing your tyre is to discover the spare is flat as well. Check the air pressure of the spare when you check the other tyres. Tyres naturally leak air over time so it is a good idea to over-fill the spare tyre by up to 4-6psi – when you are on the side of the road, it’s easier to let a little air out than pump it up!

2\. Check your driving habits √

When you start your car, don’t wait for it to warm up. If your car is tuned you will just end up wasting fuel. Try and combine errands into one trip rather than several trips and avoid peak hour traffic. Short trips will use more fuel, as cold engines consume around 40 percent more fuel, produce more emissions, and increase engine wear and tear.

Change up through the gears and into top gear as quickly as possible without accelerating harder than necessary. Driving in a gear lower than you need, wastes fuel; so does letting the engine labour in top gear on hills and corners. Automatic transmission will shift up more quickly and smoothly if you ease back slightly on the accelerator once the car gathers momentum.

Stop the engine whenever your car is stopped or held up for an extended period of time. This will save more fuel than is lost from the burst of fuel involved in restarting the engine.

3\. Check your speed √

Drive at a good distance from the car in front so you can anticipate and travel with the flow of traffic, avoiding unnecessary acceleration and frequent repetitive braking.

Resting your foot on the brake or driving with the hand brake on wastes fuel, increases brake wear and decreases braking efficiency.

4\. Check your roof rack and boot √

Roof racks, poorly placed spoilers, or driving with the window open, increase air resistance and fuel consumption, in some cases by over 20 percent. Anything fixed to the outside of your car increases wind resistance and fuel consumption.

The more weight your vehicle carries, the more fuel it uses. So have a look in your boot and make sure you’re not carrying around any unnecessary items. An extra 50kg of weight can increase your fuel bill by 2 percent.

5\. Check your air conditioner √

Air conditioners can use up to 10 percent extra fuel when operating, especially when your car is not moving and the engine is at idle. But at speeds of over 80 km/h, the use of the air conditioning is better for fuel consumption than an open window.

6\. Check your service record √

Keeping your vehicle properly serviced and well tuned will minimise its fuel use and its impact on the environmental. If your car is emitting any visible smoke or a strong odour have it checked and corrected.

7\. Check your petrol √

When you fill up your car, don’t squeeze the last drop of petrol in at the petrol station. It is often spilt or lost through the overflow pipe when you accelerate or go around corners. Plus the expansion of the fuel can result in increased emissions.

8\. Check with your car dealer √

Driving cleaner cars with the latest emissions control equipment can reduce the amount of fuel you use. Plus, generally speaking, the heavier a car, the more fuel it will consume. Automatic cars are less fuel efficient than manuals. Buying a fuel-efficient car will not only be better for the environment, it will save you money

If you are looking to buy another vehicle, why not ask your dealer about hybrid cars? A hybrid car is a passenger vehicle that is driven by a hybrid engine, which is any engine that combines two or more sources of power, generally gasoline and electricity. Not only will this save on fuel but it could reduce vehicle emissions by up to 50 percent.

9\. Check with your neighbours and car pool√  
Why not see who lives nearby and start a car pool with friends, family, neighbours and work colleagues? Carpooling or sharing rides cuts down commuter costs, wear and tear on your vehicle, and congestion and pollution. In some cases, cars that have a high occupancy rate (usually three or more) are allowed to use bus lanes or other special lanes, meaning carpoolers can bypass congested traffic.  
So post a notice on staff notice boards or social emails. Visit your neighbours and find out who would be keen to car pool.

10\. Check your options √

One third of all New Zealand car trips are less than a kilometre (two thirds are under six kilometres). If possible, try to walk, ride a bike or take public transport on those shorter trips. Not only will this save you cash on petrol it will also help you stay fit.
