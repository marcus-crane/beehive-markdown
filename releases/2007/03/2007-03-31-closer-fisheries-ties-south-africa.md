New Zealand and South Africa will now work more closely together on a range of fisheries and marine protection issues.

A Cooperation Arrangement was signed in Wellington yesterday by Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton and South African Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minster Marthinus van Schalkwyk.

“Our countries are both Southern Hemisphere coastal states with significant fisheries resources,” Jim Anderton said. “Strong links already exist between our fishing industries and we share common interests in high seas fisheries through regional fisheries organisations, including the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.”

“In other areas our governments are facing similar challenges: international trade and tariff barriers, poaching and black market sale of abalone (paua), seabird by-catch in surface longline and trawl fisheries, and the protection of sensitive sea-bed habitats."

This arrangement will promote cooperation between government fisheries agencies in the two countries in the areas of fisheries policy, management, science and technical expertise. It also aims to strengthen links between the fishing industry sectors of New Zealand and South Africa.

As well, the arrangement provides for the two countries to cooperate in Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and other international fora dealing with fisheries or related issues.
