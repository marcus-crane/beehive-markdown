Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today described the management of New Zealand's production systems as becoming "A defining issue for our generation. Consumers want to be reassured their food is produced in ways that respect our natural environment and leaves something for the future. "

He was speaking in Wellington at the launch of the Fertiliser Industry Code of Practice for Nutrient Management. "Our competitive advantage is in premium-quality, sustainably-produced food. This new Code will be a useful tool for anyone designing sustainable farming systems," Jim Anderton said.

He went on to challenge the sector in the light of what he said are disappointing responses to various voluntary initiatives. "For example, after 45 years of voluntary subsidies and support from central and local Government, far too many East Coast farmers have done nothing about their erosion problems, which create a significant cost to the rest of the community. Similarly, last week I launched the 2006 report of the Clean Streams Accord, which showed that only 33% of surveyed dairy farms had systems in place to manage nutrient inputs and outputs, when the target is 100% of farms by the end of this year," Jim Anderton said.

He added that all industries have to realise that the voluntary approach does not mean doing nothing. "I want to deliver a message to those who think that lifting environmental performance is irrelevant or too hard, or that somehow it will work out on its own: We need to take control of our own destiny. Everyone is going to have to give something so we can all gain.

"I believe we are better placed than just about any nation on earth to give consumers assurances that they are purchasing socially and environmentally responsible goods. But we need to ensure that we have world leading practice to stay ahead of the challenges before us.

"I applaud and congratulate all of those who have the long-sighted view of taking responsibility for their social and environmental impacts, and are working hard to get ahead of the game. "

Congratulating those who had developed the Code, Jim Anderton described it as "A very positive sign of practical steps to improve our record, and to give quality tools to managers and decision-makers that will help make a difference."
