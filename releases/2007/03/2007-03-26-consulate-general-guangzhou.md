Deputy Prime Minister Dr Michael Cullen today announced that New Zealand would open a Consulate General in Guangzhou, China, in April, the first diplomatic office to open in China since the Shanghai Consulate General was opened in 1991.

The announcement followed discussions this afternoon with Chinese Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan. Dr Cullen said the existing New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) office in Guangzhou would be upgraded to a Consulate General next month.

"The decision to open New Zealand’s second Consulate General in mainland China underlines the deepening ties with one of our most important trading partners," said Dr Cullen.

"The new Consulate General provides an even better environment for boosting trade and government links with Guangzhou and the surrounding provinces. With increasing numbers of New Zealanders travelling to and working in China, the Consulate General will provide additional consular resources in the south."

This decision was formalised by an exchange of diplomatic notes between the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
