Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Trade Minister Phil Goff have noted the removal of another hurdle to gaining access for New Zealand apples to the Australian market.

"After 86 years, the total ban on New Zealand apples has been lifted," Phil Goff and Jim Anderton said.

"Australia’s Final Policy Determination on the Final Import Risk Analysis (IRA) for New Zealand apples was published today. It confirms the approach adopted in the Final IRA received from Australia late last year, marking the end of Australia’s protracted IRA process.

“However, the Final Policy Determination retains the strict conditions on our apple exports that were included in the Final IRA. We remain concerned that the conditions that Australia is imposing are both onerous and unjustified,"Jim Anderton said.

“With this formal document, we are a step closer to exporting apples to Australia. However, before any trade can take place Australian and New Zealand biosecurity officials have to agree on the practical implementation of the Australian requirements," Phil Goff said.

“The Government will explore what access may be available under the practical conditions set by the terms of the IRA. While the document is very restrictive, in order to meet the best interests of the new Zealand industry we need to see what trade can take place and at what cost.

“This process needs to proceed quickly and smoothly. If commercially meaningful trade is possible, we would want to get it underway as soon as possible.

"However, if we conclude that this process will not deliver meaningful access, taking the dispute through the WTO disputes process, though time and resource intensive, would seem to be the only option."

The Final IRA, which was published in November 2006, recommends that New Zealand apple imports be allowed under strict and extensive conditions, to all states except Western Australia. Previously, a total ban had been imposed on the grounds that apples might transmit the plant disease fire blight.
