Environment Minister, David Benson-Pope says virtually all plastic packaging used in New Zealand should be recyclable and the Government will be working with local government and industry to stop it being dumped into landfills.

"Individual New Zealanders and many councils have embraced the recycling concept and are doing a fantastic job in reducing the amount of waste," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Minister is today visiting four of the country's biggest recycling facilities in Auckland, covering glass, plastic, paper and metal.

One of them, Streetsmart, is New Zealand's largest kerbside recycling processor and now collects all plastic containers marked with the codes one to seven.

"I applaud Auckland and Manukau city councils for moving towards the collection of all coded plastics but this is a rarity in New Zealand, whereas most councils only collect plastics coded one and two.

"We need national consistency if we are to significantly reduce the 3.2 million tonnes of waste that go into landfills each year.

"New Zealand's continued clean, green identity is dependant on us all embracing the concepts of [sustainability](),"&gt;product stewardship are vital components.

"Some communities are showing the way and the Prime Minister just last month opened a [new recycling facility in Palmerston North](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28450), where they are trialling a 'one bin, three tray' recycling system," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"I have called a meeting with Local Government New Zealand to make further progress on recycling issues, including how councils can recycle all coded plastics. I will also be briefing them on new initiatives including a network of public recycling stations, a waste levy to fund projects and product stewardship."
