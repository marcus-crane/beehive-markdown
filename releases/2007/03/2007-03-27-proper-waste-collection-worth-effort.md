Environment Minister David Benson-Pope is urging councils to get serious about recycling and not opt for the cheapest and easiest household collection systems.

A report on recycling released this week by the Glass Packaging Forum indicates that 'co-mingled' wheelie bin collection reduces the value of materials collected, particularly glass and paper, as opposed to crate-based systems, where materials are sorted at the kerbside.

"The co-mingling option can be cheaper for councils in the short term but ignores the downstream costs of degrading glass and sending otherwise-recyclable material to the landfill because it has been contaminated in the collection process," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"I note with some concern that Auckland and Manukau are moving from a crate-based system to a single, big wheelie bin. While I'm sure this will encourage recycling and reduce litter, it will merely exacerbate co-mingling problems.

"I am contacting Auckland and Manukau city councils with my concerns and have already written to all councils, and met with Local Government New Zealand, to urge them to consider the wider implications of their decisions, as we move towards a goal of zero waste."

Mr Benson-Pope said local government would receive assistance with recycling costs through measures in the Waste Minimisation (Solids) Bill, a Member’s bill currently before the Local Government and Environment Select Committee.

Measures include:

- the introduction of a waste levy to provide funding for progressing waste minimisation
- supporting legislation to enable product stewardship schemes, which could include container deposit schemes to encourage recycling
- the need to consider strengthening existing provisions around controls on materials.

"The role of local government is central to achieving a truly sustainable New Zealand and I again urge councils to ensure that their capacity to respond to a changing environment is not compromised by short-term decisions," said Mr Benson-Pope.
