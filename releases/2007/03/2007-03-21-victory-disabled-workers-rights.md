The right for disabled people to be paid according to their ability and not where they work has been won with the passing of the Disabled Persons Employment Promotion (Repeal and Related Matters) Bill, said Disabilities Minister Ruth Dyson.

"For 47 years, disabled people have not had the same employment rights or protections as other New Zealanders," said Ms Dyson.

"By repealing the Disabled Persons Employment Promotion1960 Act, disabled New Zealanders will finally be valued for what they can do, rather than being defined by the place in which they work."

"The repeal means that all sheltered workshops will have to pay everyone they employ at least the minimum wage, unless individual workers have an exemption. It will also mean that all people who work in sheltered workshops will have access to holiday and sick leave entitlements.

"People working in sheltered workshops – about one third of those who attend sheltered workshops - will now be entitled to the conditions every other New Zealand worker enjoys."

"Repealing this outdated legislation is part of a package of wider changes aimed at ensuring that the voice of disabled people in New Zealand is heard and acted upon. We have undertaken extensive consultation with disabled people and their families, and with service providers, over the wider package of reforms. "

Workers who are significantly and demonstrably limited in their work can be issued with a minimum wage exemption permit. Permits reflect the individual contribution and skills of the worker, rather than their workplace being issued with a blanket exemption for all employees.

"The passing of this Bill will bring our legislation into line with existing New Zealand and international human rights law and further strengthen this country's commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled Persons, which I will sign in New York at the end of this month."
