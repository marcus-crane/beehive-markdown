New Zealand has ratified the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Justice Minister Mark Burton announced today.

The Optional Protocol establishes a system of regular visits to places of detention, aimed at preventing torture and ill treatment. Both a United Nations Subcommittee and national monitoring bodies will conduct the visits.

"The Optional Protocol is a crucial treaty, which provides concrete steps to prevent torture both domestically and internationally," Mark Burton said.

"Ratifying the Optional Protocol further adds to New Zealand's already strong framework for preventing torture in our prisons and other detention facilities.

"The Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand maintains its position as a recognised leader in human rights protection."

The following agencies will be officially designated as national monitoring bodies:

- An Ombudsman holding office under the Ombudsmen Act 1975;
- The Police Complaints Authority;
- The Children’s Commissioner;
- Visiting Officers appointed in accordance with relevant Defence Force
- Orders issued pursuant to sections 175 and 206 of the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.

The Human Rights Commission will be appointed as the central national preventive mechanism and will coordinate the activities of the national monitoring bodies and liaise with the United Nations Subcommittee.

"Organisations such as the Human Rights Commission and the Ombudsmen will continue to play a key role in ensuring that torture remains unacceptable in New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

The ratification follows on from the passing of the Crimes of Torture Amendment Act in November.
