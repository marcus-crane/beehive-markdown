A new suicide support service for family, friends and significant others who have lost someone to suicide or are affected by a suicide attempt will begin this year.

Announcing the service at the National Office of Victim Support, Jim Anderton, Associate Minister of Health, said a suicide or suicide attempt could have a devastating impact on families and friends but to date there have been few services available to provide them with help.

"The loss of a loved one to suicide can raise a whole host of issues for the person's family and friends. Not only do they have to deal with the grief of losing someone who has been a big part of their life, but they may also be left asking questions like what more they could have done to help. Or they may be trying to understand what might lead a person to want to commit suicide," Jim Anderton said  
.  
The new service will combine the skills and experience of clinical psychologists from Clinical Advisory Services Aotearoa Limited (CASA) and Victim Support workers, who will work with those affected, to offer immediate and ongoing emotional and practical support.

There will be five parts to the service, some regional and others that are national. The first part is a suicide bereavement support service that will initially be set up in three police districts (Christchurch, East Coast and the combined Waitakere/North Shore/Rodney and Auckland Central districts). This is a 24 hour, 7 day a week crisis response. This will be delivered by Victim Support workers, who will receive specialist training. A national suicide support coordinator and district suicide support workers will be appointed.

Suicides can sometimes impact on whole communities, and in some cases result in further suicides. The second part of the service will provide communities with training and support to be better able to respond appropriately after a suicide. This is often referred to as postvention planning and will be initially delivered in three communities.

The third part of the service is the flexible community response service. This service will respond to suspected, or emerging, suicide clusters in up to three communities anywhere in New Zealand over a twelve month period.

The fourth part of the service is four pilot programmes to provide support to families and significant others who are caring for someone who has made a suicide attempt. The programmes will cover issues such as the carer's own emotional wellbeing, information about mental health and suicide, and how to access services.

The fifth part of the service is the management of the Postvention Response Fund. This is a fund to assist communities that are affected by a suicide anywhere in New Zealand to deliver initiatives to reduce the potential for more suicides.

A total of $3 million is available to fund the service until July 2009.

"This is an innovative package of services. We're trying something new, so we need to look closely at what is working and to make changes along the way if necessary. To do this, all parts of the service will be evaluated and this information will also be valuable for considering future services," said Jim Anderton.

New Suicide Postvention Initiative: Questions and Answers:

What is suicide postvention?  
Suicide postvention refers to community based support after a suicide that aims to reduce the negative impact of the death and to reduce the potential of further suicides or suicide attempts. The key objectives of postvention initiatives are to maximise resilience and coping; to minimise risk and distress; and to establish structures and networks to deal with the suicide and its impact.

What is a suicide cluster?  
Suicide clusters are defined as the occurrence in time and space of (usually three of more) suicides, greater than the number of suicides which would normally be expected. Clusters tend to occur most often in young people under the age of 25 years, although they do occur at other ages. Although clusters are rare (accounting for approximately 5 percent of all youth suicides), they cause considerable concern within communities.

How is this service aligned with the New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy?  
The new service responds to two of the goals of the New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy which are:  
Goal 6: To support families/whanau, friends and others affected by a suicide or suicide attempt; and  
Goal 7: To expand evidence about the rates and causes of suicide, along with effective interventions.

How does suicide postvention contribute to suicide prevention?  
Suicides and suicide attempts can impact considerably on family/whanau, friends and others. These people are faced with either issues regarding the wellbeing, safety and quality of life of the individual who survived the suicide attempt, or coming to service with the death of their loved one. It is important that there are available services to support people who are faced with these difficult situations.

What type of support do people need after a suicide?  
Research suggests that grief after a suicide can raise a wide range of issues for those affected, many of which are common to other bereavement, but some are specific to a suicide. Their specific issues include: the need for information about suicide and mental health problems; the need for social and emotional support; access to counselling or psychotherapy; assistance with a police investigation, coronial inquest and other official procedures; and help and advice about practical matters following the death.

Are CASA and Victim Support experienced in providing similar services?  
Victim Support currently provides support to victims of crime across the country, and they are familiar with the needs of people who are distressed and traumatised. This new service will see Victim Support build up specialised skills and capacity to support people who are affected by a suicide.

CASA is a nation-wide New Zealand mental health consultancy company, with one of New Zealand's largest private sector teams of psychologists and a growing number of social workers. CASA offer a wide range of experience and expertise in mental health, including clinical and research skills. They have been involved in the development and delivery of the Towards Wellbeing programme, which assists in providing advice to social workers to help manage young people who are current clients of Child, Youth and Family.and are at risk of suicide.

Are these services going to be available nationwide?  
The services that make up the Postvention Support Initiative are intended to provide national coverage. However, as it will take time to establish these new services, national coverage will be achieved through a staged roll out of services.

The services are founded upon a commitment to a research and development model. Therefore, evaluation is crucial in shaping future services. Initial contracts with both Victim Support and CASA are for 18 months. The Ministry of Health intends to use information gathered from evaluation of the initial phase to develop future postvention services and ensure national coverage of the suicide bereavement service by 30 June 2009.

Are there places where the flexible community response service would have been used in recent years?  
Suicide clusters can have a profound impact on individuals and communities. The event of clusters can result in a highly charged emotional atmosphere that can inadvertently promote further suicidal behaviour. There have been incidents in recent years, most recently in Dunedin and in Putaruru in 2006, where an organisation providing specialised advice may have been beneficial.

This new service would respond to the emergence of a cluster by working closely with other local services involved in the response activity, such as Ministry of Education, Group Special Education (GSE), police, public and mental health services, and other community social services, as well as SPINZ.

Reporting suicide in the media  
There is evidence showing that some types of reporting on suicide can result in an increase in suicides. Please refer to the Ministry of Health booklet "Suicide and the Media: The reporting and portrayal of suicide in the media - a resource".
