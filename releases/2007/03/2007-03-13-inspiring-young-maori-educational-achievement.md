A bridge from the past to the future is being used to help close the gap between many young Maori and educational achievement.

The Education Ministry has today launched the next phase of its Te Mana Maori education initiative at West Springs College in Auckland.

Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia says Te Mana uses a variety of promotional and encouragement tools to normalise and encourage rangatahi Maori (Maori youth) engagement in education.

The programme is led by a series of television commercials featuring rangatahi doing well at school with images of their forebears looking on.

“The Te Mana advertisements invite our young people to ‘honour the past and prepare for the future’. It's a simple message. The Maori culture has always and always will, value both knowledge and learning,” Mr Horomia says.

“We want young Maori to be mindful of this and to encourage them to stay at school for longer and to use education to better their future prospects.”

As well as the television and radio advertisements, the Te Mana campaign includes a raft of resource material aimed at young Maori.

One of the key resources is the popular Taiohi study guide which offers practical advice to get rangatahi past obstacles that affect their studies.

There is a revamped Taiohi magazine and a new interactive website for rangatahi to refer and contribute to. http://www.taiohi.co.nz/

A new development is a free text message service for rangatahi to request a free study guide and to go into a draw to win prizes. Access to information is critical.

Rangatahi need to be supported to achieve well at school and the evidence shows that when they are supported, there is an increased likelihood of better learning outcomes for them.

“In that regard Te Mana is an extremely important campaign,” Mr Horomia says.

He is delighted with the high-powered backing the campaign has received from some of the country’s most well-known Maori identities and thanked them for their support.

They have donated their time to support the Te Mana campaign by contributing radio commercials and the use of their images.

Mike McRoberts, TV3 News anchor and current affairs journalist
