Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton has welcomed the High Court’s decision validating MAF Biosecurity New Zealand’s actions in allowing imports of honey products from Australia.

"The decision endorses MAF’s current risk analysis and import health standard process," Jim Anderton said "and confirms that MAF was authorised to make the decision it made in accordance with the Biosecurity Act 1993.”

This case was the latest attempt to prevent Australian honey entering New Zealand. It follows a long process, started in 2001, when MAF started developing a new Import Health Standard for honey and related bee products from Australia. The process included international expert peer review, as well as two rounds of domestic consultations with industry.

In his decision, released on Wednesday, Justice Simon France, recognised the challenges of preventing exotic pests and diseases entering New Zealand.

“It is common ground that new organisms will be brought into New Zealand, unknowingly and unknown, every day. They will come as passenger organisms on people, their clothes and their goods,” Justice France said. “To be too absolute is to require the border to be shut to all traffic.”

Jim Anderton said the court has obviously considered the pressures facing the wider biosecurity system operating in today’s global trading environment. “Every day around 120,000 mail items, 12,000 passengers, 1500 sea containers, 400 vehicles and 82 aeroplanes arrive in New Zealand. We can’t stop trade and travel which is why we must focus on the management of risk to best protect our economy and environment,” he said.

The High Court has also ordered the lifting of the current injunction placed on imported honey. However, since the decision is subject to appeal, the current injunction could stay in place for another 5-6 months.
