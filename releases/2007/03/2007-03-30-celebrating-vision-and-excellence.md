"This event is a celebration of innovative, smart and environmentally conscious farming," Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said last night at the Canterbury regional evening for the 2007 Balance Farm Environment Awards. "I want to congratulate the eighteen entrants for these awards. What we have seen from them is the creativity and skill that distinguishes our farming sector. "

He went on to say that, from the beginning, farming in New Zealand has been home to world-leading agricultural innovation. "That is how primary industries became the backbone of our economy and remain so today."

An increasing awareness that sustainable farming practice can be efficient practice as well is also driving innovation in the primary industries. "The farming showcased tonight is both environmentally and economically sustainable," Jim Anderton said. "When I meet farmers around New Zealand, I find people who are acutely aware that their livelihoods depend on caring for their soil, water and air. And there is growing knowledge about the best ways to farm sustainably and nurture our resources."

The minister said that Awards such as these help to inspire other farms with best practice and he made a point of acknowledging the Awards' sponsors. "They are doing their bit to contribute to sustainable farming practice by putting something back into the industry and helping it to meet the challenges ahead," he said.

"This Labour-Progressive coalition government is standing alongside the industry with a vision for making New Zealand the world's first truly sustainable country. The excellence being demonstrated tonight shows the opportunities that are out there for us," Jim Anderton said, as he congratulated all the finalists.

The winners of the supreme award were David and Hilary Ward, who run a mixed cropping unit on 425ha near Ashburton. They also won the Hill Laboratories Harvest Award, and the Ballance Nutrient Management Award.
