New Zealanders will be entitled to a minimum of four weeks annual holiday from Sunday as the Labour-led government delivers on its promise to give workers the ability to spend more time with their families, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Employees will become eligible for their extra week’s holiday on their first anniversary date (the date when they started their current job) after 1 April 2007.

"New Zealand workers have played a crucial role in delivering one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth in our history," Ruth Dyson said.

"The move to four weeks annual leave is in line with the Labour-led government's commitment to make sure that the fruits of our economic success can be enjoyed by all our families."

Employees already receiving four weeks annual holidays will not automatically get five weeks – it will depend on whether their employment agreement makes it clear that the entitlement increases.

As always however, employers and employees can agree on a greater number of annual holidays than the minimum. The increase to four weeks brings New Zealand into line with Australia and many European countries.

1 April will also see a range other policies for families come into force, including a $10 per child, per week boost to Working for Families tax credits, a 9.8 per cent boost to the minimum wage, and a substantial increase in the rate of New Zealand Superannuation.
