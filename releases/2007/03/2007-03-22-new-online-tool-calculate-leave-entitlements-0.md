A new online tool designed to assist employers and employees calculate leave entitlements has been launched, says Labour Minister Ruth Dyson.

“This tool will help will help employers organising work and leave arrangements for staff around the two statutory holidays coming up at Easter, and Anzac Day, which follows a few weeks later.

“The Department of Labour’s, [holidays online tool](http://www.ers.govt.nz/), launched today, provides a step-by-step process for calculating whether an employee is entitled to a paid public holiday, and if so, what their entitlement should be. It can be used to calculate payments for working on a public holiday.

“It can also be used to work out sickness and bereavement leave entitlements," says Ms Dyson.

Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel says the online tool meets a significant aspect of one of the recommendations of the [Small Business Advisory Group](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____161.aspx) in that it reduces the costs of compliance in calculating relevant daily pay.

"This online tool takes the hassle out of working out how much to pay employees who don't have set days and hours of work and who have other complicated work arrangements.

"I'm sure it will be welcomed by small business owners."

The tool is designed to be used by employees as well as employers and recognises that not every worker has straightforward working conditions – people have different arrangements depending on the nature of their work.

The tool is available at, [www.ers.govt.nz/holidays-online-tool/](http://www.ers.govt.nz/)
