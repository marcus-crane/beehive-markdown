Speaking at this year's Finals of the International Golden Shears competition in Masterton on Saturday night, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton reminded New Zealanders that more than two thirds of our foreign exchange earnings come from the rural sector.

"It’s fashionable, on the part of some, to think that our primary industries are declining in importance. In truth, every iPod, laptop computer, new technology or new car we buy is bought off the back of exports from our primary industries – and too few urban New Zealanders understand this, Jim Anderton said.

Over the last fifteen years, agriculture, horticulture, forestry and fishing, together with related industries have increased their productivity at more than double the rate of the rest of the economy.

Nevertheless, over the last decade many farmers have turned away from wool production because of falling prices and competition from synthetic fibres. Jim Anderton said that ensuring a prosperous future for the wool industry was a challenge. "We need to work hard to return wool to the iconic status it had when I was growing up in urban Auckland."

He said the Golden Shears competition was much more than a sporting event. "From being with you tonight for this Final's session, the sporting element is obvious – the skill and precision to shear the sheep, prepare the fleece and pack it for transport to market is equally obvious.

"The skills in shearing, wool handling and wool pressing that have been on display during these last three days in Golden Shears 2007 are critical to growing the success and value of the wool industry into the future, Jim Anderton said.

He was also impressed by the number of young people competing in the Golden Shears. "That also indicates to me that the event provides inspiration to be the best in the industry - to strive to match and better the achievements of the champions of the past. It's that kind of spirit that will help this industry meet the challenges of the future," Jim Anderton said.
