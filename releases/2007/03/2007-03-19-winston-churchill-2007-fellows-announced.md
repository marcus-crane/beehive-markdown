Nine people have been awarded $63,000 in fellowships to travel overseas to conduct intensive investigative research, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban announced today.

The fellowships are awarded by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust and recipients bring back the results of their research to New Zealand to share with their own communities.

"From health research to ‘green’ burials, from sound-art to natural history, this year’s Fellows cover a diverse and fascinating range of research topics,” said Laban.

“Britain’s wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill strongly believed in people going overseas to develop a particular area of expertise, and returning to make a greater contribution to their community back home.

“From all parts of New Zealand, the 2007 fellows will set forth to the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, bringing back knowledge and experience that will enrich our communities.

"These fellowships provide a wonderful opportunity for individuals to further enhance the capability, connectivity and sustainability of their own community," said Laban.

Laban said the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has helped over 600 New Zealanders from all kinds of backgrounds undertake research overseas since it was set up in 1965.  
Churchill Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs. They typically spend from three weeks to three months overseas.

Applications for the 2008 funding round close on July 31 2007. Application forms can be obtained from: Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, Department of Internal Affairs, PO Box 805, Wellington, Phone: 0800 824 824 or email: trusts@dia.govt.nz
