There was some plain speaking from Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today when he addressed delegates at the William Davidson 125th anniversary Conference being held at Te Papa. "There is a story we tell ourselves in New Zealand that things went wrong for us when Britain joined the European community. But that story puts responsibility in the wrong place. The responsibility is ours - no one else has a duty to look out for us," he said.

William Saltau Davidson developed refrigerated shipping 125 years ago, making it possible for frozen lamb carcasses to be exported to Britain. "He was one of the people who had the foresight and courage to innovate; and because he did so, he changed New Zealand's destiny," Jim Anderton said.

New Zealand is the world’s largest dairy and sheep meat exporter and a major player in world trade in horticultural products. In a wide-ranging speech, Jim Anderton emphasised the importance of the primary industries to the economy but also the need for them to develop products that have high value and are sophisticated, globally integrated and diverse. "New Zealand’s agricultural industry is our only major sector with world class economies of scale and scope, global market reach and world leading technological capabilities," he said.

Agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and their associated processes and services, contribute around 17 percent of New Zealand's GDP and together employ around 225,000 people. The sector also provides around two thirds of total merchandise exports.

"Yet the scale of our industry is puny compared to the international businesses of other developed countries. I mention this not to diminish the importance of our primary industry, but to highlight the potential, the opportunities and the challenges available to us," Jim Anderton said.

He went on to expand on the challenges facing New Zealand agriculture: the way consumer demand is changing, increased competition from low-cost countries, climate change and global agricultural protectionism.

"We need to adapt or we will find, as we found in the past, that change will impose itself on us. New Zealand is no longer the cheapest producer of virtually anything. We will need better quality, better marketing and better positioning around a New Zealand brand that earns a premium.

"2007 is Export Year, dedicated to doing better at developing the industries pioneered 125 years ago. I believe we have the potential and the opportunities," Jim Anderton said. "The final ingredient will be a generation of Davidsons - not just one! - who will seize the opportunities and shape the future of agricultural exports from New Zealand."
