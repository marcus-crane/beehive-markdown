Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says he is delighted that traveling New Zealanders are pumping more money into the domestic economy.

New Ministry of Tourism data shows that domestic travelers within New Zealand spent $7.7 billion in the year to September 2006, an increase of 7.5 per cent compared to the same period the previous year.

“This really is great news for local businesses after a couple of patchy years of growth in domestic spend,” Mr O'Connor said.

"Some of the growth is directly attributed to rising fuel costs, but this extra cost has resulted in people making the most of their trips and staying longer, which will be encouraging for the accommodation sector."

The research shows that average length of stay increased from 2.9 to 3.0 days. While the number of day trips decreased by 10.4%, the number of overnight trips increased by 0.4% and the total number of nights increased by 4%.

Mr O'Connor congratulated the AA for its high-profile '101 Must-Dos for Kiwis' campaign, which started in the second half of last year.

"The AA's campaign captures the imagination and helps remind Kiwis of New Zealand's special qualities and the great things to see and do here at home.

"I hope the campaign continues to encourage us to see more of our beautiful country."

The Domestic Travel Survey is a telephone survey of 15,000 New Zealand residents undertaken throughout the year. A range of data and reports from the survey are available on the Ministry of Tourism’s research website – www.tourismresearch.govt.nz
