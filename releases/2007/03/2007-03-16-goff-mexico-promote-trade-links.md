Trade Minister Phil Goff will visit Mexico from 19-23 March to promote New Zealand’s trade with the world’s fourth largest import market for dairy products and what is becoming an important market for New Zealand meat products.

"The New Zealand and Mexican Governments established a ‘Joint Experts Group’ in 2005 which reported last year on opportunities for furthering the trade and economic relationship between our nations", said Mr Goff.

"I’m looking forward to meeting with my counterpart, Secretary of Trade Eduardo Sojo, in Mexico City to explore the possibilities for developing the trade and economic relationship.

“Mexico’s growth and demographics all point towards increased demand for meat and dairy products and other opportunities for New Zealand. Mexico last year imported $424 million of products from New Zealand making it our largest Latin American trading partner. Mexico exports a diverse range of products to New Zealand, including computers, beer, motor vehicles and telephone equipment.

"We also see potential for enhancing existing co-operative activities in a range of areas including agriculture, agribusiness, education, tourism, technology and scientific research.

"As Minister of Defence and Disarmament and Arms Control, I will also meet with members of the new Mexican government to discuss peacekeeping and disarmament issues. I will meet with the Secretary of Defence General Galvan and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, with whom I will be discussing how to progress our countries shared disarmament objectives as members of the New Agenda Coalition.

I will also be meeting with the Parliament's House Foreign Affairs Committee and travelling to see the Governor of Mexico State which has sought out New Zealand as a key economic and trade partner.

"As part of our Latin American Strategy the Government is strengthening links with countries in the region. In recent years we have taken the political relationship with Mexico to a new level and strengthened our people-to-people links and cultural exchanges. I’m now working to move the trade and economic relationship in a similar direction to capitalise on the potential we see in this market”, said Mr Goff.
