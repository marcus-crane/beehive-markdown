Acting Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven has advised that the annual inflation adjustment of petrol excise duties and road user charges for one to six tonne vehicles will take place on 1 April 2007.

Mr Duynhoven said the annual indexation process, announced in February 2004, allows for petrol excise duties and road user charges for one to six tonne vehicles to be increased by the rate of inflation each year. All of the revenue from the annual indexation increases goes toward funding the land transport network.

“For 2007, in keeping with the Consumer Price Index of 2.66 per cent increase for the year ending 31 December 2006 (indexation adjusted to inflation), petrol excise duty will increase by 0.69 cents per litre (including GST). If a household uses 30 litres of petrol per week, the indexation will increase weekly expenditure on petrol by 21 cents (including GST) a week, or $10.82 per year (including GST).

“Road user charges for one to six tonne vehicles will increase by $0.64 per 1000kms (including GST),” Mr Duynhoven said.

Road user charges are paid on all diesel vehicles and on all petrol-fuelled vehicles over 3.5 tonnes in weight. The revenue from petrol excise duties and road user charges helps fund spending on land transport. Road user charges are set according to vehicle types and weights and are intended to reflect the direct cost to our roads.

**Questions and Answers: Indexation increases to petrol excise duty and road user charges (RUC)**

**Increases effective from 1 April 2007**

In keeping with the Consumer Price Index of 2.66 per cent (indexation adjusted to inflation):

Petrol excise duty will increase by 0.616 cents per litre (excluding GST) or 0.69 cents per litre (including GST);

Road user charges for one to six tonne vehicles will increase by $0.57 per 1000kms (excl GST) or $0.64 per 1000kms (incl GST).  
**Why is indexation required?**

The government decided to index petrol excise duties and road user charges for light vehicles in 2004. The existing revenue that was being generated from these sources was not sufficient to meet projected demands for spending on land transport over the longer term, as land transport costs increase with inflation.

**What is petrol excise duty?**

Petrol excise duty is collected by the New Zealand Customs Service through a tax on petrol which motorists pay as part of the pump price of petrol. Petrol excise duty increases each year according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index. This is used to fund road construction and maintenance, passenger transport services, alternatives to roading, safety education and enforcement.

**Why isn’t diesel taxed at the pump like petrol?**

Approximately 65% of diesel is used on our roads (the remainder going on such as farm machinery and commercial fishing boats and industrial use). The road user charges system ensures that only diesel-powered motor vehicles contribute to the cost of the land transport network.

**Why is there no indexation for LPG and CNG?**

There has been no increase in taxation for LPG and CNG because the government is seeking to promote the use of alternative fuels to reduce emissions and promote land transport sustainability. Also, most vehicles that use either CNG or LPG also use petrol which will be indexed.

**What will be the impact of the increased charges on households dependent on cars for essential transportation?**

If a household uses 30 litres of petrol per week, indexation on 1 April 2007 will increase the weekly expenditure on petrol by 21 cents (including GST), or $10.82 per year (including GST).
