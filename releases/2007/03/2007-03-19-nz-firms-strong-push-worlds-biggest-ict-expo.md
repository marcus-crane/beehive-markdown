Sixteen leading-edge New Zealand companies are represented at the world's biggest computer technology trade fair, [CeBIT](http://www.cebit.de) in Hannover, Germany, says Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe.

"This is the third time New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has hosted a New Zealand pavilion at CeBIT," said Mr Cunliffe, who is attending the event on Sunday and Monday 18 and 19 March.

"Participation in the pavilion has given New Zealand technology a high international profile and allowed individual companies to make valuable business contacts and networks."

Immigration NZ (part of the Department of Labour) is also represented at CeBIT, promoting the many job and lifestyle opportunities New Zealand offers skilled workers.

CeBIT (Centrum der Büro und Informationstechnik – German for Centre of Office and Information Technology) is held each European spring in Hanover, Germany. It showcases state of the art information technology for home and business.

It attracts over 6,200 exhibitors from around 75 countries and 12,000 journalists from 75 countries. Some 480,000 visitors from all over the world attended the 2006 CeBIT.

"CeBIT offers an international platform for comparing notes on current industry trends, networking, and product presentations," Mr Cunliffe said.

"The objectives of the New Zealand pavilion are to raise New Zealand's global profile as a technology country, assess our level of technology competitiveness and provide a world class platform for New Zealand companies to do business.

"ICT is an integral part of the New Zealand economy, currently contributing $5.6 billion, or 5.1 per cent, of gross domestic product. The ICT sector provides the equivalent of 44,000 full-time jobs and includes around 8,100 New Zealand companies, of which 9 percent have annual revenues of more than $1 million.

"As the New Zealand market is relatively small, it is imperative for most New Zealand-based ICT companies to become more internationally-focused. Attending CeBIT is important for New Zealand because of the fair's size and ability to attract key buyers, partners, influencers and collaborators."
