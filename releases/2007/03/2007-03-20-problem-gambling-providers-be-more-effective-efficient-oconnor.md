Contracts have been cancelled and changed, and money will be recouped from underdelivering problem gambling providers, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

The actions result from a recently completed routine audit of all problem gambling providers and the canceling of contracts with a group of those that were underdelivering. Another group of providers are being closely monitored to ensure they meet contract requirements.

"The rollout of these services has not been as effective and efficient as I expect, and changes have been made."

The continuing ministry contracts will be reworked to provide clearer guidance for contracted providers, and the ministry will monitor all contracts on a more regular basis, Mr O'Connor said.

"The gambling industry and the public have every right to expect efficient utilisation of levy money and the Ministry of Health is clear on my expectation that contracts requirements are adhered to in future."

Problem gambling is an area of real concern in New Zealand but relatively little research has been done. We need to invest in research programmes to know why evidence suggests that only 12 per cent of problem gamblers come forward to seek help, Mr O'Connor said.
