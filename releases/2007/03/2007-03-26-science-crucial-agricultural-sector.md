Before an international audience of scientists, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today reinforced the importance of agriculture to New Zealand’s economy and the importance of science to agriculture.

He was speaking in Christchurch at the opening of the 6th International Symposium on fungal endophytes of grasses. “Advances in the science around endophytes are one excellent example of how science makes a difference to the success of our agriculture. The science involved is worth $25 million a year to the farming bottom line each year. To put it another way, five years after release the accumulated benefit to New Zealand’s economy is thought to be well over $100 million.”

Endophytes are toxic organisms that occur in ryegrass and fescue plants and are linked to diseases in sheep, like facial eczema and ryegrass staggers. It was in 1980 that Dr Lester Fletcher at the DSIR at Lincoln set up a grazing trial and achieved a breakthrough in understanding how they worked.

“There are amazing stories about the real scientific breakthroughs we make. The story of New Zealand's research into endophytes is a good example. It's the story of a small trial with unexpected results leading to the development of a highly skilled area of science and major economic benefits,” Jim Anderton said.

“And the development of endophyte science has greatly profited from partnerships between New Zealand scientists and their colleagues in the US, Europe, Australia, Japan and elsewhere,” Jim Anderton said as he welcomed delegates to the conference

“Advances like this prove to me that we have to work very hard to ensure we have a strong scientific community. These days we are grappling not only with ever higher yields and productivity, but also with issues like climate change. Science has held the solutions to our challenges many times before and I am convinced we will need world-leading research in these new areas too.”
