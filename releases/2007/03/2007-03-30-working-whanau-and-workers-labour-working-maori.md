The Government is about to deliver more money into the households of more than a million people, with Maori families to gain significant cash injections, says Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

April 1 marks the roll-out of increased payments for most families with children; for superannuitants, veterans, students and others on top of a dollar-an-hour rise in the minimum wage.

"The increases are generally designed to benefit those on lower incomes, while others are targeted at families raising children.''

The last Census showed the median Maori income grew by over $4000 from 2001.  
Yet it is still lower than that of non-Maori.

"It also showed one third of Maori are aged under 15 compared with less than a quarter of the general population, so we've got more kids," Mr Horomia said.

"These increases will therefore make a big difference to the average whanau and I want to ensure they find out what they are entitled to and access the payments.

" In some cases whanau are missing out because they don't realise what they could be getting. Some may be surprised by just much they may benefit," Mr Horomia said.

There are three major policies which will continue to be rolled out on Sunday.

Working for Families tax credits will be increased by $10 per week per child for three out of four families with children, including those on a benefit.

The tax credits were formerly known as family assistance and are payments made weekly, fortnightly or yearly.

"Households with children earning less than $35,000 a year will effectively be paying no tax at all by 2008. Census figures show this covers a significant number of our whanau."

They also show more Maori are working than ever before, with a 24 per cent increase in the number of Maori working full-time since 2001.

But because a disproportionate number of Maori workers are on the minimum wage, particularly Maori women, they will be among the primary recipients of the dollar-an-hour increase in the minimum wage.

That will rise 9.8 per cent from April 1 – up from $10.25 to $11.25 an hour or an extra $40 a week.

"We're also introducing four weeks minimum annual leave, which will give some employees another week's holiday.

"While I'm pleased there are 34,000 more Maori employed than in 2001, the government wants to ensure employees have enough time off to spend with whanau.''

"And we haven't forgotten our older people, who will get rises in Superannuation and the Veterans Pension from Sunday."

Benefits and student allowances will also be adjusted upwards, as will the Community Services Card thresholds, Mr Horomia said.
