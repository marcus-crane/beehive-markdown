“I am very pleased to see that Maori are continuing to participate and succeed in tertiary education,” says Associate Education Minister, Parekura Horomia.

He was commenting on a series of fact sheets on Maori in tertiary education released today by the Education Ministry.

“We have about one in every five Maori adults enrolled in tertiary education. This is an enormous effort on the part of Maori to up-skill.

“Maori are doing as well as, and in some cases better than, other students in certificate and diploma study. For example, Maori students are more likely than students overall to move onto higher level study having finished a certificate or diploma. They are also more likely to complete a diploma than students overall.

“What we see here is a generation of Maori who are coming into tertiary education often as mature students and they are doing as well or better than other students. And they are continuing to do so in large numbers and at all levels.''

“I celebrate this as a very positive development for Maori and our country as a whole.''

“At the other end of the scale, we now have 275 Maori students in doctoral studies, a huge increase over 10 years earlier when there were less than 100.

We know that the proportion of school leavers with little or no formal attainment has reduced at a much higher rate for Maori than for Pakeha. But we need to accelerate this progress to get even more Maori into tertiary education.

There are several programmes already running in schools, including Te Kotahitanga and Te Mana and there is more work to be done.

Yesterday's Ministry launch of the next phase of its Te Mana education initiative, which uses a variety of promotional and encouragement tools to normalise and encourage rangatahi Maori engagement in education, was another step.

The programme is led by a series of television commercials featuring young Maori doing well at school with images of their forebears looking on.
