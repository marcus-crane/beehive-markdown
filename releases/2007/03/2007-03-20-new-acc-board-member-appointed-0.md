ACC Minister Ruth Dyson today announced the appointment of Dr Marie Bismark to the ACC board.

"Marie has skills and experience in health law and patient rights and has qualifications in medicine, law, bioethics and public policy. Most recently Marie has been a senior solicitor at law firm Buddle Findlay," said Ms Dyson.

"Marie's areas of expertise will be an asset to the ACC board and complement the skills of other board members."

Ms Dyson thanked outgoing board member Dr Janice Wright for her contribution.

ACC board members are appointed for three years, with the opportunity to be re-appointed for a further three years.
