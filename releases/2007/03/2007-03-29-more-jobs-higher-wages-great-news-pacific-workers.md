Latest figures from the Department of Labour indicate that employment growth for Pacific peoples rose by 3.8 per cent per annum over the period 2001 to 2006. The economy-wide average for the same period was 2.7 per cent per annum.

"Pacific people are coming off benefits and going into real jobs, for real money," said Laban. "The number of Pacific people receiving an Unemployment Benefit has fallen from 12,317 in December 1999 to just 2895 in February 2007."

"That is a reduction of 76 per cent over the period this Labour-led Government has been in office."

Between 2001 and 2006, average hourly earnings rose from $13.10 to $16.38, an increase of 4.6 per cent per annum compared to a national increase of 4.1 per cent per annum.

"It is very pleasing to see that average hourly earnings for Pacific people are going up faster than the national average.

"Initiatives specifically aimed at the Pacific community are also obviously having an effect, with the Enterprising Communities programme working proactively with employers to address local skills and labour shortages.

"Pacific peoples now make up 5.6 per cent of all industry trainees and the future looks even brighter, with the launch last year of the Pasifika Education Plan aimed at increasing Pacific peoples' contribution to our society and economy through success in education.

"O nisi na o tala fiafia mo tagata Pasifika – this is more great news for our Pasifika communities.

"This Labour-led Government is working hard for all New Zealanders. The economic transformation taking place has created a boom in employment while the targeted tax relief of Working for Families has created support for families, young and old.

"Later this year we will launch the Pacific Economic Action Plan and the Pacific Women’s Economic Development Plan, both heavily focussed on enhancing employment opportunities for Pacific people," said Laban.
