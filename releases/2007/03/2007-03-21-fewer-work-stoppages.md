Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed statistics showing this government's Employment Relations Act compares much better than National's Employment Contracts Act across all work stoppage indices.

"I have recently received a Department of Labour report measuring work stoppages under Labour's Employment Relations Act compared with the Employment Contracts Act of the 1990s."

"The report shows the average rate of stoppages has dropped by 20 per cent under the ERA; the average rate of working days lost has halved; and wage losses have dropped by 48 per cent - this doesn’t even take into account that there are many more New Zealanders employed today than there were in the 1990s.

"These results have been achieved because the Employment Relations Act is fair and balanced, and good for employers and employees unlike the National's Employment Contracts Act."

"National should embrace this Labour-led government's employment law as a whole, instead of proposing to revert back to the failed employment law of the 1990s."
