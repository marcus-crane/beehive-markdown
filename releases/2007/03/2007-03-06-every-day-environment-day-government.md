Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton congratulated National Party Leader John Key today on finally coming round to the Labour-Progressive Government's point of view that climate change is a reality.

"Mr Key is engaged in what he calls 'Environment Day' in Canterbury today. Of course, for this government every day is environment day," Jim Anderton said "but one day is at least a start. Perhaps National is beginning to understand that New Zealand has some serious issues to debate."

"Climate change is not only a reality, but quite probably, the greatest long-term threat facing our biological economy, and in turn the New Zealand economy. John Key has been slow to realise this," Jim Anderton said.

Mr Key is intending to join his colleagues Nick Smith and David Carter at the MAF Consultation Meeting on Climate Change, being held in Christchurch. He will later meet a number of forest owners, including Roger Dickie of the Kyoto Forest Owners Association.

"Nick Smith has recently sunk so low in this debate as to attack a MAF official in the House," Jim Anderton said. "Are he and his Leader now in collusion with Matthew 'Hollow Men' Hooten and Mr Dickie in trying to intimidate officials who are actually trying to have a constructive debate over the discussion document put out by the government, Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change – Options For A Plan of Action?"

"Mr Dickie has been to all the Climate Change consultation meetings and has consistently promoted misinformation, claiming among other things that the government is 'stealing' carbon credits and that it will impose a deforestation tax."

"However, it is good to see John Key showing an interest in forestry matters after Nick Smith told Parliament a fortnight ago “that halting the massive deforestation going on in New Zealand right now should be the No. 1 climate change priority”. Given National's stated support for tradeable emissions schemes we look forward to their support for a tradeable permit regime for managing deforestation," said Jim Anderton.

"On the other hand, National has no policy on carbon credits. If they are going to flip flop on this are they going to send the bill to ordinary taxpayers or farmers?"
