Acting Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven has announced that road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes will increase by an average of 11 per cent from 1 April 2007.

Mr Duynhoven said today these charges, for vehicles over six tonnes, have not increased since 1989, while in contrast, road user charges for vehicles under six tonnes have almost doubled over the same period of time.

“We need to ensure that all vehicles are contributing their fair share of roading costs.

“Road user charges are set according to vehicle types and weights and are intended to reflect the direct cost of vehicles using roads. Vehicles over six tonnes in weight cause a disproportionate amount of wear and tear to roads. Therefore the actual increases to road user charges will depend on an individual vehicle’s weight and axle configuration.

“Industry was consulted on the principles for setting road user charges in 2001 and were generally supportive with the way that charges are set.

“Road user charges are paid on all diesel vehicles and on all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes in weight. The revenue collected directly funds the building and maintenance of roads. Up until now, road user charges rates for vehicles over six tonnes have covered the costs they are collected for. However, with major increases in land transport funding and in the cost of road building and maintenance, road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes need to increase.

“This government allocated an extra $1.3 billion to fund land transport needs in the 2006 Budget. In doing so, the government is committing $300 million more than it receives from road users in 2006-2009 to ensure that New Zealand has a world-class transport network,” Mr Duynhoven said.

**Questions and Answers: Increase to road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes**

**Increases effective from 1 April 2007**

Road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes will increase by 11per cent on average depending on individual vehicle’s weight and axle configuration.

**What are road user charges?**

Road user charges are how operators of diesel vehicles and all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes pay for using the road. Petrol vehicle operators pay a similar charge as part of the pump price of petrol.

**How are road user charges collected?**

Road user charges are purchased from Land Transport New Zealand agents, such as NZ Post shops and the Automobile Association. They are based the vehicle’s laden weight and distance the operator intends to travel. Payment of road user charges are enforced through Land Transport New Zealand and Police checks.

**Why do different vehicle weights and types have different road user charges licence costs?**  
A four-axle truck with double sets of wheels spreads its weight across the ground more evenly than, say, a two-axle truck with single wheels, and thus causes less wear and tear on the road. Road user charges take a vehicle’s configuration or type as well as weight into consideration.

**Why are road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes not indexed like road user charges for lighter vehicles?**

The government decided to index petrol excise duties and road user charges for light vehicles in 2004. This was because the existing revenue that was being generated from these sources was not sufficient to meet projected demands for spending on land transport over the short and long term, as land transport costs increase with inflation.

At the same time, road user charges from vehicles over six tonnes were keeping pace with costs and so a decision was made not to index charges for those vehicles. Cabinet decided instead that road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes would be reviewed annually to ensure they were keeping pace with land transport costs. The government has recently embarked on New Zealand’s biggest ever land transport programme and so a corresponding increase in charges for vehicles over six tonnes is necessary to ensure that all road users are meeting their share of the costs.

**Will there be more increases next year?**

Road user charges are reviewed each year. At this stage the indicative increase in maintenance and construction expenditure next year, due to the wear and tear from vehicles over six tonnes, is expected to be similar to the RUC revenue collected from heavy vehicles. This means that an increase is unlikely at this stage.

**What does this increase mean for me?**

Most road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes will increase. The exact increase to the road user charges depends on a vehicle’s weight and axle configuration. Land Transport NZ has updated the road user charges book and this is available on the Land Transport NZ website. Hard copies of the road user charges book will be posted to commercial operators of vehicles over six tonnes. Operators who do not receive a book by 14 April 2007 should contact the road user charges Call Centre.

**What does this increase mean for my business?**

Research conducted for the Road Transport Forum indicates that road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes make up on average 10 per cent of transport operators’ direct costs. This would mean that an 11per cent increase in road user charges would have an approximately 1 per cent increase in total operating costs. Therefore, these increases to road user charges are not likely to result in significant increases to freight cartage rates.

**Why are road user charges increasing now?**

Road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes have not increased since 1989. In contrast, petrol excise duties and road user charges for vehicles of one to six tonnes have increased significantly since 1989. Up until now, road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes have covered the costs they are collected for.

Road user charges for vehicles over six tonnes need to increase so that all road users are fairly meeting the increasing costs of building and maintaining the road network.
