Defence Minister Phil Goff welcomed the announcement today by Singapore Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean that Singaporean Armed Forces (SAF) personnel will join New Zealand's Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan.

"I had the opportunity to discuss a possible Singapore contribution to our PRT during the visit to New Zealand earlier this year by Singapore's Second Minister of Defence, Dr Eng. I am very pleased at their decision to contribute to humanitarian and reconstruction projects as part of the New Zealand PRT", said Mr Goff.

"We worked together well with the SAF in East Timor when they joined New Zealand troops there from May 2001 to November 2002. We also have a close relationship as partners under the Five Power Defence Arrangements, training and exercising together.

"This decision to deploy with us in Bamiyan will further strengthen our good defence relationship.

"The SAF will undertake two humanitarian reconstruction projects, establishing a dental clinic at the provincial hospital and working on the construction and repair of bridges in the province.

"A five person SAF dental team will bring in specialist equipment and establish the dental clinic. The Singaporean team will operate the clinic and provide training for local Afghans to enable them to eventually take over and run the clinic.

"The second project will see five SAF engineers work alongside New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) engineers and local contractors on the ongoing construction and maintenance of bridges in the province.

"The SAF commitment will increase and enhance the considerable contribution the New Zealand PRT makes to the province. In the end, stability and security in Afghanistan will be achieved if we can ensure that through development we can improve the lives of the people. Singapore's assistance will help us achieve further improvement in the well-being of the people of Bamiyan", said Mr Goff.
