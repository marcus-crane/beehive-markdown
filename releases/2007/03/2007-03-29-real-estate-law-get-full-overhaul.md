Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove today announced a full overhaul of the legislation governing real estate agents, citing the need for better accountability and transparency within the sector plus an independent complaints system, in order to protect consumers.

The overhaul of the [Real Estates Agents Act 1976](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3238370237&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B7CE38%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) will deal with the current discipline procedures and general regulation of real estate activity, including whether compulsory membership of the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) is still appropriate, and if all facets of licensing should be independent of the industry.

Mr Cosgrove said there have been major concerns raised by the public and real estate agents themselves about [how the industry deals with complaints](http://www.reinz.co.nz/reinz/index.cfm?80B3875D-959D-2F1D-48B4-BC1152088CE3) and discipline matters, and it is time for all aspects of the industry to be scrutinised.

"The REINZ is the gatekeeper for complaints and it decides how complaints are handled. However, most complaints are handled in-house and are seldom brought before the Real Estate Agents' Licensing Board, which can impose more serious penalties " he said.

"Basically it is a closed shop, and that is not good enough given that we are talking about what is for many New Zealanders' their greatest asset - their home."

Mr Cosgrove said under the current Act the Licensing Board has the ability to impose serious penalties for misconduct, including suspending or cancelling registration of agents and salespeople, but only when cases are referred by REINZ, the industry's regulator, which seldom does this.

“If cases are not referred up to the Licensing Board by the REINZ, the most likely outcome is a small fine or reprimand against the member. The freedom to self-regulate granted by the current legislation is now perceived as industry protectionism rather than consumer protection."

Mr Cosgrove noted that for example, in 2004 the REINZ received 132 complaints but none were referred to the Licensing Board, and in 2005 only seven of the 163 complaints it received were referred to the Board. Other concerns raised by the Minister include long delays in processing complaints, and allegations of poor quality investigations.

Last year Mr Cosgrove invited the industry to come up with proposals for open, transparent and independent complaints and discipline procedures, but he said the results were disappointing.

"The best the industry could do was to leave regulation in its own hands," he said.

"Buying or selling property is the biggest transaction most people will make, and they need to have confidence that, if they feel they have been ripped off, they can get something done about it. The current system cannot provide that."

As a result Mr Cosgrove instructed the Ministry of Justice to develop a range of legislative and non-legislative options to protect consumers and decent ethical real estate agents from the sharks in the industry. The overhaul is a result of that advice.

Mr Cosgrove said he anticipates that any new regulatory regime would be funded by the industry so it did not become a burden upon consumers or taxpayers. The full details of the government's proposed reforms will be released for public comment in May with a reform Bill to clean up the industry introduced to the House this year.

### Background Information:

***Why is an overhaul of the [Real Estate Agents Act 1976](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3238370237&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B7CE38%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) necessary?***  
While the overwhelming majority of real estate agents are honest professionals, there is widespread concern about the ethics of some in the industry and the effectiveness of complaints processes. Some high-profile cases have highlighted significant shortcomings with the current disciplinary processes, such as the time delays in processing complaints, lack of compensation for consumers through the process and the low penalties imposed in proportion to the commissions received in the transactions.

The legislation is also 30 years old. Since its introduction there have been substantial advances in regulatory frameworks for consumer protection. Currently the real estate industry lags behind other occupations in this area, such as lawyers and conveyancers, and motor vehicle traders. Real estate transactions need to be conducted in an environment that provides for independent resolution of disputes, holds agents to account and which is transparent and fair to consumers.

***But the REINZ already has a disciplinary process. What is wrong with it?***  
Concerns with the REINZ's current disciplinary process include:

- Long delays in processing complaints, and complainants not kept informed of progress
- Concerns about the quality of investigations.
- Limited information available about the complaints process.
- The current regime does not provide any compensation to complainants when agents or salespeople are found to be at fault, except in cases of fraud.
- Relatively few complaints are referred to the Licensing Board, which has the power to suspend or cancel registration, plus impose up to a $5,000 fine on agents. Most complaints are dealt with at REINZ sub-committee level, which means decisions about disciplinary action are made by fellow real estate agents, and a $750 is the maximum imposable fine.
- The industry's [Code of Ethics](http://www.reinz.co.nz/reinz/public/advice/code-of-ethics.cfm) inhibits agents from expressing their concerns publicly, as it states "Members shall never publicly criticise fellow members."

***Why not just increase the fines, as has been requested by the industry?***  
Even substantially increasing the fines may not deter real estate agents or salespeople from unethical activity when they stand to make thousands from commissions, or potentially tens of thousands if they are involved in profiteering from the on-sale of a house. Fines are just one penalty available. The review will look more broadly at both the type and level of penalties available to ensure that they are fit for purpose and effective in deterring misconduct within the industry. We need a regime where if people run amok, the hammer is dropped on them.

***What will the overhaul of the Act cover?***  
It will cover all areas - the effectiveness of the current licensing regime including entry and annual licensing requirements, consumer redress, discipline and general regulation of real estate activity. It will also examine:

- The training requirements for agents and salespeople.
- Whether membership of the REINZ by agents should remain compulsory.
- Whether the complaints and disciplinary system should be completely independent of the real estate industry.
- Whether the licensing function should be completely independent of the industry.
- Who should be required to be a real estate agent? E.g. should people providing only marketing services to sellers, or property managers, be covered by the licensing regime?

***What was wrong with the proposals put up by the REINZ?***  
The original proposal put up by the REINZ in December 2006 did not revamp the industry's Code of Ethics as requested, nor it did not provide a complaints structure that was sufficiently independent, transparent and responsive to consumers. It left control largely in its own hands. However the Government is pleased to note that the REINZ has this month (1 March) announced it is reviewing its Code of Ethics, and has appointed the outgoing Consumers Institute Chief Executive David Russell to chair this review.

***Will an independent ombudsman be installed as an alternative complaints structure?***  
Details of the government's proposals for reform will be released for public comment in May, and a reform Bill to clean up the real estate industry introduced to the House this year.
