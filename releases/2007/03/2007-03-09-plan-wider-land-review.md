Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia has welcomed government plans to review land sale processes by all government departments, agencies, SOEs and crown entities.

State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard today announced further details about the Landcorp review, together with plans to expand it to cover these other agencies.

The government is concerned to ensure protection of public access to some significant iconic land and coastline with special conservation or heritage values.

Mr Horomia said: \`\`I'm concerned that the increased demand for these properties could result in private sales which may forever impede access to important sites by Maori and other New Zealanders.''

Until the terms of reference for the reviews are determined, Cabinet has agreed ministers will be notified when consideration is being given to disposal of land by any crown agency which would meet the Overseas Investment Act 2005 criteria of \`\`sensitive land''.

The definition of sensitive land in the Act includes indigenous flora and fauna and historic heritage sites – including Maori sites such as wahi tapu - the protection of which, and the retention of access to, are of importance to Maori.

\`\`Over the years Maori have raised issues over the disposal processes used by government and crown agencies. The review is timely and will provide an opportunity to re-evaluate practices.''
