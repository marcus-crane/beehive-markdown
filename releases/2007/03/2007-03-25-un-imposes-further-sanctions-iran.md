Today’s decision by the UN Security Council to impose further sanctions on Iran shows the resolve of the international community to address concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme said Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff today.

“Iran’s failure to comply with UN Security Council’s decisions is unacceptable” said Mr Goff.

“In response to Iran’s non-compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1737, which was adopted because Iran didn’t comply with previous UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions, the UN Security Council has moved today to impose additional sanctions on Iran.

“Iran has been given 60 days to comply with the resolution. After this time the UN Security Council will decide on further action, if necessary. We call on Iran to listen to the concerns of the international community and to take the steps required to build confidence in its nuclear programme and to address the outstanding issues identified by the IAEA. This remains the best way of resolving the matter.

“New Zealand is disappointed that Iran continues to go against the wishes of the international community with its nuclear programme. New Zealand’s strong preference is for a negotiated solution to be reached – Iran needs to do its part.

"The sanctions imposed through UN Security Council resolution 1747 build and expand on the range of measures already in place on Iran through UN Security Council resolution 1737.

"The resolution extends the travel notification requirements and asset freeze to a wider group of individuals and entities involved in Iran’s nuclear or missile programmes. It also places an embargo on the sale of arms and related material by Iran.

"New Zealand, as a member of the United Nations, is bound by UN Security Council Chapter VII decisions. Regulations to give effect to sanctions under UN Security Council resolution 1737 are already in force in New Zealand and we are examining closely the range of measures included in the latest resolution, and will implement these as quickly as possible” said Mr Goff.
