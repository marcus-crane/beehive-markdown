"This art competition is about looking to the future - it helps encourage tomorrow’s fishers to think about how we will ensure there are fish for them, with care and management of the resource," said Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton at the award ceremony for the Seaweek School Art Competition.

"I am impressed by the obviouss creative talent in these artworks, combined with an awareness and appreciation of fisheries and the marine environment," Jim Anderton said

There were over 100 entries to the art competition, described by the judges as "vibrant, beautiful and thought-provoking works that clearly had a great deal of time and care put into them."

Jim Anderton presented the two national winners with their prizes, Mervyn Merumeru, who won the junior section with his work The Gifts of Tangaroa, and Riah King-Wall, winner of the senior section with her work Tiaki te Moana – Its future is in our hands.

Students painted, drew, sketched and printed their visions of the theme of the competition, Guardians of the Multitudes of Tangaroa, part of a Ministry of Fisheries’ initiative to build awareness amongst school students of fisheries issues and the importance of sustainable use of fisheries resources.

The display is at the Museum of Wellington City and Sea and runs for the month of March. 'Seaweek' takes place from 4-11 March.
