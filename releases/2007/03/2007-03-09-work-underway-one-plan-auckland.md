Coordinated strategic planning across the Auckland region is critical to ensuring that Auckland can compete as a twenty-first century city, Local Government Minister Mark Burton said today.

The Minister attended the Auckland Mayoral Forum to discuss the Auckland proposal to strengthen the region's governance arrangements. "The government supports the Auckland proposal in principle, and particularly the underlying theme that greater coordination and a unified vision are critical for the region," Mark Burton said.

"Ministers agree with the need for a stronger regional governance structure with enhanced funding mechanisms and resources to enable it to take a stronger role in the provision of regional facilities, including potential new roles beyond the ARC's current responsibilities.

"We have carefully considered the proposal and agree with the recommendation of the development, funding and implementation of an over-arching regional strategic plan, or 'One plan' as outlined in the proposal. Government officials have to date undertaken considerable work, in cooperation with officials from Auckland's local authorities, on the feasibility of the plan. I have written to councils to seek their agreement to undertake the further cooperative work now required.

"We also support the concept of having a collaborative forum develop the plan, which would represent the agencies responsible for the plan's funding and implementation," Mark Burton said.

"The government acknowledges the effort and goodwill from Auckland local authorities that has gone into developing the proposal."

The government has asked Auckland Councils to work collaboratively with the government to develop further details on the other recommendations contained in the December proposal. Final decisions on the remaining recommendations will be made once this work has been completed.

"In coming weeks I will be talking further with Auckland mayors and the Chair of the Regional Council. Arrangements for public input will also need to be enabled as the proposal is progressed further," he said.
