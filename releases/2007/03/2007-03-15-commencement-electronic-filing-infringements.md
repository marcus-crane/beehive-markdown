A move to electronic filing of Court infringement notices is expected to result in the saving of more than 1 million pieces of paper a year, Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

“For the first time prosecuting authorities such as councils and the Police can now file their infringement notices in an electronic template and submit them online,” Rick Barker said.

The change is a result of the Summary Proceedings Amendment Act (2006) which is one of nine acts amended as a result of the passing of the Courts and Criminal Matters Bill (2003).

“Up until now prosecuting agencies had to file paper copies of Reminder Notices at the local District Court. Many of them have been aiding the process by giving the court the information on a diskette as well. Court staff would then upload the information, either by typing it in or by up-loading from the diskette.

“This was both paper and people intensive.

“Now notices will be filed without the need for human intervention. This will mean less paper to be managed by District Courts, a more efficient system for managing infringement notices and a secure electronic record of the notice,” said Rick Barker.

Electronic filing became available on March 1, 2007 and will be mandatory from September 1, 2007. The NZ Police and the Auckland City Council, who last year were responsible for about 75 percent of infringements filed, have acted as pilot agencies for the initiative. NZ Police commenced efiling on 1 March 2007 and Auckland City Council on 5 March 2007.

“The commencement of efiling by these two agencies will result in immediate savings of about 66,000 pieces of paper a month. Once all prosecuting agencies are e-filing, the savings will be in the region of 1 million pieces of paper a year,” said Rick Barker.
