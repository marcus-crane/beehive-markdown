Auckland lawyer Allan Christopher Roberts has been appointed a District Court Judge, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today.

Mr Roberts was admitted to the bar in 1969 and has practised as a Barrister sole in Auckland since 1981. Before 1981 most of his work was in court, in criminal, family and, to a lesser extent, civil law. Now his work is mainly in the criminal jurisdiction and he is a member of the Auckland Prosecution Panel. On instructions from the Crown Solicitor he has prosecuted regularly in the District Court Jury Trial Jurisdiction and also in the High Court. He has also prosecuted in the Police Disciplinary Tribunal. For much of the last few years he has been a member of the Defence team in the Pitcairn case.

Mr Roberts is a very experienced practitioner having defended and prosecuted cases across the full spectrum. He is a member of the Legal Aid Assistance Scheme Committee in Auckland and a member of the Judicial Tribunal for New Zealand Surf Lifesaving. He is an active patrol member of the Muriwai Volunteer Lifeguard Service and has been a long term member of the Ponsonby Rugby Club.
