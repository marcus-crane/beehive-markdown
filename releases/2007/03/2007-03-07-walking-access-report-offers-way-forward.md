The independent report on walking access provides a blueprint for the way forward on an extremely complex and longstanding issue, Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor says.

The report, released publicly by Mr O'Connor today, was prepared by an independent panel of stakeholders representing farmers, recreational and other interest groups, and led by South Island farmer John Acland. It follows a thorough and productive period of consultation.

Mr O'Connor said the report proposes a plan of action including the formation of an establishment board for the recommended access organisation, and the commencement of work on the mapping of existing access rights under the supervision of the board.

"Resolving land access issues will not happen immediately and will evolve and become more effective over time. In the words of the panel, we much prefer an approach that is based on building on the existing goodwill and co-operation of landholders, rather than one of confrontation and compulsion.”

The next step in the process is for officials to provide a response to the recommendations, looking at the implications of implementation. This is expected to be completed before the end of the year.

Mr O'Connor said the report's recommendations were the culmination of years of work and fairly balance the rights of landowners with the expectations of the public.

"There is a lot in the report for everybody concerned. I am delighted it has received a great deal of stakeholder support.

"The report's recommendations should address the concerns of landowners, as well as providing practical processes and improving access to public land for recreational users.

"It makes it clear that private property rights will be respected, and recommends mapping and signposting existing access rights, and clarifying access to paper roads."

Mr O'Connor said the consultation process had been invaluable in the panel's aim of achieving practical and secure access along coasts, significant rivers and lakes and other publicly owned conservation areas.

"It proposes sensible measures for clearing up the many grey areas that have existed over public access in New Zealand for generations, and will give effect to the principles and expectations of the Queen's Chain.

"New Zealand's waterside laws have long created confusion among landowners and recreational users."

Mr O'Connor congratulated the panel for producing such a comprehensive and far-sighted report.

"To achieve widespread support on such a potentially divisive issue is a testament to the panellists' thoughtfulness and deep knowledge of the issues at hand."
