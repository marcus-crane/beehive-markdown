Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today that new Family Violence Courts will be established in Lower Hutt, Masterton, Porirua and Auckland City.

“Two Family Violence Courts are currently in operation in Manukau and Waitakere and the four new courts are a tribute to their success,” said Rick Barker.

The Family Violence Court takes place at a regular time and place, with dedicated Family Violence Court Judges, Police Prosecutors, Community Probation Officers, Victim Advisors and court staff. This provides a more effective way of managing family violence cases.

“Family Violence Courts are a new way of working that help ensure family violence matters come before Judges quickly,” said Rick Barker.

“Through providing rapid resolution of family violence matters, Family Violence Courts reduce the risk of further violence while the case is waiting to be heard.

“As well as improving the safety of victims, Family Violence Courts ensure offenders are accountable and can access the right support and programmes to help them live without violence,” said Rick Barker.

“Dealing with family violence requires co-ordinated approach. Much of the success of the Family Violence Court to date has been due to the co-operation and commitment of the judiciary, Court staff, and community groups,” said Rick Barker.

“Pivotal to the success of Family Violence Courts has been their close working relationships with community stakeholders. For instance the Manukau Family Violence Court works with the South Auckland Family Violence Prevention Network, a group encompassing 360 different agencies including Women's Refuges and Stopping Violence Programme providers.

“Domestic violence is an issue for all New Zealanders and must be addressed by our whole society.

“The expansion of the Family Violence Courts to four new areas is evidence that when the judiciary, the government and the community work together a very real impact can be made,” said Rick Barker.
