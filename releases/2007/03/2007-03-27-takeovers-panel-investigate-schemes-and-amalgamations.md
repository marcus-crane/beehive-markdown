Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel has asked the [Takeovers Panel](http://www.takeovers.govt.nz/) to undertake work to look at the issue of schemes of arrangements and amalgamations potentially being used in ways that may not align with the  
[Takeovers Code.](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____14132.aspx)

Lianne Dalziel announced at a function today to farewell outgoing chair John King, that the Panel had agreed to take on the task.

"I tried to get a partial resolution last year through the  
[Business Law Reform Bill](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____4510.aspx) but that required unanimity in Parliament as it was a matter outside the scope of the Bill. Unfortunately, that was not forthcoming.

"I have reflected on how best to progress this matter, given existing work programme priorities for the Ministry of Economic Development, such as the [Reviews of Financial Intermediaries](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____15293.aspx) and [Products and Providers.](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____479.aspx)

Since the Takeovers Panel considered this matter last year, the government has adopted a strengthened regulatory impact analysis framework, which takes effect on 1 April this year.

"I have decided, therefore, to refer to the matter back to the Panel and ask this time that a Regulatory Impact Statement be included in the report back to me. I believe this will strengthen the Panel's consideration of the issue and also enable a further period for consultation on the issues," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The matter has had renewed public interest of late and I am confident that by utilising the new framework the Takeovers Panel will be able to produce the answer the market is looking for."

Lianne Dalziel said the Panel has the necessary legal and commercial expertise as well as a deep understanding of the philosophy underpinning the Code.
