Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today reinforced the need for all New Zealanders to protect fisheries resources. "Going down to the water and catching a fish is part of our New Zealand way of life. When we take our kids fishing we want them to be able to take their kids fishing in the future as well," he said.

Jim Anderton was speaking at the opening of a new purpose-built facility for Ministry of Fisheries Christchurch staff. "The importance of a facility like this is in its contribution to working more effectively and in being a home for people whose dedication and professionalism benefits us all," Jim Anderton said.

Present at the opening were Ministry staff and Honorary Fisheries Officers. The new Christchurch office has been purpose built as one of three compliance hubs, the others being in Auckland and Wellington.

Jim Anderton stressed that, as Fisheries Minister, he is determined to see New Zealand's fisheries being well managed. " Eliminating illegal taking and illegal trade of high value and iconic fish species is a top priority for me. The work you do in inspections, patrols and educational operations is placing more pressure on criminals profiting from our national resources."

"In order to keep the pressure up the Government commits over ten million dollars a year to countering poaching and the black market trade. That is up by three million dollars over the year 2005-06."

Jim Anderton congratulated the volunteer officers for the support they give to the Ministry's staff. "I am very pleased that seven new honorary officers have been recruited and trained on the West Coast recently. Fish theft depletes our valuable fisheries and robs legitimate users of their fair share. It is stealing from neighbours and future generations. For your work in securing our fisheries, I am grateful and I congratulate you," Jim Anderton said.

Eight Fishery Surveillance Officers, the South Island investigation team of eight, a customary relationship manager, prosecution support and a small administration team will be based in the new Christchurch facility. The region also has sixteen Honorary Fisheries Officers.
