A Government 0800 flood helpline has been set up to provide information on government services for people affected by the Northland floods, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The [Ministry of Social Development](http://www.msd.govt.nz/) is coordinating the helpline, which will provide people affected by the flooding with a single point of contact for information on government services available.

People requiring information on income support, housing options, health issues, community assistance, taskforce green clean-up, insurance, civil defence or any other government service can call the helpline on 0800 779 997.

The 0800 information line will operate daily between 7am and 8pm during the week and 8am to 5pm in the weekend.

Calls to the Government Flood Helpline will be answered by staff from [Work and Income](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz) who will be able to assist people by providing them with information or contact details for the services they require.

"Government agencies are working closely together and are closely monitoring the issues raised by flood-affected people," said Mr Benson-Pope. "The initial focus will be on ensuring peoples’ immediate needs are being met.

“A great deal of infrastructure in the flood-affected area has been damaged. This has impacted on the lives of hundreds of New Zealanders. As we assess the extent of the damage caused by the flooding, government services will evolve further.”
