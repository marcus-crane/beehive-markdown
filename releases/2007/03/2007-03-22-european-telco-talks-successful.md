Communications Minister David Cunliffe has conducted talks with British and continental European telecommunications authorities during his visit to Europe to support New Zealand's presence at the CeBIT information technology trade fair.

Mr Cunliffe met Viviane Reding, the European Union Commissioner for Information Society and Media, Sir Christopher Bland, the British Telecom chairman, and officials from the United Kingdom regulator Ofcom and the Department of Trade and Industry.

"These were timely and highly successful talks," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Following the passing of the Labour-led government's Telecommunications Amendment Act in December 2006, we are moving to implement operational separation of New Zealand's incumbent telco, Telecom, reflecting policy development in the UK.

"I found the exchange of views very helpful and I expect there will be ongoing discussions between New Zealand and UK authorities on telecommunications policy."
