New Zealand has reinforced bilateral ties for scientific cooperation with Germany, at a meeting in Berlin between Minister of Research, Science and Technology Steve Maharey, and German Federal Science Minister, Dr Annette Schavan.

The Ministers have signed an arrangement restating each government’s commitment to encouraging research collaboration under the 1977 New Zealand-Germany Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement.

“Scientific cooperation is one of the most important aspects of our ongoing partnership with Germany, and through this we want to provide further impetus for that relationship,” Mr Maharey says.

“We want to give a boost to joint projects in science and research,” Dr Schavan says.

The two ministers have agreed to a number of new ways of strengthening their relationship. These recommendations were made in a review of their agreement carried out last year, which found the depth and breadth of research links between the two countries are 'remarkable'.

Scientific collaboration between the two countries will focus on the areas of health, food, agriculture and biotechnology, information and communications technology, the environment, and ocean and polar research.

The aim is to develop a strong information network between Germany and New Zealand. For example, combined summer courses and workshops would give opportunities for young scientists from both countries to build links.

This meeting will build on the firm foundation of cooperation between Germany and New Zealand, which includes government support for projects and partnerships between institutions with similar research interests.

For example, world-class scientists from Germany and New Zealand work alongside each other in the areas of agricultural-technology, and oceanic, atmospheric and polar research.
