Health Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed an agreement to ensure the seamless supply of laboratory services for the people of Auckland.

Auckland Region district health boards, including Auckland District Health Board, Counties Manukau District Health Board and Waitemata District Health Board, today announced an agreement to provide laboratory services had been signed with Diagnostic Medical Laboratories.

The agreement is for a period of 18 months in the first instance.

"I said I would be happy once the ink was dry on a new agreement to ensure Aucklanders had access to high-quality diagnostic laboratory services after the expiry of the current contract on July 1 this year," Pete Hodgson says.

"Today I am pleased to say that has been achieved."

Pete Hodgson leaves today to attend the Australian Health Ministers' Conference in Melbourne.
