The latest 'Competent Children, Competent Learners' research reinforces the importance of effective Early Childhood Education (ECE) in starting a pattern of successful learning at an early age, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The research shows making early progress in literacy and numeracy is an important factor in determining whether a student remains at school after they turn 16," Steve Maharey said.

"It indicates that students who left school before the age of 16 had demonstrated a pattern of poor achievement on the research tests from the age of five.

"This is more evidence to support participation in quality ECE, which will be boosted by the government's 20 Hours Free ECE scheme. From 1 July, 92 thousand three and four year olds will be eligible to sign up for this popular policy."

The report highlights the importance of activities outside school that support learning, including:

- Teachers and parents working together
- Enjoying reading
- Avoiding too much time in passive activities like watching television and playing computer games

"The latest findings are an important reminder to parents of the importance of education from a very young age, if they are to stay at school at age 16. The government's Team Up campaign provides tips and information to help parents support their children's learning."

['Competent Children, Competent Learners'](http://educationcounts.edcentre.govt.nz/publications/schooling/cc-overtime-16.html) is a study, which began in 1993, and has followed the progress of 500 young people from preschool age. The latest phase of research examines what happened when the students reached school leaving age.

The research was carried out by the NZ Council for Educational Research, and involved gathering extensive data from students and their parents and teachers.

The latest report is one of a series to be released this year, and can be found on the Ministry of Education’s “Education Counts” website [http://educationcounts.edcentre.govt.nz/](http://educationcounts.edcentre.govt.nz/)
