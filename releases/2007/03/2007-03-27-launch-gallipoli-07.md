The launch of “Gallipoli ‘07" will help ensure this year’s commemorations evoke an appreciation of the sacrifice made by those who served at Gallipoli, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today.

Speaking in Canberra, Rick Barker said that ‘Gallipoli ’07’ will see Australia, New Zealand and Turkey working together to oversee the planning, security and safety arrangements for this year’s ceremonies at Gallipoli.

“New Zealand’s experience at Gallipoli fostered an emerging national identity, and it’s important we create an environment that allows those traveling to Gallipoli to respectfully connect with their past and understand the massive sacrifice made by their forbearers,” said Rick Barker.

“Over the past two years the Governments’ of Australia, New Zealand and Turkey have worked collegially to ensure everyone who journeys to the Peninsula has a positive experience of ANZAC Day.

“Central to our planning is ensuring a strong message is conveyed to the crowd concerning appropriate behaviour, dress, conduct and respect for a sacred place of remembrance, in a foreign country.

“We also want to create a context that evokes a sense of the desperate conditions that the soldiers endured in 1915.

“An Interpretive Program will be run through the night of 24 April that will provide a dignified, educative and solemn account of the Gallipoli Campaign. As part of this a new documentary, “Kiwis on Gallipoli”, will be played which combines moving film footage, still images and the words of the New Zealanders who served on the Peninsula to tell the story of the New Zealand experience.

“The planning processes we now have in place will be invaluable as we lead up to the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli Campaign in 2015.

“Through working closely with our Turkish and Australian colleagues I am confident this year’s commemorations, and future ones, will be events of national pride”, said Rick Barker.
