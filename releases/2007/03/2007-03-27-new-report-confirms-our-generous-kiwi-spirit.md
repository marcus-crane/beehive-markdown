New Zealanders should pat themselves on the back after a new report found we gave an estimated total of $1.27 billion to charity in the 2005/06 year, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said today.

"I applaud all organisations and individual Kiwis who are supporting their communities by giving so generously," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"Of course giving money is just one part of the picture – every day thousands of ordinary Kiwis also donate huge amounts of their time, expertise and energy to their communities."

The figures were released today in a comprehensive new report by Philanthropy New Zealand, entitled Giving in New Zealand – Philanthropic Funding 2006. The report estimates that New Zealanders and non-government organisations gave $1.27 billion to charity and other community purposes during the 2005/06 year.

The report estimates that New Zealanders gave 0.81% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to charity - higher than Australia, Canada and comparable with the UK.

"The international comparison confirms what many of us already suspected – that overall kiwis really are very generous people!" said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"A healthy dose of philanthropy is vital in any society as it supports many activities which build social cohesion in communities.

"Local funders are often best placed to understand their local community needs and provide a fast and flexible response. Few local sports teams, support groups or arts and cultural societies would exist without their support.

"The Labour-led government is committed to building strong, sustainable and connected communities by supporting the efforts of charities, volunteer groups and making it easier to donate.

"We have passed the Charities Act, set up the Charities Commission and are currently exploring tax incentives for businesses and individuals to further promote charitable giving.

"In addition to philanthropic funding, our community and voluntary sector organisations receive an estimated $1 billion dollars from central government each year," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.
