Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope has introduced a supplementary order paper to the House today that will address any concerns that Sue Bradford's Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Bill will not achieve its intended purpose.

The amendment directs the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development to review whether the Act is achieving its intended purpose and to report on any additional impacts.

"The Bill closes a loophole through which some violent parents were acquitted in situations of clear use of excessive violence against their children," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The misinformation around this Bill has led many parents to mistakenly believe that good, caring parents will in some way be criminalised by the Bill. This is clearly not the case.

"This matter was raised in Cabinet by my colleague, Clayton Cosgrove, as an added safeguard for parents and I am pleased to support his suggestion."
