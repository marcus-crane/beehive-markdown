The latest Household Labour Force Survey ([HLFS](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-mar07qtr-mr.htm)) shows the number of people employed in New Zealand is the highest ever since the survey began, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"Unemployment remains low by historical and international standards, at 3.8 percent. It has been below four percent for 11 consecutive quarters – the only OECD country with such a record.

"High unemployment is a thing of the past. Low unemployment and high labour force participation are now standard features of the employment scene.

2,143,000 people were employed this quarter, up 25,000 from the previous quarter. This shows significant employment growth of 1.2 percent since December last year - the strongest quarterly growth in over two years.

"This is an endorsement of the Labour-led government's initiatives to support people into work," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The number of people participating in the labour force is also at an all time high of 2,227,000. The labour force has increased at a greater rate than the working age population this quarter.

"These results mirror the latest benefit figures I released in the House yesterday which show that the number of people on every type of benefit has dropped, and that the total number of working age people receiving benefits has dropped by over 4,000 in the last month alone.

"The Labour-led government is about supporting people, and is in the process of rolling out further support through the Social Security Amendment Bill," said Mr Benson-Pope.
