Today's signing of the terms of negotiations to settle historical Treaty claims between the Tûranganui-a-Kiwa claimant groups and the Crown is welcomed as an important step forward, say Parekura Horomia and Mita Ririnui.

The agreement was signed in Gisborne today by Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton and Ngâi Tâmanuhiri Whânui Trust, Rongowhakaata and Te Pou a Haokai Central Progression Team. It sets out the parameters for how the parties will negotiate a settlement.

Mr Horomia, also the MP for Ikaroa Râwhiti, said the signing included a recognition by the Crown that it had failed to fulfill its Treaty obligations to the groups - as previously acknowledged in hearings before the Waitangi Tribunal.

"The signing also signals that the claimant groups wish to move to resolve their historical grievances. By settling these claims we unlock resources which can be invested in our people and enable them to focus their considerable energy on charting a pathway forward for their communities, which I applaud," Mr Horomia said.

Mr Ririnui commended the efforts to date of all the negotiators in reaching such a significant milestone.

"The Crown wishes to restore its mana through the eventual settlement and to enhance its relationship with Ngâi Tâmanuhiri, Rongowhakaata and Te Pou a Hoakai as a result,'' Mr Ririnui said.
