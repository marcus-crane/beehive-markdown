Prime Minister Helen Clark and Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard today expressed sorrow at death of filmmaker Brad McGann.

"Brad achieved so much in his career and is best known for his award winning feature film In My Father's Den (2005), which saw him pick up New Zealand Screen Awards for direction and screenplay. The film itself won nine awards.

"He also achieved earlier success with short films including Possum (1997) and Come as You Are (1996)," Helen Clark said.

Judith Tizard said that Brad McGann had made a huge contribution to the New Zealand film industry and will be sorely missed.

"The support he received from friends and industry colleagues when they helped raise funds for his cancer treatment demonstrates the high esteem in which he was held," Judith Tizard said.

Helen Clark and Judith Tizard extended their deepest sympathy to Brad’s family and friends.
