Trade Minister Phil Goff today congratulated New Zealand companies for their success in marketing New Zealand natural cosmetics products in France

"New Zealand natural cosmetic products is a sector enjoying impressive successes in the French market," Mr Goff said.

"Today I joined five New Zealand companies: Living Nature, Skinfood, Trilogy, Art a Face and Antipodes, along with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the New Zealand Embassy, in an event showcasing their products to French media and industry representatives.

"The interest in, and demand for, 100% natural products in France was underlined by the fact that over thirty media representatives, including some from major international fashion publications Elle and Marie Claire, as well as representatives from some of France's major retail chains, attended.

"There is a growing international consumer demand for high quality natural products. This has contributed to the marketing success of these companies in France - quite possibly the world's most exacting cosmetic markets.

"Natural products are now a $300 million export industry for New Zealand, and this sector is likely to continue to grow.

"Companies such as these both draw on, and contribute to, New Zealand's positive reputation for quality, innovation and environmental purity.

"In the Export Year 2007 context, this is a perfect case study of New Zealand companies which have used innovation, product integrity and environmental quality to succeed in one of the most demanding, and competitive markets in the world," Mr Goff said

Mr Goff is on a three day visit to Paris France, where he is attending the annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting.
