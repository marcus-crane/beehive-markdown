Educating and training a medical workforce to provide the best health care for New Zealanders now and into the future is the subject of a report released by the Ministers of Health and Tertiary education today.

The Workforce Taskforce Report: "Reshaping medical education and training to meet the challenges of the 21st Century" is the result of six months' work by the Taskforce, which makes five major recommendations.

Minister of Tertiary Education Dr Michael Cullen and Health Minister Pete Hodgson welcomed the Taskforce's recommendation to establish a Training Board for the implementation of future changes to ensure a sustainable medical education and training programme.

Dr Cullen said the Taskforce report complemented the wider tertiary reforms currently underway, which aim to achieve tertiary education and training that meets the needs of students, businesses and communities.

"Having enough well-trained doctors in our workforce is crucial if we want to ensure that New Zealanders have the best possible medical care," Dr Cullen says.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson welcomed the Taskforce's call to action.

"The emphasis of the Taskforce's recommendations is for action and I welcome the recommendation to set up a Training Board to provide the leadership and direction in this area that has been lacking," Pete Hodgson says.

"This will have a major impact on the delivery of health and disability services and the workforce that provides those services and I am seeking Cabinet approval to establish a Training Board."
