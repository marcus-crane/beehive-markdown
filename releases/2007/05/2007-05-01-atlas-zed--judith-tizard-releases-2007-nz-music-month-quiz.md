From ukuleles to gold guitars, from school bands to South by Southwest - they're all questions in Judith Tizard's annual Parliamentary quiz released today at the start of New Zealand Music Month.

"May is New Zealand Music Month and it's a great time to celebrate New Zealand music and musicians, " says Judith Tizard.

"But my annual quiz is also a fun way to get my Parliamentary colleagues to really think about New Zealand music. So it doesn’t matter if they have to google to complete it."

"We’ve come a long way since we set quotas to ensure our music was heard. During Music Month last year, New Zealand music made up a staggering 29% of albums sold and radio airplay was over 20% for the month."

"New Zealand music is now an established part of our national identity. Where would we be without Don McGlashan's "Dominion Road" or Fourmyula's "Nature", which has become a New Zealand anthem.

"Today we have a thriving music culture in our schools and a vibrant home grown music industry we can be proud of. And a record number of New Zealand artists were invited to play at this year's SxSW in Austin, Texas.

"This Labour–led government is committed to supporting New Zealand music. Following on from the success of New Zealanders embracing their own music, we're taking New Zealand music to the rest of the world."

'Outward Sound', the New Zealand Music Industry Commission's scheme launched in 2005, works to enhance the profile of New Zealand musicians and helps develop international markets for their works – boosting their potential to increase New Zealand's export earnings.

MPs entries in the Quiz close on midday Wednesday 9 May. Prizes will be awarded to the best five entries and include New Zealand Music Month merchandise and CDs by New Zealand musicians.

"This month I encourage all New Zealanders to celebrate New Zealand music. Let's all sing, play and buy New Zealand music this month".

"Have a great NZ New Zealand Music Month!"
