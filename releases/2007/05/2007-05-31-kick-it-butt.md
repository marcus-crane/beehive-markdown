Today is as good time as any to think about the choices you make as a young person says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta on World Smokefree Day.

“Smoking is harmful and can really affect you - so why not kick it in the butt?".

Today is World Smokefree Day. Recent figures released by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) show a marked decrease in numbers of 14-year-olds smoking in 2005 compared with 1999.

"We know that more than 4500 New Zealanders still die from smoking-related illnesses each year – but the choice is in the hands of every smoker," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"As Minister of Youth Affairs it's great to see less young people smoking today compared with previous years. More young people are starting to realise that they can make small changes to improve their lives. Each step towards a positive healthy lifestyle is a step forward.

"Young people who want help, support or advice should call their local Quitline (0800 778 778) where they will receive support and information about a cessation programme – that's a great first step," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"Sometimes young people start smoking because of peer pressure and they believe it's a ‘cool' thing to do. Others live in a household with adults who smoke. Tobacco is a very clever drug and before you know it, you are hooked."

"Getting advice from a trusted adult or friend, talking to a local youth worker, or getting in touch with organisations such as Youthline (0800 37 66 33), who have experienced people to listen and offer advice, is a way that young people can help deal with issues such as peer pressure."

"There are more and more young people who realise that smoking kills, its not cool and only they can make a positive choice to live a healthy lifestyle.”

“I want to encourage all young people to make positive choices in their lives," says Nanaia Mahuta.
