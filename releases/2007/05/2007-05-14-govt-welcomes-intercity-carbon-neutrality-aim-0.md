Prime Minister Helen Clark and Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today welcomed InterCity's aim to become the world's first carbon neutral public transport company.

InterCity has signed up to Crown Research Institute Landcare's programme to measure, reduce, and mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, to achieve carboNZero accreditation. It aims to do this within the next three years.

"I believe that the sustainability challenge facing the world is a defining issue for the twenty-first century. It is also a huge opportunity for New Zealand businesses because being truly sustainable has huge economic benefits," Helen Clark said.

"New Zealand's reputation as a country with a clean environment is vital to our prosperity. The tourism industry in particular has a huge interest in maintaining and building on this priceless reputation.

"Today's announcement is a perfect example of how businesses can leverage off, and build on, that brand. I congratulate InterCity's decision to show leadership and become carbon neutral. It is good for business and will help in achieving the Labour-led government's aim for New Zealand to become the world's first truly sustainable and carbon neutral nation," Helen Clark said.

Damien O'Connor said sustainability is a key focus in the current review of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy, a draft of which will be released on Wednesday.

"The draft strategy makes sustainable business practices central to the future vision for the industry, and proposes a range of actions the industry will need to take.

"This includes reducing and mitigating carbon emissions from travel within New Zealand and to and from overseas markets, and reducing energy use overall.

"Today's announcement fits well with this vision. I encourage other tourism businesses to look at how they can make a difference in this important area," Damien O'Connor said.
