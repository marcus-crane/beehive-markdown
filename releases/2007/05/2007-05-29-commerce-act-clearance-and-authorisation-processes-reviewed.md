Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today released a discussion document reviewing the clearance and authorisation processes within Part 5 of the Commerce Act.

Lianne Dalziel said the discussion document does not fundamentally question the clearance and authorisation process but rather tests whether changes could be made to Part 5 of the Commerce Act in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of those systems.

The Act allows the [Commerce Commission](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/) to clear or authorise a merger if it considers the merger is not anticompetitive, or authorise a merger or trade practice on the grounds that it is of net benefit to the public. The clearance provisions are largely aimed at firms that are unsure whether a merger or acquisition proposal is anticompetitive. The authorisation provisions are aimed at firms that think the acquisition or the conduct is probably anticompetitive but is, nevertheless, good for the economy.

Lianne Dalziel said the discussion document seeks feedback on a range of issues relating to the authorisation and clearance processes, including the appropriate statutory timeframe for considering clearance applications and whether a clearance system should be introduced for trade practices. It also seeks views on a proposed notification system for collective bargaining – a new feature of the Australian regime designed to benefit small and medium enterprises that have little or no bargaining power in their dealings with big business.

“The Labour-led government has shown its absolute commitment to updating business laws and regulatory frameworks to provide a platform of certainty and stability, minimise compliance barriers, and provide incentives for investment.”

The release of the second discussion document follows the April 2007 release of a discussion document on Parts 4 and 4A relating to regulatory control provisions in sectors where competition is limited, such as gas pipeline or electricity lines companies.  
The review seeks feedback from all interested parties. Submissions on the Part 5 Review close on 10 August 2007 and on Parts 4 and 4A on 6 July 2007. Both discussion documents can be viewed [here](http://www.med.govt.nz).

### Main Discussion Points for Review of Part 5 of the Commerce Act

The discussion document considers:

**1.Merger issues:**

a.Increasing the statutory timeframe from 10 to 30 working days for merger clearance determinations;  
b.Whether there should be a requirement (and timeframe) for the Commission to publish written reasons given that this could delay decisions;  
c.Whether the Commission needs powers to enforce undertakings, and whether its powers to vary undertakings to divest shares or assets should be modified;  
d.Whether the Commission should be able to consider behavioural undertakings for mergers, or whether this could be counter-productive;  
e.The merits of an informal pre-merger process, such as the Australian ‘letter of comfort’ system, or whether this would undermine the formal process.

**2.Restrictive trade practices issues:**

f.Whether a clearance system for trade practices is desirable, given the greater complexity and cost of the authorisation process;  
g.The merits of the Australian collective bargaining arrangement notification process;  
h.Whether the “lessening competition” jurisdiction test is necessary - depending on the decision in (f);  
i.Whether the Commission’s powers to revoke, amend or replace authorisations on its own motion should be amended to enable the applicant to apply;  
j.Change the mandatory halting of conduct while the Commission considers an authorisation application to a discretionary order of the Commission; and  
k.Whether to continue to allow parties other than the Commission to call a conference, given that the purpose of the conference is to provide the Commission with an effective means to obtain information.

**3.Joint legal process issues:**

l.Whether the current provision providing appeal rights to all conference participants is appropriate, or whether it should be up to the High Court to determine whether a third party has a sufficiently strong interest in the outcome;  
m.Whether a specialist competition tribunal is required or necessary to take over the role of the High Court under the Commerce Act; and  
n.Whether to increase the Court's discretion to appoint lay members whenever it has to consider the merits of a Commission report.

**4.The framework for assessing costs and benefits:**

We are seeking submissions on:  
o.the Commission's practice for assessing costs and benefits, ie defining a factual and counterfactual;  
p.whether the public benefit test is sufficiently broad to take international competitiveness claims into consideration and give them sufficient weighting;  
q.the balance between quantified and intangible benefits and detriments;  
r.the time frame over which costs and benefits are assessed (2-5 years); and  
s.the market definition approach of the Commission.
