Health Minister Pete Hodgson says the Diabetes New Zealand's modelling of the future costs of diabetes is a welcome and useful addition to our understanding of the future.

"The closer we look at diabetes, the greater the challenge becomes. Between 2001 and 2006 the Ministry of Health's estimate of prevalence has increased, and Diabetes NZ has modelled the cost of that increase," said Pete Hodgson

"Between 2001 and 2006 the t Labour-led Government's response to diabetes has also increased, especially with the wide range of programmes that seek to address the fact that New Zealanders are getting heavier. Further initiatives can be anticipated in the budget later this month.

"Diabetes New Zealand has attempted to measure the economic impact of diabetes, including the impact on the health system, which provides planners with insights they would not otherwise have.

"However, it is also important to stress the paradox that part of the increase in the prevalence of diabetes is due to the success of diabetes treatment. Diabetics are now living a lot longer and that, alone, is a major driver of the increase in diabetes in the population. By contrast about 30 per cent of the increase is thought to be due to obesity."
