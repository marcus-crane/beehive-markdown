Prime Minister and Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Government is seeking feedback on New Zealand becoming a party to an international treaty aiming to strengthen and protect cultural expression.

The UNESCO Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions recognises the significance of cultural activities, goods, and services in conveying identity, values, and meaning, and recognises the need for states to take appropriate measures to protect and promote culture.

“New Zealand has supported the concept of this Convention throughout its development and negotiation over four years from 2001," Helen Clark said.

The Convention was adopted at the UNESCO General Conference in October 2005, and came into force in March of this year. A total of 57 countries have already acceded to the Convention, including most of Europe, Canada, China, India, and several African and South American nations.

“It is a document which aims to establish an international environment where the diversity of cultural expression is affirmed and encouraged.

“At the time of the adoption of the Convention New Zealand made interpretative statements on Articles 16 and 20 of the Convention, setting out New Zealand’s understanding of the effect of those Articles. Respectively, these articles refer to the treatment for developing countries under the Convention and the Convention's relationship to other international agreements. Should New Zealand accede to the Convention, we intend to submit similar statements to reinforce that understanding.

“In 2004, the government consulted on an early draft of the Convention. We are now asking for feedback on whether New Zealand should accede to the Convention, especially on the likely advantages and any disadvantages; and on any economic, social, cultural, and environmental implications for New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"The consultation period will run over four weeks, to 6 June. A copy of the letter sent to organisations requesting feedback and a link to the text of the Convention are available on the Ministry for Culture and Heritage’s website, www.mch.govt.nz.

"The outcome of the consultation will be reported to Cabinet in July. Should Cabinet agree to accession to the Convention, it will be referred to the relevant parliamentary committee for the normal treaty examination process," Helen Clark said.
