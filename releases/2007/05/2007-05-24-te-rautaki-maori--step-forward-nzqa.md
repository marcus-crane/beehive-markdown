NZQA’s first Mâori Strategic and Implementation Plan is a major step forward for Mâori education, Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia says.

Mr Horomia launched the plan -Te Rautaki Mâori me Te Mahere Whakatinana a Te Mana Tohu Mâtauranga o Aotearoa – today, saying success in learning for Mâori individuals would benefit the Mâori community generally and the nation as a whole.

“Within Te Rautaki, the strategic goals emphasise this. They stress learners being able to succeed as Mâori and as citizens of the world. They put a premium on gaining qualifications that will add to the knowledge base of Mâori communities and iwi, and will increase capability within Mâori communities.

“Mâori should be enabled to gain education and training that will increase Mâori social well-being, and support Mâori participation across the qualification spectrum. And education and qualifications should facilitate Mâori capacity to contribute towards transforming the New Zealand economy.”

Te Rautaki identifies key factors to encourage Mâori learners including:  
·multiple pathways – different ways to undertake tertiary education and training  
·quality courses and providers, with outcomes linked to employability, positive participation in society and strengthened cultural identity  
·integrated and collaborative learning opportunities to excel in te ao Mâori and in the wider society

Mr Horomia paid tribute to NZQA’s Mâori Reference Group, the Board of NZQA and staff for their work in developing Te Rautaki.

“Te Rautaki is a great step forward for Mâori education in Aotearoa.”
