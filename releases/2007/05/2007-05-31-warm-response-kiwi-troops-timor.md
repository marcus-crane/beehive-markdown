Kiwi police and defence force peacekeepers are left in no doubt that local people in Timor Leste welcome their presence there, says Defence Minister Phil Goff.

Mr Goff today finished a three day visit to Timor Leste which included a night patrol with Kiwi soldiers in Dili, a memorial service to Private Leonard Manning at Tilomar near the Indonesian border, and meetings with newly elected President of Timor Leste Jose Ramos Horta and other Timorese, UN and military leaders.

"The warmth of the welcome given to New Zealanders in Timor is obvious and overwhelming", Mr Goff said.

"On the streets of Dili during the day, at a local refugee camp and on patrol at night around Dili, Kiwi soldiers and police officers were greeted warmly with wide smiles, thumbs up signs and calls of hello kiwis.

"People we talked to made it absolutely clear that they welcomed our presence to ensure their safety and security from destruction and violence.

"As one senior political leader said to us, normally armed foreign soldiers on the soil of another sovereign country would be resented and opposed, but we know you are here for our safety and need you here.

"I have no doubt that without the International Security Force and UN police, the situation last year could have dissolved into a bloodbath", Mr Goff said.

"At the moment, things are relatively stable and recent elections for the Presidency were conducted without major violence. However, the situation remains fragile and volatile.

"As we were about to go out on patrol last night one person was killed and three injured in a grenade attack in Dili.

"People have been killed, often in gang related conflicts around the city and country, and houses set on fire.

"The election campaign began this week and the real test of Timor Leste's new democracy will be to see if power can be transferred peacefully by the ballot box, and accepted without the loser resorting to violence to secure what they failed to get by the electoral process.

"We may have a better idea of how long we will need to be in Timor Leste and at what strength, after the June 30 parliamentary elections", Mr Goff said.

"We have no desire to be here longer than necessary or wear out our welcome.

"At the same time there are lessons from the past that withdrawing prematurely and without building adequate capacity in the local police and defence force could lead to a resurgence in violence", Mr Goff said.
