Foreign Minister Winston Peters today visited Shihezi University in China's north-western Xinjiang Province, where Massey University is involved in a partnership with Shihezi and Peking Universities.

"Shihezi is one of a growing number of universities in China's less-developed west that have formed partnerships with more established east coast instititions such as the prestigious Peking University," Mr Peters said.

"Massey University joined the partnership in 2005, and the three are now sharing expertise and perspectives to capitalise on their common strengths, especially in agriculture and agricultural technology.

"Shihezi is an impressive institution. It has over 29,000 students in 20 academic colleges, and hosts over 20 research institutes supported by the Chinese and Xinjiang provincial governments.

"The University of Auckland has established similar partnerships with Tsinghua and Qinghai Universities."

While in Xinjiang, Mr Peters will also visit an education project started by Save the Children and partly funded by the government's aid agency, NZAID.

"Xinjiang is one of the poorest regions of China, and this project is delivering basic education to previously marginalised rural children of minority groups.

"The school is a long way from China’s thriving coastal cities, but education is essential if these children are to benefit from China’s economic development.”

New Zealand’s development assistance in China focuses on the seven western provinces of Tibet, Xinjiang, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi, which are less developed than the eastern seaboard.

"We can be pleased with the development work New Zealand is supporting. In Gansu, for example, the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Project has worked so well that local authorities have expanded the scheme far beyond our project villages," Mr Peters said.
