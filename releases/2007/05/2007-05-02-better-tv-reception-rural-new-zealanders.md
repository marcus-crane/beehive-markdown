Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor applauded the launch today of digital television by Freeview, which allows rural New Zealanders to tune in to digital quality free-to-air TV for the first time.

The government has committed $25 million over the next five years to support the development of free-to-air digital television by Freeview. Broadcasters will also have access to free digital frequencies for the terrestrial rollout.

Mr O'Connor said all rural New Zealanders will now be able to receive a clear television reception, and will eventually gain access to an expanded range of television channels.

"For many people in remote parts of New Zealand this will be the first time they can get the kind of quality images most of us take for granted on free-to-air tv.

"The Labour-led government recognises the special and often unique challenges of living in rural locations. That is why it fully supports initiatives, such as this, that give rural people equal access to key services and products."

Freeview is a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters leading the move to digital, including Television New Zealand, CanWest, Maori TV and Radio New Zealand.

Free to Air satellite is being launched today, and the progressive roll out of terrestrial (land based) services will follow.
