National's tertiary education spokesman Paul Hutchison has mis-read the report by the Office of the Auditor-General on NZQA’s monitoring of the quality of polytechnic education, said Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen today.

"He has totally misunderstood the Auditor-General’s findings," said Dr Cullen.

"Rather than indicating failure, the Auditor-General says categorically that he is 'pleased' with the outcome of the audit.

"Nowhere in the report does the Auditor-General state that audit reports on polytechnics were 'presented to the NZQA board but not reported on'. This statement makes no sense.

"In fact, the Auditor-General makes five recommendations that he says are 'in accord with the direction it (NZQA) is heading under its new divisional structure'.

"NZQA’s new structure was announced in September last year and at the time of the audit, NZQA was already addressing issues around audits by ITP Quality.

"The Auditor-General’s report sets out NZQA’s responses to the five recommendations and states: 'I am pleased with this outcome'," said Dr Cullen.
