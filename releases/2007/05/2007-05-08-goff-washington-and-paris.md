Trade and Defence Minister Phil Goff leaves tonight for an eleven day visit to Washington DC, London and Paris for a series of trade and defence meetings.

"I will visit Washington DC from 9-11 May where I will meet with, among others, the US Trade Representative Susan Schwab, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates to discuss trade, agriculture and defence issues", said Mr Goff.

“My visit to Washington will build on the Prime Minister’s successful visit in March and promote trade ties and defence cooperation in areas of mutual interest between our nations.

“In addition to meeting senior US officials I will engage with a range of business and congressional contacts from across the commercial and political spectrum. I will also address a joint meeting of the US-NZ Council and US Chamber of Commerce, focusing on the WTO round.

"From Washington I will travel to London for a brief visit which I hope will provide opportunities to promote New Zealand's response to the issue of food miles.

"I will then travel to Paris to attend the annual OECD ministerial meeting and participate in a WTO mini-ministerial gathering.

"As well as the OECD ministerial council meeting, I will also participate in a panel discussion on future challenges to the multilateral trading system with WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy.

"I will also take part in an informal, but important, WTO mini-ministerial meeting on how to promote progress in moving the current negotiations forward in a manner to allow the earliest conclusion of the Doha Round”, Mr Goff said.
