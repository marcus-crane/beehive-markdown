Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff welcomed the increasing number of countries committed to restrictions on the use of cluster munitions.

"New Zealand argues that the indiscriminate use of cluster munitions is contrary to humanitarian law because of the casualties caused to civilian populations. Large numbers of unexploded cluster munitions threaten to maim and kill children and innocent people for years after the conflict is ended", said Phil Goff.

"New Zealand is pleased that progress was made on an international treaty regulating these weapons at a conference in Lima, Peru, from 23 to 25 May.

"This was the second meeting in a process that began in Oslo, Norway, in February. In Oslo 46 countries, including New Zealand, gave a commitment to conclude a treaty that prohibits cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians, during 2008.

"In Lima there was even broader commitment to that goal. Over 250 participants attended from 68 countries, 10 international organisations, and more than 30 non-governmental organisations. 28 additional states, including a large number from Africa and Asia, have joined the original 46 countries that subscribed to the commitment given in Oslo.

"At the Lima meeting, participants focused their discussion on a draft treaty. This represents real progress towards our goal.

"Discussion in Lima concentrated on the humanitarian impacts of cluster munitions, as well as victim assistance, stockpile destruction, clearance of contaminated areas, and international cooperation and assistance.

"The key issue is defining the nature and circumstances under which cluster munitions will be prohibited because of the unacceptable harm they cause. New Zealand co-chaired, with host Peru, the discussion on this key area.

"Participating countries and organisations will next meet in December, in Vienna before New Zealand hosts a meeting in Wellington in February 2008", said Mr Goff.
