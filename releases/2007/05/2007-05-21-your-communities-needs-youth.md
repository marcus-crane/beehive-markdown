Youth week is a time to celebrate and encourage the positive contribution that young people make to their communities and to our country says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta at the beginning of Youth week.

This year's theme, Your Community Needs YOUth, focuses on youth involvement in the decision making process – whether for their personal life, in their communities or across the country.

"We need to ensure that youth have the opportunity to contribute. We also need to listen to the positive voices of young people," says Nanaia Mahuta.

Prime Minister Helen Clark launches Youth week later today, along with Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta, and Maungakiekie MP Vui Mark Gosche. The launch in Otahuhu includes Kapa Haka, dance by PHUSION, and music from Super Twelve from Otahuhu College.

“Young people in New Zealand are an amazingly talented and diverse group and make up a significant proportion of our population. Recognising and celebrating their positive contribution is about reflecting what is good in our communities.

“Youth Week is also an opportunity to showcase the vast number of young people who are actively involved in making their communities a better place.”

The theme of involvement in decision-making will feed into the annual Youth Parliament being held in Wellington over 4 days in July.

"The Youth Parliament brings together 121 young people from electorates around the country and 10 members of the Youth Press Gallery, and provides an opportunity for them to understand and contribute to the parliamentary decision-making process. It's an exciting opportunity for their voices to be heard."

There are over 80 events planned around the country during Youth Week - ranging from discussion forums with young people, concerts, art exhibitions and a youth health expo. For further information, see www.youthweek.co.nz
