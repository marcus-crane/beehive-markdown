A review of the sale and supply of liquor to under 18-year-olds is progressing well, with several key issues emerging, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today.  
Mr O'Connor and Justice Minister Mark Burton announced the review late last year, as a response to increased binge drinking among our youth.  
The review’s goals are to determine the harm caused by the sale and supply of liquor to minors, evaluate the effectiveness of current restrictions and develop proposals that might be necessary to address the causes of harm. This includes a review of the current provisions of the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 relating to the sale and supply to minors.  
During a speech at the Alcohol Advisory Council's 10th Working Together conference today, Mr O'Connor said initial feedback from the review steering group confirmed five key issues associated with underage drinking.

·New Zealand has a permissive environment and normalisation of youth drinking reinforced through alcohol availability, visibility, affordability, and advertising,  
·Alcohol is supplied largely by parents, peers, and other adults,  
·Unsupervised consumption of large quantities of alcohol take place on private premises and in public places,  
·Illegal sales to minors takes place, in particular from ‘problem’ retailers such as some grocery and bottle stores, and,  
·There is a small group of minors who consume large amounts of alcohol regularly.

Mr O'Connor said changing behaviour will rely on a range of initiatives, and the next steps in the review will look at developing a package of options.  
"The steering group will then develop policy options to address these issues and strengthen the existing legal and regulatory framework.

"Myself and Minister Burton are looking forward to the report which is due back within the next few months."  
Mr O'Connor said the Government was committed to reducing drinking among young New Zealanders, which all too often leads to tragic outcomes.
