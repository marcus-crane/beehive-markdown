Health Minister Pete Hodgson today launched the second edition a quality improvement programme for community-driven and governed primary health care services.

The Te Wana Quality Programme was launched by Healthcare Aotearoa in 2000 and is a national network of 55 healthcare providers that provide quality primary healthcare to more than 150,000 people.

Te Wana provides not just a framework for assessment but is an educational tool, ensures effective compliance with safety and health legislation and encourages a culture of innovation, responsiveness and quality improvement, Pete Hodgson says.

"I want to congratulate the staff and executive officers of HCA for getting this second edition of Te Wana endorsed recently by the Quality Improvement Council of Australasia," Pete Hodgson says.

"While New Zealand has been internationally recognised as having one of the best primary healthcare systems in the world, we must not forget the need to continuously improve quality so we can deliver improved health outcomes for all New Zealanders."
