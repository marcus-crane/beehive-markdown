Finance Minister Michael Cullen flies to Melbourne tomorrow to attend the Annual International CEO Forum.

"This is an important gathering of CEOs from major Australian companies, most of which have significant stakes in the New Zealand economy so I value the opportunity to explain our story to them," said Dr Cullen.

"Australia is our biggest source of investment so it is important to explain to those with such a valuable stake in our economy how this government is tackling key issues around improving productivity, raising skill levels and climate change.

"This year I will be emphasising how Budget 2007 improves the investment climate in New Zealand by bringing the company tax rate in line with Australia's and other measures such as help for research and development and expanded industry training."

Dr Cullen will deliver a speech at the forum luncheon on Wednesday.

During the visit the Minister will attend a Westpac Business Breakfast and meet other business leaders. He will also meet political leaders, including Hon John Brumby, Victorian Treasurer and Minister for Innovation, Industry and Regional Development and Peter Allen, deputy chair of the Australia and New Zealand School of Government and Victorian Under Secretary, Portfolio Services and Strategy Projects Division, Department of Human Services.
