Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her sorrow and that of the people of New Zealand at the passing of His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, the Head of State of Samoa.

“This is a day of great sadness for the nation of Samoa,” Helen Clark said.

“Through his long reign as Head of State, Malietoa represented Samoa with wisdom, humour and insight.

“He was Head of State from the time of Samoa’s independence from New Zealand 45 years ago, and at the time of his death, aged 94, was understood to be the world’s oldest national leader.

“He helped frame Samoa’s Constitution prior to Samoa’s independence from New Zealand in January 1962 and became joint Head of State at that time. From 1963, following the death of Tupua Tamasese Mea’ole, he became sole Head of State.

“Malietoa was educated at St Stephens School near Auckland. He was a great friend of New Zealand as Head of State, and was well known to successive New Zealand governments and diplomats.

“It is significant that New Zealand has a Treaty of Friendship with only one country- Samoa- and our shared unique relationship was due in no small part to Malietoa’s influence as a father of modern Samoa.

“New Zealanders of Samoan descent, together with their palagi counterparts, will be thinking of Samoa, at this sad time.

“Our thoughts go out to the people of Samoa,” Helen Clark said.

The Government will be in close touch with the Government of Samoa over coming days about the arrangements for his State Funeral.
