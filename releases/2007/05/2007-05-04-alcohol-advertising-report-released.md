Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor today released a report into alcohol advertising.

It comes out of a government-initiated review undertaken by a broad steering group of government agencies and health sector and Advertising Standards Authority representatives. The review looked at the regulatory framework for alcohol advertising to determine whether it was sufficiently aligned with the Government's alcohol policies and harm reduction objectives.

Mr O'Connor said more than 250 submissions were received, demonstrating a high level of interest in the subject.

"I believe that the review steering group canvassed the full range of possible responses, and the Government will be considering the recommendations and their practical implications very carefully.''

The report is an important piece of work and the Government has noted its recommendations, Mr O'Connor said.

"However, the report has significant implications for the sale and supply of alcohol to minors, which is also currently being reviewed. The Government will consider both sets of recommendations in tandem, after the sale and supply review is completed, expected by July," Mr O'Connor said.  
A key conclusion in the report is that alcohol advertising does play a role in shaping New Zealand’s drinking culture.  
“The steering group’s view is that research shows a small but significant association between the level of exposure to alcohol advertising and alcohol consumption. We know that alcohol advertising is only one of a number of factors influencing how alcohol is consumed, and alcohol-related harm, but we can’t ignore its impact,” Mr O’Connor said.  
The recommendations include:  
·strengthening the self-regulatory system, basing it on new legislative provisions to ensure that the system meets public policy goals,  
·widening the scope of the system to cover a broader range of marketing techniques across all media, including packaging, labelling, merchandising and all “in store” promotions and price promotions,  
·creating new formal powers to investigate breaches of the rules,  
·independently audited monitoring,  
·a planned programme of research based on the policy goals,  
·a review after two years to ensure sufficient progress is being made.

Mr O'Connor said there is now a six-week period for interested organisations and individuals to provide feedback on the report to the Ministry of Health.

Submissions should be provided to: susan\_edwards@moh.govt.nz
