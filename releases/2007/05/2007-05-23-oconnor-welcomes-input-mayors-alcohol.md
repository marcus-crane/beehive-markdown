Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today he welcomed the statement on youth drinking issued by New Zealand mayors yesterday.

Mayors called for action including an urgent review of New Zealand's liquor laws.

"I am very pleased our mayors are taking a stand on this serious and complex issue and have written to the mayoral forum asking for their input into the Government’s review of the sale and supply of liquor to minors, which is currently underway,” Mr O’Connor said.

“With the support of local government the Government’s aim of reducing the harm caused by underage drinking will not be such a hard nut to crack."

The review of the sale and supply of liquor to minors is due to report to Mr O'Connor and Justice Minister Mark Burton in July, and will be considered alongside recommendations from a review into rules around alcohol advertising.

The sale and supply of alcohol to minors review is working on policy options around five key issues:  
·New Zealand has a permissive environment and normalisation of youth drinking reinforced through alcohol availability, visibility, affordability, and advertising,  
·Alcohol is supplied largely by parents, peers, and other adults,  
·Unsupervised consumption of large quantities of alcohol take place on private premises and in public places,  
·Illegal sales to minors takes place, and,  
·There is a small group of minors who consume large amounts of alcohol regularly.

Mr O’Connor said that while the Government could make some progress, the biggest reduction in harm from binge drinking would come from individuals taking responsibility.

“Adults need to consider the example they are setting and teenagers have to stop and think about the consequences of their own behaviour. This is a message the Alcohol Advisory council has been advocating for some time."
