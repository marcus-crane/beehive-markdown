Jim Anderton, Leader of the Progressive Party and Associate Minister of Health, announced today an investment of $5.9 million over the next four years for a social marketing campaign to raise awareness of the risks of taking drugs and an online drug evidence database that will back it up.

“Since I took on the responsibility for the illicit drug portfolio in 2002 there has been a huge financial commitment and increased legislative control aimed at reducing the supply of dangerous new drugs like methamphetamine or 'P', as well as initiatives to address other substances like party pills and nitrous oxide," Jim Anderton said.

“Today’s announcement focuses on reducing the demand for drugs, and not just for the newer drugs but also for well-established drugs such as cannabis. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in this country and there appears to be a very troubling and overriding perception that it is harmless, when there is much research both here and abroad to the contrary.

“The harms and risks of taking cannabis and other drugs, especially dangerous ones like 'P', needs to be driven home, especially to the young. The funding I have secured as Progressive Leader for a social marketing campaign is aimed at doing just that.

“The campaign messages of risks and harm from drugs must be believable if they are going to help turn young people away from drugs and help people who have a drug use problem.

“To be believable, those messages must be based on the most up to date evidence and data on drugs. And funding has been set aside to develop an online drug data and information system to ensure we have that information to hand," Jim Anderton said.
