Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton is to host a meeting of primary industry leaders at Parliament tomorrow.

Jim Anderton said tomorrow's meeting was a chance for him and officials to update primary industry heads on the work that was undertaken after a meeting with the same group last year and hear from industry leaders about what more needs to be done. This will form the foundation of future work.

"One of the first things I did when I became Agriculture Minister was to get together with industry leaders to define clearly what was needed for their sectors to continue as the leading contributor to our economy and to increase their productivity and profitability in a sustainable way.

"As we discussed at last year's meeting, the primary industry sectors are facing significant economic and environmental sustainability challenges. We can only overcome these by working together.

"The Primary Industry Leaders Forum meeting would update around 50 industry leaders on progress on last year's priorities, brief them on Budget initiatives, and outline a preliminary agenda for the Primary Industries 2020 Summit to be held in November," Jim Anderton said.

"This Labour-Progressive Government recognises the important contribution the primary sectors make to the New Zealand economy, and that they will continue to play that crucial role well into the future. This year's Budget provides a number of measures which deliver benefits to the sectors and I want to make sure that industry leaders are well informed on those so they are better positioned to take advantage of them."
