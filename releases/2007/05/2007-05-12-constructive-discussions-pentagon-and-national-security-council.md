Defence Minister Phil Goff concluded his visit to Washington today with visits to the National Security Council (NSC) and the Pentagon. He met with National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley at the White House early this afternoon, and was welcomed with an Honour Guard at the Pentagon later in the afternoon.

"My discussions today with Stephen Hadley and Robert Gates covered a range of global and regional security issues", Mr Goff said.

"The focus particularly at the Pentagon was on the situation in Afghanistan where New Zealand's contribution alongside American and international forces was warmly welcomed.

"New Zealand's Provincial Reconstruction Team is widely regarded as a model for other international forces.

"I was briefed on the United States perspective on the progress of security and development efforts in Afghanistan, and was able to respond from my own experience in Kabul and Bamyan recently.

"We also discussed the situation in the Pacific and Timor Leste and concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation in Iran and North Korea.

"The security outlook for the world has changed fundamentally in the post-9/11 era and it makes sense for both countries to work together where we have common interests. Our joint efforts in Afghanistan and against terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are good examples of this.

"During my visit I also discussed with both the State Department (Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill) and the Department of Defence (Eric Edelman, Under Secretary of Defence) the proposed sale of military aircraft to the US.

"The US acknowledges that the problem in approving this transfer does not lie with New Zealand but rather with internal difficulties on their side. They have  
undertaken to come back to me on whether these difficulties can be resolved at an early point or whether we will need to look for alternatives.

"I received a warm welcome from both Secretary Gates and National Security Advisor Hadley, discussions with both were positive and constructive.

"This is consistent with the strengthening bilateral relationship with the United States, reflected in the welcome given to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, in March and Ambassador Bill McCormick's comments last week that the relationship was the best in decades.

"There remains a clear difference of views over the nuclear issue but both sides agree that this should not be a barrier to cooperation where we have common interests and to stronger relations between us", Mr Goff said.
