New stringent vehicle exhaust emission standards designed to improve air quality and public health are being proposed by the government.

Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard and Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven say the tougher standards would apply to vehicles when they are first registered for use on New Zealand roads. New vehicle imports would require a documentation check and used vehicle imports would be tested to ensure they meet the required standard. The new standards will not apply to vehicles already registered.

“Poor air quality resulting from harmful vehicle emissions can seriously affect people’s health,” the Ministers said.

A report produced in 2002 for the Ministry of Transport showed that around 400 people died prematurely each year from vehicle exhaust emissions.

Strengthening existing minimum vehicle emission standards is one of a package of measures the government is introducing to improve the environment. Other measures include promoting cleaner diesel fuel and the introduction of visible smoke checks as part of the Warrant of Fitness test.

‘‘Encouraging newer vehicle technologies not only improves air quality, but means that vehicles will generally be more fuel efficient and this can help reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,’’ said the Ministers.

Many countries, such as Japan and the United States, are updating their vehicle exhaust emissions standards to take advantage of improved emission control technologies and the availability of cleaner fuels.

“We want to make sure that New Zealand also benefits from the advances in technology and emissions standards introduced overseas,’’ said the Ministers.

The public are now being invited to make submissions on the new proposals which are planned to take effect on 1 January 2008.
