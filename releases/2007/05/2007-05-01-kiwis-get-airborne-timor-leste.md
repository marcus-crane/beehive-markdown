The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) helicopter detachment deployed to Timor Leste last month, flew their first operational mission this afternoon said Defence Minister Phil Goff.

"A RNZAF Iroquois transported part of a New Zealand infantry platoon from Dili to Baucau as part of a standard rotation of troops", said Mr Goff

"The New Zealand Iroquois detachment is based in Dili where they are operating from the Dili heliport, alongside their Australian counterparts.

"The Iroquois detachment is deployed to Timor Leste to provide transport support for the Australian-led Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) based in Dili. The rugged geography of Timor Leste combined with a poor road network makes aerial transport invaluable.

"New Zealand has been part of the CJTF since it deployed in 2006. There are currently over 900 Australians and 150 New Zealanders deployed to Timor Leste with the CJTF.

"In addition, two New Zealand Defence Force personnel and 25 NZ Police are in the country as part of the UN mission, and two NZDF personnel are attached to the Timorese Defence Force as advisors.

"New Zealand first became involved in peace support operations in Timor Leste as part of UN and regional operations in 1999 and this deployment builds on our efforts to assist Timor Leste's stability and security to allow it to progress its nation-building efforts", Phil Goff said.
