Auckland’s newest highway interchange at Esmonde Road, will be an important gateway to, and for, the North Shore communities, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark, accompanied by Transport Minister Annette King, officially opened the interchange during a special ceremony including a bus tour of the new loop, to mark the occasion.

The new $44 million Esmonde Road interchange, which has been completed on time and within budget, is the third major motorway project opened in Auckland in the past five months.

The other two interchanges were the Central Motorway Junction, opened in December last year, and the Highbrook Interchange, opened last month.

Helen Clark said the new road system would provide North Shore residents with more options for traveling by car, bike and foot, and provide valuable links for residential, commercial and educational communities.

Helen Clark congratulated Transit New Zealand and North Shore City Council for the partnership approach to the upgrade.

“This interchange will make it easier for people and goods to move around Auckland and relieve congestion in the Auckland region. Reducing congestion and travel times also helps reduce emissions from vehicles. Almost 20 per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions currently come from transport.

“The upgrade meets the government’s goals of social, economic and environmental sustainability. The interchange, as part of the broader Northern Busway project, will help secure Auckland’s place as a world-class international city.”

Annette King said it is essential to solve traffic problems in Auckland to ensure the city continues to develop economically and as a place to live.

“That is why most of the state highway construction budget allocated in the past year is being spent in Auckland, but investingin roads is not enough by itself. This year the government is investing more than $450 million in public transport. Over the next five years, total government investment in public transport will top $1.9 billion. This unprecedented investment is essential to develop public transport systems that are affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable for all those people who want to use them.”

Ms King said the interchange provided numerous benefits, including relieving congestion for local traffic; enabling pedestrians and cyclists to cross a busy stretch of road; improving access to AUT’s Akoranga campus; and forming part of the Northern Busway project, New Zealand's first purpose built road dedicated to bus passenger transport.
