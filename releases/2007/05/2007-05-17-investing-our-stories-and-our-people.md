Budget 2007 delivers significant new investment into Mâori broadcasting as part of the government's on-going drive to build and share knowledge about our people, language and lives, Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.

The government recognises the need to sustain our unique Mâori culture and values as part of its goal to retain and enrich our national identity. Mâori broadcasting plays a vital role in this process, Mr Horomia said.

As vehicles for transmitting our ideas, initiatives and success stories the government believes Mâori Television and iwi radio will also play an active role in building a sustainable economy and strengthening our whânau.

"I'm pleased to announce that Budget 2007 includes $27.1 million in new operating and capital funding for Vote Mâori Affairs over the next four years to specifically strengthen the government's commitment to Mâori broadcasting.

"Included in this total is an additional $20.1 million in operating funding for Mâori Television and $3 million in capital funding. The extra funding recognises the increasing success of Mâori Television and provides a platform to support its plan to move to digital television. It will also be used to add new programming content and to establish infrastructure for expanded broadcasts," he said.

An additional $4 million over the next four years will be invested in the iwi radio network to enable it to continue to provide a high quality service.

"The Mâori broadcasting funding completes a four year programme of strengthening the industry and positions it well for the digital era," Mr Horomia said.
