Prime Minister Helen Clark and Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today expressed sorrow at the death of Maori broadcaster Henare Te Ua.

"Henare Te Ua (Ngati Porou) was a wonderful broadcaster with a gentle personality and the ability to bring people together across cultures, " Helen Clark said.

Henare Te Ua was acknowledged for his skills as a radio commentator on public occasions, which included the funeral of the Maori King, King Koroki and the crowning of Te Arikinui Te Atairangi Kaahu. He also gave a live broadcast from New York at the opening of the Te Maori exhibition in 1984.

"Henare Te Ua made an important and valuable contribution to Maori arts and broadcasting, in Auckland and across New Zealand," said Judith Tizard.

His radio career spanned four decades and for over seven years his programme, WHENUA!, was broadcast weekly on National Radio.

"New Zealand valued and acknowledged the important contribution he made to this country. In 1990 Henare Te Ua was awarded the Queen's Commendation Medal and two years later he received the Queen's Service Medal, " said Helen Clark.

"In 2002 Henare was awarded Te Waka Toi's Sir Kingi Ihaka Award for his contribution to Maori arts, and the following year he was made a companion of the Auckland War Memorial Museum."

Judith Tizard said, "He was a courageous and energetic Kaumatua for the New Zealand AIDS Foundation from its establishment."

Helen Clark and Judith Tizard extended their deepest sympathy to Henare's partner, family and friends.
