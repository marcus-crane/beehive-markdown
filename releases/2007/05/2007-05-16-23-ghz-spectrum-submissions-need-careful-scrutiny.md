The proposed late-May auction of spectrum for the 2.3 GHz spectrum band has been temporarily deferred while the government considers submissions on the proposal, Communications Minister David Cunliffe says.

"The issues are complex and we are carefully considering submissions received from stakeholders," Mr Cunliffe said.

"A further announcement regarding the auction of radio spectrum in the 2.3 GHz band is likely to be made by the end of May."

On 10 April, the minister [called for submissions](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28946) on the proposed auction of rights in the 2.3 GHz band, which would be used for broadband wireless access (BWA) services.
