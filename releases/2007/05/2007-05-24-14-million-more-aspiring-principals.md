Encouraging upcoming school leaders to become principals is the focus of a $1.4 million investment in a pilot for aspiring and potential school principals highlighted by Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey today announced further details of the '[Aspiring Principals](http://www.nzplc.net.nz/) Pilot', included in Budget 2007, in a speech to the Greater Wellington [Secondary Principals Association Conference](http://www.spanz.school.nz/).

“Strong professional leadership of our school principals is vital and the Labour-led governments vision for professional leadership sets out a clear direction for school culture, teacher development, creativity, and student learning.

“Building the capability of aspiring and potential principals will ensure quality learning environments, so that students are well equipped for the knowledge economy of the 21st century.

"This pilot will be carried out across the country next year and will help aspiring and potential principals build their management knowledge, develop a high level understanding of the curriculum and make sure local schools shape expectations and future opportunities.

"The results of the 'Aspiring Principals Pilot' will be used to plan recruiting of, and career development for principals.

"The pilot is part of a wider piece of work under the 'Kiwi Leadership' Initiative.

"This initiative aims to strengthen professional leadership in all schools. The Ministry of Education has been consulting with schools and is producing a draft discussion document of the overall vision for Kiwi Leadership."
