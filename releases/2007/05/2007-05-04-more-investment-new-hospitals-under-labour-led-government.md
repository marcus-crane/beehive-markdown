The new Surgical Services Unit at Burwood Hospital is a further example of this Labour-led Government's on-going commitment to capital investment in the health system, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

"The Surgical Services Unit has been completed on schedule and within budget at $21.5 million. I am proud that this Labour-led Government continues to invest in our public health infrastructure."

"Burwood Hospital has a very proud history both within the region of Canterbury and nationally, offering unique but highly essential services to the population," Pete Hodgson says.

The first stage of the redevelopment – completed in 2002 – included redevelopment of the Spinal Injuries Unit and cost $6 million.

Labour MP for Christchurch East, Lianne Dalziel, was delighted to see the second of the planned three stages completed.

"The new development will improve service standards and patient care and, importantly, provide the capacity needed to deliver the additional elective orthopaedic surgical services required by the Government’s orthopaedic initiative," Lianne Dalziel says.

The facilities that have been developed are:

An operating suite of four theatres  
A recovery area including an eight bed post anaesthetic care unit (PACU)

A post-operative orthopaedic ward facility

Enhancement of orthopaedic outpatients facility.
