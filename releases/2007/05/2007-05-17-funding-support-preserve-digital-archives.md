Budget funding of $8.5 million over four years will enable Archives NZ to work on archiving ‘born digital’ materials

Budget funding of $8.5 million over four years will enable Archives New Zealand to develop a strategy for archiving ‘born digital’ materials, material that originated in a digital environment.

“A portion of the $8.5 million has been earmarked to develop a Digital Archives Preservation Strategy and to replace Archives' 16 year-old file location and tracking system, and other key systems,” said Judith Tizard, Minister Responsible for Archives New Zealand.

“These developments will help ensure that New Zealanders have access to our government archives and national treasures - especially ‘born digital’ materials.

“As we move further along the digital highway many more records are created in a digital environment and quality systems are essential to ensure these records are captured so they are useable both now and in the future. We want to ensure electronic public records are appropriately maintained by government agencies and are accessible as public archives for as long as they are needed.

“The Digital Archives Preservation Strategy will ensure New Zealand communities can appreciate and value their own local identity, our national identity and be visible internationally in the digital world well into the future. It also contributes to the government’s wider Digital Content Strategy," Judith Tizard said.

The new strategy will be developed in consultation with the National Library, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the State Services Commission.

Funding has also been approved for a programme to better manage ministers’ and security-classified papers, which will identify sensitive information in ministers’ records, classify and archive them appropriately. As the country’s leaders, it is important for current and future generations to be able to access these documents as necessary.
