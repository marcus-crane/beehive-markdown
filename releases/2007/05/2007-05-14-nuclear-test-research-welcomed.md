Veteran’s Affairs Minister Rick Barker today welcomed new Massey University research on the exposure of New Zealand naval personnel to nuclear testing in the Pacific.

“The government is open to new information and analysis which gives us insight into the health effects of exposure to nuclear tests conducted by the British Government in 1957/58 as part of Operation Grapple,” said Rick Barker.

“This government has made a commitment to monitor national and international research into the health of nuclear test veterans and their children and this research, which has been supported by the New Zealand Government, is a welcome addition,” said Rick Barker.

New Zealand Nuclear Test veterans are able to access War Disablement Pensions for any disability that they believe is attributable to or aggravated by their service in Operation Grapple or in observing at the Nuclear Tests at Mururoa.

Rick Barker encourages any Nuclear Test Veteran who has a disability they believe is attributable to, or aggravated by, their service to apply for a War Disablement Pension. If a pension is awarded then all medical care for that disability will be fully funded.
