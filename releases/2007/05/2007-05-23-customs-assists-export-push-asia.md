Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says the [New Zealand Customs Service](http://www.customs.govt.nz/default.htm) will play a key role in supporting the export push into Asia and is contributing to the government's economic transformation agenda.

Yesterday Trade Minister Phil Goff announced major plans for the expansion of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise offices into China, India and Asia, as part of the government's Export Year initiatives.

"We set up a Customs office in Beijing 18 months ago to reflect the growing importance of China as a trading partner and the increasing numbers of travellers between the two countries," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"The office provides a key contact point for [our traders seeking to export](http://www.customs.govt.nz/exporters/default.htm) to China and can assist them with tariff and other import requirements."

The Minister said that Customs were also working closely with China Customs on drug and intellectual property enforcement issues.

"We've also developed a close working relationship with China Customs and other Chinese government agencies over this time."

"I am proud that the NZ Customs Service is helping to facilitate the expansion of our export markets and are contributing to the broader economic transformation agenda of this Labour-led government."
