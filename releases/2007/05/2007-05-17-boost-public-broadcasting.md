The Labour-led government continues its commitment to strengthening public broadcasting in Budget 2007, raising total investment in broadcasting to $150.2 million this year.

"This represents a 78 per cent increase since 2001/02," said Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

"NZ on Air will get an increase of $8 million over the next four years to develop programmes for the digital environment, and produce high quality local television.

"Funding will also go to Radio New Zealand, with a $521,000 investment to extend transmission coverage to low density population areas, and a further $4.6 million over the next four years for core services," he said.

Budget 2007 also includes previously announced funding for digital television, including $25 million over five years to the Freeview consortium, and $79 million over six years for digital services at TVNZ.

"New Zealanders can actually start accessing free-to-air digital television, since the launch of Freeview earlier this month.

"Public broadcasting showcases our unique culture, giving all of us a chance to share in our diverse nation. That's why the Labour-led government is committed to supporting a strong broadcasting sector with high-quality public broadcasting and access to locally-produced television, radio and music," Mr Maharey said.
