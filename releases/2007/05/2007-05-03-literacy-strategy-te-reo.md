A strategy launched today aims to increase literacy in te reo in Mâori medium education, says Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia.

Mr Horomia today launched Te Reo Matatini Mâori Medium Literacy Strategy.  
It is a planning document developed to support organisations and schools ranging from kôhanga through to tertiary level, which provide Mâori medium education programmes.

Te Reo Matatini literally translates as the many faces of the language. In Te Reo Matatini the concept of literacy is expanded from speech and writing to understanding context and ability in all subjects from science, technology and numeracy to dance, images, stories and relationships, Mr Horomia said.

"The strategy has been developed through a combined effort with representatives of the Mâori medium sector over the last 15 months. It is intended to support sector stakeholders to align their strategic priorities by identifying current and future needs through a shared vision. It will help students realise their potential and achieve excellence in Mâori medium education. "

"It is very important that whânau, kaiako and teaching and learning communities in Mâori medium education provide high quality literacy opportunities that are fun, motivating, challenging, and are connected to mokopuna and students’ experiences, contexts and interests."
