New Zealand families will benefit from a range of initiatives in Budget 2007, which underlines the Labour-led government's commitment to strengthen the community sector, and provide greater support for young people at risk.

Over $27 million is being invested in a range of initiatives to strengthen families, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

Funding of $20.4 million over the next two years will be provided to further enhance the ability of community organisations to deliver services that support New Zealand’s children and families.

"The Ministry of Social Development is currently developing with the NGO sector the Pathway to Partnership strategy, which aims to build child and family services. The funding will be used to implement the first stages of the strategy.

"The development and implementation of a specific long term strategy to improve child, family and community services recognises the vital role that community based organisations play in supporting Kiwi families.

The government is also contributing nearly $2.6 million over the next year to social work services for the nine secondary schools involved in the Health Community Schools project.

Budget 2007 also provides:

- $3.4 million over the next four years to boost support for schools dealing with gang issues in Counties Manukau.
- $700,000 over the next year to further support mentoring programmes for young people. The Turn Your Life Around (TYLA) and Project K programmes are helping young people who are at risk of not achieving their full potential by supporting them to make better decisions about their future.
