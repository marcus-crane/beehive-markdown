"Youth Minister Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated the winning students in the 2007 Global Enterprise Experience business competition.

"It's great to see students working together across the globe – and experiencing and managing differences in culture, language and world views," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The international team of six students from New Zealand, Germany, Rwanda, and Macau (People's Republic of China) beat off competition from 650 students from across 34 countries.

"I am also pleased to see the focus on issues that foster future thinking on sustainability".

"My congratulations to the winning team and all those who participated, as well as the organisers - students from Victoria University's School of Marketing and International Business."
