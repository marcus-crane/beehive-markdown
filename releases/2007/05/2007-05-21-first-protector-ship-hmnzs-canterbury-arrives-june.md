Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today that the first of the Navy’s seven new Project Protector Ships, the Multi role vessel Canterbury, will arrive in New Zealand on 28 June.

"There are three key steps prior to Canterbury beginning working life at the Devonport Naval Base; acceptance, commissioning and arrival in its homeport and the dates for these events can now be confirmed", said Mr Goff.

"The acceptance of the vessel by the Ministry of Defence from the shipbuilders and the subsequent hand over to the Royal New Zealand Navy will take place in Melbourne on Thursday May 31, when Defence Secretary John McKinnon will formally accept the ship from Tenix on behalf of the government.

"On Tuesday June 12 the vessel will be commissioned into the Royal New Zealand Navy and formally become HMNZS Canterbury. The crew will then finalise preparations ahead of the ship’s departure from Melbourne for New Zealand.

"HMNZS Canterbury will arrive at its home port of Lyttleton on Thursday 28 June. She will remain alongside for four days during which a variety of welcome events will be held, including an open day for the public and the ship’s company parading through Christchurch to accept the freedom of the city.

"From Lyttleton HMNZS Canterbury will sail to Timaru for a brief visit between 4 – 6 July before heading to the Devonport Naval Base where it will be based.

"Planning for the arrival of HMNZS Canterbury is already underway and a detailed activity schedule for the port visits will be released by the Navy nearer to the date of each event", said Mr Goff.
