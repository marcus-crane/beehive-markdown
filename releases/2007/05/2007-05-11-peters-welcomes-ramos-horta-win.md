Foreign Minister Winston Peters has welcomed news that Timor-Leste Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta appears to have scored a landslide victory in Presidential elections.

“While the final result has not yet been declared, the initial vote count shows Jose Ramos-Horta has won the Presidency by a wide margin, and New Zealand congratulates him for that," Mr Peters said.

"We have enjoyed a constructive relationship with Mr Ramos-Horta during his time as Foreign Minister and then as Prime Minister. We look forward to working him in his new role, and supporting him in the difficult task of strengthening Timor-Leste’s young and fragile democracy."

Initial counts show Mr Ramos-Horta has won around 70 per cent of the vote in the Presidential run-off against Francisco Lu-olo Guterres. They were the two highest-polling candidates in the first round of elections on 9 April.

Mr Peters also praised the calm that prevailed in Timor-Leste during the election, and the improvements that were made in the conduct of the poll.

“It was heartening to see such a high turnout, with an estimated 82 percent of registered voters casting their ballots in the second round.

“The Timorese authorities deserve congratulating for the considerable improvements they made in the logistical and operational procedures, after problems with the first round of voting.

“We now hope that the peaceful and orderly atmosphere that prevailed during voting for the president will be maintained for the rest of the electoral process, particularly when the final result is announced and when parliamentary elections are held next month,” Mr Peters said.
