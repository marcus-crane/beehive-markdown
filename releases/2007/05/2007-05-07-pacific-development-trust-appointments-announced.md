The Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Hon Phil Goff, has announced six appointments to the Pacific Development and Conservation Trust (the Trust).

"The Trust funds projects that promote sustainable development in the South Pacific, while conserving the natural environment and cultural heritage of its peoples. The trust's net income is made available each year for groups in New Zealand and the South Pacific to use for charitable purposes", said Mr Goff.

"The New Zealand Government established the Trust in 1989 with funds that were received from France in 1986 in recognition of events surrounding the destruction of the vessel Rainbow Warrior.

"I have reappointed David Bamford, Dermot Gordon, and Suli Tuvuki as Advisory Trustees to the Trust in addition to appointing three Advisory Trustees; Patricia Webster, Karlo Mila-Schaaf, and Rob Fenwick. Esther Cowley-Malcolm will continue in her role as Chair.

"Rob Fenwick has extensive experience in environtmenal issues, waste management and conservation. Patricia Webster brings to the Trust significant international aid and development experience and Karlo Mila-Schaaf has experience in Pacific policy and Pacific health issues.

"The three new Trustees have sound governance experience and bring a variety of specialist skills and experiences which will be invaluable to the Trust", said Phil Goff.
