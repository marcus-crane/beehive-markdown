An Environmental Risk Management Authority decision to relax controls on how petrol is handled on farms shows the Government is listening to the concerns of the rural community, Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor says.

ERMA's decision this month means a farmer does not have to be approved to handle petrol, as long as the farm is larger than four hectares and the quantity of petrol stored is less than 2000 Litres.

Mr O'Connor said ERMA should be congratulated for making this sensible and well-considered decision.

"It's an excellent and pragmatic decision which demonstrates the Government and agencies are listening. The approved handler requirement would have imposed significant costs for little benefit.

"While farmers will now not have to be approved handlers, Health and Safety requirements mean they should already be adequately trained and familiar with the hazards posed by petrol.

"It is also true that the dispensing of petrol on farms is relatively straightforward and fuel is likely to be stored in remote locations on larger farms. There is no history or pattern of serious incidents involving petrol on farms.

"We must remember, however, that the farm environment presents many hazards, and we must continue to make sensible decisions to improve safety across the board."

The decision was made under the provisions of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act.
