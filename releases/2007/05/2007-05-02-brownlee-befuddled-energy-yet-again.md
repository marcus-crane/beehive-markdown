Gerry Brownlee has made yet another fumbling and failed attempt to engage with his energy portfolio, Energy Minister David Parker said today.

"National's Gerry Brownlee has worked himself into a lather, because the government has announced a board of inquiry into electricity transmission."

"What he doesn't seem to understand, is that this is a standard procedure for consulting the public, when a new National Policy Statement under the Resource Management Act is being devised."

"Mr Brownlee has misunderstood the process, and seems to think it's an investigation into the Electricity Commission."

"This board of inquiry has nothing to do with the Electricity Commission, and it's a bit of worry that Mr Brownlee doesn’t know that," David Parker said.

"In fact the board is consulting the public, as it sets environmental standards for local authorities to follow with regard to transmission lines in their area."

"The government is working hard to keep the lights on, while Mr Brownlee is floundering around in the dark."
