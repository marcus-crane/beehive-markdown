Energy Ministers met today (29 May) in Darwin for the 8th APEC meeting of Energy Ministers.

"The Darwin Declaration, signed today, outlines steps to enable the region to achieve energy security and sustainable development through energy efficiency, conservation and diversity of supply, with a strong focus on low emissions technologies," Energy Minister David Parker said.

Prime Minister Helen Clark’s leadership on this issue at the 2006 Ha Noi Leaders Meeting has played an important role in climate change being advanced on the wider APEC agenda.

“There has been a very significant shift within APEC energy discussions. Climate change considerations now have increased priority alongside traditional energy security concerns. We are proud of New Zealand’s leadership in pushing these discussions forward,” said David Parker.

Ministers agreed unanimously to place increased emphasis on the role of efficiency, alternative fuels and the development of cleaner energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Collectively, the 21 APEC economies represent just over 41% of the world’s population and around 60% of world energy demand. Heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels raises both energy security and climate change concerns.

“New Zealand’s high proportion of renewable electricity and policies to encourage energy efficiency show we are well positioned to meet the challenges of energy security and climate change.

“The APEC and International Energy Agency (IEA) transport energy recommendations on public transport, vehicle efficiency and transport fuel substitution are consistent with the approach the New Zealand government is pursuing through the New Zealand Energy Strategy," David Parker said.
