160,000 New Zealand families would miss out on tax credits if National were ever to be in government, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The Minister was referring to John Key's announcement that he will repeal the recent extension to [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz) and spend it on tax cuts.

"Working for Families tax credits that are currently going to middle and low income families would be redistributed under National. Instead the money would be given to the rich in the form of tax cuts," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Under National an estimated 160,000 families would lose about $50 per week. Currently, a Kiwi family earning $52,000 per year with 3 children and a mortgage are eligible for $246.00 per week under Working for Families. Under a National government that family would lose some $80 per week.

"Working for Families tax credits have lifted an estimated 70,000 children over the income poverty threshold. New Zealand is expected to move from 18th place on the UNICEF Innocenti Report Card into the top half and possibly into the top quartile in terms of reduction in child poverty.

"The Labour-led government is targeting tax credits where they are needed most – to families with children.

"It's appalling that National would place thousands of children back into poverty in order to top up the bank accounts of their rich mates," said Mr Benson-Pope.
