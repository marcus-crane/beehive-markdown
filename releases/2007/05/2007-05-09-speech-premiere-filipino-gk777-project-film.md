Speech at premiere of Filipino GK777 project film

Newmarket Village Sky City Cinemas,  
Auckland

Greetings to you all. Thank-you to the organisers of tonight's event and welcome to New Zealand Tony Meloto. It was wonderful to hear you speak with such integrity, passion and vision for a better world.

Thank you for allowing me, as a representative of the New Zealand Government to attend this premiere and promotion of the Gawad Kalinga project.

As we have already heard the Filipino community of New Zealand has contributed greatly to the [Gawad Kalinga](http://www.gawadkalinga.org) development, including fundraising for the building of four villages. This is something that has benefited people back in the Philippines, but has had the additional benefit of bringing the community together in New Zealand. As Tony said this project is not just about building houses, it's about building communities and that is true between our nations. The Filipino community has embraced New Zealand as their adopted country, while preserving and celebrating your own culture and traditions and maintaining a consciousness about the progress of your country of origin and the people there.

Congratulations and well done to all of you who have dedicated your time and energy to raising money for this very courageous and ambitious project that demonstrates the great things people can achieve when they put their minds to it.

I am sure that all of you, like me, are looking forward being informed and inspired by Paraiso: Three Stories of Hope.
