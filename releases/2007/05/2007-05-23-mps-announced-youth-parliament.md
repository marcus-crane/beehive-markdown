Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the names of the 121 Youth MPs and 10 Youth Press Gallery members from around the country who will come together for Youth Parliament 2007 in July.

"Youth Parliament provides an exciting opportunity for these Youth MPs to understand and influence the parliamentary decision-making process. It gives them the chance to express their views to politicians, government officials and the public," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"We need their voices to be heard and we in turn need to ensure that we listen to the positive voices of young people.

"Young people make up 1 in 5 of our population and they are our future leaders. It's important that they are encouraged to contribute to decisions that affect their communities and the country, and to vote in local and central government elections.

"Among the Youth MPs selected is Zoe Donald, daughter of the late Rod Donald, who has been selected by Green Party Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons. Zoe will get first-hand experience of her father's work during his many years as an MP.

"The Pakuranga College students, Jenny Suo and Anna Devathasan, who discovered that the actual vitamin C levels in ready-to-drink Ribena, will also be attending.

"Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson has chosen Kaitlyn Gulland, from the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre. Kaitlyn shows us that a disability is not a barrier to being an active citizen."

"I'm looking forward to working with all the Youth MPs and to the energy and views they will bring to Parliament. My congratulations to them all on their selection.

"These candidates all bring with them an abundance of talent and diversity that reflects the new face of New Zealand."

Youth Press Gallery members will duplicate the Parliamentary Press Gallery and report their stories in the mainstream media.
