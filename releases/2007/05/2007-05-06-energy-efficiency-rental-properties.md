The government wants landlords of low-income tenants to come forward to claim a subsidy to help make their rental properties more energy efficient.

Since February, the government has made a 55 percent subsidy available to landlords to install insulation and other energy efficiency measures in their properties, provided their tenants are eligible for community services cards.

Over 500 landlords have applied for the subsidy – which is worth around $1,000 – but funding is available for up to 1,500 more. The deadline for applications is 31 May.

"We know that the same steps we take to make our homes more environmentally friendly and energy efficient will also make them much healthier for our families," Energy Minister David Parker said.

The landlord subsidy programme run jointly by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority and the New Zealand Property Investors' Federation has already seen 500 low-income families set to benefit through improved insulation, hot water cylinder wraps and energy efficient light bulbs.

Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons, said it was important that more eligible landlords come forward to claim the subsidy before the end of the month. "Taking advantage of this offer will improve the value of their properties and improve the lives of their tenants."

"More than 300,000 New Zealand homes have little or no insulation. With encouragement from the Green Party, the government has made additional funding available to upgrade many of these unhealthy and energy inefficient properties."

Property owners interested in the landlord subsidy programme should contact Eco Insulation Ltd on (09) 477 0270 and the NZPIF (03) 357 9243.

**Background:**

The landlord subsidy programme is just one aspect of the government's work to improve the energy efficiency of New Zealand homes. EECA's Energywise home grants programme has already seen 30,000 homes built before 1978 (when mandatory insulation was introduced) properly insulated and retrofitted. Housing New Zealand's Healthy Homes programme has seen 4,500 state house tenants benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.

In addition, the government this week unveiled the biggest changes in 30 years to energy efficiency requirements for new homes, that will see greater use of insulation and double glazing and much more affordable installation of solar water heating systems.

**Eligibility requirements for the landlord subsidy programme:**

There are several criteria the landlord, the rental property and the tenant need to meet before they can apply for the 55% subsidy:

- The tenants in the rental properties must be on a low income and eligible for a community services card
- Landlords must be a member of the NZPIF and can join to get the subsidy. Membership costs between $100 and $200
- Applications for this offer must be received by 31 May 2007
- The property must have been built before 1978 when mandatory insulation was introduced
- The property should have insufficient ceiling and/or underfloor insulation
- The tenant named on the tenancy agreement must be eligible for a community services card
- Rent must not be raised within six months of receiving the subsidy.
