"A fishing agreement between New Zealand and the Solomon Islands formalises friendly ties regarding fisheries between the two Pacific nations," Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton announced at the signing ceremony today.

The agreement formalises access to New Zealand flagged vessels to fish in the Solomon Islands’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under licences issued by the Solomon’s Government.

Jim Anderton said both governments want to promote cooperation in fisheries. This agreement follows a provisional arrangement that was developed in 2004 for New Zealand flagged vessels to fish in Solomon Islands waters.

“The Solomon Islands’ Government wants to develop the fisheries in its EEZ to benefit its people. As neighbours in the Pacific, New Zealand fishing companies are well-placed to help with fisheries expertise," Jim Anderton said.

New Zealand flagged vessels fishing in Solomon waters must adhere to the Solomon Islands Fisheries Act, but the agreement signed today means that this is also backed up by the New Zealand Fisheries Act.

“The agreement gives our Government a role in ensuring New Zealand flagged vessels play by the rules of other fishing nations when fishing in their waters," Jim Anderton said. "We want to ensure that New Zealand companies build on their already good reputation for being responsible international citizens.”
