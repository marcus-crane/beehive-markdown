A new website called ActiveSmart, which aims to get New Zealanders more active was officially launched at Parliament today.

Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the site, saying that regular physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.

"Our government is committed to ensuring that every New Zealander has the opportunity to benefit from being physically active. ActiveSmart is one of many tools now available to Kiwis to encourage a healthy, long life, with less risk of injury."

"It is well known that time constraints and injury are the biggest reasons people stop physical activity, so removing the injury barrier helps to increase participation in sport and other activities," says Trevor Mallard.

The website, which creates free personalised, tailored fitness and nutritional plans for those who register, has so far attracted an average of one thousand new registrants every week.

Pete Hodgson, Minister of Health, spoke about the partnership between the Ministry of Health and ACC in creating this resource.

"I'm very pleased at this cross-government approach to prevent injuries and generally improve the health and quality of life of New Zealanders. It is by using tools such as ActiveSmart to monitor our activity levels that we will start to overcome this major health issue."

"There's no doubt that New Zealanders are heeding the message to be more active," said ACC Minister Ruth Dyson, "However without the right preparation there are many people suffering injuries when they return to sports or exercise after a long break."

In the year ending June 2006, 360,000 people made claims to ACC after being injured while taking part in sport and recreational activities. About 21,000 were moderate to serious injuries and 74 people died from their injuries. ACC estimates that at least one in eight people taking part in sport and recreation get injured every year.

New Zealanders lead the rest of the world in searching for fitness and conditioning material on the Internet. More web searches for 'obesity, fat, hydration, fitness programmes, skiing and rugby training' come from New Zealand than any other country.

Today's event was the offical launch of the site, which has been running for six weeks. In that time the site has been visited by 26,000 people with over 6000 creating their own tailored programmes. Statistics from the site show that 70 percent of those who logged in were female and 66 percent of those who logged in felt that they had a poor level of fitness.

The site features optional email programme reminders, regional events and weather updates and video footage of correct stretching techniques.
