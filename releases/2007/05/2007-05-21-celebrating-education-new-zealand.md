Education Minister Steve Maharey today visited Ngaio School in Wellington to  
mark the beginning of the New Zealand Principal’s Federation “celebrating education in New Zealand” week.

“The week is about celebrating the excellence of our schools, and also praising our students and teachers," Steve Maharey said.

This year schools all around the country will organise their own activities for the week. The Federation has suggested that schools encourage their students to write letters to their local newspapers about what is great at their school. Topics that teachers have suggested include:

- my favourite thing about school is …
- school is cool because …
- we need to go to school because…
- what I learnt yesterday …

Ngaio School is celebrating the week by focusing on their theme for the term - 'being prepared'. The school is using activities across the curriculum to focus on preparing for emergencies and will have a school-wide evacuation during the term.

Throughout the week the NZ Principals Federation is also encouraging schools to hold open days for family and community members, parent information sessions, 'meet your new board evenings', and community displays about schools.

"These open days are a great opportunity for parents to become more involved in their children's learning.

"Research shows that when parents, families and whanau are involved children have a much better chance of succeeding in their education," Steve Maharey said.
