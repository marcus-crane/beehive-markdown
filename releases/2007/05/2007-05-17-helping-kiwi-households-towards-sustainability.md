A household sustainability programme will make it easier for Kiwi households to improve their lifestyles, keep New Zealand’s environment clean and green, and help fight climate change, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"At an individual level, it is easy to think that problems like climate change are so huge that there’s nothing we can do about them. But there are many things that people can do that will make a difference, and this programme will help them to take action," Mr Benson-Pope said.

The programme, first [announced by the Prime Minister in February](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/HomepageFeature.aspx?id=32), has $6 million of funding over the next three years. The funding will be used to help households to identify practical steps to cut their electricity and petrol bills, make their homes warmer and cheaper to run, and cut back on their water use and waste.

"Working with local government and local communities will form a big part of this programme, and we’ll be engaging directly with communities to find out how the government can help them.

The programme will set up a new Internet portal to provide information and help community-based groups to network.

The new website will be provide information and links to assistance schemes like the Energy Wise Homes programme. It will also be a place for people to share their success stories and experiences, and to link with others who are working to make their communities a better place.

The announcement of an investment of $3 million operating and $1.6 million capital in public recycling facilities around the country will also support the household sustainability programme.

"Household recycling is an everyday activity for Kiwis now. What’s currently missing are the facilities for people, including tourists, to recycle while they’re out and about.”

The network of bins will be rolled out progressively in larger cities and major tourist spots over the next three years, in partnership with local government.
