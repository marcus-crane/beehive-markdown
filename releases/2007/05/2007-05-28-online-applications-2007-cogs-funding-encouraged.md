Community and voluntary organisations are urged to get in early and apply online when this year’s Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS) funding round opens on June 1, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“COGS supports groups that in turn support the marginalised and disadvantaged in our society. I would encourage any group that feels it can contribute in this way to find out if it’s eligible for assistance and, if appropriate go online and apply,” said Laban.

Interested groups are encouraged to visit GrantsOnLine (www.cdgo.govt.nz) and take advantage of recent enhancements to the online COGS application process.

The updated site now offers helpful prompts to ensure information is easily understood and applications are quickly and efficiently completed.

“Groups working at a grassroots level make an extraordinary difference to their communities and deserve clear access to information about funding.

“This successful modern funding scheme is driven by the community and fuelled by volunteers, all of whom are dedicated to building strong, sustainable and connected communities throughout New Zealand,” said Laban.

Any not for profit organisation delivering community services or running community based projects can apply for a grant towards running costs. The average grant is $3000.

COGS is run by 37 volunteer local distribution committees which represent New Zealand’s diverse communities. The committees are supported by the Department of Internal Affairs.

Although the easiest way is to apply for a COGS grant is online. Those without web access can phone 0800 824 824 between 8am and 5pm Monday to Friday. Also attached is a contact list of Department of Internal Affairs Regional Advisors who will be able to help.
