Prime Minister Helen Clark and New Zealand Public Service Association (PSA) President Keith Gutsell today launched the Partnership for Quality 3 agreement.

The agreement builds on the two previous agreements, and provides a framework to achieve the shared goal of the parties to develop an innovative, high performing public service.

The Partnership for Quality 3 is a partnership between Government and the PSA, and was developed in conjunction with the State Services Commission.

Helen Clark said that the third agreement seeks to ensure fair workplaces for public service staff and to demonstrate our joint commitment to building a world-class public service.

“The Labour-led Government has a positive and constructive relationship with the PSA. All three Partnership for Quality agreements reinforce our commitment to delivering high quality public services.

“Our government believes that the public sector has a vital role to play in promoting opportunity and security for all New Zealanders. To deliver strong public services, we need highly engaged public servants who get fair recognition for their work and talents,” Helen Clark said.

PSA President Keith Gutsell said the partnership's aim is to find the most effective and efficient ways of turning resources into the services that New Zealanders need.

“The agreement develops a culture of resolving problems in positive ways. It drives a cultural shift within the public sector, in the direction of high-quality jobs delivering high quality services.

“It goes further than its predecessors by specifically spelling out how creative partnerships can be achieved at all levels of an organisation,” he said.
