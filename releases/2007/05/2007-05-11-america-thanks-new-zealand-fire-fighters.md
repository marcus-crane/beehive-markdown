An engraved fire-fighting axe and commemorative plaque was handed to Trade Minister Phil Goff in Washington today by Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns.

The occasion was in honour of the role of New Zealand firefighters, who along will colleagues from Australia, Canada and Mexico, helped combat forest fires in the United States in 2006. Fires have destroyed over 9 million hectares of forest and scrubland in the US in recent years.

“The two Secretaries expressed their strong appreciation for the assistance given to the United States by New Zealand through its firefighters on repeated occasions,” Mr Goff said.

“Our willingness to assist at a time of need is seen as evidence of our friendship, and the close relationship between the two countries. New Zealand has a mutual assistance arrangement with the US, which covers the provision of specialist wildfire fighting capability when required.

“New Zealand sent a total of 29 firefighters to the Pacific North West of the US last year. They served in leadership roles, in many cases supervising US fire crews on the ground.

“The 2006 contingent was the fourth time New Zealand has sent firefighters to the US. Help was also provided in 2000, 2002 and 2003.

“The co-hosting of an official event by two Cabinet Secretaries is evidence of the esteem the US holds for the professionalism and dedication of the New Zealand firefighting personnel who have travelled to the United States.

“New Zealand firefighters gained valuable experience through their deployment and picked up useful knowledge about US operational procedures and systems, equipment and apparatus and training programmes.

“New Zealand also benefits from the reciprocal support the US is committed to providing New Zealand if we ever need it,” Mr Goff said.
