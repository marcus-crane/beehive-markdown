New Zealanders gathered at Tilomar, near the border of Timor Leste and Indonesia yesterday to pay tribute to Private Leonard Manning killed in action in July 2000.

The service was attended by a party of New Zealanders and East Timorese, including; Defence Minister, Phil Goff, Ambassador to Timor Leste, Ruth Nuttal, Chief of Air Force, Graham Lintott and Deputy Commander of the International Security Force in Timor Leste, Colonel Paul van den Broek.

"The death of Private Manning was a tragic reminder of the risks faced by New Zealand Defence Force personnel deployed in security and peace keeping operations", said Mr Goff.

"The decision to deploy New Zealanders into high risk environments is never taken lightly.

"Our presence today and in the past in Timor Leste is, and has been, because we accept the responsibility to protect the lives of innocent people threatened by violence.

"Prior to the service for Leonard Manning, the New Zealand party visited the site of the Cathedral in nearby Suai where 170 Timorese people including priests and nuns, were murdered in cold blood by militias in September 1999.

"We also pay tribute to Leonard's mother and father, Linda and Charlie Manning, who following the loss of their son established a scholarship for East Timorese students to commemorate his life", Mr Goff said.

"We honour Leonard Manning for giving up his life in the service of his country.

"While there can be little consolation at the loss of a young man in the prime of his life, we can at least acknowledge that Leonard Manning's sacrifice and New Zealand's presence in Timor Leste has made a difference for the better in the lives of the people there", Mr Goff said.
