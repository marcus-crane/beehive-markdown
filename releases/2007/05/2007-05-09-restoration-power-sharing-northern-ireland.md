Prime Minister Helen Clark today described the restoration of a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, after more than four years in suspension, as a hugely significant event for the Northern Ireland peace process.

"It is the culmination of progress towards full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which was concluded back in 1998," Helen Clark said.

"I welcome the commitment of Dr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, to put aside former deeply held differences to work together to create an effective government for Northern Ireland, and a common future for its people.

"As the two men took up their positions as First and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, along with their Ministerial colleagues in the Northern Ireland executive, they pledged to work together to serve the people of Northern Ireland.

"Restoration of the power-sharing government is also testament to the joint efforts of the British and Irish Governments, and particularly the personal commitment by Prime Minister Blair and Taoiseach Ahern to the peace process. It vindicates all those who have worked for many years for the cause of peace, including the wider international community, politicians, and many individuals across the community in Northern Ireland.

"I hope that the constructive spirit which the leaders on all sides have demonstrated recently will continue as the Assembly and Executive gets established, and I offer the support and encouragement of the New Zealand Government in this process. I also look forward to what I’m sure will be a warm and productive relationship between New Zealand and Northern Ireland," Helen Clark said.
