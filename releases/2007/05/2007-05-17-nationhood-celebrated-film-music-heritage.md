Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced details of new funding in the arts, culture and heritage portfolio, aimed at preserving and promoting the unique elements of New Zealand's nationhood.

"Budget 2007 contains additional investments by the Labour-led government in the arts, cultural, and heritage infrastructure of our country," Helen Clark said.

"The restoration project for Government House, the Governor-General's official Wellington residence, will receive $2 million in capital funding, to develop design work, cost estimates, and resource consents. The 97 year old building needs to be brought up to building code specifications, while its heritage values are maintained.

"Efforts to conserve newly-found Maori artefacts, which by law are deemed to be prima facie owned by the Crown, will be supported through an additional $120,000 over four years. A further $120,000 over four years is provided to authenticate protected objects such as taonga through an authorised certificate of examination from a museum.

"The NZ Music Industry Commission will receive an additional $533,000 next year to enable it to maintain support for the music industry through domestic and international initiatives, pending a full review of the organisation.

"The New Zealand Film Archive's efforts to collect and protect our heritage of moving images will be boosted through an additional $2 million over four years.

"The New Zealand Film Commission will receive $946,000 in capital funding next year to cover relocation and fit-out costs as it moves to new premises.

"Baseline funding for the Ministry of Culture and Heritage will increase by around $2 million a year, following a review which called for more support for it to deliver policy advice, monitor other arts agencies, and provide adequate internal support services for staff," Helen Clark said.
