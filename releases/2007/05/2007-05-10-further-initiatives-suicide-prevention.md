Jim Anderton, Leader of the Progressive Party and Associate Minister of Health, announced today $23.1 million over four years to support a range of suicide prevention initiatives as part of the implementation of the New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy, launched last year.

"Although the rate of suicide in New Zealand has decreased by around 20% percent since 1998, it is still far too high and needs continued commitment to keep the number of these tragic deaths down.

"This Labour-Progressive Government has that commitment. We are backing our suicide prevention strategy with substantial funding for new initiatives and building on the success of earlier ones.

"The depression awareness campaign fronted by John Kirwan has been very successful. The funding announced today will build on that success with new initiatives to reach a younger audience.

"Hand in hand with people becoming aware of the signs of depression and seeking help, is the need for good treatment. To this end we are beefing up the training of primary care professionals on depression management, completing the roll-out of emergency department suicide prevention guidelines to all hospitals, and establishing pilot positions in DHBs for regional coordination of the suicide prevention strategy.

"It is also clear that we need to better protect the vulnerable people who have made a suicide attempt.

"Studies show that almost half of them will make at least one further attempt, and one in 12 will die as a result of suicide within five years. Therefore, we are trialling new approaches of care for those who have attempted suicide and we will roll-out the most effective approach nationally.

"To improve people's understanding of mental health issues, a new community-based education programme is being developed, with further funding going toward extending the successful 'Travellers' support programme in schools, and the [Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training programme](http://www.livingworks.org.nz/ASIST_Workshop.aspx) that provides people in the community with the skills to better respond to people who may be suicidal.

"Programmes like these show there is a will to educate and improve knowledge and skills to deal with suicide at various levels. There is no veil of silence around suicide" Jim Anderton said.
