The President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, will visit New Zealand from 28-30 May, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

President Arroyo will attend the Third Regional Interfaith Dialogue at Waitangi, and will also visit Auckland, Wellington, and Rotorua.

The high level delegation travelling with the President will include Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry, Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, and Defence. She will also be accompanied by senators, mayors, government officials, business leaders, and media.

“President Arroyo last visited New Zealand in 1999, when she was Vice-President, to attend the APEC Women Leaders Network Meeting," Helen Clark said.

“President Arroyo and her delegation are interested in New Zealand's world leading forest science, in our water and waste management initiatives, and in our emphasis on renewable energy.

“Our two countries are also looking to build co-operation in human rights and conservation, and finalise a double taxation agreement,” Helen Clark said.

Economic links between New Zealand and the Philippines are expanding. Two way trade between New Zealand and the Philippines was valued at approximately NZ$658million for the year to December 2006. The Philippines is now New Zealand's twelfth largest export market.

"The Interfaith Dialogue to be held in Waitangi involves 15 countries from Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. It aims to promote understanding and co-operation amongst different faith communities in our region, addressing some of the potential causes of religious and inter-community conflict," Helen Clark said.

"I travelled to the Philippines in 2006 to attend the second Regional Interfaith Dialogue hosted by President Arroyo. At that time I offered on behalf of our government to host the 2007 Dialogue with Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines as co-sponsors. President Arroyo's visit reciprocates my visit to Cebu and the Interfaith Dialogue there last year," Helen Clark said.
