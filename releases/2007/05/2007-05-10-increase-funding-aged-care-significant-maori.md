Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui said the major investment in care and support for elderly, announced in a pre-Budget statement on 1 May by Health Minister Pete Hodgson, is significant for Maori.

The Government is investing $150 million over four years in residential care and another $81.2 million for home based support services which will help older people stay in their own home if they wish.

"The number of older Maori, aged over 65 years, is expected to grow from 20,000 in 2001, to 57,000 in 2021.

The is the most rapid growth of any Maori age group over this period, and this investment will help ensure that they receive safe, effective, and appropriate care." said Mita Ririnui.

"The Labour-led Government recognizes the need to raise the level of pay for workers who provide support and care to our senior citizens. This year's Budget will help to ensure that the sector can attract and retain workers." Mita Ririnui says.

"A 2003 Quality and Safety Survey reported over 2,100 Maori support workers and over 200 Maori coordinators working in disability and aged support services. This is approximately 1/7 of the workforce for support workers and 1/8 for coordinators.

Budget 2007 is designed to continue efforts to raise pay levels in the aged care sector contributing to quality care and positive choices for older people. This will help to ensure that older Maori receive appropriate care, whether in their homes, or in residential care."

A further $128 million has been provided for inflation and to fund volume increases.
