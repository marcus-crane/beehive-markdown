Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today he took very seriously all allegations of unethical or inappropriate behaviour made against prison staff.

"All allegations must and will be followed up by Corrections to ensure the system remains robust.

"The chief executive has assured me he is committed to cracking down on suspected corrupt practices within the system and has already made good progress.

"Barry Matthews has set up a five-person internal investigations team, as I foreshadowed three months ago, and is building on Corrections' intelligence capability known as Crime Prevention Information Capability or CPIC."

Around 15 prison staff are presently suspended following investigations co-ordinated by Mr Matthews.

Mr O'Connor cautioned against believing claims of widespread corruption within the corrections system.

"Allegations against staff are made every single day, many from disgruntled ex-prisoners and former prison staff. The number currently on suspension equals less than half of one per cent of all Corrections' more than 3000 front-line staff.

"That said, every one of these claims will be followed up. I will not tolerate any behaviour that undermines the credibility of the department."
