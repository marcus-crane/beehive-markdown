This country's first ever New Zealand Sign Language Week has been a great success says Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson, who helped launch the week officially at Parliament on Monday.

"I am delighted to be celebrating another step forward in this country’s official recognition of New Zealand Sign Language, which started with the passing of the New Zealand Sign Language Act by the Labour-led government in April last year," said Ruth Dyson.

"I am pleased to announce during Sign Language Week that the Ministry of Health has approved a one-off payment of $20,000 to assist the Deaf Association with upgrading its online booking system for Interpreter Services."

The online interpreter booking system will allow NZ Sign Language interpreters to be booked through the Deaf Association website. A suitable interpreter will be matched with the details of the request and confirmation of the booking will be sent to the requestor using their preferred method of communication such as email, fax or text.

The new booking system will have enhanced security and provide simplified, and faster access for the public. The booking system itself is free to use, but some people or organisations will need to pay for the interpreter service as they do now. The upgraded system is expected to be available to use from 1 July 2007.

"By establishing New Zealand Sign Language Week, New Zealand’s Deaf community now has a central focus point for celebrating and lifting the profile of what is this country’s third official language. I congratulate the Deaf Association and the Week’s organisers for drawing together a fantastic collection of events that has captured the imagination of New Zealanders," said Ms Dyson.

One such event is the [3rd Deaf Short Film Competition](http://www.deafshortfilm.co.nz/) being held tomorrow in Auckland. More information about activities on during the week can be found at [www.nzsign.co.nz](http://www.nzsign.co.nz/)  
NZ Sign Language Week ends on 13 May.
