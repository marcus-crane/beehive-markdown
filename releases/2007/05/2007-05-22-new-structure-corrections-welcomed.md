Minister for Corrections Damien O’Connor has welcomed the announcement today of the new structure for Corrections.

“I am pleased to see that the department has acted to address the concerns expressed by myself and others about whether its structure was suitable given the clear challenges of the future,” Mr O’Connor said.

“These challenges include the work this government has asked the department to do in as part of its Effective Interventions initiatives to reduce re-offending while ensuring the public are kept safe.

“I particularly welcome the new clarity around accountability which the new structure promises and I look forward to an improved performance as a result of the changes.

“The greater emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners is a positive development and the greater coordinated support being provided to the department’s operational arms – Prison Services and the Community Probation and Psychological Services – promises well for the department looking forward.

“It is also pleasing to see bedded in the new investigation team which is tasked to look into any allegations of unethical or inappropriate behaviour among staff. This will provide a level of comfort around the integrity of the department which will be reassuring to the public.”
