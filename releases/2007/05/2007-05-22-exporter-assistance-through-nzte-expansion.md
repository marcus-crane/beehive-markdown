Trade Minister Phil Goff today announced major plans for expansion of New Zealand Trade and Enterprises (NZTE) Asian operations.

"The budget allocated a $23.8 million increase in funding for the strengthening and growth of NZTE's presence in this key region", said Mr Goff.

"The expansion will see NZTE open up to five more offices in China, one more office in India and New Zealand concept centres in China and Japan. The concept centres will be modelled on the successful New Zealand Focus Centre in Hong Kong, a permanent exhibition centre for the promotion of New Zealand products.

"The expansion will also see the successful Beachheads Programme extended into China and India. The Beachheads Programme assists New Zealand companies entering new markets by connecting the company with mentors drawn from the local business community who assist the company as it begins operations in the new market. The Beachheads Programme began in 2002 in Singapore and has since expanded to the United Kingdom, United States, Dubai and Japan.

"In 2006 New Zealand exports to China and Japan totalled more than $5.4 billion. New Zealand exports to India totalled only $337 million in the same period but there is strong exporter interest in entering this market. We believe that these markets offer more opportunities for New Zealand's future growth than any other and based on this we are increasing the size of our teams there and the services we offer to help New Zealand companies.

“You need to be in the market to be successful. You cannot just do business from a distance. Establishing relationships, developing strong business linkages and building a local constituency is needed if we are going to effectively grow and service opportunities.

“This increased focus and presence also reflects the fact these markets present particular challenges in terms of culture, language and market structure for New Zealand firms that require additional support compared to other markets”, Mr Goff said.
