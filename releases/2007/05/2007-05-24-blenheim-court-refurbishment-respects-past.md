Courts Minister Rick Barker officially opened the newly-refurbished Blenheim courthouse today, saying it was a fine example of how heritage buildings can be adapted to accommodate the demands of the present and the future.

“The courthouse was built in 1937 and is typical of the post depression Art Deco era. However much has changed in Marlborough in the last seventy years and the courthouse had not kept up with the times. It had become too small to provide the functionality required of a modern day court” said Rick Barker.

“The newly-refurbished courthouse has an additional court room, judicial chambers and associated spaces on the second level, new facilities for staff, new custodial facilities and holding cells. There are also additional interview rooms, increased public areas and a new, integrated security access system.

“The building’s category II listing under the Historic Places Trust Act presented a few challenges but these have been overcome thanks to the close collaboration between the building contractors, the heritage architect and the Historic Places Trust.

“I am especially pleased to see that the Rimu panelling in Courtroom One has been preserved and extended throughout the rest of the courthouse.

“The Blenheim Court refurbishment is the latest in the Labour-led Governments programme of improving court house facilities throughout New Zealand, and it’s great to be here and see first hand the results of our approach", said Rick Barker.

The Nelson Courthouse will be the next in the region to benefit from the Labour-led Government’s investment programme. This refurbishment will see a doubling of the floor space from 1,600msq to 3,200msq. There will be two additional courtrooms, two additional hearing rooms, increased public waiting and administration spaces and additional judicial spaces.
