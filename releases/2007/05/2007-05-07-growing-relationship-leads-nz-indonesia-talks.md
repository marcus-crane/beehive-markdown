Enhancing a growing relationship will be the prime focus when Foreign Minister Winston Peters and his Indonesian counterpart Hassan Wirajuda meet for the first New Zealand-Indonesia Joint Ministerial Commission in Jakarta tomorrow.

“Indonesia is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand. It is pleasing that the relationship is becoming closer, and we are committed to building greater mutual understanding between our two countries,” Mr Peters said.

"New Zealand has been encouraged by Indonesia’s reform process, and we want to build on the momentum created by President Yudhoyono's visit to New Zealand in 2005 by strengthening ministerial and institutional links.

"The Joint Ministerial Commission offers an opportunity to review recent progress in developing areas of cooperation, such as in policing, defence and between parliamentarians.

"Growing cooperation between our countries on counter-terrorism and transnational crime has resulted in New Zealand establishing a second Police Liaison Officer position in Jakarta.

“Significant reforms within the Indonesian military have also seen us resume low-level defence cooperation, with an Indonesian officer invited to attend the Command and Staff College in Trentham.

"Parliamentary links are growing, and a group from the Indonesian House of Representatives has just recently completed a visit to New Zealand, where they met with the Finance and Expenditure Committee."

Mr Peters said the meeting would discuss initiatives to enhance relations in the areas of security, trade, and natural disaster management.

"There are also a number of wider regional and international issues of common interest to us, including the East Asia Summit, the situation in Timor-Leste, and our mutual support for inter-faith dialogue," Mr Peters said.
