National leader John Key's stumbling into the broadband investment issue risks putting the price up, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"Of course New Zealand needs better broadband," Mr Cunliffe said. "The Labour-led government is delivering that after a decade of neglect in the 1990s by National when Maurice Williamson, their invisible spokesman, was minister.

"But John Key suggesting now that he would commit taxpayers to funding the National-caused investment gap could be a costly blunder.

"Telecommunications companies collectively make hundreds of millions of dollars profit every year from New Zealand consumers. If the companies think taxpayers via the government will do their investment for them, why would they spend their own money?"

Mr Cunliffe was criticising suggestions Mr Key made on Radio New Zealand's Checkpoint programme last night that National would use taxpayers' money to fund broadband infrastructure.

"There is solid evidence of underinvestment in broadband infrastructure," Mr Cunliffe said. "Recently Telecom said at least $1.5 billion needed to be invested by it and other industry players. That may be conservative.

"Today, one company's mainly overseas shareholders are learning of a $1.1 billion windfall. At the same time, National wants taxpayers to pick up the tab for the next generation of New Zealand's networks. It is a good thing John Key does not have the public chequebook.

"The industry is at a critical junction with local loop unbundling on a fast track and the issue of operational/structural separation open for public comment. A true leader would not blunder in at such a time. National would be well advised to put its brain into gear before running off at the mouth with taxpayers' money.

"Clearly, this is more evidence of John Key's PR advice to try to mimic Labour in areas of the government's strengths. While flattering, the public will not buy 'Labour lite' when it already has the real thing. It is also fiscally irresponsible, like National pursuing tax cuts for the rich while every week promising to spend more money in the face of an economy that is already running hot.

"It is ironic that National is becoming a born-again nationaliser after decades of neglecting the country's infrastructure, but it has no credibility. It is the Labour-led government that is delivering on sound policies."
