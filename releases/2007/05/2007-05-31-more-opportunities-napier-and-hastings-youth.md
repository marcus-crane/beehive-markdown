A new Youth Transition Service launched today will lead to better futures for young people in Napier and Hastings, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The Minister was speaking at the official launch of the Napier and Hastings service today at the premises of the Youth Transition Services provider, Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga in Hastings.

"YTS is an investment in the future of our greatest asset; the young people of New Zealand," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The service will work alongside 15 to 19 year olds who are at risk of experiencing prolonged disengagement from work, education or training – with a particular focus on 15 to 17 year old school leavers.

"Most young people make a very good transition from school, but some are at risk of falling through the cracks and missing out on work, education or training. Evidence tells us time and again that these young people are at a much higher risk of poor outcomes like long-term unemployment, as well as crime and other anti-social activities.

"We’re putting money into YTS so we can help even more young people shift into training or employment. Last month we reached a milestone with more than 10,000 young people having accessed Youth Transition Services. Of those, just over 4,000 were currently receiving services, while the remainder had received assistance and left the services," said the Minister.

The service provider of the Napier and Hastings Youth Transition Service, Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga delivers a comprehensive health service, including primary, community and mental health services to both Maori and non-Maori client groups. Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga also delivers a large number of education and training programmes as a registered training provider.

"With its local knowledge and experience, Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga is also in an ideal position to build on what’s already available for young people here in Napier and Hastings.

"Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga will co-ordinate what’s already here, fill any service gaps identified, and raise awareness among young people, families, whânau and schools of the opportunities available," said Mr Benson-Pope.
