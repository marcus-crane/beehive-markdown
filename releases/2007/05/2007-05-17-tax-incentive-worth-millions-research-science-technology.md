The Labour-led government is providing a major tax incentive worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars, to boost private sector investment in research and development (R&D), says Research, Science and Technology Minister, Steve Maharey.

"The tax credit for business research and development has been unveiled as part of the $630 million Business Tax Reform package over four years from Budget 2007.

"Under the new incentive, businesses investing in R&D can earn a 15 per cent tax credit on that spending. For example, a company investing $100,000 in research would get $15,000 back in a tax rebate.

"The aim is to help raise the rate of private sector investment in New Zealand, which is currently only a third of the OECD average.

"The private sector can also form partnerships with government bodies, such as Universities and Crown Research Institutues, to take advantage of the tax incentive. This will boost take up of the tax credit, while also promoting public private partnerships.

"This government is committed to raising the low level of private funding of R&D, by giving smaller companies the incentive to start investing in R&D and larger companies to expand their research.

"The tax incentive gives businesses more scope to invest in their own research, or commission New Zealand scientists to support their growth."

The tax credit is on top of a $107 million investment in research, science and technology (RS&T) funding over the next four years, which also focuses on transforming the economy by improving business performance and sustainability.

"The government is continuing its drive to invest strongly in R&D, and this tax incentive is creating a major opportunity for the private sector to also boost its contribution to New Zealand's economic transformation."
