Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel today launched a new product line by established Christchurch family business Lahmajou Company Ltd.

Lianne Dalziel said the Michaelides family represented the innovative-thinking, hard work and “can-do” attitude that characterised many Kiwi small businesses.

Cyprus-born Giannis Michaelides, his wife Despo, and their three sons Andreas, Kyriakos and Stelios are all involved in the pita-bread baking business. The company has now expanded into producing pita bread chips.

“Giannis started producing pita bread after a serendipitous oven failure caused him to bake some dough without the topping that he had been using to make a completely different product. Happily for the New Zealand consumer that batch of dough came out of the oven as pita bread which he has since refined and modified along the lines of a traditional Cypriot recipe.

“Now he’s had a fresh look at the market and has identified and developed a new product line that is sure to do well as New Zealander’s tastes have become more internationalised.

“Giannis has designed and built most of his own machinery, and has used local engineers for some of the more specialised items; and his sons are now joining the family business after gaining tertiary qualifications in marketing, accounting and engineering.

“With such hard work, commitment to gaining a sound business education, and thinking outside the square to create and adapt new products and the necessary equipment, this family business is a recipe for success.”
