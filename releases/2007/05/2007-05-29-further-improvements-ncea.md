The Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, has announced design changes to the NCEA system at a joint briefing with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).

"NCEA is a world-class qualifications system which challenges students, recognises their achievement, and is proven to prepare students well for university.

"The operational side of NCEA is now working well, and today's announcement focuses on further refining the design of the system. The changes will increase student motivation, provide more detailed information on their achievement, and further improve consistency in NCEA.

"These improvements are part of the Labour-led government’s commitment to providing a world class education system for the 21st century."

The improvements include:

- Introducing 'excellence' and 'merit' to NCEA certificates from 2007
- Introducing 'excellence' and 'merit' at subject level from 2008
- Including 'not achieved' in NCEA results notices for both internally assessed and externally assessed standards from 2008
- Up to 10 per cent of internally assessed standards will be moderated by full-time moderators appointed to NZQA from 2008

A new 'School Results Summary' will also be introduced from 2008 that includes all results 'achieved' and 'not achieved' in NCEA for school leavers. The lifelong 'Record of Learning' will become the 'Record of Achievement' for both tertiary and secondary students.

"The Ministry of Education and NZQA have worked together on these improvements following consultation with principals, teachers, students, and various education sector bodies like the PPTA and school trustees.”

### Improvements – Fact Sheet:

- ***Introducing 'excellence', ‘merit’ or ‘achieved’ to NCEA Certificates:***

NCEA certificates at level 1, 2 and 3 are issued to students who achieve the required number of credits. The certificates will now show their overall achievement, for example NCEA level 1 with ‘achieved’, ‘merit' or ‘excellence'. This will encourage students to do the best they can, and provide more information for them, their parents and for employers. It acknowledges the level of student success without compromising the flexibility of the qualification.

- ***Introducing 'excellence' , ‘merit’ and ‘achieved’ at subject level:***

Results notices will also specify the level of achievement in a group of standards with links to a specific subject area. For example a student with strength in mathematics might receive a merit or excellence for that subject. This will encourage students to do their best. It also responds to concerns from some that courses have become more fragmented.

- ***Reporting 'not achieved’:***

Currently 'not achieved' results for externally assessed standards are reported on the results notice. From 2008, 'not achieved' results for internally assessed standards will also be reported. This will help provide greater consistency in reporting of internally and externally assessed standards. It will also provide a more accurate picture of all work undertaken by a student during the year.

- ***School Results Summary:***

A School Results Summary will be issued to all school leavers as a complete record of their performance while at secondary school.

- ***Record of Achievement:***

The 'Record of Learning' (which records all credits attained towards any national qualification throughout a person’s life) will be renamed the 'Record of Achievement' from 2008.

- ***Moderation:***

To improve confidence in internal assessment, the number of samples of student work that is moderated will rise from 3 per cent in 2006 to a target of 10 per cent from 2008. Full-time moderators will be appointed to NZQA to carry out this role.

NZQA has already announced a pilot in which there will be some random sampling of moderation decisions. This will be carried out from September this year.
