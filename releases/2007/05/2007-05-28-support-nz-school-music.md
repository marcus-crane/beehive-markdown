The New Zealand School of Music will receive a one-off capital injection from the government for a purpose-built facility in Wellington, subject to meeting certain commitments, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"Funding of up to $11.5 million has been approved in principle so the school can build a new home to reflect its contribution to our national identity," said Dr Cullen. "This will be contingent on a new business case and performance commitments.

"National identity is a key theme for the Labour-led government. It's about who we are, and music plays a vital part in expressing the creativity of our country. That's why I am very pleased to announce a cornerstone capital injection to help the construction of a new building.

"It's also fitting that I can make this announcement at the inaugural graduation of the school's first 17 graduates.

The School of Music is a collaboration between Massey University and Victoria University and is currently housed across Wellington on several sites.

"I applaud the partnership of the two universities. It reflects precisely what we are trying to achieve with the tertiary reforms – collaboration, not competition and duplication. This is essential if the tertiary sector is to better meet our economic and social priorities.

"Therefore, the new home for the School of Music will be an important symbol of what can be achieved.

"To assist the financing of the building there will also be contributions from the universities, Wellington City Council and private donors.

"The government’s contribution is dependent on the school submitting a new business case that provides more information about the cost of the new building, how the school fits into the network of tertiary music education and the financial sustainability of the school. Performance commitments will also be required in return for government funding.

"I am sure the new school will be a fitting home so the musicians of tomorrow can make a valuable contribution to supporting our national identity."
