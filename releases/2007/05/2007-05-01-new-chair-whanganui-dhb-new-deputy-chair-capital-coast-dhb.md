Health Minister Pete Hodgson has announced the appointment of a new chair at Whanganui District Health Board (DHB) and a new deputy chair at Capital & Coast DHB.

Pete Hodgson said he welcomed the appointments of Kate Joblin and Ken Douglas as chair and deputy chair of Whanganui and Capital & Coast DHBs respectively. Both Kate Joblin’s and Ken Douglas’ terms of office commence on 3 May 2007.

"Kate Joblin and Ken Douglas will bring substantial governance and managerial experience to their positions through their previous roles. I look forward to working with both of them to improve health outcomes for the residents of Capital & Coast and Wanganui," Pete Hodgson said.

Kate Joblin is a Wanganui-based self-employed chartered accountant. She has extensive senior management experience in both the private and public sectors.  
Kate Joblin is involved as a director in local health and education organisations in Wanganui and is currently an appointed member of Whanganui DHB. She is a director of Nazareth Rest Home Ltd, Quinlan Court Ltd, Whanganui City Health, Whanganui Accident and Medical Ltd, and Kate Joblin & Co Ltd. She also chairs Aubert Home of Compassion Ltd and is a trustee of ‘Life to the Max’.

Ken Douglas, ONZ JP, is an established company director with extensive experience in the management, governance and business areas. He was elected as a member of the Capital & Coast DHB in 2004. He has been a life long trade unionist. Over the last six years he has been an elected member of the Porirua City Council and director of several of New Zealand’s largest companies, including Air New Zealand and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. He is currently chair of Positively Wellington Business and deputy chair of New Zealand Post.

Pete Hodgson particularly thanked outgoing chair Dr Patrick O'Connor for his governance and hard work in heading Whanganui for the past two-and-a-half years and was pleased Dr O'Connor would continue to serve the people of Wanganui.

"I acknowledge the efforts of Dr Patrick O’Connor and thank him for continuing on as a board member," Pete Hodgson says.
