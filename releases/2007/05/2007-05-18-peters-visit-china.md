Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves for China tomorrow night, for a visit that will see him meet his newly-appointed counterpart Yang Jiechi, and visit the north-western province of Xinjiang.

"This visit will help underline the great importance New Zealand places on all aspects of its relationship with China," Mr Peters said.

“It will be good to meet Foreign Minister Yang so soon after his appointment in late April, and to build on discussions we had when he visited New Zealand as Vice-Minister in December 2005.

"China’s importance in the Asia-Pacific region is already significant and growing steadily, and its views on a number of issues are of great interest to us. Asia is increasingly central to New Zealand's future, and we need to be closely engaged with the region, and with China in particular.

"Discussions with Minister Yang will cover a range of issues, including the East Asia Summit, of which both countries are members, and China's readout on the progress of talks with North Korea over its nuclear programme."

In Beijing, Mr Peters will open the New Zealand Centre at Peking University, which is a joint initiative with the University of Auckland, and an important development in the education relationship between the two countries.

In Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, Mr Peters will visit a New Zealand-funded education programme for the children of local minorities, and speak at Shihezi University, which has a relationship with Massey University. He will then fly to Shanghai to give a keynote speech at the Shanghai Forum.

"Travelling outside the main centres will be a useful way of getting a fuller picture of China's economic development, especially in the western provinces which have become an important focus for the Chinese government.

"It will also reinforce the government’s message to China that New Zealand has a broad focus to the relationship,” Mr Peters said.
