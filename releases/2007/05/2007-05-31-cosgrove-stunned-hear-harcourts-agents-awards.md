Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove said today he was stunned to learn that New Zealand's largest real estate company, Harcourts, last night rewarded agent Shaun Cosgrave for the second time with some top industry awards.

Last year Mr Cosgrave received a formal warning from the Commerce Commission and was fined by the Real Estate Institute for breaching the industry's code of ethics, over the Ottaway case. Yet earlier this month he was named as Harcourts Central Region's Top Sales Consultant, for the fourth year in a row.

Mr Cosgrove said Harcourt’s decision to award Mr Cosgrave with its top International (Australasian) award last night plus the New Zealand and Unit (volume) awards shows once again that the senior leadership in the real estate sector is clearly out of touch with New Zealanders.

"The real estate industry is expected to pull in $1.2 billion dollars this year in commissions, with a big chunk of this bonanza of cash flowing through the Harcourts coffers," Mr Cosgrove said.

"Rather than spending money on an expensive awards ceremony, Harcourts could instead have decided to compensate John and Catlin Ottaway who fell victim to the failure to disclose information that an apartment block was to be built next to their prospective new home."

"The government's reforms announced earlier this week will bring accountability, transparency and independence to the real estate industry, but the leaders of the sector need to review their own attitude to fair play for prospective Kiwi homeowners and homebuyers."

"Paying out compensation to the Ottaways is the least they can do. There is no moral constraint preventing Harcourts from doing the right thing by the Ottaways," Mr Cosgrove said. “And in light of the announced changes, such a move to compensate the Ottaways and other victims, would start to rebuild the tarnished image this sector has.”

Mr Cosgrove said that he had arranged a meeting with Harcourts' Chief Executive Bryan Thomson at which he intended to ask Harcourts to compensate the Ottaways, but that Mr Thomson pulled out of the meeting the night before it was due to take place.

"At this time when the industry is under enhanced scrutiny due to some high-profile cases about unethical real estate agents and the government's plans to overhaul real estate agent legislation, I find it hard to fathom how the industry can continue to insult good people like the Ottaways with this kind of self indulgence."
