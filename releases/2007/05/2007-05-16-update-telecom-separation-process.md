Interest in the issues surrounding the separation of Telecom remains high, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

“I continue to be impressed at the depth and quality of the submissions made on Telecom’s separation,” Mr Cunliffe said. “Clearly, this is an issue with wide-ranging implications, and I am pleased that the industry and the public are giving it the focus it deserves.

"[Sixteen submissions have been received](http://www.med.govt.nz/telecommunications/operational-separation), including from ordinary New Zealanders. I thank everyone for the time they have devoted to considering this important issue.

“I will consider all submissions made before making any further comment or decisions. In the meantime, I am continuing to develop my requirements for the operational separation of Telecom as required by the [Telecommunications Amendment Act](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28055)," Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe also welcomed the progress being made on the development of LLU and new bitstream products, including naked DSL.

“I am very pleased with the progress being made, and the commitment from all parties to expediting the availability of these critical products.”
