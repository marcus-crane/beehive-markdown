Business Mentors New Zealand plans to recruit up to 100 additional people to act as mentors for exporters, with support from Export Year 2007, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard and Trade Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"This boost to mentoring means business can more easily find an experienced mentor to act as a sounding board for ideas and plans and to benefit from their skill and know-how," the ministers said.

"Business Mentors New Zealand makes several thousand matches a year between businesses and mentors. No other organisation in New Zealand is structured to connect mentors with businesses on the same scale and this additional funding of up to $299,250 for Export Year 2007 will enable more matches between export businesses and mentors with the right skills.

"Export Year 2007 is a joint initiative between the Labour-led government, NZ First and the private sector and aims to improve our long-term export performance – and New Zealand's prosperity - by supporting both new and existing exporters and encouraging businesses to globalise their operations.

"Increasing New Zealand’s sustainable export base by making our firms more resilient and more capable will strengthen the foundations for long term export growth – ensuring New Zealand continues to compete and thrive in global markets."

Business Mentors New Zealand is funded largely by patrons from the private sector, with additional support from the government through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. It provides free mentoring services to businesses that have been operating for at least a year and have fewer than 25 staff. The organisation currently has a pool of about 1,400 mentors from throughout New Zealand but only a proportion of those are experienced exporters.

As well as recruiting additional mentors, Business Mentors New Zealand will provide export-focussed training for both new and existing mentors. Mentors are volunteers but they are reimbursed for expenses.

"Exporters and business organisations working together as part of Export Year 2007 have identified that export-focussed mentoring could help address the need for knowledge sharing between existing and aspiring exporters. They have expressed their support for enhanced mentoring delivered efficiently through existing channels."

“By recruiting more mentors with real-world exporting experience, we can boost the capability and performance of New Zealand firms that are currently exporting or those who are ready to start exporting,” Trevor Mallard said.

Businesses wishing to request a mentor can register their interest on-line at www.businessmentor.org.nz or by calling 0800-103-400. A list of other Export Year initiatives follows. See also www.exportyear.co.nz
