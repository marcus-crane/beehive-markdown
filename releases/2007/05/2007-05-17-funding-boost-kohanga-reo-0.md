Budget 2007 will deliver kôhanga reo increased funding of $13.9 million over four years, said Education Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia.

The extra funding helps fulfil the Labour-led government's drive to put early childhood education (ECE) within reach of all New Zealand families and it is part of the $64.6 million invested in new early childcare money over the next four years, Mr Maharey said.

"Higher funding rates will support kôhanga reo to be more financially sustainable in the future. Many kôhanga will also be taking advantage of the government's 20 Hours Free ECE policy, which will be available for three- and four-year-olds in teacher-led ECE centres from 1 July.

Mr Horomia said the increased kôhanga reo funding recognises the special contribution kôhanga make within the education sector. "Not only are they the main form of Mâori immersion early childhood provision, but they are also one of the main providers of early childhood education in rural communities."

In 2006, 95 per cent of school entrants had been educated in ECE centres, and 27 per cent of all Mâori early childhood enrolments are at kôhanga reo.

This initiative will enable Mâori to continue to employ kaiako who are competent in te reo Mâori and will support rural kôhanga which have fixed costs, but lower enrolment levels, Mr Horomia said.

Mā tēnei pūtea tāpiri e āwhina te whakatutuki i te whāinga a te Kāwanatanga Reipa-ārahi, kia noho tata tonu ngā huarahi akoranga kōhungahunga (ECE) ki ngā whānau katoa o Aotearoa, ā, koia nei tētahi wāhanga o te $64.6 miriona i whakahaumitia ki roto i ngā moni tiaki kōhungahunga hou mō ngā tau e whā kei mua, e ki ana a Maharey.

“Mā ngā auau pūtea nui ake e tautoko i ngā kōhanga reo ki te haere ukauka ā-moni kaha ake, hei ngā wā kei mua. He maha anō ngā kōhanga ka whai painga i raro i ngā kaupapa here kāwanatanga, arā, 20 Haora kore utu a ECE, ka whakawāteatia mō ngā tamariki, toru me te whā tau, i roto i ngā pokapū ECE, kaiako-ārahi, atu i te 1 0 Hōngongoi.

E kī ana a Horomia, he tautokohanga te pūtea nui ake nei mō te kōhanga reo, i te takoha motuhake e hangaia nei e te kōhanga, ki roto i te rāngai mātauranga.  
“Ehara noaiho ko rātou anake te whaihanga matua mō te whakawhiwhinga akoranga kōhungahunga rumaki Māori, engari ko rātou anō tētahi o ngā kaiwhakawhiwhi akoranga kōhungahunga kei roto i ngā rohe tuawhenua.”

“I raro i tēnei kōkiri, ka āhei te Māori ki te whakamahi i ngā kaiako e matatau ana ki te reo Māori, me te āwhina i ngā kōhanga o tuawhenua kei a rātou ngā utu mau, engari ngā taumata whakaurunga iti iho,” e ki ana a Horomia.
