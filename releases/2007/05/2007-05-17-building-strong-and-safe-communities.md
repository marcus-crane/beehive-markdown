The Labour-led government believes every New Zealander should live in a safe and secure community where he or she can take part in all the activities a vibrant society offers.

"That's why Budget 2007 includes significant new funding to build on the work of the past seven years to transform our social and legal structures," said Justice Minister Mark Burton.

"A safe community is one in which crime levels are low and people have access to an equitable and credible justice system that is responsive to a changing society.

"The most visible sign of this government's investment in law and order is our ongoing work to support the deployment of 1000 new police officers, as well as many other initiatives aimed at preventing crime, strengthening enforcement agencies and planning for emergencies."

Budget 2007 includes:

- **$2.4 million over the next four years to strengthen the Police Complaints Authority** so that it can resolve complaints faster and further reduce its existing caseload. New legislation aimed at further strengthening the Authority's capacity and independence is currently before the House and will incorporate amendments addressing the recommendations of the Police Conduct inquiry report.
- **$1.3 million over the next year in the Supported Bail Programme** for young people on remand from the Youth Court to ensure they comply with their bail conditions. Aimed at reducing youth re-offending of 14-16 year olds and keeping young people out of police cells, supported bail provides one-on-one case management including individual supervised day programmes. Preliminary evaluation findings show 75 per cent had not re-offended while on the programme with 95 per cent attending all their required court appearances.
- **$1.4 million over the next year will go into intensive intervention programmes** for the most serious and dangerous youth offenders. Investing earlier in programmes to address the causes of the criminal behaviour has obvious positive flow on effects for the young person, their families and the community as a whole. The aim of this funding is to reduce re-offending by this group and keep young people out of prison.
- Further support as part of the government's agreement with New Zealand First to put 1000 new police on the frontline is all about creating safer communities. Budget 2007 allocates $6.2 million of operating funding over the next four years and $131,000 of capital funding over the next year for staff and services to support **two additional judges**: one High Court and one District Court. In addition, $3.6 million has been allocated over the next four years to the Legal Services Agency for **additional legal aid**.
- Enhancing the safety of all New Zealanders in an emergency by the provision of more than $4.3 million operating funding over four years and $2.9 million capital from 2006/07 to 2008/09 to the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management. The additional funding will provide for an **upgrade to the information and warning systems used before, during and after emergencies**.
- **The Human Rights Commission will receive an additional $7.5 million** over the next four years to strengthen its capacity to deliver key programmes and services. In addition improvements will be made to its information technology infrastructure ($713,000 operating over four years and $540,000 capital).

"The legal and human rights of all New Zealanders must be protected and enforced, so that they can engage and prosper in the social, economic and cultural life of their community," Mark Burton said.

Funds allocated to Corrections last year will result in two new prison-based drug and alcohol units over the next 18 months and more than 200 additional community probation staff to run the new sentence of home detention and the new community based sentences of intensive supervision and community detention (electronically monitored curfew).

Other initiatives aimed at building strong and safe communities have also been announced in Budget 2007, including significant funding to consolidate the establishment of New Zealand's highest court – the Supreme Court.
