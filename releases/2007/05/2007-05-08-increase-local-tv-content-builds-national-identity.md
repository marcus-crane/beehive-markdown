The Minister of Broadcasting Steve Maharey is welcoming the release of NZ On Air's Local Content Report showing the highest ever levels of New Zealand content on television in 2006.

"Hours of local content on free-to-air television reached 10,255 in 2006, which is nearly double the level of 6142 hours achieved under the National government in 1999.

"The Labour-led government is committed to the core objective of building national identity and this report provides a clear example of success. There were just 2111 hours of local content on TV when the collation of hours began in 1988.

"Television provides New Zealanders with access to their own stories more than ever before, with public broadcasters successfully reflecting our culture and national pride.

"The government funded Maori TV has been included in the local content report for the first time in 2006, and is providing an impressive 75 per cent local content.

"C4 was also included in the 2006 report for the first time. This proves that all of New Zealand's national free-to-air TV channels are boosting local content, providing more choice of quality local programming for New Zealanders."
