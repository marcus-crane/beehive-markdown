The Crown and Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups, whose traditional tribal area centres on the Gisborne District, have signed an agreement to enter into negotiations to settle the Groups' historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton, on behalf of the Crown, and Ngäi Tamanuhiri Whanui Trust, Rongowhakaata, and Te Pou a Haokai Central Progression Team signed Terms of Negotiation in Gisborne today. The Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups comprise Te Pou a Haokai, Ngäi Tamanuhiri, and Rongowhakaata negotiating collectively.

The Terms of Negotiation set out how the parties will negotiate a durable settlement of all the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of the Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups. Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia and Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui also attended the signing on behalf of the Crown.

"We can now address the grievances of the past and focus on building a stronger future together," Mark Burton said.

"I look forward to working with the Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups to comprehensively resolve their historical Treaty grievances," he said.

The claims of the Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups relate primarily to the war between the Crown and Türanga Mäori in the 1860s and the subsequent loss of land through the Deed of Cession, the operation and impact of Native Land Laws and the Poverty Bay Commission, the detention of Türanga Mäori on the Chatham Islands, the removal of Te Hau kï Türanga (a Rongowhakaata meeting house now located in Te Papa Museum) and the deaths of unarmed prisoners by Crown forces.

The Crown recognised the Deeds of Mandate of the Turanganui-a-Kiwa Claimant Groups to represent their respective claimant groups in Treaty negotiations in August 2005.

"Today's signing is another important milestone in the process to address historical grievances and strengthen the relationship between the Crown and iwi. Currently, the Government is working with over 20 claimant groups each of which involves a number of claims ranging from 2 to 70."
