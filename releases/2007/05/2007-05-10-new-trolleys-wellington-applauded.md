Transport Minister Annette King says the signing of a contract for 61 new trolley buses in Wellington is a proud day for the capital, a great boost for public transport and a fine example of “environmental sustainability in action”.

Greater Wellington Regional Council chair Ian Buchanan and Infratil managing director and NZ Bus director Lloyd Morrison signed the contract for the 61 new buses, each worth about $500,000, in Wellington today.

Ms King, who spoke at the signing ceremony, said the contract signalled the “rebirth of a Wellington icon.

“More than that, however, trolley buses demonstrate environmental sustainability in action,” she said. “The Government is meeting half of the approximately $6.5 million annual cost of running and renewing the trollies, and improving the overhead system and power supply.”

“Wellington’s existing 60-bus trolley fleet covers 1.6 million kilometres annually, powered by four Giggawatt hours of electricity. That’s the same amount of electricity used by about 500 households, or the equivalent of the amount of electricity produced by about half of one of the new windmills recently installed at TrustPower’s new Tararua windfarm.

“Diesel buses covering the same distance would use 600,000 litres of diesel a year, producing 1600 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

The smooth, electric-powered motors help make the inner city cleaner and quieter, and an even better place in which to work and play.”

Ms King says that “anything we can do as a country to reduce CO2 emissions, to move toward renewable energy sources, and to increase the use of public transport is to be applauded. That’s why today is such a great day, and why Wellington should be congratulated for its enterprise and initiative.”

“I want to particularly acknowledge Land Transport New Zealand for their hard work over the past year, and Greater Wellington Regional Council for negotiating this contract with NZ Bus. Together, we have ensured trolley buses remain on Wellington’s roads.”
