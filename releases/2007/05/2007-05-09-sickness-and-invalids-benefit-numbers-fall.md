The number of people receiving Sickness and Invalid's Benefits has fallen over the past month, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

"The number of people on the Sickness Benefit has fallen by 848 since the end of March this year. On top of this, the number of people on the Invalid's Benefit fell by 103. The number of people on the Unemployment Benefit fell by 2,167 over the same month," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"In fact, all main benefits saw reductions so that in total, benefit numbers dropped by 4,176 – a two percent reduction in just one month.

"I was delighted to be able to tell the House today that the number of people on Sickness and Invalid's Benefits has dropped. I was especially happy to inform Judith Collins. Hopefully this will put an end to her constantly using this group of Work and Income clients to play political point scoring games. Her obsessive behaviour about this group is getting out of control," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"These people are sick, injured or disabled. That's why they are accessing the Sickness or Invalid's Benefit. I don't know how to make it any clearer for Ms Collins.

"Those who become sick, injured or disabled would have everything to fear if the like of Judith Collins ever got into government.

"She clearly resents the sick accessing benefits, and she clearly resents spending public funds on supporting them back into work.

"She seems to be hinting that National would arbitrarily deprive people of benefits, even when they qualify under the relevant criteria," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The Labour-led government is about supporting people, and is in the process of rolling out further support through the Social Security Amendment Bill," said Mr Benson-Pope.
