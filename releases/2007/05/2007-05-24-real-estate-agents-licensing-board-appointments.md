Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove today announced the appointment of Hon Bill Jeffries, Murray Giera and David Russell to the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board.

The Boards principal functions are to hear and determine applications for real estate agents licences and to grant or renew certificates of approval of sales persons. It also has disciplinary powers to order the cancellation or suspension real estate agents' and sales peoples' licences, as well as impose fines.

However the Board's ability to hear complaints is dependent on the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) referring cases on.

Mr Jeffries takes over as chairperson of the Board as from 1 July this year. He is a former Minister of Justice and now practices as a Barrister sole in Wellington specializing in civil litigation. Mr Jeffries is also Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission, and a former Chairman of the Motor Vehicle Dealers Licensing Board from 1992 to 2004.

Mr Cosgrove said he is pleased that Mr Jeffries will make transparency and openness the cornerstone of the Board he will be chairing.

"I have met with the Chairman-designate who has advised me he plans to hold public hearings, and that the decisions of the Board will be made public. This is a positive step given real estate is such an important sector for New Zealanders, and real estate commissions are predicted to pass the billion-dollar mark this year."

Mr Giera and Mr Russell also join the Board as members from 1 July. Mr Giera has been a licensed real estate agent since 1970 and has operated his own real estate business since 1977 (the Act requires that one of the appointees be a licensed real estate agent). Mr Russell recently retired as Chief Executive of the Consumers Institute. Over the past 35 years he has played a leading role in all the Institute’s activities and is a recognised champion of consumer rights.

The new appointees join existing Board members Paul Dudding and Joan Harnett-Kindley, both experienced in the real estate industry and who were appointed to the Board in September 2006.

Mr Cosgrove said that he is delighted that candidates of such high calibre and experience have agreed to join the Board. "I am confident that the members of the Board will act as guardians of the public interest to the benefit of consumers and the industry," he said.

Mr Cosgrove said he recognised that the Board will be operating under the constraints, such as complaints referrals, of the current Real Estate Agents Act 1976. However he said he would soon be announcing the government's preferred options to reform the legislation governing the real estate industry, to provide independence, accountability, transparency, fairness and quality within the sector.

The Minister acknowledged the contribution of the outgoing chairperson, Alison Sinclair and the other two outgoing members Richard Stark and Kevin Coakley.
