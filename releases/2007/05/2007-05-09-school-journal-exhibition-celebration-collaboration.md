A Nest of Singing Birds, an exhibition celebrating 100 years of the School Journal is an exciting treasure trove of New Zealand art and literature, and an achievement for the Government organisations that put it together, National Library and Archives New Zealand Minister Judith Tizard said today.

“The School Journal is remembered fondly by so many New Zealanders. The Journal itself and the records, writing, and illustrations from it that are held within Archives New Zealand and National Library chart our country’s social and cultural development. By working together, National Library, Archives, and other Government organisations have created an exhibition that not only celebrates the life of the School Journal but that reflects New Zealand’s culture and heritage over the last 100 years.”

Over the course of its 100-year history, the School Journal has attracted work from some of New Zealand’s greatest poets, artists, and writers. The exhibition includes works by artists Colin McCahon, Ralph Hotere, and Rita Angus and letters from James K. Baxter and Elsie Locke as well as many others.

Many of the original illustrations and letters are on loan from Archives New Zealand.

“Government organisations like Archives and National Library that hold these objects and images in perpetuity for all New Zealanders help us all recall and celebrate our country's history.” Judith Tizard said.

"We are privileged that such great artists and authors shared their work with young New Zealanders and their families in such an accessible form.”

Prime Minister Helen Clark will formally open A Nest of Singing Birds at National Library in Wellington tonight.

A Nest of Singing Birds: 100 years of the School Journal is a partnership project between National Library of New Zealand, Archives New Zealand, the Ministry of Education, and Learning Media Limited.
