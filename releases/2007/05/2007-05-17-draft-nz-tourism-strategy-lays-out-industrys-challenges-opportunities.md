The draft New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, released today, clearly identifies the challenges and opportunities facing the industry into the future, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr O'Connor and Fiona Luhrs, Chief Executive of the Tourism Industry Association, released the draft strategy, the result of extensive consultation by tourism industry leaders and government officials.

Mr O'Connor said the issues facing the New Zealand economy mid- and long-term are widely understood both by tourism operators and the Government.

These include improving quality, increasing businesses' return on investment, making the sector more sustainable, and linking more closely with communities.

"The challenge now is to overlay this strategy with an absolute commitment to making New Zealand a sustainable country – right across the board, from our attitude to the environment to our businesses, communities and culture.

The level of expectation around 100% Pure is now far greater than ever before, Mr O'Connor said.

"Tourism is New Zealand's showcase industry and has to be aspirational in its vision and generate excitement to drive our country into the future.

"Over the term of the strategy, the world and New Zealand can expect to see accelerating change, with intensified pressures from climate change and rapid evolution in consumer attitudes and expectations, and that's why the strategy must be bold."

Mr O'Connor urged interested parties to read the document and make comments by the closing date of June 27.

"It is vital that as many people as possible understand the importance of this strategy and have an input into what is effectively a blueprint for the future of New Zealand's biggest export sector. Go to www.nztourismstrategy.com to have your say."
