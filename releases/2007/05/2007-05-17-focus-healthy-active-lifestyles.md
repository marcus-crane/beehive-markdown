Budget 2007 provides for a further expansion of funding for sport and recreation to promote healthy active lifestyles, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Funding is set to increase from $66.1 million in 2006/07 to $69.5 million in 2007/08. Sport and recreation funding has grown from $6.7 million in 2001/02 and is on top of lotteries grants funding of approximately $30.9 million.

The package includes more than $11.1 million for programmes in the coming year targeting children and young people as part of Sport and Recreation New Zealand’s (SPARC) contribution to the government’s ongoing $67.0 million four-year [Mission-On](http://www.sparc.org.nz/education/mission-on) initiative.

"New Zealand offers the opportunity to enjoy a quality outdoors lifestyle, regular physical activity, healthy food, a good education, and the opportunity to contribute to society and the economy," said Mr Mallard. "But we’re seeing increasingly sedentary lifestyles, which are affecting the health and prosperity of our children.

"The coming year will see the rollout of more Mission-On initiatives aimed at improving the lifestyles of young New Zealanders through improved nutrition and increased physical activity. It is one of the approaches that will help us achieve our vision for New Zealand of strong family units, healthy confident kids and better health for everyone."

The package also includes increases, largely previously announced, of $666,000 in direct athlete support through the Performance Enhancement Grants scheme to $4.2 million for 2007/08 and a doubling of SPARC’s investment in regional sports development to more than $2.8 million in 2007/08. Total funding for sport and recreation for the next four years is $261.7 million.

"If New Zealand is to compete at the highest levels on the world stage, we must not waiver in our commitment to the elite athlete programmes and our focus on developing regional sporting opportunities. This approach will provide a sustainable regional infrastructure to support sports at the national level," said Mr Mallard.
