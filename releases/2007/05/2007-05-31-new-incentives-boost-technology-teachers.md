A range of incentives have been developed to encourage more people to become technology teachers, including a new teaching qualification and making teaching scholarships more attractive, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"The Labour-led government is committed to making sure our schools deliver a full range of subjects with quality teachers, to maintain our world class education system.

"In the short term, the Ministry of Education will recruit trained technology teachers from overseas to improve the supply in schools.

"Waikato University is also seeking final approval to set up a purpose built technology teaching qualification, which includes a pathway for trades people to become teachers.

"The Bachelor of Education (Technology) degree could be available as early as next year, and will include a distance option so people can study it outside the Hamilton campus. It offers a combination of practical skills and teaching and technological knowledge to produce well-rounded, skilled technology teachers.

"The longer term solutions to boost technology teachers also include offering a 'career change' scholarship to encourage experienced trades people into teaching.

"And the Ministry will extend the existing TeachNZ scholarship to students who are almost-qualified trades people, to help them finish their training and start teacher education."

This opportunity for technology teaching will be directly promoted with Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) and other industry bodies.

"The Labour-led government has identified a shortage of technology teachers and acknowledges that some schools have difficulty recruiting them.

"These measures aim to immediately address that, and more work is being done to improve the rate of trades people entering the teaching profession in the future."
