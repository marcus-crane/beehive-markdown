News that the Labour-Progressive government's polices are driving investment in forestry will come as a bitter blow to National's Nick Smith, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Global financial giant Credit Suisse is backing London-based Sustainable Forestry Management, which has a US$200 million (NZ$275 million) fund to invest in Permanent Forest Sinks projects. SFM announced yesterday it would plant 100,000 hectares of trees here because of the Government's Permanent Forest Sink Initiative, which devolves carbon credits to landowners who planted trees. Further assistance was announced in the Budget to encourage landowners to plant trees on erosion-prone hill country.

Jim Anderton said the Government was close to finalising further climate change policy, which would include incentives for landowners to plant commercial forests and sensible arrangements to manage deforestation.

"Despite Nick Smith's scare stories, the business community is pumping $275 million into New Zealand forestry because Government policies enable growth," Jim Anderton said.

"I note that the MAF report on forestry plantations says the current deforestation is part of land-use correction going on in response to the booming dairy industry. The Government is certainly not opposed to people making the best use of their land, shifting from forestry to dairying, as this is of significant economic benefit to themselves and their communities.

"While the Government has been developing and implementing policy, some parties in Parliament, including National, have been playing politics with climate change. The Labour-Progressive Government has never doubted climate change, or the need for policies to respond to it. This is in stark contrast to National Party leader John Key, who has expressed doubt about climate change, and once described the Kyoto Protocol, which creates carbon credits as a 'hoax'."
