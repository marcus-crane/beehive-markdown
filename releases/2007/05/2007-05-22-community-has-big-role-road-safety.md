Community organisations, private companies and individuals can play a significant role in reducing the toll of death and injury on our roads, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

Harry Duynhoven presented the Road Safety Innovation and Achievement Awards at Parliament today.

“While government agencies can produce major campaigns on road safety and develop and enforce laws, the results will never be as good as when the community takes on the challenge of reinforcing these road safety messages as well as developing and managing road safety projects.

“In the past year, the ‘See you there…Safe As’ engagement programme went out into the community to seek ideas from the public on how to reduce the road toll. Excellent feedback and suggestions were received, some of which have been incorporated into policy papers being prepared for Cabinet to consider shortly. The ‘Safe As’ programme showed us the potential of tapping into the passion for road safety which exists in this country, and the calibre of the entries in these awards is another illustration of that.

“The supreme winner of today’s awards, the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society is a wonderful example of an organisation that has undoubtedly helped to save countless lives and injuries to children through its child car seat rental scheme. It is great to see community agencies working constructively together, alongside government, to come up with innovative and practical solutions.

“Reducing the toll of death and injury on our roads will only be achieved when everyone who uses the network makes well informed and socially responsible decisions. The community and winners of the Road Safety Innovation and Achievements Awards serve as excellent role models for others to follow,” said Harry Duynhoven today.
