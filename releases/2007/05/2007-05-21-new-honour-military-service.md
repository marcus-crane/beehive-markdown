Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced that the Queen has approved the institution of the New Zealand Distinguished Service Decoration (DSD).

“The DSD will recognise distinguished military service by regular, territorial and reserve members of the New Zealand Defence Force, including command, leadership, and service in an operational environment, or in support of operations,” Helen Clark said.

“Until 1995 this type of service was recognised by awards of the British Empire Medal (Military Division) and the lower levels of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire. Since the change to a totally New Zealand Honours system in 1996, awards at these levels have not been available," Phil Goff said.

“With the high level of operational activity being undertaken by the New Zealand Defence Force, the Distinguished Service Decoration is an important addition to the New Zealand Honours system. It will enjoy precedence comparable to that of The Queen’s Service Medal (QSM) and the recently instituted New Zealand Antarctic Medal (NZAM)," Mr Goff said.

"The first awards will be announced in the forthcoming Queen’s Birthday Honours list on Monday 4 June. Recipients will be entitled to use the initials “DSD.” and will receive their awards at the regular investitures at Government House," Helen Clark said.

"The new Decoration will be made of Sterling Silver. The obverse design is a representation of eight blades of a kotiate (lobed club) in a circle with a Royal Crown in the centre. The front four blades of the kotiate are in frosted silver, and the rear blades are polished silver. The reverse bears the inscription “For Distinguished Service” in English and Maori. The ribbon is dark blue and red, similar to the colours of the British Distinguished Service Order ribbon, with two narrow yellow stripes that signify achievement," Helen Clark said.

The DSD has been designed by the New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary, Mr Phillip O’Shea, CNZM, LVO.
