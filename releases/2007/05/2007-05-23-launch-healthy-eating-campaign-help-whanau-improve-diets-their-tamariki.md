Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui is delighted the launch of a healthy eating social marketing campaign 'Feeding our Futures' will support Maori parents and caregivers to achieve healthy diets for their tamariki.

The campaign has been launched by the Minister of Health Pete Hodgson at the Agencies for Nutrition Action conference in Rotorua.

Mita Ririnui says, "a mass-media campaign beginning today will target Maori, Pacific and low socio-economic communities about things they can do to improve the diets and eating practices of their tamariki."

"Feeding our Futures, developed by the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC) on behalf of the Ministry of Health, will initially focus on three key tips for parents and caregivers which include eating together as a whanau as often as possible, encourage tamariki to become involved in the preparation of kai and promoting water or milk as the first choice, because tamariki don't need sweet drinks."

Mita Ririnui says research undertaken by the HSC used to inform the development of the campaign found that eating together as a whanau around a dinner table is good for tamariki as they are more likely to eat healthier kai.

"Maori media are key to getting the message through to our communities and advertisements are set to feature on Maori Television and iwi radio for example, plus a number of Pacific and mainstream media channels."

Mr Ririnui says 'Feeding our Futures' is part of the Government's Healthy Eating - Healthy Action (HEHA) Strategy which aims to improve nutrition, increase physical activity and reduce obesity.

"Obesity is more of a problem for Maori and Pacific communities than other New Zealand population groups.Health inequalities being addressed by the HEHA Strategy are greatest between Maori and non-Maori and between Pacific peoples and non-Pacific, non-Maori people. 'Feeding our Futures' is one of the Ministry of Health's initiatives to reduce health inequalities and I am confident today's launch will go a long way to contributing towards that goal."

Mita Ririnui says over time, the social marketing campaign will build the knowledge and motivation which is necessary for improving the nutrition and diets of tamariki and their extended whanau.
