An options report for strengthening Auckland's governance structures to make the region more competitive has gone to Auckland councils for their consideration, Minister of Local Government Mark Burton said today.

The report builds on a proposal from Auckland councils to the Government in December 2006 that contained high-level options for changes to Auckland's strategic planning and local governance, and how these could be achieved with the agreement of Auckland Councils.

"Cabinet agreed in principle with that proposal and in particular its three key elements: the need for a stronger regional governance structure, an over-arching regional strategic plan and a forum to develop the plan."

The government and Auckland councils tasked senior central and local government officials to work together to develop the proposal further, he said.

Auckland councils are discussing the report's contents at a round of meetings between 23-30 May and provide their feedback for the next stage of the process.

"The joint process of cooperatively building a blueprint for Auckland's future is an iterative process.

"Most importantly, it is a process based on discussion and development of mutual understanding about what is required to achieve a strong future for the Auckland region. Officials will jointly bring together formal feedback from the options report meetings in a final report to be considered by Cabinet in July."

Mark Burton said ensuring Auckland's future as a world class, internationally competitive city and region was key for New Zealand's long-term success. Strong regional leadership was essential for delivering on Auckland's potential.

"The Government supports and encourages this joint process to develop and strengthen the governance of this critically important region."

Auckland Governance  
Questions and Answers

**What has been happening with the Auckland Governance Project since December 2006?**

Central government received the proposal from Auckland councils in December 2006. Cabinet agreed in principle with that proposal and in particular its three key elements: the need for a stronger regional governance structure, an over-arching regional strategic plan and a forum to develop the plan. Central and local government officials were tasked with developing the proposal further and options for action.

**Who is working on the project?**

Central and local government officials are working together on the project. Central and local government Chief Executives and officials are involved in steering and advisory groups to develop the proposals and report on progress to Auckland councils and the Minister of Local Government.

**What does the options report say?**

It is a refinement and development of the original proposal and identifies key options requiring a decision. The main components of which are:

- Greater Auckland Council (GAC), which would assume existing Auckland Regional Council role together with expanded role in regional economic development, tourism, funding and owning regional facilities and amenities, advocacy of regional issues, access to new funding sources;
- Development of 'One Plan', a strategic and coordinated vision for Auckland along with a set of priorities and an implementation plan, promoting social, economic, cultural and environmental well-being through a Regional Sustainable Development Forum;
- The Regional Sustainable Development Forum would be a standing committee of GAC and would develop the 'One Plan' for the GAC;
- Other regionally significant issues including management of water services, shared services and transport.

**How is this different from the December proposal?**

The December proposal identified several high level concepts for changes to Auckland's governance. This report has developed detailed options for action from the December proposal, which councils will now consider.

**What happens next?**

A series of meetings in which Auckland councils will discuss the report's contents will take place between 23 and 30 May. Feedback on the report will be collated in a final report for Cabinet to consider in July.

**What will change?**

The objective is to improve the governance and strategic planning arrangements for the city and region. The aim is to make changes that contribute to Auckland becoming a competitive, world-class city/region that is sustainable and contributes to the overall transformation of the New Zealand economy.

**This is a local issue so why is central government involved?**

Ensuring Auckland's future as a world class, internationally competitive city and region is a key part of New Zealand's long-term success. It is essential that both local and central government work together to strengthen Auckland governance.

**How will proposed changes improve the way Auckland is governed?**

The intention of this work is to achieve:

- greater coordination and more effective use of public spending in the Auckland region;
- greater leadership and consistency of approach across the region;
- improved economic and social performance; all of which will contribute to Auckland's future as a world class, internationally competitive city/region.

**What other information has informed the development of this report?**

Councils have used information gathered through public consultation on major plans such as growth strategies and long-term council plans in developing this report.

**How will this affect the local government elections?**

This will depend on the final report that goes to Central Government in July and what decisions are made. Should any changes be required before the October 2007 local authority elections, they will be widely communicated. Similarly, proposed changes that have implications beyond the 2007 local authority elections will also be clearly spelt out.

**How much will it cost to implement?**

When a preferred option is identified it will be fully scoped including any financial implications. A key aim of this process is to achieve improved value for money with a focus on efficiency and effectiveness of services and facilities.
