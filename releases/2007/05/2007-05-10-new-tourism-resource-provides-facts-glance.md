A new easy to read resource launched today will help tourism operators keep ahead of the game, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

The Tourism Ministry has produced a set of publications providing the latest research and statistics on the accommodation sector.

The documents, called Tourism Sector Profiles, cover hotels, motels, backpackers, bed & breakfasts and camping grounds, Mr O'Connor said.

"The profiles take about 10 minutes to read and give a statistical snapshot of the sector, providing accessible and easy to understand facts from the IVS, DTS, RVM and CAM, as well as a range of SNZ data.

"It’s a move away from large comprehensive reports, and is designed for convenience to aid time-strapped operators."

The data is a part of the Ministry's Tourism Analysis Programme, which has already led to a publication on domestic tourism. Research coming soon includes summary sheets on traveller types, and activities and attractions, Mr O'Connor said.
