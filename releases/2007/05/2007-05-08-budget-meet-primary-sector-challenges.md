A Budget allocation of $1 million has been made to fund a major summit for the primary industries on the subject of ‘succeeding in a changing global economy’, Jim Anderton, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, announced today.

"New Zealand’s economy is enormously dependent on our biological and natural resource-based industries. We have a primary sector which includes world-class economies of scale and world-leading technological capabilities," Jim Anderton said.

"We also face a number of key challenges, such as ensuring the sustainability of natural resources, and meeting and adapting to consumer preferences.

“Creating stronger primary industry sectors is a cornerstone of the Labour-Progressive coalition government’s Economic Transformation agenda."

The summit will take place in Christchurch on 28 and 29 November this year. Officials are already working with a number of leading primary sector businesses to develop the programme, which will include a number of high profile international speakers.

"As part of [Export Year](//www.exportyear.co.nz/%E2%80%9D), the summit will showcase some of the very best innovation and thinking in New Zealand’s primary industries and shine the spotlight on the importance of the primary sectors to the New Zealand economy.

“Holding a significant event like this also creates an opportunity for New Zealand industry leaders to hear and discuss a variety of perspectives on the challenges the sector faces. I expect it will also inspire those leaders to take the steps necessary to drive sustainable economic transformation," he said.
