**Speech to the Institute of Public Administration (IPANZ) Seminar, Wellington**

Thanks for the opportunity to talk to you this afternoon. I commend IPANZ for organising such a relevant and timely seminar on SOE governance issues.

I want to address some of the specific concerns and criticisms that have been made about the current SOE governance regime, but more specifically to start a conversation about how that regime can be improved.

Let me make four things clear from the outset:

Firstly, the Labour-led government is committed to the long term hold of all SOEs. That position appears to be held by all of the parties represented in Parliament with the exception of Act.

National is confused on the subject - as it is on a few policy areas. It says it may sell off some assets and the list seems fluid and it also says it favours partial privatisation. But by and large it appears to support the government's position on long-term hold.

The result is that barring a major shift in the political landscape, the SOE governance framework will have to operate within the context of government ownership for the foreseeable future.

We need to look to enduring governance arrangements for SOEs. This is not a debate about options for the immediate future.

Secondly, just as shareholders in private sector companies have certain decision-making rights concerning the governance of the companies they partly own, so too does the government as shareholder have legitimate rights over the governance of SOEs.

One of the major drivers of the recent resurgence of private equity investments and takeovers around the world is that there are virtues of governing even profit-oriented companies outside the goldfish bowl of continuous disclosure that is now associated with public listing.

My third point is that the Crown, as owner, does compete at the top level for director talent.

I have high regard for the quality and commitment of SOE directors, and the calibre of prospective new directors and I don't buy the nonsensical claims of political cronyism in appointments.

My faith in the system does not imply however, that improvements cannot be made.

Finally, while SOEs are already an important contributor to New Zealand’s economic transformation, they have the capacity and capability to achieve more. Recognition of this fact was behind my announcement in June last year, encouraging SOEs to diversify into adjacent markets, products and technologies.

Because of their important role as a vehicle for economic transformation, the government - in its role as shareholder - expects to have some influence over their strategic direction.

Let me turn first to the SOE appointment and governance regime.

As Minister for State Owned Enterprises I am directly responsible for the appointment of directors to the boards of 19 SOEs. Each year approximately one-third of directors’ terms come up for renewal and around half of these result in new appointments.

My impression is that we are somewhat more active in refreshing our governance structures than is the private sector, where extended tenures are more common.

I regard this as a virtue, and as a defence against so-called cronyism. In fact one of the major criticisms of private sector governance is that an old-boys club of inter-locking directorships is a barrier to effective shareholder democracy.

These appointments take place in the context of the wider Crown environment, where there are over 400 boards that have directors appointed to them, with about 400 new appointments considered ever year. So, I have a very small slice of the Crown appointments ‘market’ - albeit the most commercially-focussed one.

Director appointments and reappointments generally occur twice a year, to coincide with term end dates in April and October.

A five stage appointment process is followed:

1\. Skills Profiling

CCMAU (Crown Company Advisory Unit) continuously analyses each company’s status, performance and board composition, to determine the optimal skills and experience required and those that would be ideal in any new appointee. This is done in conjunction with the chair of each company and me.

The chair provides the vital link to the board here, and is expected to have a view about what is required around the board table and what the views of directors are.

2\. Candidate Identification

When specific positions are under consideration, wide ranging candidate search processes are followed to identify as broad a range of candidates for consideration as possible.  
And yes there is a political element in this - I, like all ministers, formally seek feedback from my caucus colleagues on candidates that they think have the skills - and I stress the word "skills" - to serve on boards. But at the same time as CCMAU requests nominations from other agencies, such as: Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Te Puni Kokiri, and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.

CCMAU also searches its database of around 2,000 CVs, for candidates matching the requirements of each board. Importantly, all "vacancies" are listed on CCMAU’s website allowing anyone with an interest to express it.  
This leads to the identification of a huge range of candidate options.

3\. Short-listing

I consider a long-list of applicants for each role, and - taking into account the wishes of the chair and the advice of CCMAU - short-list preferred candidates that match the skill needs of each board.

4\. Due diligence

Short-listed candidates are put through a due diligence process before final decisions are made. This provides an opportunity for candidates to assess the possible role, and for the chair and CCMAU to form a view about each candidate’s suitability and whether or not there are any known or potential conflicts of interest.  
The chair’s role here is critical - as I am relying on them to advise me how these candidates will fit into the board.

5\. Appointment

After the preferred candidate has confirmed his or her availability to serve on a board, I advise the Cabinet Appointment and Honours Committee accordingly. After further consideration by the full Cabinet, the appointment is confirmed, and the company and successful candidate advised.  
This process has evolved over time, to ensure a robust and transparent appointment process, but also one that manages the political realities of Crown ownership.

Underpinning this entire process is one fundamental principle.

First and foremost, shareholding ministers seek to appoint the best qualified directors regardless of their political persuasion, and irrespective of their sex or race. I have an equal opportunity appointment policy for SOE boards that tends to act as a tie-breaker.

A secondary principle relates to providing opportunities for promising new directors.

Shareholding ministers acknowledge the "public good" associated with experienced directors, in that the greater the pool of such directors, the more competitive the market for director services, resulting in better corporate outcomes for business in the private sector.

But this creates a Catch 22 situation - you usually need experience to get a directorship, but how can you get experience if you can’t get your initial appointment?

So the Crown is a big appointer of first time directors, but not at the risk of compromising the integrity and capability of any SOE board. It is important to remember that a new appointee adds at the margin: continuity and institutional knowledge are carried forward by incumbent directors.

The criticisms of the appointment process fail to take into account the crucial role played by the chair of each board through the entire appointment process.

I will not proceed through any process unless I know what the chair’s views are. Of course, I may take a different view.

But that is my duty. I, and the other relevant shareholding Minister own the company on behalf of the public at large, and are accountable to it through Select Committee scrutiny, parliamentary questioning and, of course, ultimate electorate reappointment.

The chair is not accountable in the same way, even if occasional Select Committee presentations may cause a degree of embarrassment .

The point is that there are no capital market disciplines on directors in a public ownership/ hold-in-perpetuity model, and we cannot give chairs any veto on appointments in case we end up with the worst of all worlds: unelected cronyism.

Whatever you think of the outcomes, be assured that I go to great lengths to ensure that appropriate candidates are identified and interviewed to meet specific board requirements.

I have already said that the single most important principle of the selection process is to select the best qualified director for each position.

While issues of diversity are important, they are not pursued at the expense of board capability. And I do not believe at all that diversity dilutes competence.

Diversity in our corporate governance has been sadly lacking over the last half century or more, and there is a strong argument that it shows. I firmly believe that as a country, we have failed to capture the full potential of more diverse perspectives being brought to the guidance of our major institutions, including commercial ones.

The current SOE governance regime is also criticised for a high turnover of directors.

I would appreciate some advice on what an appropriate turnover rate might be.

We probably lose about 15 directors a year out of the portfolio - but there’s no particular trend pursued here - each board is considered on an individual basis and we do place considerable emphasis on balancing continuity of expertise with the need to introduce new skills. I repeat my earlier observation that the flip side of turnover is ossification.

These days directors do not automatically retire just because they have completed two terms on the board. I am increasingly open to extending a director’s tenure beyond six years if they continue to make a strong contribution to the board and commercial success of the company.

Equally, I have no hesitation in not reappointing a director after one term if they are not performing up to expectations or if the needs of the company have changed.

I take some comfort from the survey finding that the majority of directors see themselves as having the opportunity and capability to influence the strategic direction of their company.  
This is particularly significant in the context of the SOE diversification agenda I discussed earlier. It suggests that directors feel in control of the decision-making associated with any new initiatives put forward by management.

On the issue of performance management and evaluation, I agree that improvements can be made. Dare I say it that this applies to the private sector as well.

In this regard, I note the recent initiative by CCMAU and the Treasury to appoint private sector equity analysts to assess the market performance of the three SOE electricity generators & retailers: Meridian, Genesis and Mighty River Power.

While the traditional market performance management of SOEs will always be relatively constrained by the absence of a transparent share price, the more market disciplines we can bring to bear on their performance, the more accountable they will become and all else being equal, the better they should perform.

You should not underestimate the importance that shareholding ministers place on this issue, given the nature of SOEs - that they are expected to be as profitable and efficient as comparable private sector companies.

As for concerns about the level of compensation for SOE directors, there needs to be recognition of the element of public service involved in serving on SOE boards.

It is unlikely that SOE directors will ever be paid fees comparable to their private sector counterparts. Directors go into these boards with there eyes open about the fees environment - and we have no problem finding suitably qualified directors willing to serve. This does not imply that I am unaware of or unconcerned with this issue however. CCMAU regularly reviews the fees structure, and Cabinet regularly considers adjusting it according to movements in the marketplace.

Concluding, I am on the whole satisfied with the current SOE governance regime. The current regime has evolved over time to achieve a robust and transparent process, while accommodating the political constraints associated with Crown ownership.

These comments do not imply that the current system is perfect. I am always open to change, and I have no doubt that the regime will continue to evolve in response to new theories, expectations and market disciplines.

Specifically, we are moving away from expectations of directors that they are good trustees as they nurture SOEs in the period before their sale. Increasingly we are looking for imaginative directors who can, on the one hand, identify opportunities for diversification, but on the other discipline the enthusiasm of managements that do not need to face their capital market tormentors every morning.

Funnily enough, this is precisely what private equity companies are seeking from the directors they appoint within their portfolios.

I welcome your comments and suggestions as to how the current regime can be improved.
