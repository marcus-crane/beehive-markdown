Businesses and individuals involved in trans-Tasman civil legal cases are set to benefit from reforms that will make the legal process easier and more affordable.

The New Zealand Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove and the Australian Attorney-General Philip Ruddock and today announced that the Australian and New Zealand governments have agreed to reforms proposed by a trans Tasman working group.

The next step in implementing the reforms will be to negotiate a new bilateral treaty between the two countries covering civil court proceedings and enforcement of judgments.

This agreement, once finalised, will represent an unprecedented level of cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in civil court proceedings.

The agreement will also enhance the effectiveness of civil court proceedings in both countries, as parties will no longer be able to avoid the consequences of a judgment by moving themselves or their assets from one country to the other.

The Ministers said this would benefit both businesses and individuals involved in legal disputes across the Tasman.

Being able to resolve trans-Tasman disputes more effectively and at lower cost supports closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand and will underpin a broad range of other trans-Tasman initiatives.

The reforms will also increase the effectiveness of each country’s regulatory rules. Under the new arrangements, fines in a range of areas deemed to be of mutual interest, such as securities offerings made to the public, will be enforceable across the Tasman.

In developing the detail of the reforms, the New Zealand and Australian governments will consult widely with stakeholders in both countries.

Following conclusion of the treaty, both governments will introduce legislation to implement the arrangements in each country. The Ministers expect good progress to be made during 2007.

These reforms are based on recommendations made in December 2006 by the Trans-Tasman Working Group on Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement.
