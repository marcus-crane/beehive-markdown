An independent Board of Inquiry will hear public views on a proposed national policy statement on electricity transmission, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"The Government considers that national guidance on electricity transmission is important for every section of society and business," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The purpose of the policy statement is to recognise the national significance of the electricity transmission network. It sets out objectives and policies for managing the national grid under the Resource Management Act.

"We must prepare for the future. Everyone needs electricity, and with population growth and increasing demand for electricity we need to recognise the benefits of improving, upgrading and extending the national grid," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope has appointed the following Board of Inquiry:

- Hon Peter Salmon – a retired High Court judge (Chair)
- Russell Howie – an Environment Court Commissioner,
- Prue Kapua – a specialist resource management lawyer.

The proposed national policy statement will be publicly notified this month and submissions will be invited. The Board will hold a hearing to consider those submissions and will provide a report to the Minister by the end of the year.

“Local authorities will continue to have responsibility for ensuring all relevant environmental effects are appropriately considered.

“The proposed policy together with national environmental standards which will follow, will provide guidance on electricity transmission to local authorities and decision-makers," said Mr Benson-Pope.
