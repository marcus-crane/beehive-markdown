Government funds innovative local youth projects

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced today that 16 local councils have been granted funding of more than $1.3million for a range of innovative youth projects to help young people gain local employment, further education or training.

"It's great to see central and local government along with the community, working together by investing in the needs of young people to improve engagement, foster leadership, increase participation and conduct a whole range of events and activities for young people," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Youth Development partnership fund, administered by the Ministry of Youth Development, works with local councils to help achieve positive social, economic and wellbeing outcomes for young people by developing work and learning skills.

“The fund prioritises education, training and employment, and aligns to the priorities set by the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs. The successful projects range from enterprise, further learning enhancement, leadership, participation, and producing youth friendly resources.”

The Minister says the fund aims to encourage community groups and councils to work together on local projects that target the specific needs of young people.

"It's an opportunity to take an innovative approach to youth development and can make a real impact."

Past projects include the Dunedin City Council's Audacious Business Challenge which provided young entrepreneurs with the inspiration and tools required to see their business ideas through to fruition. The project has led to young people securing successful employment opportunities and connected them with mentors and business partnerships. Two ideas were selected for the television programme, Dragon's Den.

The Far North Futures Project provided motivated young people, who were registered with Work and Income, with work experience in local businesses, drivers licence and first aid training as well as personal development to better prepare them for the workforce.

"These are just a couple of examples where the Youth Development partnership fund has made a difference to communities thinking differently about meeting the needs of their young people."

“It's great to be announcing these successful projects at the end of Youth Week 2007, a national campaign celebrated over the last week to recognise the positive contribution that young people make to their communities.”
