Prime Minister Helen Clark today said New Zealand's long history of working towards peace and security has been recognised with its 2nd place ranking on the inaugural [Global Peace Index](http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9266967) launched in London overnight.

Helen Clark said New Zealand’s high ranking reflects the Government’s strong commitment to peace and security – at home and in its relations with other countries.

“We will continue to further our agenda for a peaceful, secure world through a number of different fora, including the United Nations”, Helen Clark said.

“The ranking recognises New Zealand's longstanding contribution to international peacekeeping. New Zealand is a significant contributor to both UN-led and regional peacekeeping missions.

“New Zealand has played its part in promoting peace and prosperity. We have deployed forces to restore stability in Timor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Bougainville, Afghanistan and other troubled places around the world.

“[Our hosting](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F29495) of the [Alliance of Civilisations High Level symposium](http://www.unaoc.org/aoc.php?page=33) last week and the [Waitangi Regional Interfaith Dialogue]() this week are examples of the positive role New Zealand is taking to encourage inter-religious and inter-cultural understanding and co-operation, Helen Clark said.

“These dialogues are an important way of building relationships across the boundaries of civilisations and religions and thus have the potential to make an important contribution to world peace and security.

“Our firm commitment to international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, in particular our strong stance on nuclear disarmament, are key elements of New Zealand policy. Our principled stance contributes to New Zealand’s reputation as a world leader in peace and security” Helen Clark said.

The report comments that “New Zealand’s lofty position in the Global Peace Index partly reflects its lack of internal and external conflicts and its very good relations with neighbouring countries.”

The report specifically points out that New Zealand’s stable political scene and its measures of domestic safety and security all contributed to New Zealand’s high ranking.

The Global Peace Index is a new initiative aimed at assessing over time the levels of peace in 120 selected countries. The index is composed of 24 indicators, ranging from a nation’s level of military expenditure to its relations with neighbouring countries and the level of respect for human rights.

The Economist Intelligence Unit helped in developing the methodology underlying the index, and collecting the required data. The Unit used the latest available figures (mainly from 2004-06).
