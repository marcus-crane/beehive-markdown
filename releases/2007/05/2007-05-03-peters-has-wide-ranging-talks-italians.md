Foreign Minister Winston Peters held constructive and wide-ranging talks with his Italian counterpart Massimo D’Alema in Rome on Wednesday (overnight NZT).

"Today's meeting provided an ideal opportunity to reinforce the close relationship between New Zealand and Italy, and to discuss our growing, multifaceted commercial relationship," Mr Peters said.

"Italy is a significant player in the European Union, which it helped establish through the Treaty of Rome 50 years ago, and we were interested to hear their views on current EU issues.

"There were extensive discussions on New Zealand's engagement in the Pacific, during which we expressed our gratitude for Italy’s growing interest and financial contribution in the region.

“The talks also covered a range of international topics where New Zealand and Italy have mutual interest, particularly the situation in Afghanistan, where Italy has a number of troops, the Middle East, Antarctica – where we work closely together – and our support for Italy's initiative to seek a moratorium on the death penalty.”

Mr Peters also held constructive meetings with Umberto Ranieri, President of the Chamber of Deputies’ Foreign Affairs Committee, and with Gianni Vernetti, Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for New Zealand and Antarctica.

From Rome, Mr Peters will travel to Berlin for the latest round of New Zealand’s six-monthly consultations with the European Union Presidency, which is currently held by Germany.
