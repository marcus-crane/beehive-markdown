Cabinet has agreed to a $21.2m project to upgrade the self protection system fitted to the C-130 Hercules aircraft, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"The C-130 fleet provides the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) with an essential air transport capability for a wide variety of roles and tasks. It is vital that we ensure that the aircraft and the NZDF personnel travelling onboard are protected against possible threats," Mr Goff said.

"The aircraft frequently operate in locations such as Afghanistan where there are potential ground based, anti-aircraft threats. The C-130 fleet has been equipped with a self-protection capability since the 1990s. However a significant escalation in the sophistication and availability of anti-aircraft missiles means it is appropriate to upgrade the existing system to meet this evolving threat.

"This self-protection system work will be completed as part of the C-130 Life Extension Project currently being undertaken by L-3 Communications Spar Aerospace to extend the life of the C-130 Hercules fleet through avionics, aircraft systems and structural upgrades.

"The project will be funded from within the Defence Long Term Development Plan.

"The system we have chosen for the upgrade is in widespread global use and will also be fitted to the NH90 helicopters, providing additional cost efficiencies from operating a common system across aircraft types.

"This government has committed to ensuring that the NZDF has the equipment necessary to do the jobs we are asking it to do and that our defence force personnel are properly protected as they carry out their responsibilities on behalf of New Zealand", said Phil Goff.
