Justice Minister Mark Burton today welcomed support from National's Simon Power for the prompt passing of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill.

The Bill, which aims to reduce crime and address New Zealand's growing prison population, is currently before the Justice and Electoral Select Committee. The Committee has reopened the public submission process to allow for public feedback on amendments proposed to the Bill that aim to strengthen the parole system.

"Simon Power's concerns, reported in the NZ Herald today, that the Criminal Justice Reform Bill will now pass a little later this year so that it can include changes to the parole act, suggests he may now change his vote and support the passing of this Bill.

"Whilst it is surprising that Simon Power does not seem to support taking the time necessary to make changes to strengthen parole rules, I look forward to his support for the Bill's next reading.

"I hope that Mr Power will also convince his colleagues in the National party of the importance of passing this legislation," Mark Burton said.

When passed the Bill will make several significant changes to parole. The Bill will move eligibility to apply for parole from one-third of a sentence being served to two thirds. The Bill will also allow the Parole Board to monitor compliance of specific offenders on parole and establish a Sentencing Council to draft parole guidelines.

Amendments to the Bill were introduced following the outcome of investigations into the Graeme Burton case. These changes include making it clear that parole is a privilege, not an entitlement. There will also be changes to the way the Parole Board receives its information and changes to strengthen the Board's power to call evidence or witnesses. The Board will also be able to receive direct applications from the Police for recall where they believe there is a risk to public safety.

"Based on the most up-to-date prison population figures the additional time asked for by the Select Committee is both preferable and will not cause undue pressure on prison bed numbers," Mark Burton said.

The Criminal Justice Reform Bill had its first reading in Parliament in December. The House voted 71-50 in support of the Bill progressing to the Justice and Electoral Select Committee. All parties in the House except for National and Act voted in support of the Bill at its first reading.
