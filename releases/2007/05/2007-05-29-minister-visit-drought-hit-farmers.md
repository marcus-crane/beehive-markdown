Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton is to visit North Island East Coast farmers hit by drought to see first hand what conditions they are facing and what further assistance the Government can provide.

Sheep and beef farmers in the Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, and Wairarapa regions are affected by drought, with many coastal and middle areas receiving less than half the normally expected rainfall this year.

Many farmers had carried extra stock through late summer and autumn, hoping that the meat schedule and store lamb prices would improve, and that autumn rains would allow the stock to gain weight. The autumn rains have not arrived, and though temperatures have been relatively mild, a shortage of feed has meant stock conditions have deteriorated.

Mr Anderton said that if rain did not arrive soon, there would be a shortage of feed when winter arrived. In some areas, there are already supplementary feed and water shortages.

"Farmers are having to make some pretty tough decisions about what to do with their stock, in order to manage the effects of the drought and its potential impact on farming communities."

Mr Anderton said the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry was paying $20,000 from its Adverse Events contingency fund for farmer meetings to provide expert advice for farmers in Gisborne and Wairarapa, along with industry organisation Meat and Wool NZ. Meat and Wool NZ and local sponsors are also paying for meetings in Hawke's Bay.

He said that MAF had updated its website with drought resources for farmers, and was in discussion with farm leaders about setting up a grazing register to allow feed from other areas to be made available to farmers in affected regions.

"IRD has been advised of the drought and will put its adverse events provisions in place. This will enable farmers to extend the deadline to deposit funds from the sale of capital stock in Income Equalisation accounts on more favourable terms without incurring additional income tax liabilities.

"MAF and the Social Development Ministry are also to discuss the need for welfare provisions to be available as winter develops."

Mr Anderton said further resources would be considered as needs became clearer. This would be done through the provisions of the On-Farm Readiness and Recovery Plan for Adverse Climatic Events announced earlier this month.

"I urge farmers to attend drought field-days in their area, and to take whatever help is available. In particular, farmers need to look out for neighbours who may be under stress and help them to make early decisions as these will help them and their stock to get through this drought in the best possible condition."
