Defence Minister Phil Goff leaves tonight for Timor-Leste to visit New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) and Police personnel and meet with government and security officials. From Timor-Leste he will travel to Singapore where he will attend regional defence talks.

“I will be in Timor-Leste from 29-31 May where I will visit New Zealand Defence Force and Police personnel who have been working to assist Timor-Leste achieve security and stability. While with the New Zealanders I will accompany New Zealand Army personnel on a night patrol in Dili.

"I will also meet with the newly elected President, José Ramos-Horta, who I have known for nearly 20 years, the care-taker Prime Minister, Estanislau da Silva, and key senior military and UN officials", said Mr Goff.

"This will be my second visit to Timor-Leste as Defence Minister and I am looking forward to returning and getting a first hand understanding of the current political and security situation.

"From Timor-Leste I will travel to Singapore for the 6th Asia Security Summit, commonly known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, from 1-3 June.

“The Shangri-La Dialogue is the key forum for discussing public policy on defence and security in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand has always been a strong supporter of the Shangri-La Dialogue, and the Defence Minister has attended every year.

"The 2007 Dialogue will involve the largest number of participants yet, with delegates drawn from 26 countries and I will take advantage of this opportunity to meet with my colleagues from Australia, Singapore, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Germany", said Mr Goff.
