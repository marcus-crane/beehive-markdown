Judith Collins sank to new lows as she laughed her way through Question Time in the House today at the expense of people on Sickness and Invalid's benefits, said Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope.

"People are granted a Sickness Benefit on the advice of doctors if they become sick, injured, pregnant, or disabled and otherwise qualify," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"People are granted an Invalid's Benefit on the advice of doctors if they have a sickness, injury or disability that is expected to last at least 2 years, or have a life expectancy that is expected to be less than 2 years, or who are blind and otherwise qualify.

"For Judith Collins to find humour in their circumstances is disgraceful.

"The government has been successfully dealing with an international trend of increases in Sickness and Invalid's-related beneficiaries against a backdrop of a worldwide ageing population.

"The success of our policy is in keeping the rate of receipt of Sickness and Invalids benefit in New Zealand to around 4.5 percent of the working age population, in comparison to Australia's higher rate of 5.2 percent, and the United Kingdom's rate of 7 percent.

"The number of people on Invalid’s and Sickness-related benefits aged 50 to 64 years old, as a percentage of the total Invalid’s and Sickness-related benefit population has steadily increased from 36% in 1999 to 42% today. This age group is more susceptible to illness, disease and injury.

"Those who become sick, injured or disabled would have everything to fear if the like of Judith Collins ever got into government. She clearly resents the sick accessing benefits, and she clearly resents spending public funds on supporting them back into work," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"I know Judith Collins finds it difficult to accept that total benefit numbers, including Sickness and Invalids benefits, have fallen by 136,000 or 34% since 1999 when National was in government.

"That does not mean that she should turn on a relatively small group of people because they have become ill, pregnant, disabled or have a shorter life expectancy and are in need of our support.

"The Labour-led government is about supporting people, and is in the process of rolling out further support through the Working New Zealand: Work Focused Support package," said Mr Benson-Pope.
