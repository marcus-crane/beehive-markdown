Justice Minister Mark Burton today encouraged people concerned about gangs and organised crime to make a submission to the Select Committee considering the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Bill.

"This Bill will mean the authorities can more easily confiscate the proceeds of criminal activities from crime gangs, and in turn take away the very incentive for these groups to commit crime," Mark Burton said.

"While those at the bottom of the criminal food chain are the most obvious elements of organised crime in our community, we've got to cut the oxygen off from these organisations at their leadership – this is the intention of the new Bill."

"Public submissions on the Bill close on Wednesday 16 May and the government would consider any new proposals that could strengthen this bill's effectiveness further."

The new legislation is an important part of the government's broader initiatives to combat gangs and organised crime. Other recent initiatives include:

- The National Interception Centre (NIC), which undertakes electronic intelligence aimed at organised crime and gang involvement in the drug trade received additional funding from 2004 allowing for a significant increase in staff.
- The Sentencing Act 2002 introduced tougher sentences for the worst murders, lifting the standard non-parole period within a life sentence for those murderers from 10 to 17 years.
- Changes to the Bail Act in 2000 made it much harder for recidivist offenders to obtain bail, by reversing the usual onus of proof to ensure that they have to persuade the court not to lock them up, rather than vice versa.
- The Criminal Justice Reform Bill will move eligibility to apply for parole from one-third of a sentence being served to two thirds. Additional amendments to the Bill will allow the Police as well as Corrections to seek the recall of an offender on parole, and enable confidential evidence to be heard by the Parole Board. These changes will help to keep those who continue to be a threat to society out of our communities. More often than not, these people come from criminal gangs and organised crime.
- Justice and the Police are jointly undertaking the establishment of an organised crime strategy.
- A range of cross-government approaches, focusing on housing needs, youth education, and employment opportunities exist that deal with the underlying problems of gangs and gang families.
- The government has made changes to legislation aimed at keeping criminal elements out of prostitution. The Prostitution Reform Act 2003, Section 36, disqualifies anyone from holding an operator's licence if convicted under Section 98A of the Crimes Act.
- The government made it harder for stolen goods to be disposed of by criminals via secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers, while making it easier to recover such goods and solve property crimes. This was the aim of the Secondhand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 2004, which was passed in 2004.
- In 2006 MSD launched Improving Outcomes for Young People in Counties Manukau. This 26-point action plan is intended to reduce the incidence and impact of youth gangs in South Auckland. Links have been established between some adult and youth gangs and it's clear that youth gangs provide a fertile recruitment ground for adult gangs.
- Additional cross-government programmes that have an impact on gang activity includes MSD’s Vulnerable Families project, which focuses on specific families with multiple social needs and significant state dependency.
- In Wanganui, there is a multi-agency approach to gang related issues, led by Police and involving other agencies including MSD, Education and Housing New Zealand. Some 12 months ago the Wanganui District Commander commenced a gang operation to respond to inter-gang offending. To date, the operation has resulted in over 100 arrests for various charges including Fire Arms, and Intimidation.

"In terms of existing legislation, section 98A of the Crimes Act makes it illegal to participate in a criminal group. However, this has had mixed results in addressing the problem. I have instructed Justice officials to review this section of the Act with the aim of improving its impact.

"Officials from relevant agencies including the Crime Prevention Unit, Police and Corrections will bring together a comprehensive situation report for Ministers this week, looking at what is being done around gangs and organised crime and what other options might be available.

"If there are further credible options available that aren't yet being pursued in combating organised crime and criminal gangs, then we'll certainly give them serious consideration."
