Kate Wilkinson today demonstrated when it comes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme established by the Labour-led government in 2002, she is cut from the same cloth as deposed National Party leader Don Brash, said Labour  
Minister Ruth Dyson.

Off the back of a recent evaluation of the scheme by the Department of Labour, which showed the scheme is embraced by New Zealanders and has been taken up by 80% of eligible women, Ms Wilkinson showed her back-to-the-1990s attitude to workers with her comments that when it comes to home life "the state should butt out".

"Just like Don Brash, who cited parental leave as a failure in the deregulation of the labour market, Ms Wilkinson displays a similar attitude that when it comes to workers and their entitlements, National cannot be trusted," said Ruth Dyson

"In contrast, this Labour-led government has widened eligibility for the paid leave scheme, including extending it to the self-employed last year, and is committed to considering its further extension."
