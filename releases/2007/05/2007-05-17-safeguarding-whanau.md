Budget 2007 is investing $2 million over the next year in the training and support of people working to prevent violence in Mâori whânau and communities.

There is a high prevalence of violence within too many Mâori communities and Mâori are significantly over-represented as both victims and perpetrators of violence within Aotearoa/New Zealand.

"This is something we must acknowledge and tackle - and we have to do it in a way that is relevant to our whânau," Mr Horomia said.

"The Mauri Ora Framework has been developed specifically to enable Mâori to address whânau violence in a culturally appropriate and meaningful way."

The new funding will see on-going training support, resources and services for 60 family violence prevention practitioners, including those delivering Mauri Ora training.

It will also fund a working group to advise the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families on the implementation of initiatives to reduce violence within whânau and Mâori communities, Mr Horomia said.

Whakamaru i ngā Whānau.

E $2 miriona e whakahaumitia ana e te Tahua Pūtea 2007, a te tau kei mua, ki te whakangungu me te tautoko i ngā tāngata e mahi ana ki te aukati whakarekereke ki roto i ngā whānau, me ngā hapori Māori.

Kei te kaha rawa ngā āhuatanga whakarekereke kei roto i ngā hapori Māori maha rawa, me te māngaitanga tāpua a te Māori hei pārurenga, hei kaihanga whakarekereke ki roto o Aotearoa.

“Koia nei tētahi āhuatanga me whākina e tātou, ka whakatika – ā, me whakamahia tēnei i raro i ngā whakaritenga e hāngai pū ana ki a tātou whänau,” i kī ai a Horomia.

“Kua whanaketia te Pou Tarāwaho Mauri Ora, motuhake hei whakakaha i te Māori ki te aukati i te whakarekereke whānau i raro i ngā whakahaere tīkanga tōtika, me ngā whakahaere whaihua.”

I raro i tēnei pūtea hou ka tautokona ngā whakangungu e haere tonu ana, ngā rawa, me ngā ratonga kaimahi aukati whakarekereke whānau, e 60 rātou, tāpiri atu ki a rātou kei te kawe i ngā whakangungu mō Mauri Ora.

Ka whakawhiwhi pūtea anō te tahua, mō tētahi rōpū hei tohutohu i te Rōpū Mahi mō ngā Whakahaere Aukati Whakarekereke i roto i ngā Whānau, mō te whakamahinga i ngā kōkiri ki te whakaheke i te whakarekereke i roto i ngā whānau me ngā hapori Māori, i kī a Horomia.
