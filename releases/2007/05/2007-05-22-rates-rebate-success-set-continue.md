Up to $70 million has been allocated for the Rates Rebate scheme for the 2007/08 rating year, Minister of Local Government Mark Burton told Parliament today.

"The allocation made in the Budget recognises the strong support for the expanded scheme. Over the past eleven months more than $45 million has been paid in rates rebates to households across the country."

The latest figures showed that $45,857,704 has been paid to 102,228 households since the expanded scheme came into effect on 1 July 2006. The average rates rebate per household is now $448.

"The expanded rates rebate scheme has proven a success for many thousands of New Zealand ratepayers, particularly for those on fixed or lower incomes such as the elderly.

"It's not too late either for those who think they may be eligible but haven't yet applied. Applications for a rates rebate for the 2006/07 rating year can be made up until 30 June.

"Rates rebate eligibility depends on a combination of income and rates levels, along with the number of dependents. For example, a married couple that received NZ Superannuation of $24,456 and is paying annual rates of $1,746 or more would be entitled to a maximum rates rebate of $500. A married couple that received NZ Superannuation of $24,456 and is paying annual rates of $1,300 would be entitled to a rates rebate of $203. People who think they may be eligible should contact their local council.

"Through initiatives such as Kiwisaver, Working for Families and Rates Rebates, this government is helping New Zealand families to build secure futures."
