Education Minister Steve Maharey today congratulated New Zealand's best and brightest secondary school students at the Top Scholar Award Ceremony.

32 students received awards at today's ceremony at Government House.

"Scholarship is about encouraging our most promising students to aim high and then recognising and rewarding their achievements," Steve Maharey said. "These results are evidence of both the determination and the talent among Kiwi students.

"The 32 scholars have in many cases exceeded expectations. A number have excelled not only in their specialist subjects, but across a range of subjects.

"The scholars faced some of the most challenging school examinations ever seen in this country. The fact that last year's Scholarship exams ran so well demonstrates that our assessment system is in good health and is providing challenges for our most able students.

“We must have a learning system that ensures every student – whatever their age or background – is engaged in and excited by their learning, and able to achieve their potential. We have built that system and we are working on ways to enhance it – that is part of a commitment to continuous improvement."

Ten of the students received premier awards, worth $10,000 a year for three years (as long as students maintain a B grade average in tertiary studies). These are awarded to the top 10 candidates in the country, gaining at least three Scholarships at Outstanding level.

27 students received the Top Subject Scholar Award worth $2000 a year for three years (as long as students maintain a B grade average in tertiary studies). It is awarded to the top performer in each subject.
