A programme that aims to reduce aggressive behaviour in school children was launched today by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope.

Roots of Empathy, a Canadian programme run in New Zealand by The Peace Foundation, aims to improve empathy, teach parenting skills and reduce bullying levels among school children. It involves regular visits to the classroom by a parent and baby and a Roots of Empathy instructor.

The children observe the baby’s development, celebrate milestones, interact with the baby and learn about an infant’s needs and feelings. Through the visits and interactions, the children learn how to understand their own feelings and the feelings of others.

Helen Clark and David Benson-Pope today attended the launch at a primary school in Otara, in Auckland.

"We know that effective, early interventions for families and their children have positive, long-term, wide-ranging effects. The Labour-led government is introducing programmes such as these to help give our children the best possible start in life," Helen Clark said.

"Early interventions such as this one are key to improving children’s health and education, they reduce the likelihood of adult offending or long-term unemployment, and they help reduce family abuse or neglect.

"It is a fitting way to mark the end of Youth Week," Helen Clark said.

The three-year trial is co-funded by the Ministries of Social Development, Education and Health. It forms part of the Government’s $7 million Early Years package.

"Roots of Empathy is focused on preventing problems like bullying and aggression occurring at school and later in life. Past studies on Roots of Empathy in Canada show that teaching empathy in classrooms can increase the levels of emotional understanding and decrease levels of aggression," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Roots of Empathy has run successfully in Canada for ten years and worldwide 160,000 students participate in the programme.

The programme will initially be introduced to Year 5 students at ten schools in Auckland and by year three will be in 100 schools in Auckland, Wellington and a third centre.
