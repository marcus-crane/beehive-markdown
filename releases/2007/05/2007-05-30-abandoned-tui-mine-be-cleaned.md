The Government has contributed $9.88 million to clean up one of New Zealand’s most contaminated sites, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

During a visit today to the abandoned Tui mine near Te Aroha, Mr Benson-Pope said that in Budget 2007 the Government has allocated $4.94 million to the clean-up in each of the next two financial years.

Mr Benson-Pope said the project was a prime example of the Labour-led Government working with territorial authorities to benefit all New Zealanders, and remove a threat to this country’s treasured clean, green, image.

Tui was abandoned in 1973, but piles of waste rock, ore dumps and mine tailings blight the landscape at the foot of the Kaimai Range. Hazardous substances seep from the old mine shafts, tailings and dumps, affecting the water quality of two streams which flow into the Waihou River. In addition, the tailings dam is at risk of collapse.

"The planning and options assessment has been done. With funding committed, the clean-up will significantly improve the catchment’s water quality, eliminate the unacceptable risk of the dam failing, ensure public safety, and improve access to reserves around the site," Mr Benson-Pope said.

The regional council, Environment Waikato, and Matamata-Piako District Council will be the Ministry for the Environment’s partners in the clean up.

The work will involve the tailing dam being reconstructed, the capping of the tailing deposits, and bulkheading old mine shaft entrances.

The clean up is subject to resource consent, and is expected to be finished by 2010. The Ministry for the Environment’s clean-up of a contaminated site at Mapua, near Nelson – the only site ranked worse than Tui – is due to be completed this year.

The Government set up a Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund in 2003 to assist local government with the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites.
