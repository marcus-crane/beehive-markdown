Courts Minister Rick Barker today tabled the Labour-led Government’s response to the Law Commission report on [Access to Court Records](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/ProjectReport.aspx?ProjectID=119).

“The Labour - led Government has worked hard to make the justice system more open and transparent and the Law Commission report contains useful recommendations on further steps,” said Rick Barker.

“The Government agrees with the Law Commission’s finding that court record access rules need to be improved. Simply put, the rules governing access to court records are not easy to find, unclear, and inconsistent.

“The Government is persuaded that a legislative solution is the best means of simplifying access rules and providing greater clarity about accessing court records.

“The Law Commission’s recommendations represent a significant shift and the Government believes there needs to be public debate on issues such as the meaning of open justice in respect to court records and what documentation should constitute the court record. These concepts are critical to the shape of any future legislation.

“The Government recognises that there will be many interested parties and wants to ensure there is a thorough debate. The Law Commission report makes a very good case, but we should also hear other views such as from the media, the legal profession, and the general public. These views will need to be weighed up with the expert views of the judiciary.

“The openness of our courts system is in all our interests and for this reason the Government is asking the Justice and Electoral Select Committee to conduct an inquiry so that the public and other interested stakeholders have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.

“I have every confidence that this will lead to a vigorous debate on the issues, and provide a good foundation for subsequent legislation,” said Rick Barker.
