Budget 2007 shows this Labour-led government’s continued commitment and investment in young New Zealanders says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“Improving the lives of young New Zealanders today is important, but it is also critical that we invest in their future to ensure that they are able to reach their full potential. After all, they are the future innovators, employers, employees, parents and leaders of our community and our economy,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

"In Budget 2007, we're continuing to make important investments in the education and skills of young New Zealanders. We're investing over half a billion dollars in schools, industry training, tertiary education and other initiatives over the next 4 years.

"We've also expanded allowances and scholarships for an extra 12,000 students, primarily from low-income backgrounds to make tertiary education and training more affordable.

"We're investing in the physical, mental and sexual health of young New Zealanders. There are funding initiatives to tackle obesity, improve sexual health education, and a range of suicide prevention initiatives, as well as a social marketing campaign on the risks of drug taking.

"The budget provides additional support for the community and voluntary sector organisations which play a critical role in supporting young people and their families – totalling more than $85.4 million over the next four years."

The Minister said the government is continuing its coordinated approach to youth development and is working closely with the agencies and organisations that have an important influence on the lives of young people, such as schools, local councils, voluntary organisations and the social and youth work sectors.

“I'm enormously proud of the investment this government is making in young New Zealanders," she said.

Budget 2007 builds on the investments made in Budget 2006, which focused on improving the lives of young New Zealanders by promoting healthy lifestyles, strengthening and supporting youth workers and making positive changes in the tertiary education sector.
