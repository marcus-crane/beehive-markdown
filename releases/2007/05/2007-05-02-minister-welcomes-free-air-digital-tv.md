Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, is welcoming today's launch of digital television by Freeview, which allows New Zealanders to tune in to digital quality free-to-air TV for the first time.

"The Labour-led government firmly supports the industry's move to digital, and congratulates the broadcasters involved in Freeview on this significant milestone.

"The digital shift gives public and free-to-air broadcasting a secure future, making sure New Zealanders will always see their own stories and other local content on our screens.

"This government has committed $25 million over the next five years to support the development of free-to-air digital television by Freeview. Broadcasters will also have access to free digital frequencies for the terrestrial rollout.

Freeview is a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters leading the move to digital, including Television New Zealand, CanWest, Maori TV and Radio New Zealand.

"Free-to-Air digital television contributes to the government's core objective of building national identity. It will carry public broadcasting into the future, ensuring a visible and uniquely New Zealand presence in the diverse digital environment."

Free to Air satellite is being launched today, and the progressive roll out of terrestrial (land based) services will follow. This will offer audiences more channels, better pictures and sound and more options, such as interactivity.
