Not only has National revealed it wants to take money from working families but it also wants to return to the failed workplace employment practices of the 1990s, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

"Bill English talks about labour law flexibility – he means lower wages and a reduction in minimum work conditions and rights for employees, especially our most vulnerable workers. When he talks about cutting government spending what he really means is fewer nurses, doctors and teachers," said Ruth Dyson.

"His comments send a clear message of a return to the Employment Contracts Act."

"Department of Labour figures show the average rate of stoppages has dropped by 20 per cent under the Employment Relations Act; the average rate of working days lost has halved; and wage losses have dropped by 48 per cent - this doesn’t even take into account that there are many more New Zealanders employed today than there were in the 1990s.

"These results have been achieved because the Employment Relations Act is fair and balanced, and good for employers and employees and it is an Act which has played a major role in achieving one of the world's lowest unemployment rates - unlike National's Employment Contracts Act of the 1990s.

"We are now seeing more of National's true agenda. But all it promises is a return to the failed polices of the past."
