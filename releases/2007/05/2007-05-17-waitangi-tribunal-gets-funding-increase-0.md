Budget 2007 injects an extra $7.7 million into the Waitangi Tribunal over the next four years, said Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Associate Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui.

The increase will raise the tribunal's funding by 25 per cent a year and reflects the Labour-led government's determination to settle all historic claims by 2020, the ministers said.

"We're intent on settling remaining historic claims quickly, so Mâori can realise their potential through use of the resources the settlements deliver," Mr Horomia said.

"All New Zealanders, Mâori in particular, want these claims resolved. As a nation we must expedite reconciliation so we can focus on forging a mature national identity respectful of all our peoples. Anzac Day highlights the public's desire to express and celebrate our unique identity. I look forward to the time when Waitangi Day is similarly embraced, " Mr Horomia said.

"The government has increased Waitangi Tribunal funding by 60 per cent since 2001/02," said Mr Ririnui. "This year's increase will enable those claimants who wish to bring their claims before the tribunal to have them heard and reported on in a timely manner before negotiating settlements with the Crown."
