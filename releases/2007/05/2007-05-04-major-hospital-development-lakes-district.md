A major upgrade of health services in the Lakes district is an investment in the health of the people of the region and shows the Labour-led Government's on-going commitment to capital investment in the health system, Health Minister Pete Hodgson says.

Lakes District Health Board has been given approval to proceed with phase one of its $51.3 million health services improvement project, a significant building and redevelopment programme that will provide a new Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit along with a full redevelopment of Taupo Hospital.

The Capital Health Budget will contribute $25.8 million with the district health board financing the rest.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson congratulated Lakes District Health Board on securing approval for phase one and said the development of its business case had set a high standard.

"This redevelopment will enable some financial gains through better efficiency and the approval conditions for the funding will ensure the project delivers the modern models of care expected from such a significant investment," Pete Hodgson says.

The Minister said he appreciated Lakes DHB's close regional service collaboration with Bay of Plenty DHB and expected this to continue.

Labour MP for Rotorua, Steve Chadwick, welcomed the funding decision and said it was affirmation of continuing confidence in Lakes DHB by the Government.

"This is fantastic news, I have been closely associated with the upgrade plans, as have practitioners who will be relieved to know they will be practicing in modern and effective hospital surroundings," Steve Chadwick says.

"This will reassure our communities they will never lose their hospital services."
