National Party MP Judith Collins' understanding of New Zealand's benefit support system is so shallow she is only interested in its form not its substance, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"The Single Core Benefit project is primarily about providing effective support to people in need. The name we apply to benefits is secondary," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The [Working New Zealand: Work Focused Support package](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27504) is Phase One of this project, and includes the Social Security Amendment Bill currently before the House.

"If she hadn't noticed during the Select Committee's deliberations or read the Government's announcement on 26 October 2006, surely she read the answer provided to her in written parliamentary question 2692 (2007).

"Ms Collins knows that these changes are more than just renaming benefit categories. They are about supporting people into work. That is the focus of this Labour-led Government – investing in people.

"They are about extending support services to clients based on what they can do, not what they can't, and on a client's needs, not the name of a benefit they may be entitled to.

"She wasted the House's time today, again asking questions to which she already knew the answer.

"She is merely trying to distract attention from the fact that the National Party supported the Bill at Select Committee but has now decided to vote against it. It is this Bill that will go part of the way to simplifying the benefit system and providing extended support to Work and Income clients.

"Ms Collins is also trying to distract attention from the Labour-led Government's excellent record in supporting New Zealanders into work with a drop of 35% in total benefit numbers since 1999.

"If Ms Collins is in the least bit sincere she will revert to her party's former support for the Social Security Amendment Bill and stop wasting everyone's time," said Mr Benson-Pope.
