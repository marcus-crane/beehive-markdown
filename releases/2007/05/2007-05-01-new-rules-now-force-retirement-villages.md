Retirement village residents will enjoy greater financial and lifestyle security, and retirement village operators will be clearer on their legal obligations with the final phase of sector reforms coming into force from today, the Minister for Building and Construction Clayton Cosgrove has announced.

"This is about consumer protection of older New Zealanders – about informed consent and protecting the best interests of those entering complex contractual arrangements," Mr Cosgrove said.

The Retirement Villages Act 2003 reforms, which have been brought in over the past two years:  
·protect the rights of residents;  
·set out a legal framework for operators to run villages;  
·place new responsibilities on all retirement village operators for disclosure of information to residents and intending residents;  
·make provision for a disputes resolution process.

"For those who operate Retirement Villages, this final phase means that they must register with the Registrar of Retirement Villages," said Mr Cosgrove. "It is also important to realise that the legal definition of a retirement village has expanded – small operators may not be aware that they are legally required to register."

Under the new definition, a retirement village:  
·contains two or more residential units to provide residential accommodation and/or services or facilities predominantly for people who are retired  
·involves payment of a capital sum to live there.

Mr Cosgrove said that as the sector has been largely unregulated to date, there are no concrete figures on how many villages exist, with best estimates at around 400.

"If you fall under the definition – and you should talk with your lawyer if you are not sure - to continue in business and be making new offers of occupation you must have submitted registration documents by November 1."

For those who live in retirement villages a new Code of Residents’ Rights is now in force, setting out what residents are entitled to and how operators must deal with them. The rights cover services, consultation, complaints, using representatives, the right to courtesy and the right not to be exploited.

"Making sure older New Zealanders are treated with respect and afforded their full consumer rights is crucial. All residents are now entitled to their own copy of the Code, and to the good treatment it represents," Mr Cosgrove said.

New villages need to be registered with the Registrar of Retirement Villages from 1 May 2007, and existing villages by 1 November 2007 (including those currently governed by the Securities Act).

**What is the Retirement Villages Act 2003?**

The Retirement Villages Act protects the rights of residents and intending residents, and sets out a legal framework for operators to run villages. It places new responsibilities on all retirement village operators for disclosure of information to residents and intending residents, and makes provision for a disputes resolution process. It also introduces independent oversight of villages through statutory supervisors.  
Note: This Act does not cover rest homes, which are regulated under separate legislation by the Ministry of Health.

**Why did the Government pass law governing retirement villages?**

There are an estimated 400 retirement villages operating in New Zealand, and while the majority are responsible operators, the Government was not prepared to let the safety and security of residents rely on goodwill. There have been instances where residents' rights have been breached. Operators also benefit from the introduction of a more uniform set of procedures, and, in the case of those villages which have been covered by the Securities Act 1978, ceasing to be under a legislative regime which is not really designed to cover the sector.  
The Act will, for the first time, require all villages to be registered and to meet required standards. It also provides mechanisms for dealing with disputes that arise.

**What does May 1 mean for retirement village operators and residents?**

1 May 2007 marks the final phase of the implementation of the Retirement Villages Act 2003.

For operators, this means:  
·Between 1 May 2007 and 1 November 2007, existing operators will need to submit registration documents to the new Retirement Villages Registrar based in the Companies Office.  
·Any new villages (those without residents, currently) will have to be registered with the Retirement Village Registrar before they can make offers of occupation, known as an occupation right agreement.  
·In order to be able to register, all operators will need to supply a series of documents, including a copy of their occupation right agreement, details of their appointed statutory supervisor (although the Registrar may grant an exemption to appointment).  
·Operators who are currently registered under the Securities Act have until 1 November 2007 to submit their registration. If operators have applied for, but have not received confirmation of, registration by 1 November 2007, they will be able to operate under the Securities Act until their registration application is approved.  
·All new residents entering into retirement villages from 1 May 2007 should be provided with the new occupation right agreement, disclosure statement, Code of Practice and Code of Residents’ Rights.  
·Details on the registration process and application forms can be found at www.retirementvillages.govt.nz.  
·The Department of Building and Housing has developed a disclosure statement template to enable operators to get the documentation and information together for registration. The template is available at www.dbh.govt.nz/retirement-villages

For residents, this means:

·The new Code of Resident’s Rights (see below), which sets out what residents are entitled to and how operators must work with them.  
·New occupation right agreements – for new residents from 1 May 2007  
·Disclosure statements – for new residents from 1 May 2007, and to all existing residents by 1 May 2008  
·New residents must receive:  
oa new, compliant occupation right agreement  
oa copy of the disclosure statement  
othe Code of Practice  
othe Code of Residents’ Rights

**What does the Code of Residents’ rights involve?**

The Code of Resident’s Rights sets out what residents are entitled to and how operators must work with them. It came into force on 1 May 2007, and covers:  
·Services and other benefits available under the occupation right agreement  
·Information
