Minister of Labour and ACC Ruth Dyson has congratulated the innovation of the finalists and winners at the New Zealand Workplace Health and Safety Awards run by Safeguard magazine with the support of the Department of Labour.

"These awards recognise the achievements that each workplace can make - from raising health and safety standards that lead to productivity gains, through to innovative employee participation systems and industry leadership.

"I would like to congratulate every one of the workplaces that entered these awards. People who stepped up to the challenge of lifting their health and safety performance, pushed themselves to redefine what they thought they could achieve and achieved it," said Ruth Dyson.

Ms Dyson presented the Air New Zealand overall winner for best contribution to improving workplace health and safety to Ribbonwood Yarding Systems of Tokoroa for its DVD encouraging tree fellers to think about how their emotional state could affect their safety on the job. The DVD project also won the Air New Zealand best initiative to promote or communicate an improved safety culture award.

The Minister also congratulated Auckland-based O-I New Zealand which won three awards – for automating a furnace cleaning process that prevented exposure to hazards for workers and increased productivity at the same time; its health checks and personalised exercise programmes and the Safeguard health and safety practitioner of the year, which went to O-I's Fran O'Keefe.

Other winners included Auckland's EnviroWaste for its dust reduction system, Palmerston North City Council for raising the profile of its health and safety representatives in each work area, Collins Corporation Ltd Napier, for its roof anchor points which can be fitted to timber and steel structures to prevent falls from heights, Karl Boniface Plumbing of Invercargill for changing the applicators used for applying primers to clean PVC piping to reduce injury from splashes and alerting the primer manufacturer to the issue, and Manukau City Council for improving the health and safety management of its physical works contracts.

Ricky Dunstan of NZ Steel Hollow Section Waiuku won the NZCTU most influential employee award for his enthusiasm, hard work and positivity about health and safety .

Judges commendations went to Bay of Plenty District Health Board for designing and using carriers that prevented sharps bins from used vaccination needles from falling over while in vehicles, and to Otago University Students Association for raising awareness and providing leadership about health and safety in the student environment.
