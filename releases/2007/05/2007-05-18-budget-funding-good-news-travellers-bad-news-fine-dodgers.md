Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says international travellers can look forward to reduced bottlenecks at New Zealand's busiest airport, while fine dodgers can look forward to tighter scrutiny with planned upgrades of Customs' systems announced today as part of Budget 2007.

The Minister says the Budget will provide $360,000 in operating funding over the next four financial years and $1.2 million in capital funding in the next financial year for upgrading passenger processing facilities at Auckland International Airport.

This will allow the service to keep pace with a projected 2.5 to 3 per cent growth in international visitors over the next two years, while streamlining its processes.

"Auckland International Airport currently processes around three-quarters of all international travellers in and out of New Zealand – which in 2005/06, translated to around six million people – with further growth in that number already projected over the next couple of years," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"Customs therefore needs to expand its operating area within the new airport terminal to meet this expected demand, which includes an upgrade of existing technology. This will help reduce bottlenecks and streamline things at the border, which is good news for all travellers to and from New Zealand."

Also announced in Budget 2007 is $6.3 million in operating funding over the next four years towards Customs' computer system and the development of a business case to look at options for a capacity increase to meet rising demand.

"Revenue collection by Customs is heavily reliant on effective border management systems, and an effective computer system is an essential part of this. In 2005/06 Customs collected $8.4 billion revenue, including $16 million of additional revenue as a result of compliance checking.

"New technology will also provide greater capability, flexibility and connectivity to address Government needs and business requirements of industry, the public and international trading partners."

Nanaia Mahuta said a new system would also ensure more effective integration with other government agencies, such as the Ministry of Justice and Inland Revenue Department, and help to catch fine and loan repayment dodgers.
