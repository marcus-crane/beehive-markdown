Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the relationship between New Zealand and Britain had strengthened during Tony Blair’s decade as Prime Minister.

“Mr Blair has been a good friend of New Zealand during his time in office. I have thanked him personally and on behalf of the government for the many positive developments within the New Zealand¯United Kingdom relationship that we’ve seen.

“Far from waning over distance and time, our relationship has been strengthening.

“During Mr Blair’s visit to New Zealand early last year, New Zealand and the United Kingdom formalised the existing policy dialogues between departments. We continue to co-operate closely on important regional and international issues, such as climate change, the Pacific and Europe, as well as in the Commonwealth and other international groups. As well, Britain continues to be an important economic partner for New Zealand.

“The significant links between New Zealand and Britain, which have their origin in our shared history, are continually renewed through the steady flow of migrants and visitors in both directions.

“Tony Blair’s unflinching support for the right of New Zealanders to live and work in the United Kingdom has been particularly appreciated.

“The success and profile given to last November’s dedication of the New Zealand Memorial at Hyde Park Corner was the best possible illustration of the strength of the many ties that bind us. And the links between our Defence forces are strong to this day.

“During Tony Blair’s decade at Downing Street, New Zealand has had a good friend and I have valued his friendship personally. I wish Tony Blair well for the future,” Helen Clark said.
