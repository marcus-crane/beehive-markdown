Applications are now open for the Lottery Community Facilities Fund and Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker is urging community groups wanting to upgrade or build multi-purpose community facilities to apply.

“Increasing lottery profits over the last few years has allowed us to reintroduce the Lottery Community Facilities Fund,” said Rick Barker.

"Funding of over $8 million has been set aside to support a wide range of community facilities projects where community members can meet and interact in ways that strengthen the community.

“Lottery Grants help communities reach their potential and the reintroduction of the Lottery Community Facilities Fund will provide much sought after funding to build or improve community facilities,” said Rick Barker.

The first funding round opened on April 30 2007 and closes 27 July 2007.

Administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, Lottery Grants Board funding is generated by NZ Lotteries’ profits, which are transferred to the Lottery Grants Board and flow on to directly benefit the community.
