Governor General Anand Satyanand and Prime Minister Helen Clark will lead the New Zealand delegation to the funeral of Samoa's Head of State, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II.

The State funeral will take place at Samoa’s Parliament at Mulinu’u, on the morning of Friday 18 May (Saturday 19 May NZ time).

The New Zealand delegation to the funeral also includes government ministers, MPs from a range of political parties, New Zealand Samoan community representatives, and Maori representatives. The delegation will travel to Apia on RNZAF Orion and Hercules aircraft.

"His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II played a leading role in guiding Samoa to independence in 1962. In the last 45 years he has been a deeply loved head of state who served his country well. He will be greatly missed by Samoans in Samoa and New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

"In addition to the strong family and historical ties between New Zealand and Samoa, the presence of a number of representatives from Maoridom, including a party led by King Tuheitia, highlights our common Polynesian heritage.

“The ties between the peoples of Polynesia were treasured by His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II. His passing is mourned by Polynesia and the wider Pacific.

“New Zealand and Samoa are very close friends. In attending the State funeral, we recognise and acknowledge that friendship, and express our condolences to the Samoan people, including the many here in New Zealand, on the loss they have sustained,” Helen Clark said.
