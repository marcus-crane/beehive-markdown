The number of youth receiving an Unemployment Benefit is plummeting under the Labour-led government, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"In December 1999 there were 17,514 18 and 19 year olds on an Unemployment Benefit. At the end of April there were just 1,424 - a reduction of 92 percent since this government took office," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"There are 28 Work and Income Service Centres in this country where there are no youth receiving an Unemployment Benefit and a further 66 Service Centres where there are fewer than 10.

"This success is also reflected in the number of 18 and 19 year old Maori and Pacific Island youth receiving the Unemployment Benefit. There are now just 572 Maori 18 and 19 year olds receiving an Unemployment Benefit, compared to 6,276 under National in December 1999. 162 Pacific 18 and 19 year olds are receiving an Unemployment Benefit - a drop of 89 percent since December 1999.

"The government is well on the way to achieving its joint goal with the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs. That is, to have all 15-19 year olds in work, education, training or other activities that will contribute to their long-term economic independence and well-being by the end of this year," said Mr Benson-Pope.
