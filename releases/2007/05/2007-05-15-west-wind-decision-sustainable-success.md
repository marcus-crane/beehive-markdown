Energy Minister David Parker today welcomed the decision of the Environment Court giving the green light for [Meridian Energy's West Wind Project](http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/OurProjects/WestWind/default.htm). The wind farm is expected to produce enough power to meet much of the domestic electricity demand for the Wellington region.

"This is just the sort of development we need to secure a sustainable, carbon neutral future," said David Parker.

"Labour got wind power off the ground in New Zealand with its ground breaking [Projects to Reduce Emissions programme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F17598). This brought forward the development of wind power in New Zealand by many years.

"This government has also clearly signaled its preference for a renewable energy future through the draft [New Zealand Energy Strategy](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____19431.aspx). Following Labour's clear policy signals, major generators have announced their own plans to invest billions of dollars in new renewable projects.

"I'm delighted by today's decision and Merdian's plans to make another major investment in building a sustainable, carbon neutral New Zealand.
