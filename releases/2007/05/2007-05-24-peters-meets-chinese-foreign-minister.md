The progress made during 35 years of diplomatic relations dominated Foreign Minister Winston Peters' meeting with China’s new Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi in Beijing today.

“New Zealand and China enjoy a strong and constructive relationship. In marking its 35th anniversary today, we reviewed how far we have come, and talked about best to carry the partnership forward," Mr Peters said.

“We also had useful and frank discussions on the Pacific; on China’s hopes for the Six Party Talks on North Korea, and on our respective views for the future of the broader Asia-Pacific region."

Mr Peters congratulated Mr Yang on his appointment as Foreign Minister last month, and invited him to visit New Zealand again.

Mr Yang was previously a Vice Minister, and had oversight of China's relationship with New Zealand. He last visited here in 2005.

Later today Mr Peters is due to call on elder statesman Huang Hua, who was prominent in establishing China's place in the modern world.

"Huang Hua, as China's first Ambassador to the United Nations, negotiated the recognition agreement with New Zealand in 1972," Mr Peters said.

"More famously, he was part of a three-person group that negotiated Henry Kissinger’s and then President Richard Nixon's first visits to China. He became Foreign Minister in 1976, and also served as Vice Premier.

"When the Asia 2000 Foundation was formed, Huang Hua became an honorary adviser. He is still an adviser today, as a spritely 94-year-old, and it was a pleasure discussing with him the new directions that have been set for what is now the Asia New Zealand Foundation,” Mr Peters said.
