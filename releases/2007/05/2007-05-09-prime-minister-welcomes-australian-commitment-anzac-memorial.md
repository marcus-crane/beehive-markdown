Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the Australian Government's commitment to build an ANZAC memorial in the [New Zealand Memorial Park](http://www.mch.govt.nz/projects/memorials/park.html).

The Australian Federal Budget, announced yesterday, has allocated AUS$5 million to the ANZAC memorial project. Australian Veterans' Affairs Minister Bruce Billson said the memorial would commemorate the ANZAC alliance, and Australia and New Zealand's shared history.

Helen Clark last month announced plans and funding for the New Zealand Memorial Park which will complete the redevelopment of the National War Memorial precinct in Wellington. The park is expected to be completed next year.

"This news from Australia is very welcome. One of the reasons for the Memorial Park is to give other friendly nations an appropriate place to build memorials commemorating their relationships with New Zealand.

"Australia will be a very appropriate first memorial for the new park. New Zealand and Australia have served side-by-side in many conflicts going back to the late nineteenth century, and more recently in peacekeeping operations. We also share close family, historical, cultural, sporting, and economic bonds.

"The Australia memorial also reciprocates the building of the New Zealand Memorial at the head of the ANZAC Parade, which leads to Australia's National War Memorial in Canberra, and which was unveiled in 2001.

"Both New Zealand and Australia also have memorials in London's Hyde Park Corner," Helen Clark said.
