Budget 2007 provides a substantial injection of capital to ensure the five-year State Highway Construction Plan is delivered in the event of any unanticipated input cost increases, Transport Minister Annette King announced today.

The government is setting aside an additional $145 million of capital in 2006/07and 2007/08.

“The Labour-led government regards a world-class land transport network, which moves people and goods safely and efficiently, as a centrepiece of our drive to transform the New Zealand economy,” Transport Minister Annette King said.

“In Budget 2006 investment in roads over the next five years increased to a record $13.4 billion to guarantee and accelerate New Zealand’s largest-ever road building programme.

“Last year was the first time that funding had been guaranteed for such a period. Previously, funding had only been guaranteed in one-year blocks.

“I am delighted that we are now reinforcing certainty in the state highway construction programme. Last year’s announcements were welcomed right across the land transport sector, and I am sure the extra funding in Budget 2007 will reassure the sector that the Labour-led government remains committed to providing world-class infrastructure,” the Minister said.

Ms King also said that the unprecedented level of spending in land transport makes it imperative that the government ensures that taxpayers receive value for the public money invested in the sector.

“Work is underway across a number of areas, including strategic planning, and improving performance measurements and monitoring, to make sure our money is spent as effectively as possible. The work will also ensure there is greater clarity among land transport sector agencies about their respective roles,” Annette King said.
