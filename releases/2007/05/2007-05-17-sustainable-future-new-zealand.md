Sustainable growth is the hallmark of Budget 2007. It takes significant further steps to transform our economy and provide higher living standards for all families, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

"New Zealanders are wealthier, more secure, and enjoying greater opportunity than ever before, thanks to consistent economic growth, rising wages, and one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the world. This has been reflected in HSBC's description of New Zealand as "the Miracle Economy" in the past week.

"The Labour-led government's eighth budget continues our progress in putting the country on a sustainable footing, with saving and investing as its centrepiece. This is critical to addressing the imbalances in the economy.

"The budget increases our investment in families to give all New Zealanders a stake in society, through strong public services, safer communities, and the creation of a better country in which to live and work, where the benefits of economic growth are widely shared.

"Our culture and values are celebrated, promoted, and protected, as we continue to strengthen our national identity and take pride in our reputation as a responsible and active member of the international community.

"Budget 2007 is based on Labour's vision of continual economic transformation, grounded in sound fiscal measures, and based on smart, active policies to preserve what is fundamentally good and unique about New Zealand," Helen Clark said.
