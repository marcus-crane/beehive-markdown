Dr Ross Patterson has been appointed the Telecommunications Commissioner and a member of the Commerce Commission for a period of five years starting 12 July 2007, says Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

He will take over the role from the current commissioner Douglas Webb, who steps down on 11 July.

"This is a key appointment and it was vital that we took appropriate steps to find the best candidate for the job," Mr Cunliffe said.

"The commissioner will play a pivotal role in implementing the new telecommunications regime introduced following the May 2006 Stocktake and December's Telecommunications Amendment Act.

"Dr Patterson will have lead responsibility in monitoring the telecommunications market and ensuring, in a robust and impartial manner, that the enhanced regime promotes an effective and competitive telecommunications environment which delivers long term benefits for end users."

Dr Patterson is a New Zealand lawyer currently working in Sydney, Australia as a partner of Minter Ellison Lawyers, where he heads their competition and regulatory practice. His principal areas of expertise include all aspects of competition law, telecommunications law, payment systems regulation and competition policy initiatives. He has a PhD in commercial law, and regularly provides commentary and articles for publications and journals in Australia, New Zealand and overseas.

He is president of the Australia New Zealand Business Council, and a member of the Australian New Zealand Leadership Forum combined working group on competition law and consumer protection, the Competition Law and Policy Institute of New Zealand and the Trade Practices Committee of the Law Council of Australia.

"Dr Patterson will bring with him extensive experience and knowledge in competition and regulatory issues in New Zealand and Australia. He has significant experience in dealing with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the New Zealand Commerce Commission and the Australian Competition Tribunal," Mr Cunliffe said.

The minister thanked Mr Webb, who in March agreed to stay in the role at this important time until his replacement was appointed.
