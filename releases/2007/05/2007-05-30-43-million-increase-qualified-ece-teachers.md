Early childhood education centres across the country will receive grants of $4.3 million to help more staff become qualified teachers, Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

At Queens Park Early Childhood Centre in Invercargill, Steve Maharey said the grants, which will go to 1077 centres, are part of the Labour-led government's drive to increase the number of qualified early childhood education teachers.

"This year 2,099 grants have been allocated, 515 (33 percent) more than in 2006. The grants will go towards study costs and paying staff while they are gaining teaching experience in other services as part of their qualification.

"Each grant is worth $2,094 per year, up to a total of $7,329 per staff member over a three and a half year period. Services can use the grants in the way that best suits their circumstances, for example, to pay course fees, purchase textbooks or cover salary costs for a reliever, so long as it supports the staff member in training.

"Both national and international research tells us that quality early childhood education makes a significant difference to the way children develop and achieve later in life. Ensuring all early childhood teachers are fully qualified will improve quality and strengthen effective teaching and training across the sector.

"We're making good progress towards our goal of ensuring all teachers are registered by 2012. These grants are part of the government's ten year strategic plan for early childhood education, Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki, and build on the work we're already doing to improve the quality of early childhood education for Kiwi families.

"Nine out of ten New Zealand children now take part in early childhood education. Nationwide, early childhood education funding has more than doubled since 1999, and the number of qualified teachers has increased by 50 percent.

"The government recognises the importance of early childhood education and is committed to supporting quality improvements. This Labour-led governments total investment in early childhood education is $775 million in the 2007-2008 financial year, that's more than two-and-a-half time higher than the $276 million spent in 1999-2000."
