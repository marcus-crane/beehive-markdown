Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today announced the reappointment of Ms Tapu Misa to the Broadcasting Standards Authority.

Ms Misa has been reappointed for further 3-year term, to 30 April 2010.

"Ms Misa's media background makes her an ideal member of the Authority," Steve Maharey said.

"In particular her background as a Pacific journalist across a range of media has contributed to a strong professional and multicultural perspective to the Authority's deliberations.

"This reappointment means Ms Misa will continue to enhance and add value to the Authority by providing strong advocacy for Pacific and Maori people."

The BSA is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints after determination by broadcasters, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.
