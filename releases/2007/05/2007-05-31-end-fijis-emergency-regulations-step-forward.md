Foreign Minister Winston Peters tonight acknowledged the Fiji interim administration's decision to lift emergency regulations from midnight.

"This is a good first step on the road back to constitutional government, but it is only a first step," Mr Peters said.

"It should bring to an end the abuses of human rights witnessed ever since the coup.

"An important effect of this evening's announcement will be the military's return to barracks.

"However we encourage the interim government to take further steps to re-establish the independence and integrity of the Fiji justice system.

"New Zealand remains committed to engaging with Fiji, to assist with a return to democracy.

"Under the framework agreed with other Pacific Island Forum nations in Port Vila in March, we are participating actively in the Forum-Fiji Joint Working Group. We continue to seek substantive steps towards the return of a democratically elected government for the Fiji people," Mr Peters said.
