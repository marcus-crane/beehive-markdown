Education Minister Steve Maharey today announced consultation on proposals to build four new primary schools in North West Waitakere which will begin in July.

"The Ministry of Education has identified North West Waitakere as an area of significant population growth over the next 10 to 15 years, with an estimated 31,000 residents living in the area by 2021," Steve Maharey said.

"That is an increase of around 16,000 people in the area, which includes about 2000 students.

"The proposal involves four new years 1-8 schools, two will be located in Hobsonville and the other two in the Kumeu/Huapai area.

"This consultation will give members of the local community the opportunity to consider what they would like to see in the new schools to ensure the best possible outcomes for local students.

"Whatever decisions are eventually made, we will ensure that the new schools add to and work with the existing schools in the area.

"A reference group representing local schools and community groups will be formed to help guide the consultation process.

"Consultation is critical to the future success of the local schools in North West Waitakere. This process is an opportunity for people to tell us how they think the education needs of their children can be best met in their local area.

"The Labour-led government currently invests $527.8 million in school property funding, which allows existing schools to continue modernising their buildings, as well as for the construction of new schools."
