Budget 2007 has delivered an extra $530,000 in 2007/08 to enable Te Papa to continue touring its highly successful Treaty 2U exhibition, say Prime Minister Helen Clark and Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

The extra money will enable the high-tech road show to undertake a tour of schools in the Auckland region and matches a much-welcomed $530,000 grant from the ASB Community Trust.

The exhibition aims to provide New Zealanders with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi and has been visited by over 62,000 people since it began.

There have been two tours to date, but it is apparent that there is still an unmet demand in schools for access to this high quality exhibition, said Helen Clark.

Mr Horomia said New Zealanders had embraced the exhibition. "I'm pleased that schools will be provided with an additional resource to help explain the importance of the Treaty in this country."

The exhibition is presented by Te Papa, Archives New Zealand the National Library. "We have redirected the $530,000 from existing Te Puni Kokiri operating funding for 2007/08, because we believe the road show is a key priority,'' Mr Horomia said.

Pūtea nui atu mō te whakaaturanga Tiriti 2U.

E $530,000 ngā moni nuinga atu kua kawea mai e Tahua Pūtea 2007, mō te tau 2007/08, hei āwhina i a Te Papa ki te mau haere tonu i te whakaaturanga tino angitu, a Tiriti 2U, e kī ana te Pirimia a Helen Clark, me te Minita Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia.

Ko ngā moni āpiti nei ka āwhina i te whakaaturanga rori hangarau-teitei, ki te mau haere atu ki ngā kura kei te rohe o Tāmaki Makaurau, me te tāpiri atu ki tētahi koha tino-maioha, e $530,000, mai i te ASB Community Trust.

Ka whai te whakaaturanga ki te whakawhiwhi atu ki ngā tāngata o Aotearoa, tētahi huarahi wātea, kia mau māramatanga pai ake ki te Tiriti o Waitangi, ā, neke atu ki te 62,000 ngā tāngata kua tae atu mai i tōna tīmatanga.

E rua ngā haerenga ki tēnei wā, engari kei te mārama rawa atu, kāhore anō kia mutu ngā tono a ngā kura ki te mātaki i tēnei whakaaturanga kounga kairangi, e kī ana a Helen Clark.

Me te kī a Horomia, i te awhi ngā tāngata o Aotearoa i te whakaaturanga. “ Kei te harikoa ahau ka whakawhiwhia tētahi rauemi ake, ki ngā kura, hei āwhina i ngā whakamāramatanga o te whakahiratanga o te Tiriti ki runga i tēnei whenua.”

Ko Te Papa, ko Te Rua Māhara o te Kāwanatanga, me Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa, kei te whakahaere i te whakaaturanga. “Kua whakaratohia e mātou te $530,000 mai i te putea whakahaere a Te Puni Kōkiri mō te tau 2007/08, i te mea e pono ana mātou he kaupapa take nui, take tuatahi te whakaaturanga rori nei,” e kī ana a Horomia.
