Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched a new booklet to help parents become more involved in their children's learning from the very start of their development.

Helen Clark launched the new Ministry of Education resource during a visit to the Gisborne Community Early Childcare and Education Centre. The government announced yesterday that the Centre will receive an incentive grant of up to $2,094 this year to help a staff member become a qualified teacher. Ten ECE centres in the Gisborne region will receive a total of $27,222 in incentive grants this year.

"The new booklet launched today is the latest addition to the government's Team-Up campaign, which encourages parents to support their children’s learning. Previous booklets have been aimed at parents of primary, intermediate, and secondary school students. This booklet focuses on parents with children under five years old," Helen Clark said.

“The booklet contains advice for parents about choosing an early childhood centre, and an outline of the early childhood education curriculum. It also contains many useful and practical ideas – including activities parents can do with infants, toddlers and young children.

"The Labour-led government is committed to investing in education to support parents to take an active role in their child's learning.

“Supporting learning in a child's early years makes a big difference to the way they develop and go on to learn throughout their lives.

"Research shows that when parents, families and whanau are involved children have a much better chance of succeeding in their education.

"In 2006, almost 95 per cent of year 1 pupils had participated in early childhood education prior to starting school. However this participation can involve a relatively short number of hours, and the government is keen to further improve participation.

"Investment in ECE has more than doubled since 1999 to $769 million in the 07/08 year, and the introduction of up to 20 hours Free ECE from 1 July 2007 will remove barriers to participation for three and four year olds enrolled in teacher-led and some kôhanga reo services," Helen Clark said.
