New Zealand will host and fund an interim secretariat for the new South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation for the first two years of its operation, Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today.

A further round of negotiations to establish a South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was held last week in Reñaca, Chile. This was the third meeting held under the initiative taken by New Zealand, Australia and Chile for an agreement to manage the fisheries of the high seas of a huge area - stretching from Western Australia to Chile and from the Equator to the Antarctic - and to protect associated marine ecosystems.

Twenty-one countries plus the European Community, as well as various inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, attended the meeting.

The meeting confirmed earlier decisions to limit bottom trawling, Mr Anderton said, and the other significant outcome of the meeting was acceptance of a New Zealand offer to host an interim secretariat in Wellington.

"New Zealand’s offer to host and also to fund the interim secretariat for the first two years of its operation is another sign of New Zealand’s commitment to the success of the negotiations.

“We saw that the bottom trawling rules, as well as the data and information arrangements, would not work effectively without some basic institutional infrastructure. So, we have put up our hand to show that we are serious about getting the new management regime in place and operational as soon as possible,” Mr Anderton said.
