A Labour-led government initiative to reduce the gender pay gap between men and women will be extended to a number of Crown entities, having been tested in the public service, public education and public health areas, said Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today.

“Nine public service departments have reviewed pay and employment conditions for men and women within their organisations. In the public health sector, the review process is underway in five district health boards.”

“This process will now be extended on a voluntary basis to a number of Crown entities and to state-owned enterprises and organisations whose work is government-funded.”

“Pay and employment equity reviews help identify changes needed to the way pay issues and working conditions are addressed. Each organisation is different, and there cannot be a blanket approach to the way the review process is carried out.”

The next phase of the Pay and Employment Equity Plan of Action will be to extend the initiative to local government, subject to consultation with relevant employers and unions.

“Making sure that the work of men and women is valued equally, including through pay, is a vital way to increase labour market participation and people’s choices around work,” said Ruth Dyson.

“Poor pay and employment conditions have a direct impact on staff recruitment. In the current climate of low unemployment and skill shortages, achieving pay and employment equity is a key factor in ensuring women and men want to work and remain in their jobs or to return to work after parental leave. Promoting fair work conditions will help achieve this.”
