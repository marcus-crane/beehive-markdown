Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that New Zealand will host two important international meetings this month which are aimed at promoting understanding across civilisations, culture, and religion.

Helen Clark said that New Zealand can play an important role in bringing diverse peoples together to build the basis for a more peaceful world.

Helen Clark said that the Government has organised the first symposium in the Asia-Pacific region on the major United Nations report on the Alliance of Civilisations initiative.

As well, the Third Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith Dialogue will be held at Waitangi from 29 to 31 May. The dialogue is co-sponsored by New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.

The Prime Minister is expected to be joined at the opening session of the Interfaith Dialogue by Philippines President Gloria Arroyo, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, and Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. Foreign Minister Winston Peters will also attend.

"New Zealand strongly supports regional and international work to encourage inter-religious and inter-cultural understanding and co-operation. These dialogues have the potential to make an important contribution to world peace and security," Helen Clark said.

"The Alliance of Civilisations meeting, in Auckland on 24 May, will consider an initial regional response to the global UN Alliance of Civilisations initiative launched by the Secretary General in mid-2005. The initiative was first promoted by the Governments of Spain and Turkey.

"New Zealand sees the initiative as an important way of building relationships across the boundaries of civilisations, and in particular of working to reduce the level of suspicion and fear which has grown between the Islamic world and the West.

"The Symposium will bring together around forty current and former government ministers and eminent people, including academics and other experts, and religious and media figures, drawn mainly from the Asia-Pacific region. The symposium is being co-sponsored by the Government of Norway," Helen Clark said.

Symposium participants will develop a regional response to the report presented late last year to the United Nations by the Alliance's High Level Group of experts and will be the first event world-wide to focus a region's attention on the High Level Group's report and its implications.

The report is divided into two parts: the first focused on the Middle East, and the second setting out a series of practical recommendations in the fields of education, media, youth, and migration.

It proposes actions to reduce the barriers between civilisations, including strengthening education about other cultures and religions; encouraging media literacy; expanding internet access, particularly in Muslim countries; promoting youth exchanges; and improving the way in which migrants can be included into their new country.

Helen Clark said that the Interfaith Dialogue at Waitangi the following week brings together Asia-Pacific faith and community leaders and other civil society representatives from fifteen Southeast Asian and South Pacific countries to address potential causes of religious conflict and extremism in the region.

New Zealand will be represented by a delegation of eleven members drawn from its faith communities and those involved with community relations issues, such as the Race Relations Commissioner.

"The Waitangi meeting will focus on building bridges between the diverse communities in our region in the key areas of peace, development, security, and education," Helen Clark said.

New Zealand has been active in the Interfaith Dialogue since it first met in Indonesia in 2004. Helen Clark attended the Philippines-hosted second meeting last year.
