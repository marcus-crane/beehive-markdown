Hamilton lawyer Melanie Harland has been appointed a District Court Judge, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced today.

Ms Harland was admitted in 1985. From 1985 to 1988 she was a Solicitor with Meredith Connell, appearing in a variety of jurisdictions with focus on the District Court, both in its summary and jury jurisdiction, and also in the High Court on a variety of appeals and in the civil jurisdiction.

From 1988 to the present she has been with McCaw Lewis Chapman, Hamilton where she has been a partner since 1991. She has experience in civil litigation and has been involved in criminal work from a defence perspective. She has conducted jury trials in both the District and High Courts.

In the early 1990s Ms Harland developed an interest in Family Law. She has appeared as a lawyer for the child, counsel to assist and counsel for the subject person in cases involving disability. She has also been a Youth Advocate for some six years. She developed her area of practice in Resource Management.

In 1995 she travelled to Switzerland for six weeks on a Rotary Group Study Exchange Scholarship when she spent time observing and talking to members of the criminal justice system working in a tri-lingual society and was able to compare the Swiss environmental laws with New Zealand’s Resource Management Act.

Ms Harland has been actively involved with the District Law Society, being a member of various sub-committees and on the Faculty of the NZLS Civil Litigation Skills programme. For the past 10 years she has been an appointed Trustee of the Waikato Foundation Trust, which administers a fund for regional environmental projects and was chairperson of the Waikato Montessori Charitable Trust.
