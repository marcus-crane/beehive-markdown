New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Japan will be career diplomat Ian Kennedy, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Mr Kennedy has had two previous posting to Japan, and has written a book on Japanese/New Zealand relations for the Institute of Policy Studies. He speaks Japanese fluently.

"Japan and New Zealand have a deep and longstanding partnership, and work closely together across the Asia Pacific region," Mr Peters said.

"We share fundamental values of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. These common understandings are complemented by longstanding trade, tourism, education and investment links.

"Japan is New Zealand's third largest export market, currently worth over $3.5 billion per year, while Japanese investment in New Zealand stands at around $3.7 billion. Japan is also an important source of tourism for us.

"As we celebrate 55 years of diplomatic relations this year, the importance of further developing our relationship with Japan cannot be underestimated.

"We are keen to develop a forward-looking vision for that partnership that recognises changes to the region's political, security and economic landscape," Mr Peters said.

Mr Kennedy is currently Deputy High Commissioner in Canberra, and was previously Ambassador to Turkey and to the Solomon Islands. He will take up his appointment in May.
