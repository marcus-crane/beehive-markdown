A new research fund, allocated in Budget 2007, will bolster New Zealand’s international leadership position in helping the agriculture and forestry sectors respond to climate change, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Climate Change Minister David Parker announced today.

The ministers said New Zealand needed and wanted to develop its role as a world leader in agriculture and forestry research on climate change. “This new fund will provide $1 million each year for collaborative research with other countries," Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealand is already recognised as a world leader in agriculture greenhouse gas measurement and mitigation. We want to be in a stronger position to help the rest of the world understand and respond to the effects of climate change."

David Parker said the new fund would help promote New Zealand science abroad. “It will be used to foster international work on these very important issues, and it will help with technology and knowledge transfer to developing countries through the development of formalised collaborative relationships and exchange programmes."

The ministers said the investment would support collaboration on relevant research between New Zealand industry and other countries, as well as future government-to-government research partnerships on agricultural greenhouse gases.

“As well, this will help reinforce the sustainability of our agriculture and forestry products internationally. The Labour-Progressive government is confident that New Zealand has the talent and the will to be an international leader in the response to climate change. This Budget 2007 allocation demonstrates that confidence,” Jim Anderton said.
