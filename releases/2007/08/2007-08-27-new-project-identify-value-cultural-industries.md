The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, today announced details of a $50,000 pilot project to link humanities research with government priorities.

“The study will examine the contribution of government-funded cultural industries, such as film, television, literature, museums, and performing arts, to New Zealand, and to driving our creative industries”, says Steve Maharey.

“The Labour-led government believes that cultural industries are vital to further fuel the ‘creative economy’, which currently contributes about $2.86 billion a year to the economy.

“This pilot project will examine the issues facing New Zealand’s cultural industries, and the role of this government in further supporting their sustainability and development.

“The continued growth of creative industries is central to driving our economic transformation and to our sense of national identity.

“They also form part of New Zealand’s unique attraction as a tourism destination, so improving them could also drive up tourism numbers. Tourism expenditure reached $18.6 billion in the year to March 2006.

“This pilot project also aims to get greater value from the ideas and expertise within New Zealand’s humanities research community.”

Minister Maharey was speaking at the opening session of the 2007 Humanities-Aronui Congress in Wellington.

The new study will be a partnership between the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage on how humanities research can contribute to policy that will help further develop cultural industries in New Zealand.
