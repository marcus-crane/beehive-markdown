Food Safety Minister Annette King says New Zealand is not proceeding immediately to gazette the amendment to the GM standard in the joint Food Standards Code for food derived from High Lysine Corn (LY038).  
She has asked the NZ Food Safety Authority to provide her with more advice as to the appropriateness for New Zealand to accept amendments for varieties intended for use as animal feed to joint food standards under the “Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand Concerning a Joint Food Standards System”
