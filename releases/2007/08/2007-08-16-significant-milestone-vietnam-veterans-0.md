The Viet Nam Veterans and Their Families Trust was inaugurated today at Parliament by Defence Minister Phil Goff and Veterans Affairs Minister Rick Barker, marking a significant milestone for Viet Nam Veterans and their families.

“The Trust is a central element of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 2006 by the Government and the veterans’ organisations, the Ex- Vietnam Services Association (EVSA) and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RNZRSA) and will address the needs of many veterans and their families”, said Mr Goff and Mr Barker.

“The purpose of the Trust is to provide support to Viet Nam Veterans and their families in relation to concerns and circumstances not addressed elsewhere in the MOU package.

“The Trust is in addition to existing entitlements under the War Pensions Act including War Disablement Pensions.

“Under the MoU, veterans and their families suffering the effects of specified medical conditions are able to receive ex gratia compensation payments. The Trust has been established to assist those suffering serious difficulties but whose conditions are not on the United States Academy of Science Institute of Medicine 'sufficient evidence of association' list, and who are therefore not eligible for an ex gratia payment.

“The Government has established the Trust with a capital endowment of $7m, for a 30 year period. The interest on that sum will be available for distribution to veterans and their families. Over the life of the trust that could come to around $12m to $15m which works out to around $400,000 to $500,000 annually.

“The Trust is independent from the Crown, with strong accountability links to the veterans themselves. There will be four trustees who are chosen by the veterans groups and a chair appointed by the government.

“The inaugural veteran’s representatives on the trust are individuals who all served in Viet Nam, had successful military careers and who continue to make contributions to their fellow veterans and the communities they live in.  
The trustees appointed today are Rick Ottaway, Alastair MacKenzie, and Henry (Teach) Macown with a fourth nomination yet to confirm his availability.

“The Trust will be chaired by former State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham who headed the Joint Working Group which consulted with New Zealand Viet Nam Veterans and their families throughout the country and in Australia which led to the MOU agreement between the Government, EVSA and RNZRSA.

“Fundamental to the agreement is the collation of a register of Viet Nam veterans and their families that is helping paint a clear picture of the possible effects of their service, and allowing us to monitor the trends in health and well being. So far 3,621 Viet Nam veterans and their families have registered and as a result people eligible for ex gratia payments and other assistance have been identified.

"Today's announcement marks another significant step in the process which began in 2004 when parliament's Health Select Committee reported on Viet Nam veteran's exposure to defoliants. In response to representations made by Veterans' groups, the Joint Working Group, was established to make recommendations to government on concerns of Viet Nam veterans and reported to Ministers on 28 April 2006. It is estimated that approximately 3700 New Zealanders served in the Viet Nam war between 1964 and 1973.

“We are pleased that after 34 years the grievances which exist and in many cases have become entrenched have been tabled and can begin to be addressed. It will take time for the healing process to work but at least this process can now begin”, said Mr Goff and Mr Barker.
