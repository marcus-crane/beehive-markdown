New Zealanders’ increasingly warm embrace of, and desire to support, our indigenous language is a welcome sign of the maturing of our nation, Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.

Mâori became an official language of Aotearoa 20 years ago today and Mr Horomia said it was heartening to see the continued growth in the use of te reo and the mounting recognition of the important role it played in our emerging sense of national identity.

“It is also important, when marking the passing of the Mâori Language Act 1987, to acknowledge those visionaries who fought for the recognition and survival of the reo: in the courts, our homes and within the spheres of education and broadcasting.”

“Every individual who makes an effort to familiarise him or herself with the language must also be acknowledged as it is these personal commitments – the small as well as the large – that will safeguard this taonga.”

"Survey results which I released during Te Wiki o Te Reo Mâori (Mâori Language Week) revealed a marked increase in the proficiency levels of Mâori able to speak te reo, with a total of 52 per cent of all Mâori able to speak more than a few words or phrases."

The survey also showed that more parents were conversing with their children in te reo, which is critical for intergenerational language transmission, Mr Horomia said.

“But it also showed we have some way to go before te reo is 100 per cent fighting fit – and that a significant number of people who can use the language do not. We do need to continue to work to ensure te reo becomes more of a part of everyday life.”

The big strides being made by Mâori Television and the on-going contributions of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Mâori, Te Mângai Pâho, kôhanga reo and those working in Mâori medium education are contributing towards realisation of this goal.

“But we still need more Mâori language teachers and to ensure all new pre-school and primary teachers are trained to enable them to deliver basic Mâori language instruction. I have recently asked the Education Ministry to call together a think tank of experts to address these issues.”
