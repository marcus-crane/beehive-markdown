Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton last night cited the Christchurch company Cariboo as an excellent example of a New Zealand company gaining ground by being innovative. “New Zealand is the most isolated place in the world to start an international business. And because we are so far from the rest of the developed world, we are innovative.”

Jim Anderton was speaking at the launch of a new product for Cariboo. “There is innovation here in the new fibre developed by Mid Micron Wools for Cariboo's export range.”

He reminded those at the launch about a survey carried out a few years ago by New Zealand Trade & Enterprise. People surveyed were asked how they wanted New Zealand to be seen by the world. “The majority of New Zealanders − by far − want us to be known throughout the world for our new ideas. It's more important to us than winning on the sports field. We want to be known for our innovation, our creativity and our talent.”

Produced using new technology, the new fibre is not only fire resistant, warm and light but it is also soft enough to be suitable for baby products.

“We need to use science to develop better products because our wool industries have to adapt. R&D helps to add value,” Jim Anderton said. “Wool is a billion dollar industry for New Zealand and our ninth largest export earner but the industry's long-term health depends on its ability to develop high value markets.”

Jim Anderton acknowledged that these are not easy times for wool growers but that the Labour-Progressive government is supporting companies, such as Cariboo, who are involved with research and development. “In this year's Budget we announced a new tax regime for research and development that will make it easier for businesses and industries to develop the kinds of initiatives you have developed here.”
