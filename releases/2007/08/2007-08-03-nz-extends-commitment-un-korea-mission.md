Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced that New Zealand will extend its commitment to the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) in the Republic of Korea for two years to August 2009.

"Stability on the Korean peninsula is critical to ensure peace and prosperity across Asia. New Zealand's participation in UNCMAC ensures we are recognised as an active participant in the peace process and reinforces our commitment to peace keeping and our relationship with the Republic of Korea", said Mr Goff.

"In 1953 an Armistice Agreement was signed which ended fighting in the Korean War. As a result of the Agreement, a 241km long and 4km wide buffer zone, the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), was created to separate North Korean and South Korean armed forces. The primary role of UNCMAC is to supervise access to, and security of, the DMZ.

"New Zealand Defence Force officers have served with UNCMAC since 1998. The deployment involved three New Zealand officers who serve for a six month tour of duty. They are employed monitoring the demilitarised zone to ensure parties comply with the terms of the armistice agreement signed at the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War in 1953.

"UNCMAC is a multinational mission led by the United States. The NZDF personnel serving with UNCMAC have earned a high degree of respect from the other military personnel they serve alongside from Australia, Canada, Colombia, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey and the United Kingdom", said Mr Goff.
