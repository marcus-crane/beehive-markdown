Discounts from 188 businesses with 2215 outlets between them are being offered to seniors through the SuperGold Card, Associate Senior Citizens Minister Winston Peters announced at today's launch.

Over half a million SuperGold Cards are currently being sent free to all New Zealand residents 65 years or older, and to those under 65 who receive Superannuation, a non-qualified spouse entitlement, or a Veterans' Pension.

The Card provides discounts on a wide range of everyday goods and services, as well as easy access to central and local government entitlements previously received through a Super Card or a Community Services Card.

"This is an important day for New Zealand. It is a day when we showed that we take our seniors seriously, through something tangible and rewarding," Mr Peters said.

"The range of businesses offering discounts through the SuperGold Card is truly impressive, and the number who have signed up easily exceeds our launch date target of 150.

"By using their SuperGold Card, from today seniors across New Zealand will be able to access cheaper banking and insurance; make savings on phone calls and the internet; enjoy discounts on clothing, building supplies, household products and furnishings; save money on car repairs, medical alarms, hearing aids, and mobility scooters, and enjoy cheaper travel, rental cars, and hotels.

"Some of our biggest businesses have signed up – Westpac, Kiwibank, TSB, SSB, TelstraClear, Orcon, State Insurance, Sovereign 50 Plus Insurance, Big Save Furniture, Carters, Resene, Guthrie Bowron, New World, Ray White Real Estate, Public Trust, Mr Minit, House of Travel, to name a few.

"But the really important thing to stress at this point is that is just the start. Businesses are continuing to sign up on a daily basis, and the Ministry of Social Development is currently in discussion with 200 more companies.

"We don't have a power company signed up yet. That is a priority for us, and we are not prepared to see our seniors facing next winter without having some relief from the cost of their power bill.

"New Zealand First has campaigned hard for many years to improve the lot of our seniors. We have always believed that their contribution needed to be recognised in a way that could make a real difference to their lives.

"The idea of a dedicated seniors card that helped people make their limited incomes go further has been a longstanding policy for New Zealand First, alongside a boost in Superannuation payments.

"Those promises were at the core of our negotiations with the government following the 2005 election, and became the cornerstone of the confidence and supply agreement.

"We were determined to use whatever influence we had to make the lives of our seniors better. As history will record, we have again delivered on both those promises," Mr Peters said.

The Ministry of Social Development is running a SuperGold Card call centre on 0800 25 45 65 for any queries related to the card, and has set up a website – [www.supergold.govt.nz](http://www.supergold.govt.nz) -- which lists all participating companies and their discounts.

During this week, all those who automatically qualify for a SuperGold Card should have received one in the mail.

Cardholders can choose to have their photograph added to the card free, by visiting an AA business centre – an option for people who do not already have photo identification, such as a drivers licence.
