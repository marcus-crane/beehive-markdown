Racing Minister Winston Peters is seeking nominations for the position of independent chairperson of the Racing Safety Development Fund’s decision-making body.

“This is an opportunity to chair the working group that each year will allocate $1 million in dollar-for-dollar support for projects that improve the safety and therefore the quality of racecourse facilities around New Zealand,” Mr Peters said.

“The successful nominee will work with four representatives from the racing industry in assessing applications to determine the most effective use of fund.

“Racecourse safety is the most pressing issue facing the industry at present. This fund, which was announced in the 2007 Budget, is aimed at encouraging racing clubs to be proactive about addressing safety concerns.

"It is important that we have a strong pool of enthusiastic candidates from which to select the chairperson."

Mr Peters also noted that the deadline for the first round of applications for grants from the Racing Safety Development Fund was September 30.

“All racing clubs are strongly encouraged to submit applications for funding racecourse safety projects by the end of September,” he said.

Nomination forms for the independent chairperson, grant application forms, and further details about the Racing Safety Development Fund can be found at www.dia.govt.nz or by calling 04 495 9313.

The closing date for nominations is Friday, 14 September.
