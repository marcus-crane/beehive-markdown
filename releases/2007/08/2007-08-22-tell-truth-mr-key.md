This afternoon in the House Cabinet Minister Pete Hodgson raised serious concerns around legal and official declarations made by John Key.

The ramifications if proven are serious.

"The penalties under the Companies Act for providing misleading or fraudulent statements include up to five years imprisonment or a $200,000 fine. This is over the threshold at which an MP must step down from Parliament," said Pete Hodgson.

- In March 2002 he declared he was living at Orakei Rd, Remuera for the purposes of the Companies Act.
- In October 2002 he declared to the Chief Electoral Officer that he was living at Waikoukou Valley Rd, Waimauku, Helensville.
- In April 2003 he again declared he was living at Orakei Rd, Remuera for the purposes of the Companies Act.

"When he told the Companies Office in 2003 that he was living in Remuera was that in fact correct? Because he had told the Chief Electorate officer a few months earlier that he was living in Helensville.

"Or was he just living in two places at once? That would be fine except that under the Electoral Act you can reside in only one place.

"And if that is the case, then the Companies Office should be made aware there is conflicting information. That Mr Key shifted from Remuera after March 2002 to Helensville and then back to Remuera by April 2003."

That, Mr Key, is simply not credible. We are all entitled to the truth:

1. Was he living in his new Parnell mansion on 4 April 2003, if not, where was he living?
2. When and for how long did John Key actually live in Orakei Rd, Remuera?
3. Did John Key ever live in Waikoukou Valley Rd, Waimauku, Helensville, if so, when and for how long?
4. Did he shift from one house to another four times between 2002 and 2004 as suggested?
5. Given the information I have to hand, that John Key¡¦s statutory declarations are awry, does he intend to correct those inconsistencies?
6. Is he willing to answer all questions that the Companies Office or Chief Electoral Officer may have for him?
7. Is he aware that under electoral law, an MP convicted of an offence carrying a jail term of two years or more must step down?

"We know Mr Key's style is to slip and slide with what he says. But what we need from Mr Key is some straight answers," Pete Hodgson said.
