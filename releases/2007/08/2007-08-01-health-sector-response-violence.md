Health sector professionals are often the first people who can get help for those suffering family violence or abuse, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today. "The inside of a health clinic is often the only safe place in some New Zealanders’ lives. While we can help nurses, doctors and other staff with additional training and resources to recognise abuse, they alone can not stop abuse. Every person, every government agency, each community and every politician must join together to stop violence and act when they know of abuse," Pete Hodgson says. He [made his remarks](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30215) during the Parliamentary launch of the [Ministry of Health Violence Intervention Programme](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/family-violence-guidelines-elder-abuse-neglect) – the health sector response to violence. The event’s 200 participants included health professionals, judges, child advocates, non-government agencies and community members who are working to end family violence. Budget 2007 set aside $11.2 million to help the health sector in its response and to continue work within the umbrella term ‘Violence Intervention Programme’ to:

- ensure that victims of violence using health services receive the support they require, and
- ensure that staff are trained and competent to screen health service users who may be victims of child and partner abuse.

To date:

- Over 4500 health professionals have been trained in family violence intervention
- Plunket has screened 29,200 new mothers for violence and made 600 referrals for child abuse
- In the past year 500 GPs and midwives have been trained in family violence prevention.

A new resource video specifically targeting Elder Abuse and Neglect, made by [Age ConcernM](http://www.ageconcern.org.nz/?%2Fservices%2FEANP-InfoKit), was also launched at the event.
