The 2007 Get2Go Challenge has been expanded to include secondary schools throughout the North Island, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Year nine and ten students from all over the North Island will have the opportunity to test their mettle this spring in a series of outdoor activities, including rock climbing, kayaking, orienteering and mountain biking. At the end of the series, the ten top teams will compete in a five-day adventure on Great Barrier Island.

Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) is once again partnering with the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre (OPC) to run the second Get2Go Challenge, designed to encourage Year 9 and 10 students to get active and participate in outdoor activities.

"The Get2Go pilot was so successful last year that the event has been extended to reach schools in every region of the North Island this year. The expansion of Get2Go means that more students have the opportunity to get active and test their skills in outdoor activities," Trevor Mallard said.

Day-long regional challenges will be held in ten regions across the North Island. The 2006 pilot in the Waitakere/North Harbour, Counties Manukau, Northland, and central Auckland regions saw more than 300 students participate. This year’s expanded event is expected to attract as many as 1000 students.

"Get2Go also helps students to gain confidence in the outdoors and develop skills such as communication, problem solving, planning, decision making, leadership, endurance and teamwork."

"The ten regional challenge days are designed to suit all levels of fitness and skill. All that will be required on the day will be a positive attitude and the willingness to give anything a go."

To date, more than 500 students from schools across the North Island have entered the Get2Go Challenge.

Schools can enter one team of eight students in the Get2Go Challenge. Schools are reminded that registrations for the event close on 15 August. For a registration form and more information visit [www.opc.org.nz.]()
