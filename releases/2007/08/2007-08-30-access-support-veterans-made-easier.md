Veterans’ Affairs Minister Rick Barker has announced changes which will make it easier for veterans with specific conditions to receive support.

"The New Zealand War Pension system is unique as it works on the basis of the reverse onus of proof. If service cannot be ruled out as a cause or contributing factor of a condition suffered, then a War Disablement Pension is awarded," said Rick Barker.

"This system has served New Zealand well and will be retained in the rewrite of the War Pensions Act currently underway.

"The Labour-led Government is committed to improving the service provided to veterans and as part of this, presumptive lists have been introduced which will help speed up the process of applying for War Disablement Pensions for those with specific conditions," said Rick Barker.

Presumptive lists will be introduced to cover veterans of the following declared Wars and Emergencies under the War Pensions Act 1954:

- Former Prisoners of War of World War II
- Viet Nam Veterans;
- Veterans Exposed to Nuclear Radiation (J-Force, Operation Grapple and Mururoa Veterans); and
- Gulf Conflict Veterans

"Any Veteran who has a disability that appears on the list corresponding to his or her theatre of service will be automatically accepted for a War Disablement Pension. This means the only medical information required will be verification that the veteran has the claimed disability and an opinion on the degree of disablement so the level of pension can be determined," said Rick Barker.

"Presumptive lists will short cut the process of applying for a War Disablement Pensions and will help veterans get what they are entitled to earlier.

"The presumptive lists are based on those which operate in the United States and are based on medical and science evidence, primarily from the National Academy of Sciences institute of Medicine.

"It is important to note that veterans who have disabilities not on the presumptive lists will not be affected by the change. They will still be able to apply for a War Disablement Pension for any disability they believe to be attributable to or aggravated by their service under the reverse onus of proof criteria," said Rick Barker.

A War Disablement Pension is a tax-free lifetime entitlement paid in addition to other income such as New Zealand Superannuation.
