Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel's report on New Zealand's progress and her frank acknowledgement of continuing challenges for women was well received at the United Nations in New York today.

Lianne Dalziel said she was pleased she was able to deliver an extremely positive report of New Zealand's actions to advance the rights of women, and did not shy away from key concerns such as family violence while reporting to the UN Committee responsible for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/)).

"The Committee was very interested to hear about New Zealand's whole-of-government approach to tackling this shameful issue jointly with the community through NGOs, together with the police, the judiciary and the Families' & Children's Commissioners. I was pleased to be able to give concrete examples of the grassroots programmes aimed at improving family safety that are being delivered as a result of a commitment to a real programme of action."

The Committee will deliver an initial response to the New Zealand government by August 10 but, in her summing up, the chair of the New Zealand session Shanthi Dairiam (Malaysia), indicated the Committee's interest in seeing tangible evidence that the CEDAW Convention was effectively reflected in New Zealand law. She indicated interest in the lack of progress in the private sector, in contrast to government, in tackling issues such as women on boards and pay and employment equity.

They also wanted assurance the [Action Plan for New Zealand Women](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/news-and-pubs/publications/action-plan.html), which provides a vision and focus for the Labour-led government initiatives for women's wellbeing, economic independence and work-life balance, supported the goals of the Human Rights Commission's action plan on human rights.

Lianne Dalziel said the women's action plan is a "living document" and the two approaches complement each other.

"I will ensure this human rights vision is made explicit in the next update to the women's action plan."

The Minister was commended for making it possible for NGOs to present shadow reports to the Committee.

"They were really pleased to see the New Zealand government helping our NGOs to have a voice in this international forum, and we were pleased that we could do so," Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel said that it was a highlight to be able to report the lifting of the last remaining reservation to the Convention and that New Zealand had been specifically congratulated by the committee for doing so.
