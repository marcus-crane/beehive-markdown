A new draft Mâori Education Strategy focuses on boosting the achievement of Mâori students by making the education system more effective for them.

‘Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success: The draft Mâori Education Strategy 2008-2012’ sets out priorities, actions, targets and outcomes for the next five years. It’s being released for public consultation today by Education Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia.

The achievement of Mâori has improved since the first Mâori Education Strategy in 1999, and this represents a new stage of education by the Labour-led government based on the growing knowledge of what works for Mâori.

Parekura Horomia says "the plan makes it clear the whole education system must make improving the way Mâori students are taught a top priority. The system is performing well by international standards, but much more needs to be done to ensure the sector responds effectively to the educational needs of Mâori students."

Steve Maharey says this strategy is informed by a greater understanding of what makes a difference for Mâori students, both in the classroom and the community, “programmes like Te Kotahitanga, which challenge teachers’ assumptions and expectations of Mâori students, are already showing encouraging results.”

Research shows that what makes the biggest difference for Mâori students is a different approach to teaching. All leaders in education taking responsibility for Mâori students achieving is also vital.

There are eight key actions to help students reach their full potential, including boosting Mâori participation in early childhood education, improving access to Mâori language education and making sure more young Mâori stay at school.

The action plan also introduces provisional targets including:  
•A 20 per cent reduction in the truancy rate of Mâori students in Years 1 and 2, and Years 9 and 10  
•Increasing Mâori participation in early childhood education from 90 to 95 per cent by 2012  
•Boosting literacy, numeracy and the number of Mâori achieving university entrance.

“Mâori students need to be able to succeed as Mâori. The education system must engage them in a way that is relevant to them and their culture,” Mr Horomia says.

Steve Maharey says the Labour-led government firmly believes that all New Zealanders must be equipped with the knowledge, skills and values to continue to drive our economic transformation.

Public consultation over the next three months will include 13 hui and meetings with key stakeholder groups. A final strategy is expected to come back for government approval in March next year.
