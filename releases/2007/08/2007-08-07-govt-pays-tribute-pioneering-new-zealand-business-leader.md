Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard paid tribute today on behalf of the government to one of New Zealand's pioneering business leaders and innovators - Sir Angus Tait, who passed away today.

"This is a sad day for New Zealand as we lose one of New Zealand's pioneering business leaders, mentors and innovators - a star exporter who has shone the way for many exporters and business people since his first foray into radio technology all those years ago.

"Sir Angus built a hugely successful exporting business, employing thousands of people since his business began and he also touched people and communities in other ways - the Tait Foundation has donated millions of dollars to important causes.

"Sir Angus was not only an innovator and role model for us all, he was a team player, dedicated and committed to his business, his employees and to New Zealand.

"New Zealand can be proud of his many achievements. Sir Angus will be sorely missed but his legacy, I am sure, will live on," Trevor Mallard said.
