Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the appointment of John Blackham as one of New Zealand's three representatives on APEC's Business Advisory Council (ABAC).

"John Blackham is the Chief Executive of software company XSol Limited. He brings extensive experience of working in the high end information technology sector in New Zealand to ABAC," Helen Clark said.

"John Blackham has been instrumental in establishing a number of high tech ventures in New Zealand and brings that perspective to the council. As well as establishing companies in the Asia Pacific, Mr Blackham has worked in business in Europe and the United States.

"ABAC plays a key role in mobilising support among the Asia-Pacific's business communities for progressing APEC's trade and development agenda. It also meets annually with APEC Leaders during their Summit.

"I greatly value the role New Zealand's ABAC representatives play. I thank Wendy Pye, whom John Blackham is replacing, for her very considerable contribution to the work of the New Zealand ABAC team over the last seven years," Helen Clark said.
