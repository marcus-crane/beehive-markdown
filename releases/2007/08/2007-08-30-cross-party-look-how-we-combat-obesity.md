Over 300 individuals and groups contributed to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into obesity and type 2 diabetes which shows just how urgent this public health matter is, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Members from five political parties: Labour, National, the Greens, the Maori Party and New Zealand First heard evidence over a ten-month period and have released their findings today.

"The Labour-led government has been saying for at least the last 2 years that this is the most urgent public health matter and has already started an intensive work programme to halt the rising epidemic of heaviness and its associated health risks,” said Pete Hodgson.

"Earlier in August I announced the Ministry of Health and the District Health Boards will refocus their efforts on ten specific health targets over the coming year. It is no co-incidence that one is to improve the diagnosis and management of Diabetes and another is to improve our physical activity and nutrition to help us all maintain healthy body weight.

Pete Hodgson thanked the Health Select Committee for this work and signalled the Labour-led government’s response would be made available within 90 days.
