New reports released today show New Zealand’s labour market continues to flourish, Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

“These [Department of Labour/Ministry of Social Development Quarterly Regional Labour Market Reports](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/regional/joint/index.asp) show that more people are in paid work compared to this time last year and some regions of New Zealand are experiencing unprecedented growth," said Mr Maharey.

“Nationally, the labour force participation rate has risen to 68.8% in the June quarter 2007, the highest rate recorded since surveying began in 1986.

"Regionally, Taranaki has shown the strongest labour force participation growth rate, increasing from 67.1% in the year to June 2006, to reach 69.3% in the year to June 2007. Taranaki also saw the largest rise in employment rates, up from 64.7% in the year to June 2006 to 66.9% in the year to June 2007. The strengthening oil and gas industry in this region is certainly having a positive impact on the labour market."

“Strong growth in employment was seen in Bay of Plenty (up 13.0%) and Waikato (up 8.9%) and annual average employment rates rose in most regions.

“The national unemployment rate of 3.6% is at the equal lowest rate recorded since surveying began over two decades ago and all regional unemployment rates were below 5% on an annual average basis," said Mr Maharey.

The largest falls in unemployment rates were in Northland (from 5.0% in the year to June 2006 to 4.3% in the year to June 2007), Bay of Plenty (from 4.1% to 3.5%) and Wellington (from 4.5% to 4.1%).

“These 12 reports provide a single point of reference for a range of region-specific labour market information and give a regional dimension to this quarter’s [Household Labour Force Survey](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-jun07qtr-mr.htm) results released yesterday.

"The Labour-led government's commitment to upskilling the New Zealand workforce, lifting the quality of employment, and providing more choices for living, caring and working is paying dividends. These fantastic results New Zealand-wide highlight this commitment," said Mr Maharey.

The reports draw on official statistics from the Department of Labour’s Job Vacancy Monitor, Ministry of Social Development beneficiary records and Statistics New Zealand’s Household Labour Force Survey.
