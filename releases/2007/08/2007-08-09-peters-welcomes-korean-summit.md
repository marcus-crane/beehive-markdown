Foreign Minister Winston Peters has welcomed news that the leaders of North Korea and South Korea will meet in Pyongyang later this month.

"This meeting is as an important step towards easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and both leaders are wished every success," Mr Peters said.

“Maintaining an open dialogue is essential for building confidence and seeking a peaceful resolution of the issues on the Korean Peninsula.

“The people of North Korea live in very difficult conditions, but if the North Korean leadership is prepared to work constructively with other countries, the international community will help."

The summit will be only the second time that leaders of the two Koreas have met since the Korean War. The first was in June 2000.

Mr Peters, who has been invited to visit North Korea, called on both sides to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.

"Last month's shutdown of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor was a welcome step, and the level of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency to date has been encouraging.

“New Zealand is strongly committed to a world free of nuclear weapons, and I will urge North Korea to put a permanent end to their nuclear weapons programme when I visit Pyongyang," Mr Peters said.
