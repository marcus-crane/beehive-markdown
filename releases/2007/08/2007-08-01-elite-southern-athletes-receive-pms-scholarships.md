The successful recipients of Prime Minister's Athlete Scholarships from the Southern region were announced by Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard today.

New Zealand Academy of Sport-South Island athletes make up 210 of a group of more than 650 athletes nationwide who have been awarded a Prime Minister's Athlete Scholarship this year.

"Sport plays a fundamental role in our national identity, which is why the Labour-led government is committed to giving our top athletes every chance to win on the world stage.

"Through the scholarship programme we can help take the financial pressure off athletes and give them more time to focus on reaching their sporting goals, while at the same time studying towards a career which gives them opportunities after sport," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Labour-led government is investing in the physical activity levels of all New Zealanders for our health and well-being, and these athletes are great role models for young people."

Among the Southern-based recipients are Stephanie Mortimer and Rebecca Wardell.

As well as studying at Canterbury University and the Christchurch College of Education, Stephanie is part of the world champion New Zealand Black Ferns rugby team, and says the scholarship has given her the support she needs to study and train.

Preparing for a Rugby World Cup requires a lot of training and focus on her sport and her scholarship has allowed her to do that while she studies.

Rebecca Wardell had represented New Zealand at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, and holds three New Zealand athletics records.

Her Prime Minister's Athlete Scholarship is helping her work towards a Masters in Transport Engineering at Canterbury University and ensures she has a career after athletics.

The scholarships are administered by Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) through the New Zealand Academy of Sport, SPARC's high performance network.
