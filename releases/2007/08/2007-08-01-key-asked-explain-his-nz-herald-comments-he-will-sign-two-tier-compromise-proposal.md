State Services Minister Annette King says the Government is seeking urgent clarification from the National Party following comments made by National Leader John Key in the New Zealand Herald today that he will sign up to the two-tier compromise proposal on a transtasman therapeutics agency.

“I am very surprised by the comments because there’s been no indication before this that the National Party would shift from its position of absolute opposition to regulating complementary medicines jointly with Australia, including opposition to the two-tier approach.”

Ms King says she is seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Key. “I would like him to bring his pen with him if he’s ready to sign because I am absolutely convinced this legislation is in the best interests of New Zealand.

“I will be delighted if National will now confirm John Key’s comment that if the Government comes to him with the two-tier proposal, he will sign it. I am ready to deliver the proposal to him to sign at any time.”

Ms King said she still wondered, however, if Mr Key had checked with National’s health spokesperson Tony Ryall. “Mr Ryall has publicly said repeatedly that there is no way National will support a proposal unless complementary medicines are totally taken out. In fact, Tony Ryall has blocked all efforts at finding a solution.”

Ms King says John Key’s comments “came as a surprise, because they are contrary to all previous feedback received from the National Party. This has included Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen discussing with Mr Key allowing former United Future MP Gordon Copeland to vote for the two-tier mechanism, and Prime Minister Helen Clark telephoning National foreign affairs spokesperson Murray McCully.

“She rang before she spoke to Australian Prime Minister John Howard to ask Mr McCully if there could be any flexibility at all in National’s position, and was told there was none. National could not accept anything other than taking complementaries out.”

Ms King said she rejected National Party allegations that she had not consulted National over the transtasman agreement and the two-tier compromise. “That is merely a convenient excuse for very poor management. I consulted with all five National health spokespersons, including Mr Ryall, seeking a compromiseand ways we could agree, and Michael Cullen talked to John Key about the two-tier approach suggested by New Zealand First.

“Labour won’t be blamed for National’s failure to understand the importance of this legislation, but it seems John Key is now coming to realise what a blunder they made in the past, and what a merry dance Tony Ryall has been leading him.”
