“New Zealand will lead a call at the United Nations General Assembly this year for nuclear states to draw back their nuclear weapons from immediate launch readiness”, Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Thousands of nuclear weapons currently are on high-alert status, ready for instant launch. This presents a major threat to global security.

“Nuclear weapon systems at a high level of readiness increase the risk of these weapons being used, including unintentionally or by accident. Such an eventuality would have catastrophic consequences.

“Steps need to be taken to reduce this risk. New Zealand has played a leading role through its participation in the New Agenda Coalition in pushing for disarmament and non-proliferation. This new initiative is consistent with that role.

“New Zealand, together with like minded states including Sweden, will promote a resolution at the UN General Assembly this year calling on nuclear weapon states to take steps to lower the operational status of their nuclear weapons.

“New Zealand looks forward to others’ support, including nuclear weapon states.

“We call on States with nuclear weapons to take mutual action to remove all nuclear weapons from launch-on-warning status.

“We urge all States with nuclear weapons to take steps to decrease the operational readiness of their nuclear arsenals. Such steps could include the separation of warheads from delivery mechanisms and the separation of arsenal storage from potential deployment locations.”

“Our goal of course is for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons. However lowering the operational status of nuclear weapons would be an important interim step towards this fundamental objective”, Mr Goff said.
