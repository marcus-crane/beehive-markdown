Illegal logging is costing New Zealand wood producers hundreds of millions of dollars in the global marketplace, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

The Government is to consult industry, importers, and retailers on a proposal to introduce rules ensuring wood products sold within New Zealand are produced from legally harvested timber.

It is also working internationally to back proposals to tackle global deforestation.

Jim Anderton said a study, [Implications for the New Zealand Wood Products Sector of Trade Distortions due to Illegal Logging](http://www.maf.govt.nz/forestry/illegal-logging/trade-distortion-implications/index.htm), indicated that trade distortions, due to illegal logging, cost the New Zealand forest industry NZ$266 million a year in lost revenue. Of this cost, forest owners lose $41 million, sawmillers $22 million, and collectively the panel, pulp and paper industries $203 million.

He said the Russian Government had indicated it would impose a higher tax on log exports and if that went ahead, it might restrict supply of logs on the global market, meaning higher prices for New Zealand log exports – a potential increase of at least 14 per cent.

However, New Zealand wouldn’t be the only beneficiary, and illegal logging would still continue. The higher prices for logs, whether legal or not, still impacts on New Zealand, and the cost of illegal logging to New Zealand would increase to NZ$390 million per year. Of this forest owners would lose $117 million, sawmillers $68 million, and collectively the panel, pulp and paper industries $205 million.

The study, carried out by researchers from Crown Research Institute Scion for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, shows that the supply of illegal wood in world markets depressed all wood product prices, distorting global production and trade.

It says that New Zealand export log prices are 10.6 percent lower than they would otherwise be.

Exports of New Zealand wood products (wood panels to mouldings) are up to 15 percent lower. Furniture prices are 2.8 percent lower. It also says there is lower demand for New Zealand furniture because of illegal logging, but the overall effect is very small.

Jim Anderton said the trade distortions not only affected the prices that New Zealand wood producers got in the international marketplace, but they flowed on to the price of forestry land here and the rate of tree plantings.

“So, not only does illegal logging increase greenhouse gas emissions, but also discourages sustainable forestry that helps slow climate change.”

He said combating illegal logging was a priority for the Government, both domestically and internationally.

“I have pressed officials to advance our policy programme, and New Zealand will be taking an active stance internationally to work with all countries serious about reducing illegal logging and avoiding deforestation.”
