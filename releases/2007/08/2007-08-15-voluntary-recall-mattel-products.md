Consumer Affairs Minister, Judith Tizard has applauded Mattel for acting responsibly to carry out the voluntary recall of a small number of its toys.

Mattel has identified potential safety problems with Polly Pocket, Barbie and Tanner accessory toys that may have loose magnets, and a batch of the 'Sarge' green army toys had high levels of lead in the paint.

The recall is underway as a result of Mattel’s increased testing procedures after its recent recall of Fisher-Price toys.

Consumers who own the toys covered by the recall should stop using them immediately and contact Mattel for a refund.

These toys have been sold at major toy retailers, supermarkets and independent retailers in New Zealand.

Under the Consumer Guarantees Act goods sold in the New Zealand market must be of acceptable quality and fit for purpose. This means that goods must be safe. Consumers are entitled to a refund under the Consumer Guarantees Act, which Mattel has confirmed.

"Mattel has kept the Ministry of Consumer Affairs well informed about this and its previous recall. They are to be applauded as a responsible supplier for taking action in response to risks to customer safety. It is pleasing that there have been no reports of injuries" said Judith Tizard.
