Labour Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the release of a Families Commission report into paid parental leave in New Zealand.

"The report says the current provisions are moving in the right direction and offers suggestions for extending the scheme.

"Our Labour-led government introduced paid parental leave for the first time in New Zealand history in 2002, and increased it from 12 to 14 weeks in 2005. Last year we opened up eligibility to the paid parental leave scheme to the self-employed.

"A recent Department of Labour evaluation of the scheme showed that with this change, paid leave is now available to nearly 90 percent of all women in paid work. Paid parental leave is widely embraced by New Zealanders, despite being consistently opposed by the National Party," said Ruth Dyson.

"A recent evaluation of parental leave found that while few fathers use the parental leave provisions already available to them and instead used other forms of leave, many said they would like to take more time off work to share more in the care of their new babies and their partners.

"It's a priority for the Labour-led Government to ensure paid parental leave can be accessed by even more working parents – no matter what their working arrangements – and forms yet one more part of this government's commitment to supporting out families."

"The Family Commission's findings will contribute to the ongoing review and improvement of the paid parental leave scheme."
