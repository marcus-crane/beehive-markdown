“I am absolutely delighted to see a New Zealand fashion company making a decision to remain Kiwi Made,” Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made says.

Ms Bradford was welcoming today's commitment by High Society, designers of the well known ‘Catalyst’, ‘Obi’, ‘Chocolat’ and ‘Mosaic’ labels, to continue to manufacture its garments in New Zealand.

High Society's Managing Director, Robyn Hall says despite obvious cost advantages in going offshore, these are outweighed by the long term advantages of remaining proudly ‘Kiwi Made’.

“It is fantastic to note High Society saying the decision to continue manufacturing in New Zealand includes a commitment to becoming more environmentally sustainable and operating with the highest ethical standards,” Ms Bradford says.

“It is also interesting to hear the company say that New Zealand consumers are increasingly questioning the country of origin of what they are buying.

“We have only just launched the first phase of the Buy Kiwi Made media campaign and the multi-media consumer campaign will be launched in a couple of weeks.

“I am sure that once the multi-media campaign starts, more and more consumers will be demanding New Zealand made. It will make dollars and sense for companies to manufacture in New Zealand and customers will increasingly purchase locally made products," Ms Bradford says.
