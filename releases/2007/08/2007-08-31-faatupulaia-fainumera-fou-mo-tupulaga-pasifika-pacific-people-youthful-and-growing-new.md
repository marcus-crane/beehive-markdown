[New Census 2006 statistics](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/2006-census/2006-census-pacific-profiles-06-mr.htm) released today provide a detailed picture of New Zealand’s Pacific population, says Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“Our Pacific people are youthful, urban-centred and growing in number. Pacific communities now make up 6.9 per cent (265,974) of the total New Zealand population and have every right to feel energetic and optimistic about their future,” said Laban.

The report covered the seven largest Pacific ethnic groups consisting Samoan (49 per cent), Cook Island Maori (22 per cent), Tongan (19 per cent), Niuean (8 per cent), Fijian (4 per cent), Tokelauan (3 per cent) and Tuvaluan (1 percent).

“The report shows the median age of Pacific person in 2006 was 21 years, compared with the total New Zealand population of 36 years. The median age of a Tongan person was a young 19 years,” said Laban.

“The figures reveal that many of our Pacific population were born in New Zealand. 60 per cent of the Samoan population and 73 per cent of the Cook Island Maori population were born here.

“These new statistics illustrate how our far Pacific people have come under this [Labour](http://www.labour.org.nz)-led government, with a huge decrease in unemployment since 1999 and increases in education participation and income levels.

“The figures present us with the challenge of ensuring Pacific peoples are well equipped to fully participate in New Zealand’s success.

Winnie Laban said the report underlines the importance of the Labour-led government’s recently released [Pacific Economic Action Plan and Pacific Women’s Economic Development Plan](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30425).

The two plans focus on key areas for development including education; workforce development; business development; creative, emerging, and growth industries; entrepreneurial culture; and leadership.

“Our Labour-led government is committed to lifting the economic potential and prosperity of Pacific people in New Zealand over the next decade.

"These plans aim to harness their enormous potential and lead Pasifika communities towards greater economic prosperity,” said Laban.
