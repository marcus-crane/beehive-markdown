John Key’s comments on housing affordability today show National is still wedded to the failed policies that helped it lose the 1999 election.

Housing Minister Chris Carter said National’s policy announcements were designed to help property developers, not ordinary people buy their first home. The Housing Minister said simplistic slogans and failed policies from the past would not create affordable homes.

“Selling off state houses, encouraging urban sprawl and deregulating the building sector led to a complete mess in the 1990s which the current Labour-led government had spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to fix up.

“Leaky homes were a direct result of a deregulated approach to development. Today some New Zealanders are still struggling with the cost of that failed approach.

"A similar gutting of the RMA would have profound implications for our environment. This, at a time when more and more New Zealanders are concerned with the impact of development on our coastal and other sensitive landscapes,” said Chris Carter.

“Selling state houses was tried in the 1990s by National. Over 13,000 were hocked off, mostly to property investors and developers, not tenants. We now have 10,000 people on the waiting list and we need more, not less, state rentals.

The Housing Minister said that the reality was that state housing provided affordable homes for the lowest income New Zealanders.

“People who on their current incomes could never pay a mortgage for the homes they currently rent. This would be particularly so in the area of greatest need, Auckland, the city with some of the highest value state houses,” said Chris Carter.

The Housing Minister said there may be an argument for more active adjustment of the urban metropolitan limits around some of our largest cities. However Chris Carter said this had to be done in a careful and planned way.

“The last thing Auckland needs is endless sprawling suburbs compounding current transport and infrastructure costs.”

“Developments like Housing New Zealand’s Hobsonville project are an example of carefully planned urban growth which did require a modest adjustment to the urban limit and which will create a substantial opportunity for first-home buyers.

Chris Carter said that the Labour-led government wants as many Kiwis as possible to own their own home.

“Initiatives like KiwiSaver, the [Welcome Home Loan scheme](http://www.welcomehomeloan.co.nz/), next years shared equity pilot and major government-run urban developments like Hobsonville in West Auckland will help first-home buyers achieve their dream of home ownership. Simplistic slogans and failed policies of the past will not help meet the housing affordability challenge.

The Housing Minister has signalled that the Labour-led government will announce a major housing initiative to help create more opportunities for affordable homes by the end of the year. Chris Carter said he expects this announcement will make a major difference in creating more affordable housing for New Zealanders.
