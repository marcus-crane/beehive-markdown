In Wairarapa nine out of every ten Māori children are fully immunised by their first birthday beating the national average of eight out of ten, Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui said today.

The comments follow yesterday’s launch of nationwide health targets which include childhood immunisation.

The Labour-led government is setting nationwide health targets for the first time in ten key areas: immunisation, oral health, elective services, cancer waiting times, avoidable admissions, diabetes, mental health, healthier lifestyles, smoking and efficiency. The targets have been established to highlight the extra emphasis and focus the government will place on these important priorities.

"While immunisation of tamariki is fantastic over the hill from Poneke we know we can do better in the other District Health Boards. Introducing these targets will enable whānau and communities with excellent results like Wairarapa to share and help others.

The targets will be reviewed annually to assess whether they are still appropriate and relevant. Overseas experiences suggest that periodically refreshing targets is important to maintain their impact on performance and relevance to the priorities of the day.

"I know in Wairoa 65 per cent of the population at a PHO is Māori. Previously only four per cent of those diagnosed with diabetes were taking advantage of the Get Checked programme. Now it’s closer to 95 per cent. How they have done this should not be kept a secret in Wairoa. I say “let the excellence spread.”

"Many will ask why limit ourselves to only ten health targets, but as anyone who's ever set themselves a plan and stuck to it will know, spreading your focus too wide is a handicap to achieving any one of your goals. I know the targets will help improve Māori health outcomes.” Mita Ririnui said.
