Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton said today that the National Party spokesman Shane Ardern is indulging in political grandstanding about the changes to the health import standards for pig meat being proposed by Biosecurity New Zealand.

“For Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) to infect our local commercial pork industry an almost impossible chain of events would have to occur, which is so unlikely, that the risk to New Zealand pork producers is considered to be negligible,” Jim Anderton said.

“I am more than confident that the measures proposed are sufficient,” he said. “Furthermore, the Import Risk Analysis conducted on this issue was peer reviewed by seven independent national and international experts.

“I suspect that National Party MPs such as Lockwood Smith, David Carter and Tim Grosser support a science-based approach to trade. But every couple of months they let Mr Ardern have question number 12 in the House to run some kind of alarmist, shock-horror story up the steps of Parliament on a Massey Ferguson tractor.

“Biosecurity New Zealand has had to make a rational decision over PRRS, balancing all of the views and risks, and I support them doing this without political interference.

“Political interference in the objective decision-making process on import heath standards is totally inappropriate, and is completely contrary to our broader trading interests,” Jim Anderton said.

“If the National Party thinks otherwise, New Zealand agricultural and horticultural exporters have a lot to fear from a National government.”

Circumstances Required for Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome to infect our local commercial pork industry:

i.Pork would have to be imported from a country with PRRS disease present and be present in the meat. Yet, for example, only 1.2 percent of carcasses selected randomly from Canadian slaughterhouses were positive for PRRS.

ii.Imported consumer-ready, cuts of pork, the only cuts proposed to be allowed in, would have to be purchased by a household that has backyard pigs. Only around 1% of households keep backyard pigs (and these households may be less likely to purchase pork).

iii.Fresh raw scraps would have to be generated from the consumer-ready cuts which, by their very nature, will have little waste.

iv.Raw scraps would then have to be disposed of in garbage as opposed to ‘insinkerator’, rubbish bin, or compost heap and not stored there at room temperature overnight.

v. Garbage containing raw scraps would have to be fed to backyard pigs as opposed to other animals, and in contravention of the pig feeding regulations.

vi.Pigs would have to ingest enough raw scraps to constitute an infectious dose but this would be affected by how long the meat was held at room temperature before, and by competition from other pigs.

vii.The raw meat scraps would have to be chewed rather than swallowed whole when the latter is likely if there is competition for food from other pigs.

viii. An infected pig would have to pass the infection on to other pigs.
