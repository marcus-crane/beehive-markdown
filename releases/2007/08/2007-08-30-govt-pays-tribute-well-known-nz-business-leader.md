Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today paid tribute on behalf of the government to one of New Zealand's best known business leaders - Sir James Fletcher, who passed away yesterday.

"As Managing Director of Fletcher Challenge for 37 years, Sir James led the company to success, and was prepared to fight to expand it to the point that it eventually became New Zealand's largest listed company.

"Sir James was extremely dedicated and committed to his business, and has made a huge contribution to New Zealand and its economy.

"Sir James employed thousands of people and will be remembered by many for his loyalty to staff and his efforts to ensure their welfare.

"New Zealand can be proud of his many achievements. Sir James will be sorely missed," Trevor Mallard said.
