The leaders of Viet Nam, Mexico and Hong Kong will visit New Zealand in association with their visits to Sydney at the time of the APEC summit, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

New Zealand will host Mexico’s President, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, before the APEC leaders’ summit, and Viet Nam’s President Nguyen Minh Triet and Hong Kong chief executive Sir Donald Tsang afterwards.

Mr Calderon’s visit from 6-7 September is the first bilateral visit to New Zealand by a Mexican president.

“I am delighted that President Calderon is visiting New Zealand early on in the term of his administration,’’ Helen Clark said.

“The visit reflects the strategic importance of our relationship with Mexico. New Zealand exports to Mexico last year amounted to $424 million, contributing to two-way trade of $562 million, and there remains significant room for growth.

“I look forward to making progress in several areas of mutual interest, including economic partnerships and people to people links.’’

Viet Nam’s President, Mr Triet, will lead the largest ever delegation from Viet Nam to New Zealand from 9-12 September.

He will be accompanied by a number of Ministers and senior officials, as well as a large business and media contingent.

“Viet Nam's economy is one of the fastest growing in Asia, with an average growth rate of 7.8% in recent years. I was struck by its dynamism when I visited for APEC in 2006.

Business interaction between New Zealand and Viet Nam is expanding. Trade between New Zealand and Viet Nam was valued at approximately NZ$394 million for the year to December 2006.

“We are developing a more broad-based relationship with Viet Nam and have a solid platform for that already in many areas, including trade, education, defence, business and investment. This visit will allow us to further explore new areas of collaboration including science, climate change and environmental protection.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Sir Donald Tsang will visit from 10-12 September, reciprocating Helen Clark’s visit to Hong Kong last year.

In New Zealand he will meet with Helen Clark, Michael Cullen, and a range of business leaders and academics, as well as hosting a Hong Kong tourism event in Auckland.

“Hong Kong is New Zealand’s eleventh largest trading partner. New Zealand exports there last year were worth more than $500 million. Our close connections go back to the days of British rule, and the shared legacy of a commitment to the rule of law. We work closely together in organisations like APEC and the World Trade Organisation,’’ Helen Clark said.
