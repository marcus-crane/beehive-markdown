A tripartite initiative involving the government, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU) and Business New Zealand (Business NZ) will further drive skill development in this country’s workforce.

“Increasing the skills and expertise of people currently in the workforce is critical to drive greater productivity and so accelerate economic transformation. It is even more important when unemployment is at a record low,” said Minister for Tertiary Education, Dr Michael Cullen.

“The agreement signed today by government, NZCTU and Business NZ representatives will ensure that progress continues to be made in this important area. It signals just how serious the three groups are about working together to improve progress.”

Dr Cullen said working in partnership will increase understanding of the challenges of workforce skill development, and ensure that the tertiary education sector and employers respond appropriately to current and future skill needs.

“Changes to the way the government invests in tertiary education provide a platform for greater collaboration among those that provide tertiary education and training, and those that benefit directly from it – such as students, business, industry and community groups.”

Business NZ Chief Executive, Phil O’Reilly said that “building strong links between education and industry and lifting New Zealanders' skill levels would be critical to the country's future prosperity."

"Skill development is a key part of the economic and social development agenda. As 80 per cent of the workforce of 2017 are in the workforce today this means a strong focus on upskilling is required to build the high wage, high skill economy, quality employment and careers we all aspire to," CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said.

*Present at the signing were Dr Cullen; Minister of Labour, Hon Ruth Dyson; Acting Minister for Employment, Hon Steve Maharey; Mr O’Reilly; Ms Beaumont; Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) Chief Executive, Janice Shiner: and Department of Labour Chief Executive, Graham Fortune.*
