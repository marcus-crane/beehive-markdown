**Introduction**

Sunny Nelson greetings to you all.

Thank you for inviting me here today to open your annual conference.

A lot has happened in the twelve months since I spoke at your last conference in Gisborne. At that time I talked about our review of fire legislation. And I’d like to talk about that again today.

But first I want to acknowledge your conference theme, “Wildland Fire Training for Global Cooperation.” It’s a theme which captures both the special nature of your work, and the cooperative aspects of your sector.

**Cooperating to fight forest fires**

In December last year I travelled to Victoria in Australia to visit firefighters injured at Mt Terrible, appropriately named.

This was an unfortunate incident, and served to remind us all that yours is a dangerous profession.

We all need to be aware of the power of wildfires, and I know that safety is always paramount. Building on your knowledge is partly what this conference is about.

For now though, I’d like to focus on the “global cooperation” aspects of your theme. That was one of the things that impressed me so much in Australia.

Well-trained people from different parts of the global rural firefighting community coming together to fight a common threat.

I was particularly impressed by how quickly New Zealand firefighters were able to mobilise in significant numbers to assist our Australian mates. I was also impressed to see how well everyone was able to work together to achieve a common task. This, I understand, is the benefit of having a common command structure with well understood management systems, as well as established working relationships and understanding of each others working environment.

You will understand that under my other hat, as Minister of Civil Defence, the potential of regional mutual assistance agreements is of great interest. I know that we also have similar agreements with the United States, and that a further agreement with Canada is close to completion. To my mind this cooperation is a great working model. With a cooperative approach we increase everyone’s resilience.

As you will know, last year 29 New Zealand firefighters went to the US to help fight the wildfires ravaging the Pacific North West.

In Washington in May this year my Cabinet colleague, Trade Minister Phil Goff, was presented with this engraved fire-fighting axe and commemorative plaque by the USA Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, in appreciation of the efforts, professionalism and dedication of the kiwi firefighters.

Just like those firefighters who went to Australia, those who went to the USA did New Zealand proud, and it gives me great pleasure today to present this Pulaski and plaque to National Rural Fire Officer Murray Dudfield.

**The review of legislation**

In response to the recent launch of the discussion document, there have been around 370 submissions received by the Department of Internal Affairs.

Many useful comments have been made. I’d like to thank the many of you who have participated in this effort.

My goal throughout this process has been to be led by the sector, and this morning I would like to reinforce the fact that nothing in the proposals are set in stone. The proposals represent our attempt to map out the feedback and ideas the sector has provided us over the last few years.

**The proposal is about choice**

The first thing I’d like to note is that the proposal is about choice. Some public comments to date seem to indicate that everyone is being forced into a new organisation. Today I want to remind you of the choices that are being offered in respect of rural fire services.

The proposal offers choices for communities and firefighters.

Choices for communities

For communities what I am offering comes down to two choices.

First, communities can choose to retain vegetation fire management responsibilities. If so, they will remain either as Fire Authorities or members of Fire Committees. For these communities there will be three main consequences.

1. They will have clear accountabilities for vegetation fire. They won’t have to provide the capacity to fight structural fires in their areas.
2. All rural fire forces will attain a common brigade status with urban brigades. Rural volunteer brigades will receive financial support from the FRS for their establishment, training and equipment similar to what happens today for urban brigades.
3. And last, the FRS will have the responsibility to provide its general rescue services within their regions.

For communities that make this choice the consequences will be greater clarity about responsibilities for services, and lower costs.

The second choice is for communities to hand over all their fire responsibilities to the FRS.

This will mean that the new FRS would provide all services in their areas and support all local brigades. For these communities this would completely remove the costs of existing services.

**Choices for firefighters**

For firefighters the choice is about what kind of work they wish to do. This acknowledges the varied mix of rural fire forces.

Some of your members concentrate solely on forest and vegetation fires. Others belong to forces which act much like urban brigades in any small New Zealand town.

Some of these attend more road accidents and natural disasters than fires. They want to be part of a community’s self help capability.

In the proposal existing rural fire forces can choose to remain as specialist vegetation firefighters if they wish.

No-one will compel them to perform tasks in which they have no interest, or for which they are untrained. It will be up to brigades to choose what type of activities they wish to carry out. There will be a place for everyone’s skills.

Conversely, those volunteer rural fire forces which currently operate like urban brigades will still be able to opt to continue this role. If their community chooses to retain vegetation fire responsibilities, they can continue to work for their local fire authority in this capacity. At the same time, however, it is highly likely that the new FRS would retain their services for other fire and rescue work. In both cases their training and equipment would be supplied by the FRS.

I can assure you that no rural fire teams will be forced into unwanted roles under the proposal. Volunteers are a key strength of firefighting in New Zealand, and the proposals are about how best to employ the efforts of all willing volunteers.

In this context I need to mention that standards will be developed to ensure that firefighters will have the right equipment and training to keep them safe and to enable them to work effectively. Standards are only for this purpose, not to raise the bar and discourage people from becoming volunteers.

**Takeover fears**

Some have said the proposals mean all control will go to ‘Wellington’. I think we can all agree, given where the strength of fire services lies in New Zealand, that if this was the case, it would be a step back indeed!

Since becoming Minister of Internal Affairs I have spoken to firefighters throughout New Zealand about how we can get the best fire service possible.

I want the final product to strike the right balance between having a national structure that provides support, and at the same time empowers communities to identify the issues they face, and gives them the resources necessary to respond appropriately.

What we’re trying to achieve here, and I’m not saying we are completely there yet, is a structure of local delivery and central support.

This structure works for well for Civil Defence and I believe it can benefit for fire services in New Zealand too.

I expect debate around how the new structure should look – this is a good thing and is reflected in many of the submissions. However I do feel that some issues which have been raised about the proposed structure fail to reflect what is actually contained in the proposals.

The proposals recognise that it is local people who deliver our local services. And in most of New Zealand this means volunteer brigades and fire forces.

Anyone who understands how our existing urban fire services work would understand that volunteer brigades have a good measure of autonomy. They are usually led by Chief Fire Officers, who have statutory powers to enable them to act at the local level.

The proposal makes sure that we continue with statutory officers. That we will continue with local empowerment. And it ensures that there will be strong support for all firefighter brigades and forces.

This will apply whether they come to work for the new FRS, or for a Fire Authority.

The requirement for regional plans will also help ensure that there is ongoing input from the regions. I think regional plans are a great idea and they are gaining widespread support.

It will enable the integration of all regional fire risk management services. Because the FRS will be required to develop and lead the consultation process on these plans, it will ensure that it is always engaged locally.

It will necessarily have its own local managers who understand and respond to their own regions.

Another aspect of the model is that the FRS itself must support all brigades throughout the country. In a new organisation, where 85% of brigades are likely to be staffed by volunteers this will always be an ongoing challenge. Brigades and forces have a strong sense of local identity.

It is my view that the need to maintain credibility and influence throughout this volunteer base will never allow the FRS to become a remote and autocratic organisation.

**Risk reduction**

One of the starting points in the proposal is that we are creating a new organisation. It will have the prime responsibility to develop a “4 Rs” approach to fire risk management. And it will have much wider responsibilities in law compared with the existing Fire Service.

The need to focus much more on risk reduction is one of the important reasons for bringing in a 4 Rs approach to the new legislation. Anyone familiar with the present Fire Service Act will know that it focuses heavily on response.

The Forest and Rural Fires Act is better in this respect. And that’s no accident. Better laws do create better outcomes. We know the rural sector has well-developed practices in risk reduction. And we want to retain this expertise and build on it.

So the point about new legislation is that we can do better in these areas with a fully integrated approach. Those who fear that the new FRS will ignore risk reduction are failing to take note of the new emphases which the law will require.

Any board directing the new organisation will need to look pretty carefully at what this will mean. Their jobs, and the performance of the chief executive, will depend on how well the FRS manages this responsibility. They would ignore it at their peril. That’s what we mean by accountability.

**It ain’t broke**

Another of the common arguments I’m hearing is of the kind “if it ain’t broke don’t try to fix it!”

This is more of a slogan than a robust piece of analysis. You could have a 1936 Austin Seven in effective working order. While it might not be broke, everyone knows we could get better.

A long list of problems have been raised and acknowledged since we began our review. Those who delve into our present legislation know that it has problems.

It is my strong belief that we can pull together a wide range of fire risk management skills and knowledge in the one integrated organisation. That we can greatly improve things. That’s what we do all the time in New Zealand. We pride ourselves on being an adaptable people.

**Conclusion**

I believe the process of our review has been excellent in the way it has drawn out the views of all stakeholders. For two years now I’ve been in dialogue with firefighters and the wider sector. And this has seen the proposals change sign. I expect further refinement.

In the coming months I will be taking the results of your submissions to Cabinet for further consideration.

The challenge for all of us is to create something that we can be proud of for the next thirty years. And we should all be acutely aware that the opportunity for such large changes is something that comes very rarely.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you well for the rest of your conference.
