Finding reliable and up-to-the minute business information has become easier through a new government website, Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

The new website, www.business.govt.nz, has been developed with input from a wide range of government departments, business groups and business service providers.

“[Business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz/) is the place for busy business men and women to quickly find the information they need and to access relevant services.

“The site is also a gateway for business people to find the latest information available from the wider business community,” Lianne Dalziel said at the launch of business.govt.nz at Wellington business Harriet Harcourt Catering today.

"Business.govt.nz is more interactive than its predecessor (biz.org.nz) and will ensure business people can easily access relevant and accurate information to run their businesses successfully. I particularly like features such as the online checklists that help business people keep track of what they need to do to grow their business. It also provides easy access to online training resources and allows users to personalise the site to keep track of events and dates of importance to them, set alerts, bookmark favourite topics and subscribe to a business e-newsletter with all the latest information," Lianne Dalziel said.

“The features of the site have been based on what businesses have told us they need. Information and communications technology has an important part to play in improving business capability and the site helps businesses use the power of this technology to access that capability."

Business people can continue to access advice about where to find information relevant to their business from the network of walk-in Business Information Zone (BIZ) offices around New Zealand and the freephone Biz service (0800 42 49 46) which are run by the Government’s economic development agency, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

**Why was a new site developed?**  
The previous government business site, biz.org.nz, was launched in 2003 and has proved to be a useful and well-used business resource. However, technology and the needs of business are always changing. Creating a new government business site means we can build on the success of biz.org.nz and expand the information and services that the current site provides. Budget 2005 contained $9.9m to develop the site. So far it has cost about $3m and the remainder will be used over the next three years to continue developing the site's features.

**Who has developed business.govt.nz?**  
Business.govt.nz has been developed by [New Zealand Trade and Enterprise](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/) in consultation with a range of government departments and ministries, business groups and business service providers. This level of input has ensured the features of the new site are based on what businesses have told us they need to make managing their businesses easier.

**What is the long-term vision for business.govt.nz?**  
Continual improvements to business.govt.nz will eventually result in the site becoming the becoming the primary point for New Zealand business people to interact and transact with the whole of government, as well as continuing to be an access point for advice and information from the private sector.
