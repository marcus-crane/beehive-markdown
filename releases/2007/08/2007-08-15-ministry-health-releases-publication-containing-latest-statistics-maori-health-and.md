A health profile containing the latest statistics on the number of Māori in the health workforce as well as potential pathways for Māori to enter the health workforce has been released by the Ministry of Health.

He Pa Harakeke: Māori Health Workforce Profile

Associate Health Minister, Mita Ririnui says he is pleased a new report shows there has been an increase in the number of Māori in the health and disability workforce.

Mita Ririnui was commenting on He Pa Harakeke: Māori Health Workforce Profile 2007 just released by the Ministry of Health, which presents the most recent statistical information on Māori in the regulated health careers.

Mita Ririnui says “Building capable and competent Māori health workers is pivotal to improving health outcomes for Māori. The challenge for the sector is to look for opportunities to continue to support Māori into health careers”.

Improvements in the number of Māori have been made across most of the registered occupations including medical practitioners, registered nurses, registered midwives, medical radiation technologists, dietitians and chiropractors.

For example, the number of Māori midwives practising grew from 110 in 2005, to 157 in 2006 and the number of Māori radiation technologists increased from 12 in 2005 to 40 in 2006.

Mita Ririnui says "The careers profiled in the report shows that young Māori who have left secondary school, Māori who are second chance learners as well as Māori who have had careers in other sectors are taking up health as a career option.”

In 2006, the Ministry released Raranga Tupuake: Māori Health Workforce Development Plan, a 10 to 15 year plan for building a competent, capable, skilled and experienced Māori health and disability workforce. A number of workforce development programmes are underway in areas such as breast and cervical cancer screening, Māori public health and tobacco control. In addition, there are sector-wide health workforce programmes such as the Health Workforce Careers Framework, Health Workforce Information Programme and the DHBNZ Future Workforce project. The Ministry of Health and DHBNZ are working to develop a career framework for the health workforce, and have recently released a discussion document for consultation.
