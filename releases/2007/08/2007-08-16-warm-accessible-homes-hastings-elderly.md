Older people living in pensioner housing will enjoy warmer homes with easy-access thanks to funding made available through the Government’s Housing Innovation Fund, Housing Minister Chris Carter announced today.

Mr Carter met with Hastings District Mayor Lawrence Yule to celebrate the $740,000 suspensory loan which will be used to modernise the Council’s 220 elderly housing units.

“The support provided to Hastings for its modernisation programme demonstrates the government’s commitment to providing good quality housing for older people and others in need”, Mr Carter said. “It is a great example of what can be achieved when the government, and councils work together to improve the quality of social housing.”

“The Government wants all New Zealanders living in homes which are safe, secure and suited for modern living. Decent housing makes a strong contribution to people’s health and well being, and enables them to contribute positively in their communities.”

Hastings District Council currently owns and operates nine pensioner housing complexes targeted at providing a low cost accommodation option for those most in need within Hastings District. The complexes comprise 220 individual units located in Flaxmere, Hastings and Havelock North.

Mr Yule said the council had a long proud history of supporting the housing needs of the elderly dating back to 1960.

“This announcement is a wonderful result for Hastings, it means we can modernise our housing stock and to provide for the future needs of older people in our community”, said Mr Yule.

The modernisation programme is planned to take 12 months and includes bathroom reconfiguration, insulation improvements, improved outdoor shelter, removing access impediments and enhanced provision for mobility scooters.

Launched in 2003 and administered by Housing New Zealand, the Housing Innovation Fund was established by the government to provide grants and loans to community groups and local authorities committed to increasing and improving housing available to low income earners or people with special needs.
