Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, today congratulated Freeview and associated broadcasters on the figures of take up of free-to-air digital television in the first three months.

“At the launch of Freeview in May, I recall General Manager Steve Browning saying they would be happy if they reached 40,000 householders by the end of their first year.

“21,000 set-top boxes have been sold in the past three months, bringing the total of free-to-air digital households to 41,000. This is simply an outstanding achievement.

"Free-to-Air digital television will carry public broadcasting into the future, ensuring an accessible New Zealand presence in the diverse digital environment. Congratulations to TV One, TV2, TV3, C4, Maori Television, Radio New Zealand National and Radio New Zealand Concert for their commitment to Freeview.

“TVNZ has two new advertising-free channels coming on to Freeview in September and March, TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7. Triangle has also announced its intention to launch its Stratos digital channel. With more content, we can expect an increasing number of consumers choosing to make the one-off payment to buy a set-top box and change to digital television.”

The Labour-led government has committed $25 million over five years and has provided access to free digital frequencies to support the development of free-to-air digital television by Freeview.
