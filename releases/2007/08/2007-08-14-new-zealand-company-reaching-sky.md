Start-up company Rocket Lab’s project to send New Zealand’s first rocket into space may open up new opportunities for the country’s aviation sector, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said today at the company’s official launch in Auckland.

"From early pioneer beginnings, our aviation industry has grown substantially and now represents an important and thriving industry sector in its own right. It could not have got to where it is today without blue-sky thinkers like Richard Pearse and the people behind our aerial topdressing industry.

"The entrepreneurs behind Rocket Lab want to deliver pioneering technology and specialised components to the international space industry, so are demonstrating similar creativeness and spirit," Trevor Mallard said.

Commercial opportunities in the space industry are growing. US space agency NASA is also increasingly contracting out much of its work globally to private providers.

"Rocket Lab intends to provide innovative, low cost solutions for the space industry which it hopes will lead to creation of a respected sub-orbital space industry in New Zealand. This could provide opportunities for New Zealand’s aviation sector, and associated technology and component suppliers.

"To compete internationally, New Zealand needs to move up the value chain and create high-value spin-off industries. This requires the development of new areas of niche expertise.

"Rocket Lab’s ambition fits these goals as it will be leveraging off New Zealand’s unique geographical position and creating a specialist area of technical expertise.

"As such, I wish the company success and look forward to watching its progress," Trevor Mallard said.
