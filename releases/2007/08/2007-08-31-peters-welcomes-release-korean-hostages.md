Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is welcoming today's release (NZT) of the seven remaining Korean hostages who have been held in Afghanistan for six weeks.

A group of 23 Korea missionaries was taken hostage by the Taliban on 19 July, while travelling from Kabul to Kandahar. Two of the missionaries, both men, were killed several weeks ago. Twelve were freed on Wednesday, and two were released earlier.

“New Zealand utterly condemns the taking of hostages. While today's release will have been a great relief to the family and friends of the hostages, and indeed to all the people of South Korea, our thoughts also go out to the families and friends of the two men who died," Mr Peters said.

"The Afghan authorities and everyone who assisted in trying to negotiate the hostages' release should be commended for their efforts. It is a very difficult situation for governments whose citizens are taken hostage and threatened with execution unless terrorist demands are met," Mr Peters said.

New Zealand has a Provincial Reconstruction Team and other defence and police personnel based in Afghanistan.
