The Minister of Youth Affairs says the story of India’s development since independence should be an inspiration to New Zealanders young and old.

Nanaia Mahuta, who attended Indian Independence Day celebrations in Auckland today, says India’s commitment to democratic values is recognised throughout the world.

"India is a multi-cultural country which faces challenges in meeting the aspirations of all its peoples within the world’s largest democracy. The point is not the difficulties in developing its multi-cultural nation, but India’s success in maintaining its democracy while doing so.

"There is sometimes a feeling in New Zealand that our way of life is threatened by people maintaining and developing their ancestral languages and culture. World experience, including that of India suggests that this is not so.

"Nations are enriched by the presence of people who can claim a lineage to different places, cultures and languages.

"The challenge is to ensure that there is the opportunity for young people of all cultures to maintain and develop their languages and culture, while taking a full part in the life of the wider New Zealand community.

"I congratulate the Indian communities of New Zealand for the way they have continued to support their traditions, and urge all members of the communities to ensure that these taonga are not lost to future generations".
