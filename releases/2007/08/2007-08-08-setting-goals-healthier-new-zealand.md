Health Minister Pete Hodgson today announced a set of major health targets for the New Zealand health system, aimed at achieving the best possible health outcomes for all New Zealanders.

The Labour-led government is setting nationwide health targets for the first time in ten key areas: immunisation, oral health, elective services, cancer waiting times, avoidable admissions, diabetes, mental health, healthier lifestyles, smoking and efficiency.

"The Labour-led government has made an investment in health that is almost without precedent, repairing the infrastructure of a system severely damaged throughout the 1990s,” Pete Hodgson said.

"For New Zealanders, that has meant the price of seeing the doctor has been cut to around half what it was under National while prescription charges are now $3, not $15. Hospitals have rebuilt from Kataia to Invercargill, 4000 extra nurses and 1200 more doctors are now working in our health system. Labour has delivered better pay for clinicians, higher rates of screening for breast cancer and diabetes, lifted immunisation rates and achieved a drastic cut in the number of New Zealanders still smoking.

"Those successes would have been unimaginable seven and a half years ago but we are not stopping there. These targets are ambitious, but we shouldn't settle for less.”

Pete Hodgson says the targets are areas of priority where improvements will deliver the best health outcomes possible for New Zealand families.

"The Ministry of Health included the targets in their Statement of Intent this year and have been building support for them across the health sector. The Ministry will now work in partnership with District Health Boards, service providers and communities to achieve them.

"New Zealanders are very fortunate to be served by health professionals who strive for continued improvement in the health of our families. These targets are a statement from the Labour-led government it shares that ambition.”
