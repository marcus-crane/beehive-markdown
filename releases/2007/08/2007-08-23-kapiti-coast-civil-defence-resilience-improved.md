Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker officially opened the Kapiti Coast District Council Emergency Operation Centre today, saying it will be a valuable resource for the Kapiti Coast.

“Recent civil defence emergencies throughout New Zealand have severely tested the resilience of communities, and have highlighted the importance of strong and effective regional systems and structures,” said Rick Barker.

“Today’s opening of the Kapiti Coast District Council Emergency Operation Centre represents the Labour-led Government’s philosophy of local control with regional and national support in action.

“Local communities know who lives where; know what support and capability exists, and know what risk factors are most likely.

“This is a facility those on the Kapiti Coast have determined they need in order to be prepared and I commend those who have been involved in its development.

“I am always heartened during civil defence emergencies by the way communities pull together during and after these events. Community organisations play a vital role in building a resilient and safer New Zealand, and it is great that the Red Cross will also operate out of this Emergency Operation Centre.

“This Emergency Operation Centre is testament to the Kapiti Coast District Council’s commitment to improving the resilience of the community they serve,” said Rick Barker.
