Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor visited Waikeria Prison near Hamilton today to observe progress at the first of three new rehabilitation programme facilities for high-risk offenders.

Ten prisoners are undertaking the intensive 300-hour programme delivered over 33-weeks which aims to motivate offenders to change their behaviour, and to provide them with skills to help prevent offending in the future.

The programme, a first for New Zealand, has been underway for two weeks. It will be moved to a purpose built special treatment unit at the prison early next year, and a second and third unit will be developed in Spring Hill Corrections Facility in June 2008 and at a South Island prison from June 2009.

Mr O’Connor said the initiative, an important part of the Labour-led Government's Effective Interventions strategy, is a big step forward from previously used lower intensity programmes targeting high-risk offenders.

"Research conducted in 2005 indicated that high risk offenders were not benefiting from the criminogenic programmes in place and hence required a more targeted approach.

“These programmes are the result. At more than 300 hours duration, they are three times as long and more likely to be successful, as high-risk offenders need a lot of time and effort devoted to their rehabilitation. Clearly the old programme was too short."

Psychologists and experienced staff will deliver these high-intensity programmes. Once the units are fully operational a total of 120 prisoners are expected to take part annually, Mr O'Connor said. This is additional to the more than 500 places that will be available at prison drug and alcohol units from the middle of next year.

A further 470 prisoners and 260 offenders on community-based sentences will undertake the newly introduced 140-hour Medium Intensity Rehabilitation Programme in the year to June. These programmes will be offered across nine prisons and 12 community areas.

In total, around 1300 prisoners and offenders in the community undertake rehabilitation programmes delivered by Corrections staff annually. A further 1500 undertake a Tikanga Maori Programme, and other programmes target child sex offenders, violent offenders, and those with drug and alcohol addiction.

Mr O’Connor said the special treatment units, along with three additional drug and alcohol treatment units and greater prisoner work and training opportunities, are part of a strengthening of Corrections' rehabilitation focus. Prisoners are being presented with a clear spectrum of incentives and sanctions to encourage them to obey the rules while in prison and to take action to become responsible members of society when released.

"Treatment units such as this complement the prisoner placement system I announced two weeks ago, which is to be rolled out across the country's prisons in a staged process. If prisoners show they are willing to change, undertake rehabilitative courses and take part in work opportunities they will be able to progress through the system and prepare themselves for crime-free lives after prison."
