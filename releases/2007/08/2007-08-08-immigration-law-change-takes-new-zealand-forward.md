The biggest rewrite of immigration law for two decades will ensure New Zealand is well-placed to meet the challenges and grasp the opportunities of a fast-changing world, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

The Labour-led Government's landmark Immigration Bill, to replace the dated, inflexible Immigration Act 1987, has been tabled in Parliament today.

"Changes in this Bill will clarify and strengthen border security, tighten the law against those who pose a risk to New Zealand’s well-being, and facilitate the entry of those migrants we want," Mr Cunliffe said.

“It allows Classified Information to be used in immigration, refugee, and protection decisions. Provisions in the Bill will replace Part 4A of the current Immigration Act.

"We will have a robust new international protection regime, a world-class independent appeals system, and a model detention system that will uphold human rights and high standards of fairness. The Bill is consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights.

"The Bill proposes a simplified visa system, more flexible powers to enforce  
immigration law, and the ability to collect and use biometric information.’’

It follows the extensive public consultation carried out in 2006 as part of the Immigration Act Review.

"Significant global changes have taken place since the present law was passed in 1987. There are greater flows of people around the world. There is greater global competition for skills, talent, and labour. There are heightened risks and pressures on the border.

"These changes are real. New Zealand needs to recognise them, and to adapt the immigration system to ensure the best outcomes for this country.

"That is why we are undertaking a major overhaul of the entire immigration system, with this Bill complemented by operational reform – the Immigration Business Transformation – and the concurrent review of immigration policies.

“Migrants from all over the world play a vital role in the economic transformation and wonderful diversity of this country. That role is set to increase as our need for skilled, talented people continues,’’ Mr Cunliffe said.
