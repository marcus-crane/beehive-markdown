Communications Minister David Cunliffe has received a report from Telecom on the outage of its Yahoo!Xtra webmail service last week.

The report noted the following:

\- An unforeseen technical fault caused serious disruption to the planned migration of customers to the new Yahoo!Xtra Bubble service.

\- The fault was diagnosed last Monday night and repaired by Tuesday evening.

\- The fault caused a backlog of customers requiring assistance.

\- Telecom has apologized to affected customers and is *looking at an appropriate form of compensation* for those unable to access the service they were paying for.

The Minister understands how frustrated those affected by the outage must feel.

"It is disappointing when a major provider such as Telecom leaves many thousands of customers without access to their accounts over a 24-hour period.

"We live in an increasingly technology-dependent world and outages such as this may occur from time to time.

"The issue is how these situations are dealt with.

"I am assured by Telecom that the majority of its customers were back up and running by the end of the week, and I am pleased to hear that the company is looking at ways of compensating those paying for a service they did not receive," Mr Cunliffe said.
