Pacific Island Affairs Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the response by the Ministers of Consumer Affairs and Social Development to the release today, of a report into borrowing by Pacific consumers from ‘fringe’ credit providers.

“The report’s key finding is that the most common reason for Pacific borrowers to seek credit from fringe lenders is to cover everyday household expenses followed by borrowing to buy cars. A major concern highlighted by the report is that borrowing by many of the borrowers leaves them exposed to high cost credit and potentially exploitative credit contracts.

“Stronger enforcement of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act will help curb exploitative behaviour by some credit suppliers. Better information will also forewarn consumers about entering into credit arrangements which will be oppressive.

“Both the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development have support systems and initiatives to better inform families seeking financial support or who may be about to enter into a loan contract.

“The Ministry of Consumer Affairs ‘Truecost’ campaign is aimed specifically at assisting borrowers calculate the actual costs associated with any financing arrangement they enter into. The Ministry has a set of resources which enable borrowers to do the sums before they sign on the bottom line and to highlight the legal and financial risks that may be associated with agreements.

“Truecost resources including fact sheets and loan checklists that enable borrowers to calculate the actual costs of finance are available in English, Tongan and Samoan from the Truecost website: [www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/truecost](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/truecost/)

“Initiatives like regularly raising minimum wage rates and the Working for Families programme are designed specifically to improve the incomes of lower income families and help them meet their needs”, said Mr Goff.
