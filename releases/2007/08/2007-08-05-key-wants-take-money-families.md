There is no doubt families will be worse off under a National government, Finance Minister Michael Cullen warned today.

John Key has told the National Party conference that families on above average incomes will not get support under Working for Families if National is elected. Instead he is promising to cut taxes for higher income earners.

"He is promising significant personal tax cuts for those on above average incomes, but once again fails to come up with any details," said Dr Cullen.

"There is no way National could afford to cut taxes to ensure families currently receiving the Family Support Tax Credit would be no worse off.

"What is clear is that John Key has no qualms about taking money off those who need it most - hard working Kiwi families because he thinks tax cuts are the panacea for all our economic challenges.

"Once again John Key is promising much, but saying little. Sound bites are no substitute for policy. It may satisfy National's core supporters, but it should worry the thousands of Kiwi families across the country for which Working for Families is making a real difference to their ability to make ends meet.

“Mr Key also says he wants to help Kiwis afford houses – Working for Families is doing exactly that. So is KiwiSaver. But there’s no mention of that in his speech. Mr Key voted against KiwiSaver and is threatening to cut Budget 07’s extension – how will that help New Zealanders buy their first home?” said Dr Cullen

Housing Minister Chris Carter said today National’s housing policies are nothing new, just a retreat to the failed policies of the nineties.

“Selling state houses then reduced the pool of houses for those who could not afford their own homes. Even now there is a waiting list of 10,000 families wanting a state house so how can selling state houses help them?

“National also promises to reduce compliance costs. Mr Key seems quite prepared to run the risk of another leaky building type crisis.

“These are policies for developers, not people,” Chris Carter concluded.
