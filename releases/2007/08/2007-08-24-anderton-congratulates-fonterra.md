Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today congratulated Fonterra on its increased forecast payout to farmers of $6.40 per kilogram of milk solids, up from the $5.50 that had been previously anticipated.

“This is good news, particularly for regional New Zealand,” Jim Anderton said. “It is also a reminder of the strength of our primary industries and their importance to the economy.

“No other developed economy is as dependent on exports of primary products as we are. We export 95 percent of our dairy production. And the success of our dairy industry is an excellent example of the sector responding to the market.

“Fonterra is highly successful in reaching world markets and helping New Zealand to be well-positioned for the future,” Jim Anderton said. “Today’s announcement is certainly cause for celebration. It is possible, of course, that some New Zealanders will attempt to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by finding something to complain about what is, in effect, an amazing result.”
