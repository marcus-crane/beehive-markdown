Progressive Party leader and Minister of Agriculture Jim Anderton today expressed his personal regrets at the passing of long-serving Wanganui Mayor Chas Poynter.

“Chas has been lauded for his career in local government and for his role in calming the disputes over the Moutoa Gardens by his common sense approach, for which he was rightly made an honorary kaumatua of Atihaunui O Paparangi Iwi. Others have spoken eloquently of those and his many other achievements.

“I would like to draw attention to his lesser known but very significant role in regional development. From almost the first moment of our rolling out our regional development policies under my auspices as Minister for Regional Development in 2000, Chas was to the forefront, facilitating and encouraging the participation of his Wanganui community and local businesses.

“He understood the importance of these activities for encouraging growth in our regions and he made sure that Wanganui and its region took full advantage of the development opportunities it provided.

“To a marked extent the prosperity that Wanganui enjoys today is down to his foresight and appreciation of those regional growth opportunities,” Jim Anderton said.

“My sympathies and condolences also go out to Chas’s family on their sad loss.”
