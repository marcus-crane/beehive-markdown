Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched two new plans aimed at lifting the economic potential and prosperity of Pacific people in New Zealand over the next decade.

The Pacific Economic Action Plan and the Pacific Women’s Economic Development Plan focus on key areas for development including education; workforce development; business development; creative, emerging, and growth industries; entrepreneurial culture; and leadership.

Helen Clark said that New Zealand's Pasifika communities are energised and optimistic about the future.

"These plans aim to harness their enormous potential and lead Pasifika communities towards greater economic prosperity. It's important that New Zealand's Pasifika peoples can fully contribute to, and share in, New Zealand's success.

"Pasifika peoples have made great advances already under the Labour-led government, with unemployment falling by over fifty per cent since 1999, and education and income levels improving," Helen Clark said.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said that the plans being launched today are designed to encourage economic self-sufficiency for Pasifika peoples through a mix of private enterprise and industry leadership.

"The Pacific Economic Action Plan is organised around six goals, with more than forty activities aimed at realising those goals.

Twenty-five organisations, across government, tertiary institutions, and the private sector, will be directly involved in ensuring that the plans are implemented successfully.

“The plans are a part of the Labour-led government’s Economic Transformation Agenda, and aim to ensure that Pasifika peoples are equipped to play their part in our high income, knowledge-based economy of the future,” Winnie Laban said.
