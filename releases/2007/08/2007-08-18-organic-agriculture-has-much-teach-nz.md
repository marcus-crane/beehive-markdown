The newly-unified organics industry could play a leading role in developing niche export markets for our primary industries, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton told the inaugural Organics Aotearoa New Zealand conference at Lincoln University in Christchurch that the continuing strength of the primary sector, if we were to remain the world's leading primary producer, would depend on us developing niche products that command a premium.

One of the emerging trends was that consumers world wide would pay a premium for certified-organic produce, he said. Organic kiwifruit averaged a premium of 50% between 1996 and 1999; organic sweetcorn 57%; organic apples reaped a 100% premium.

“We can attract a premium for our quality − for the desirability of produce from the world's freshest and cleanest growing environment and one with responsible production practices.”

Jim Anderton said organics production was not without its challenges, but the Government recognized organic producers were an important sector and key players in New Zealand’s future.

He said the Government had invested in the sector, with the Ministry of Economic Development Sector Initiative Fund providing seed funding of $1.5 million over three years to assist Organics Aotearoa New Zealand to get up and running. Since 2000, $2.5 million has been made available from the Sustainable Farming Fund for projects relevant to the organic sector.

“Another example of the Government’s active engagement with the organics industry is the $2.2 million that will be provided over the next three years for the Organic Sector Advisory Programme.”

Jim Anderton said that between 1999 and 2005 the amount of New Zealand land that was under conversion or was already certified as organic increased by more than 400%.

He said it is not realistic that all NZ's agriculture would convert to certified organics, even in the medium term and probably not ever.

“But organics has much to teach conventional agriculture. Rather than just pushing conversion and certification at the margins of the industry I suggest that the organics sector use its new unity to step up and engage with the wider agricultural community in improving their practices, not in a preaching way but by being there to assist.

“Then over time more and more farmers and producers will be edging their practices closer to organics and in effect will be in various stages of transition. Each incremental step by the conventional sector makes the next step easier.”

Jim Anderton said that internationally, research into ways to reduce the environmental footprint of all land-based industries had taken on a new urgency.

“Organic production is certainly one pathway but it is not the only one.

“Within all sectors of New Zealand agriculture and horticulture, there is a general thrust to reduce the use of agrichemicals. Organic production provides a valuable test bed for learning about many issues involved with minimal and/or nil use of agrichemicals that could benefit conventional systems.

“I would like to invite representatives of the organic agriculture industry to the Primary Industry 2020 Summit to be held in Christchurch in November. This will be the first event for two decades to provide business leaders from all sections of New Zealand’s primary industries with an opportunity to examine the future demands and challenges facing our primary industries and to develop ideas on how their businesses and sectors can build and maintain competitive advantage in our existing as well as emerging markets. An industry organisation with an important leadership role such as yours should be there to bring the organic perspective to the debate,” Jim Anderton said.
