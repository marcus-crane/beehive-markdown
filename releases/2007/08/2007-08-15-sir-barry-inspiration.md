Sir Barry: an inspiration

Associate Minister of Local Government Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta has congratulated the outgoing Mayor of Manukau, Sir Barry Curtis, on his many years of service to his city, and to local government generally.

Sir Barry has announced he will not seek re-election.

“Sir Barry works alongside a very Polynesian community and embraces the rich cultural diversity of Manukau. He enjoys positive relationships with Tainui and sought constructive and enduring outcomes such as those reached on Watercare and the Auckland airport. He will continue to be a great friend for Tainui.

“Sir Barry is an inspiration to all those who consider serving in local government, demonstrating that people of good will and talent can indeed make a positive difference to people’s lives. I look forward to hearing of his new endeavours”.
