New Zealand horticulture is innovative and responsive to market signals, but continues to face significant challenges through changing demands from consumers and overseas regulators, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Mr Anderton told the second annual meeting of Horticulture New Zealand in Christchurch that one of the most important changes occurring in our markets is the rising concern − especially in the UK and Europe − about the way food producers manage our environment.

“Supermarkets are soon going to be saying, 'Unless you're sustainably catching a fish or sustainably developing a dairy industry, we're not interested in buying your product.'

“This should focus our minds.”

Mr Anderton said environmental concerns were leading to bogus issues such as ‘food miles’ masking old-fashioned protectionism.

He said that New Zealand was up against a huge new campaign that is explicitly targeted at produce from New Zealand.

“We're accused of using up food miles by air freighting Kiwifruit to the UK. We don't! We ship our fruit to the UK − and that uses less CO2 than hopping in your four wheel drive and puffing down to the supermarket to buy the kiwifruit.

“What we are seeing here is a gigantic and cynical new protectionist movement, where consumers − especially UK and European consumers − are being manipulated by our competitors to focus only on one part of the production chain.”

Mr Anderton said access to markets, and dealing with tariff and non-tariff barriers, was critical to our export industries, and horticulture was in the frontline.

Earlier this year, he launched a report showing tariff barriers to our horticulture exports cost the average grower $25,000 a year in lost earnings.

“But tariffs are only part of the story. We are also facing frustrating non-tariff barriers. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the cynicism and deliberate gamemanship of Australia over apples.

“Yesterday, I met my Australian counterparts in Auckland. I had a message for them. It was blunt.

“We made it clear that this process could, and should, be concluded by now. But the Aussies have held things up even more.

“There is not much sign we will see compliance before the Australian general election, probably around November. And then there will probably be more stalling, given their shoddy track record.

“Mr Goff and I will now go to Cabinet to look at further options and a WTO case is the most likely option.

“I don’t have a huge amount of faith that the WTO will solve the matter quickly – but at least Australia will be embarrassed at a time when it lectures the rest of the world over trade access at the same time that it is practicing cynical protectionism.”

Mr Anderton said no-one had complaints about legitimate phyto-sanitary standards.

“As the most isolated country in the world, with the most unique natural environment, we demand the highest standards of biosecurity at our own border. So I understand why other countries want to be protected from biosecurity risks.

“But what every country should be doing is adopting science-based standards.

“We face too many restrictions on trade or management at the border that can not be justified in the name of science.”
