Women's voices must be heard in the Council Chamber if the needs and interests of the whole community are to be truly represented by local government, Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel says.

Lianne Dalziel is urging women to put themselves forward as candidates for the local body elections in October. Nominations close at 12 noon Friday 24 August.

"We hold our cities and communities in trust for future generations – the decisions we make today impact on the choices our children and grandchildren will have. It is an enormous responsibility – and women today are better equipped than ever to take on that responsibility alongside men.

"Diversity at the Council table is as important as it is in Parliament or on boards of directors. It brings other perspectives in to the mix and ensures the needs of the wider community are part of the decison-making," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Women have so much to offer in terms of knowledge, experience and passion for our communities. It is essential that our voices are heard in the Council Chamber if we are to achieve a society that represents us all.

Lianne Dalziel said that the UN [CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/) Committee on eliminating discrimination against women that she reported to last week noted that the number of women in local government had fallen in New Zealand despite an increase in women in Parliament.

"Local government is important and it is vital that women stand for election," Lianne Dalziel said.
