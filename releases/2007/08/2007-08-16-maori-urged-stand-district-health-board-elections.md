Mâori must step up and make their voices heard in the upcoming District Health Board elections, says Minister of Mâori Affairs Parekura Horomia.  
Nominations are now open for candidates for this year's DHB elections but potential candidates only have just over a week to get their nomination in. They close at midday on Friday 24 August.  
Mr Horomia says the 2007 DHB elections represent an important opportunity for Mâori to participate in and take responsibility for the decisions DHBs make about health.

In 2004, around 70 Mâori candidates were among the nearly 520 who stood for DHB boards. There were also 11 Mâori candidates elected to eight DHB boards, which was up from five members to three boards in 2001.

Mâori make up nearly 15 percent of the population in Aotearoa but the percentage of Mâori people elected to DHBs in the last election was only 7.5 percent.

"Also given the position of Mâori in health statistics in this country, we need to make sure the Mâori perspective is heard and understood at every DHB board table."

Mâori have a lower life expectancy, higher mortality rates in cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, heart disease, ischaemic heart disease and their prevalence of diabetes is two and half times higher, than non-Mâori.

"I challenge Mâori to either stand as candidates themselves or to approach others who they think should stand for their DHB," he says.

District Health Boards are responsible for providing services and allocating funding to ensure the health and disability needs of the people in their district are met. There are 21 DHBs in New Zealand and each is governed by a board.

Seven board members will be elected to each DHBs by postal vote in October this year – at the same time as local government elections.
