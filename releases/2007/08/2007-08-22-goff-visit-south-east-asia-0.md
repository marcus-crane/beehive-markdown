Trade and Defence Minister Phil Goff leaves today for bilateral defence and trade talks in Singapore, Manila and Jakarta, and to attend the annual dialogue meeting between CER partners, Australia and New Zealand, and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

The first stop on the visit will be a one day bilateral defence visit to Singapore.

“My Singaporean defence counterpart, Dr Teo Chee Hean and I will discuss the extensive New Zealand – Singapore defence relationship.

“Singapore is New Zealand’s second largest defence partner in the Asia-Pacific and it is a relationship that continues to grow. A good example of this is Singapore’s decision, this year, to deploy elements with the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan, Afghanistan”, Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff will then travel to Manila where he will attend the annual ASEAN-CER Economic Ministers’ dialogue meeting, and undertake a bilateral programme with his Philippines’ ministerial counterparts.

“The main focus of the ASEAN – CER ministerial dialogue meeting will be the ASEAN - Australia/New Zealand free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations currently under way.

“The importance to New Zealand of these negotiations lies not only in the FTA itself, but also in how it helps New Zealand cement its place in the Asia Pacific regional architecture.

“Together with my Australian counterpart, Warren Truss, we will stress to our ASEAN counterparts the importance of concluding these FTA negotiations in a timely manner,” Mr Goff said.

“The meeting will also provide an opportunity to engage with ASEAN counterparts on a broad range of regional and international trade issues, including the status of the Doha WTO negotiations.

“A number of the ASEAN members are important developing country players and this meeting provides a good opportunity to discuss whether there is anything that we can do to help revitalise the negotiations due to restart in Geneva in September.

“In addition to the ASEAN – CER ministerial dialogue, I will also meet with my Philippines trade and defence counterparts to discuss the New Zealand – Philippines bilateral relationship,” Mr Goff said.

The third leg of the visit will be a trade and economic focused visit to Jakarta.

“A visit to Jakarta presents a good opportunity to continue building on the positive momentum created during the Prime Minister’s visit in July.

“Indonesia is an increasingly important trade and economic partner for New Zealand, and an influential international and regional player in its own right.

“Indonesia is now New Zealand’s ninth largest market, and our largest in South East Asia. Last year we exported NZ$613 worth of products to Indonesia.

“There is still significant scope to grow our bilateral trade and economic relationship further, so the main focus of my visit will be to discuss how we can do so.

“I hope that we will be able to sign a bilateral Trade and Investment Facilitation Agreement while I am in Jakarta, which will provide a framework for developing future trade and economic links with Indonesia.

“I will also discuss a range of regional and international trade issues of mutual relevance with my Indonesian trade counterpart, Dr. Mari Pangestu, including the status of the Doha Round and the ASEAN – CER FTA negotiations.

“I will also raise these issues when I meet with Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Dr Boediono.

“In addition, I plan to meet with Indonesian and New Zealand business representatives to get their views about how the relationship might be developed further.

“While in Jakarta, I also plan to meet with my Indonesian defence counterpart Juworno Sudarsono”, said Mr Goff.

Mr Goff returns to New Zealand on 29 August.
