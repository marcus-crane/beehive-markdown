Forestry Minister Jim Anderton has congratulated the Forest Owners Association on a new Environmental Code of Practice. “I'm proud to be here for the launch of this Code, and its contribution to ensuring our forestry takes its place among our primary industries as the leader in environmental practice.”

At a function held at Parliament last evening, Jim Anderton said that consumers and regulators are growing more aware of environmental issues. “There is a great opportunity for New Zealand if the focus switches to how well we care for our natural surroundings, because we have some of the best practices in the world.

“From the quality of our fisheries management in our oceans, to the steadily improving practice on farms, New Zealand is setting a bench-mark of excellence in environmental practice.”

Jim Anderton spoke of how, along with the demand for higher standards, in some instances countries are setting up barriers to access based on environmental measures. “A vibrant, commercially sustainable and internationally competitive forestry sector can help us to achieve the government's environmental objectives.

“Not only that, but these initiatives will lead to more wood being used − and so more wood being harvested and more replanting of harvested sites. An economically strong industry is also more likely to attract new investment and new planting.”

Concluding his speech, Jim Anderton acknowledged that recent times have not been easy for forestry, which is one reason he welcomes the Code. “It is a time of adjustment. One of the most important challenges the industry has been facing has been to grow the use of higher value products. And value stems partly from environmental reassurance. “
