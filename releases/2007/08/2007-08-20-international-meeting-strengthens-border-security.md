Stronger links with Asian and Pacific countries on immigration border security systems is the focus of a two-day international workshop in Wellington this week.

“The Bali Process workshop focuses on strengthening cooperation against people smuggling and related trans-national crime in the Asia/Pacific region through information-sharing on lost and stolen travel documents,'' Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said.

“New Zealand already boasts world-class border security standards, but as an increasing number of students, workers, and visitors cross our borders, we need to look at ways to stay ahead of the game.

“The new Immigration Bill, tabled in Parliament this month, will give us greater flexibility to adapt our border security measures. And our involvement in the Bali Process allows us to strengthen links with our Asia/Pacific neighbours by building on existing border security systems, and increasing the capacity of the agencies involved,'' Mr Cunliffe said.

"One of the initiatives discussed at the workshop will be the Regional Movement Alert System -- which has already detected over 700 lost or stolen passports held by people attempting to enter New Zealand.''

The Bali Process was initiated in 2002. There are currently 43 member countries from the Asia/Pacific region, and two Special Administrative Regions of China --Hong Kong and Macau.

“It is unique in its effectiveness because it combines both foreign Ministries, and legal and operational bodies, in the same place. This means there are real, practical results from the workshops,'' Mr Cunliffe said.

“I welcome this valuable opportunity to host the workshop, strengthen links with our Asia/Pacific neighbours, and further boost New Zealand’s border security.”

The 2007 Bali Process Workshop: Enabling Electronic Authentification of Travel Document Information runs from August 20-22.
