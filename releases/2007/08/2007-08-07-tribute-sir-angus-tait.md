The death of Sir Angus Tait is a great loss for New Zealand, Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton said today.

“As a Christchurch electorate MP, I had a lot to do with Sir Angus. Like many others, I was deeply impressed with his abilities, integrity, and energy.”

Mr Anderton said Sir Angus was indefatigable in his advocacy for high technology research and scientific development as being the base of New Zealand’s high quality manufactured good sector.

“He was a constant advocate in all areas that mattered for his industry, and of course his own company, but he had a tireless energy for assisting others, particularly young people, into his company and into the industry. He was a fierce nationalist in the best sense of the word, in terms of New Zealand ownership, New Zealand-based international corporations in maintaining their presence in this country and the development of their company in New Zealand hands.

“His legacy will be the most well-known and well-developed electronic engineering company in New Zealand, being left in the hands of a trust for the future of electronic engineering manufacturing in Christchurch in particular and New Zealand in the wider sense.

“On a personal note, he was an extraordinarily committed New Zealander, an extraordinary advocate, and an extraordinary human being in how he approached his life and work. He will be irreplaceable.”

Mr Anderton said his deepest sympathies go to Lady Tait and her family.
