New Zealand is to give $500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) to help people affected by serious flooding in North Korea, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“Torrential rain and flooding has caused widespread devastation across North Korea, with Kangwon province the most seriously affected. Preliminary reports indicate hundreds of casualties and over 63,000 families left homeless," Mr Peters said.

"When a disaster like this occurs, it’s important that New Zealand does what it can to assist.

"Our funding, which will be provided through the government’s aid agency NZAID, will help the IFRC provide emergency food and shelter.

“The IFRC is already active in North Korea, so it is well placed to carry out evacuation and relief activities, and to assist with the rebuilding of homes and livelihoods as soon as practicable," Mr Peters said.
