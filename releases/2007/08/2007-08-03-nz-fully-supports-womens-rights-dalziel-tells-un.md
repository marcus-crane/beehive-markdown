NZ fully supports women's rights, Dalziel tells UN

Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel today advised the United Nations in New York that New Zealand is now a full signatory to its international bill of rights for women.

Recent law changes in New Zealand to remove an exemption that could prevent women serving in combat roles in the military – although they have done so in practice since 2000 – have enabled New Zealand to withdraw its only reservation to the UN's Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/)).

Lianne Dalziel is in New York to present New Zealand's 6th report to the 39th session of the CEDAW committee which is responsible for implementing the convention to protect and promote the rights of women around the world.

"In committing unreservedly to CEDAW, New Zealand demonstrates that we dearly value equality," Lianne Dalziel said.

"We firmly believe to achieve a successful, thriving economy and vibrant society, women must be able to participate fully, freely and actively in social, political, economic and cultural life. Anything we do to improve the circumstances of New Zealand women benefits all New Zealanders. We're proud of our record on women's rights but we acknowledge there is more work to be done – particularly with respect to eliminating family violence, improving pay and employment equity, and enabling people to have a work-life balance – all of which are priorities of the Labour-led government."

Lianne Dalziel said New Zealand stacked up well in any international comparison in its commitment to eliminating gender discrimination.

"But this Convention is not designed for international comparisons. It is a standard against which we assess our own progress. It is about New Zealand being the best that it can be for the benefit of all New Zealanders."

New Zealand had reported to the Committee every four years since it ratified the Convention in 1985, Lianne Dalziel said.

"Each reporting period has seen advances, with the exception of the 1990s when the imposition of a deregulated labour market and the repeal of pay and employment equity legislation under a National government set women back by more than a decade in terms of addressing the gender pay gap. We're committed to fixing this."

Lianne Dalziel is accompanied by Women's Affairs Ministry chief executive Shenagh Gleisner and Diane Mara of [PACIFICA](http://www.pacifica.org.nz/), one of the Ministry's social partners.

### Background Q&As

**What is CEDAW?**  
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women is an international agreement adopted in 1979 by the United Nations. New Zealand was one of the first countries to sign the agreement and there are now 180 signatories. CEDAW defines discrimination as it applies to women and sets out an agenda for countries to end such discrimination. It is often described as an international bill of rights for women.

**What issues does CEDAW cover?**  
CEDAW contains a series of measures to end all forms of discrimination against women, particularly in law and application of the law. It supports the right of all women to have access equal to that of men to participate in all aspects of society.

New Zealand’s 6th report (covering the period March 2002 to March 2006) includes updates on women’s representation on government boards, employment opportunities, pay equity, prostitution, violence against women and the needs of disabled women, Mâori women, refugee and migrant women.

**How often does New Zealand prepare CEDAW reports?**  
Signatory countries must provide a report detailing progress towards CEDAW goals every four years. New Zealand has filed six reports, the latest in March 2006. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is responsible for managing New Zealand’s international obligations in relation to women.

**What is happening today?**  
The Minister is presenting New Zealand's 6th CEDAW report to the Committee. Her full statement can be seen [here](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F30228)

The CEDAW committee has previously reviewed the report and issued a series of follow-up questions which received a written response from New Zealand in April 2007. Today the Committee will ask further questions, or request clarification or more information. Following today's session, the Committee will provide an appraisal including positive progress, areas of concern and suggestions and recommendations for improvement towards meeting CEDAW goals.
