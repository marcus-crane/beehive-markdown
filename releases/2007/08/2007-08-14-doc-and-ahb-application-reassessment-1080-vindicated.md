“The Department of Conservation and the Animal Health Board now have support from an independent government body for the continued careful use of 1080 poison,” Conservation Minister Chris Carter says.

Mr Carter was commenting on “The Reassessment of 1080”, the decision released today by the Environmental Risk Management Agency (ERMA) to allow the continued use of sodium monofluoroacetate or 1080 for pest control in New Zealand.

“The use of 1080 has been controversial and I commend DOC and the AHB for voluntarily seeking a reassessment of 1080 by the appropriate authority, which is the Environmental Risk Management Authority. Their commitment to enabling well-informed public debate and to submitting themselves to intense scrutiny on the use of 1080 has been vindicated.”

“ERMA has carried out a very thorough investigation into the use of 1080. It has spent the last five years gathering information, analysing 1400 public submissions, and there were several public hearings held throughout the country. All views presented were thoroughly and impartially investigated and considered, as you would expect from an independent government body.”

“Everybody in New Zealand with an interest in 1080 could have their say, and I note that the majority of public submissions favoured the continued careful use of 1080.”

“It’s heartening to see ERMA recognise the importance of 1080 as a pest control tool. Much of ERMA’s recommendations are about upgrading and building on existing controls, and most of the work that ERMA is keen to see happen is already being done by DOC and the AHB.”

“As a result of the ERMA decision, the important work of the Department of Conservation in protecting New Zealand’s native wildlife and plants from pests such as possums can continue. While DOC is continuing to research other methods of pest control, 1080 remains one of the safest and cost-effective methods available.”
