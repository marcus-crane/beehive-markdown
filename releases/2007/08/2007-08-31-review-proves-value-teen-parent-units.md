The Education Minister Steve Maharey says a review of the effectiveness of Teen Parent Units (TPUs) has found they are working very well and are valued by students, teachers and educators.

Steve Maharey is speaking today at a meeting of the Association of Teen Parent Educators New Zealand at Chateau on the Park in Christchurch.

He says the review of Teen Parent Units began in 2006, “It has found that young parents who were not going to school before becoming pregnant are welcomed into the units. Feedback from students shows that they value the opportunities the schools are giving them.

“The Labour-led government believes Teen Parent Units have become an important part of our world-class education system. They offer unique support to their students’ education by providing the social services, links and transport that young parents need to stay at school.

“Increasing access to education for teen parents is a priority for this government. This review proves the current model is working for the most part, so all existing units will continue to operate, and the Ministry of Education will accept applications to set up new units.”

The review also found that quite large numbers of students were needed to make a Teen Parent Unit viable, and this will be a factor when new applications are considered.

“We are committed to establishing Teen Parent Units in areas where a dedicated unit is needed, and where schools are prepared to provide quality education for larger groups of teen parents.”

The review also highlighted the need to give mainstream schools more flexibility and better support to cater for teen parents, including extra academic support, transport and pastoral care at school, “We will explore ways to improve access for teen parents not able to access a unit, or who want to stay in a mainstream school.”
