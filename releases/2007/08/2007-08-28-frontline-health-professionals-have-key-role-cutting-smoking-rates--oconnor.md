Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor today launched the latest version of the New Zealand Smoking Cessation Guidelines.

The guidelines provide advice for health care workers in their day-to-day contacts with people who smoke, including those from priority population groups, such as Maori, Pacific peoples, pregnant women and people who use mental health and addiction services.

"Many people find it difficult to stop smoking, but we know that support improves their chances of success," Mr O'Connor said.

"So while cessation services and initiatives such as Quitline are very effective, it is important that all parts of the health sector, especially those on the frontline such as GPs and dentists, play a role in getting people to stop smoking."

Mr O'Connor said the guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review which summarises the most recent national and international evidence on best practice in smoking cessation.

"Health care workers are highly trusted in the community and are perfectly placed to ask patients about their smoking status and to recommend that smokers stop.

"One of the ways they can do this is by using the new ABC system – a simple tool which all health care workers can use. Health care workers should Ask about smoking status, give Brief advice to stop smoking to all smokers and provide evidence-based Cessation support for those who wish to stop smoking.

"The guidelines have been sent to all GPs, hospitals, dentists and cessation services around the country, and will help ensure that all have the tools to be able to offer support and advice to help smokers quit.

"The Labour-led Government recognises that smoking cessation advice and support for smokers is an essential part of providing high-quality health care. In Budget 2007, the Government invested $43.6 million dollars in additional funding over four years for smoking cessation, including primary health programmes such as these guidelines, increasing Quitline capacity and other services, more money for nicotine replacement therapy, and new initiatives such as the text based support service (txt2quit)."

The Guidelines were developed by a Guidelines Advisory Group, led by the Clinical Trials Unit from University of Auckland. The last Guidelines were published in 2002.
