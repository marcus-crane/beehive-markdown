Rural Affairs and Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor welcomed the release today of a discussion document for a review of the Telecommunications Service Obligation (TSO) regulatory framework.

Included in the document, released by Communications Minister David Cunliffe, is recognition of the need to address shortfalls in the availability of broadband Internet services to rural parts of New Zealand, and includes the possibility of introducing a broadband TSO (or Kiwi Share Obligation).

"This document represents the next step in the Labour-led Government's overhaul of the telecommunications sector, and providing for rural and regional New Zealanders is a big part of that," Mr O'Connor said.

"It is vital that New Zealand gets this right. Exports from our rural agricultural, horticultural and forestry sectors account for two thirds of our total exports.

"When you add the export dollars of tourism businesses, many of whom are located in remote places, it is clear that we must find the right mix of incentives and investment to ensure rural businesses and families have access to world-class communications infrastructure."

The TSO discussion document is a call for public feedback and does not represent government policy at this stage.

Mr O'Connor encouraged rural people to read the document and make submissions to the Ministry of Economic Development by September 28 2007. Further details are at med.govt.nz.
