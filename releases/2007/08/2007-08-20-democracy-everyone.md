The Minister of Youth Affairs, Nanaia Mahuta - who is also associate Minister of Local Government and MP for Tainui – is encouraging broader representation on local authorities – and is urging groups not often represented to the extent they should be to have a go.

Nominations for local council and DHB elections close on Friday 24 August.

“Local Government is a key part of our democracy. Being a councillor or DHB representative can deliver real benefits to the community. Local government needs good people in leadership roles who understand the local community and are prepared to seek and advocate solutions to the many challenges they will face.

“I know that when people participate in the decision-making process it can lead to a very positive outcome. So it is absolutely necessary to encourage more Mâori, more women and more young people to seek election. They can make a real difference in our communities.

“Young people may feel they need to wait until they have more experience. In fact, their most relevant experience is that of being a young person in their council region. They can connect with young citizens and explain their point of view to others.

“Most councils have effective systems in place for consultation with Mâori – but Mâori have something to offer the whole community, and should consider taking their role beyond Mâori and to the community as a whole. Many Mâori have extensive experience in business and governance which would benefit councils and DHBs. My message is: e tu! Ka taea! Stand! You can do it”.

Nanaia Mahuta welcomed the fact that women are taking a greater role in local government.

“But last time fewer women than men stood for election. The really good news was that their chances of election were as good as men’s chances. 30% of candidates were women, and 30% of those elected were women.

“Just as with youth and Mâori the message to women is clear: give it a go – it’s your right,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
