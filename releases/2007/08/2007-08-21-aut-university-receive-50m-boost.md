The government is investing $50 million in AUT to enable the university to continue its development and improve its research and teaching capability.

“This investment represents the government’s commitment to ensuring AUT continues to develop as a vibrant research-led university in the steadily growing Auckland region,” said Minister for Tertiary Education, Dr Michael Cullen.

“AUT has developed a reputation for being responsive to stakeholder needs since it was established in 2000. This investment will increase the university’s capability to respond to the needs of students as well as industry and business groups, while at the same time increasing its international standing.”

The government’s investment is subject to several financial and capability building performance measures.

“This stringent requirement is in line with the government’s new approach to investing in tertiary education,” said Dr Cullen.

“Under the new approach that starts in 2008, the government will invest in tertiary education organisations according to what they will deliver for students and other stakeholders. The government’s investment will then be monitored according to performance measures agreed before the investment is made.”

Dr Cullen said considerable progress has been made in the tertiary education sector over the past year.

“Most of the components of the [new approach to funding](http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/standard.aspx?id=2513) and monitoring tertiary education are now in place,” he said.

“The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) has begun discussions with organisations moving onto the new approach about how they plan to meet current and future stakeholder needs from 2008 and beyond.”

AUT will receive the money before the end of the year, once a contract detailing the performance measures is drawn up.
