Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson and Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker today welcomed the launch of the SuperGold Card for older New Zealanders and veterans.

"The SuperGold Card recognises the contribution that senior citizens and veterans make to New Zealand and fulfils a commitment made as part of the confidence and supply agreement the Labour-led government has with New Zealand First," says Ruth Dyson.

"Veterans will be given special recognition for their service to our country with a separate version of the SuperGold card," says Rick Barker.

The veterans SuperGold card features poppies as part of its design.

The SuperGold card offers discounts for seniors with participating businesses and easy access to concessions on government and local authority services.

The card will be sent automatically to people receiving NZ Super and to eligible veterans. About 500,000 cards have been printed and are on their way to seniors and veterans.

It will carry the holder's name, a number and whether the holder receives NZ Super or a Veteran's Pension, or has a Community Services Card. A photograph for ID purposes is optional.

"Cardholders' spouses who are under 65 will also be able to access the commercial discounts," said Ms Dyson.

Due to high interest in the card the Ministry of Social Development has set up a freephone number for seniors and veterans with enquiries - **0800 25 45 65.**
