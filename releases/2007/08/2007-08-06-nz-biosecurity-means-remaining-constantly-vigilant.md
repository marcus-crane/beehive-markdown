Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton said today that he was as confident as it is reasonable to be that New Zealand’s rigorous border security would keep out serious animal diseases such as food and mouth disease.

“There have been 65 foot and mouth disease outbreaks across a number of countries this year already. This is not a new problem for us to deal with and we have tighter border security than most other nations.

“However, we do have a significant number of tourist and business links with Britain and measures have been stepped up for those flights in particular,” Jim Anderton said.

Biosecurity officials stepped up precautions at the border this weekend after Britain confirmed another outbreak of the animal disease near London.

Since the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak in Britain, all international airports in New Zealand had been equipped with soft-tissue x-ray machines which could find organic material in passengers’ bags. All passengers and air crew at these airports are now screened.

Jim Anderton said, “While it is unlikely the disease will make its way here, it is important that all precautions are taken because of the serious consequences of an outbreak of foot and mouth to New Zealand’s economy.

“Foot and mouth disease is highly infectious, and any outbreak here would be a serious blow to our primary industry exports, on which we rely for our standard of living. It has been estimated that an outbreak here could potentially cost us billions of dollars because we are the most export-dependent economy in the world on agricultural based production.”
