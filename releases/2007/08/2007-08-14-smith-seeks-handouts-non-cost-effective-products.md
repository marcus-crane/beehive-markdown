Nick Smith's proposal that the Government should subsidise solar water heaters that are not cost-effective for customers is astonishing, Government Spokesperson for Energy Efficiency Jeanette Fitzsimons says.

"This is the party that wants low taxes and reduced government spending. Yet Dr. Smith wants to use taxpayers' money to give grants to solar water heaters that are sold at a price so high that the energy savings will never pay back the initial price," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"The solar water heating programme agreed between the Government and the Green Party, has focused so far on improving the quality of products and installations.

- This package includes:
- a new quality standard;
- performance modelling to establish energy savings;
- training courses for installers;  
  and,
- an information website for consumers that shows which systems have passed their tests, and the price at which they will be cost effective.

"We are totally committed to ensuring the consumer gets quality and value for money when they choose to invest in solar heating," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"The new grants for volume builders, announced just a month ago, are already bearing fruit.

"Builders are teaming up with solar suppliers, and the first grant for a group of at least 20 homes has been signed off. The informal advice is that builders are putting together proposals for a further 1,300 systems," Ms Fitzsimons says.

Ms Fitzsimons is confident that the temporary reduction in sales cited by Dr Smith is a short term effect while the solar industry gets its systems tested and modeled, and more installers are trained.

"In the short term, I expect that most grants will go into groups of new homes," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"In the longer term, with a number of new entrants waiting to enter the market, I expect retrofit installation to resume. And they will be high quality products and high quality installations - at a price that is cost effective for the householder and for the country," Ms Fitzsimons says.
