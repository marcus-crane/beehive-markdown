The acquisition of 36 ha adjoining Opouahi Scenic Reserve in Hawke’s Bay will boost volunteer efforts to protect kiwi and carry out other conservation work, Minister of Conservation, Chris Carter, announced today.

Mr Carter and Hawke’s Bay Labour MP Russell Fairbrother visited the reserve on completion of the purchase from Landcorp Farming Ltd by the government’s Nature Heritage Fund.

“Adding this land to Opouahi Scenic Reserve will help the completion of an outdoor creche for young kiwi, a key part of a kiwi conservation programme in Hawke’s Bay,” Mr Carter said.

The Environment, Conservation and Outdoor Education Trust (ECOED) is building a predator-proof fence at Lake Opouahi, part of the “Save Our Kiwi Hawke’s Bay” community project.

When ready, the predator-free area will offer a safe haven for kiwi chicks that have been hatched and/or raised in captivity via Bank of New Zealand Save the Kiwi’s Operation Nest Egg but are still too small to defend themselves in the wild against stoats.

ECOED general manager Alastair Bramley said the land purchase would also help in the conservation of other endangered wildlife and environmental education for students at local schools.

"The acquisition of the land strengthens the area's reputation as an outdoor and environmental education hub, with the Guthrie Smith Outdoor Education Centre and the Boundary Stream Mainland Island located just down the road," Mr Bramley said.

Seven ha of the purchase will be included within the 40 ha predator-free area. The remaining 29 ha would be restored into native bush and made available to schools for environmental education.

ECOED chairman Matthew Lawson acknowledged assistance from Landcorp Farming Ltd and the Department of Conservation in supporting the purchase.

“ECOED has raised thousands of dollars of community funding for the Opouahi Kiwi Creche, a partnership between DOC, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and ECOED. We are extremely grateful for the support for this community initiative.”

“ECOED provides a great example of how people can help reverse the damage that has been caused by humans and pests to native ecosystems.”
