Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched 'Tribute 08' which is an event to be held next year to pay tribute to Viet Nam veterans and their families.

The Prime Minister launched 'Tribute 08' at event in Parliament also attended by Defence Minister Phil Goff, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Rick Barker, Viet Nam veterans, and representatives of other political parties. It is planned for Queen's Birthday Weekend next year and will consist of a number of events commemorating Viet Nam Veterans and their families.

Events will include:

- an opening ceremony
- a Whakanoa Ceremony honouring those killed in action and those veterans who have died since returning home
- a Memorial Service and rededication of the Vietnam Honour in the National War Memorial
- an exhibition of New Zealand’s military heritage with special focus on Vietnam.

"'Tribute 08 is about acknowledging those who lost their lives in Vietnam, and the surviving veterans and their families, for their sacrifice in the service of New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"It has fallen to our Government to deal with the longer term consequences of New Zealand's involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, and with the issues raised more recently by veterans groups and the Health Select Committee.

"Today's launch shows the progress being made in implementing the package agreed in December between the Labour-led Government, the Ex- Vietnam Services Association (EVSA) and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RNZRSA).

“Whatever people’s views on the Viet Nam War, those who served in Viet Nam, like other New Zealand soldiers before and after them, undertook their duties bravely, loyally, and professionally," Helen Clark said.

Phil Goff said that during the Joint Working Group’s extensive consultation in 2005, Viet Nam veterans spoke of the negative response they personally felt on their return to New Zealand.

"A public commemoration acknowledging the service of the veterans and the sacrifices of their families is important even after 40 years to allow a healing process to occur," Phil Goff said.

Rick Barker said that 'Tribute '08’ forms a key part of helping bring closure to Viet Nam Veterans and their families.

"It allows us to acknowledge them alongside veterans who have served their country overseas, before and since the conflict in Viet Nam, and accord them the same respect," Rick Barker said.
