An agreement signed today provides a powerful new tool in the fight against crime, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr O'Connor, Corrections Department chief executive Barry Matthews, Vodafone and Telecom today jointly announced the successful conclusion of a trial of technical solutions to combat the unauthorised use of cellphones in prisons, and the signing of an agreement for action in this area.

"Today is a significant milestone for Corrections," Mr O'Connor said.

"With this agreement we now have the ability to block the use of cellphones in our prisons. We will roll out this blocking technology and other technologies across the country's prisons, starting within six weeks at Hawke's Bay prison which has one of the highest concentrations of gang members."

Mr O'Connor said the parties have been working towards this goal for four years, and it is believed that this type of agreement has not been reached anywhere else in the world.

"While all parties recognised the huge benefits for society from preventing the abuse of cellphones in prisons, it is important that the technology does not interfere with lawful users close to prison sites."

Mr O'Connor said that for this reason it was important to recognise that the blocking technology would not be the total solution in all prisons and that a combination of technologies, along with increased deterrence, security and detection would provide a package of solutions.

"After testing between 20 and 30 available technologies we have been now able to agree on a number of solutions including a mix of technologies that can be implemented across the prison system to help put unauthorised cellphones out of action.

"Under the Labour-led Government our prisons are now surrounded by 17 kilometres of fencing, Corrections is working towards a single point of entry in all of our prison sites, and it has the ability to collect, analyse and act on 'intelligence' obtained through improved monitoring in all sites.

"As I announced in June, I am also about to introduce amendments to the Corrections Act which will boost search powers and stiffen penalties for anyone who is foolish enough to bring communications devices, drugs or weapons into prisons. New prison sentences of three months and 12 months are to be introduced."

Mr O'Connor and Communications Minister David Cunliffe thanked Telecom and Vodafone for their cooperation.

"Both companies have recognised the high level of public concern and have spent a lot of time, effort and technical expertise helping Corrections get to this point. We would like to acknowledge that commitment," the ministers said.
