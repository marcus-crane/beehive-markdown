Racing Minister Winston Peters today welcomed the new racing season by inviting applications to the new Racing Safety Development Fund.

“The Safety Development Fund offers $1 million in dollar-for-dollar support for projects that improve the safety and therefore the quality of racecourse facilities around New Zealand," Mr Peters said.

"Racecourse safety is the most pressing issue facing the industry, and this fund is designed to encourage clubs to be proactive in addressing safety concerns.

"Eligible projects can cover the safety of riders, spectators, officials, or others involved in racing, as well as the health and safety of the animals.

"There will be two funding rounds per year, but clubs are being encouraged to get their applications in as soon as possible because significant demand for support from the fund is expected.

“Applications for the first round need to be submitted by 30 September. It is hoped that successful applicants will be named in January, before a second round of applications opens in February,” Mr Peters said.

A five-member industry working group, which includes representatives from each of the three racing codes, will make final decisions on fund allocations.

Information on how to apply to the Racing Safety Development Fund, and a copy of the application form, is available on the Department of Internal Affairs’ website (www.dia.govt.nz) or by calling 04 495 9303.
