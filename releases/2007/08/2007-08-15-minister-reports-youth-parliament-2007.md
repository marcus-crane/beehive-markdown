Minister reports on Youth Parliament 2007

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has formally reported to parliament on Youth Parliament 2007.

“The youth parliament consisted of enthusiastic, committed, articulate young people whose families, schools and communities have every reason to feel proud,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“In the future, whether they have political careers or not, these young people will have a close insight into the workings of our democracy. The fact that the parliament involved the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, the Speaker and other presiding officers, 10 Ministers and many other members of parliament showed the importance of the event.

“There’s a genuine concern in government and across parities in parliament to ensure that youth take a full part in the life of their communities and the nation. Youth Parliament is one expression of active citizenship and engaging young people.

Nanaia Mahuta urged other representative organisations such as community groups, schools, councils and DHBs to consider ways of actively involving youth in decision-making.

“An understanding of democracy is the key to New Zealand becoming a nation which is both diverse and successful”.

Youth Parliament 2007 was held from 8 to 11 July 2007 in Parliament Buildings. 121 Youth MPs, 10 Youth Press Gallery members and 22 international observers travelling to Wellington to discuss debate and report issues of importance for young people.

The Youth MPs debated a bill: the Household Response to Climate Change Bill 2007, posed questions for oral answer to Cabinet Ministers, engaged in general debate and sat on 10 youth parliament select committees.

“I am encouraged by feedback from youth parliamentarians, members of parliament and staff who have shared their thoughts on the positive impact of Youth Parliament 2007. I look forward to receiving the formal evaluation that will contribute to a better Youth Parliament next time,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
