Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard is alarmed at National's about turn on consumer protection, as evidenced in the house today.

"National looks set to abandon the current market–based consumer protection system that has worked well to protect New Zealand consumers" said Judith Tizard.

"It is astonishing that the consumer affairs spokesperson for a party claiming to promote individual responsibility has flip-flopped so dramatically to now demand a tax-payer funded nanny-state approach to market choice."

The comments were made in response to questions by National Consumer Affairs Spokesperson Kate Wilkinson that contrasted New Zealand's current consumer safety measures with a heavy-handed regulatory approach.

"The current product safety measures work well because responsibility for ensuring products are safe and fit for their intended purpose is shared between the importer or retailer, the consumer, and the Government. National's proposal to remove two parts of that equation will compromise of consumer safety, as well as raising costs for the consumer" said Judith Tizard.

"In the absence of policy it's easy to suspect National of having a hidden agenda. Now, through hastily prepared outbursts from the back benches, we're getting confirmation of this agenda, and it looks bleak."
