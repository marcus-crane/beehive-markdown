Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, today introduced a Bill to allow government funding of a wider range of digital programming in a variety of formats.

The current Broadcasting Act 1989 only makes it possible for the funding agencies, NZ On Air and Te Mangai Paho, to allocate money to programmes and other content to be watched on television.

This Broadcasting Amendment Bill will broaden their role so the two agencies can also fund content to be used in different forms, such as on the internet, cell phones, as well as on television.

Steve Maharey says this Bill is to keep government funding up to pace with the rapidly changing face of our broadcasting sector, in the exciting move to digital.

“It means that Labour-led government funding can produce New Zealand stories and culture for the growing variety of different formats that people can watch or use to access local content.

“The amendment will allow the agencies to fund such things as video-on–demand on the internet, and to adapt programmes and other content for alternative platforms, like the internet and mobile phones.

“The Bill also amends the Act to allow Te Mangai Paho to archive funded Maori language and culture programmes.”
