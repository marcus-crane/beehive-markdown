Students attending schools that provide effective sexuality education programmes are highly motivated to learn and they value the programmes, a new report has found.

The Teaching of Sexuality Education in Years 7 to 13, June 2007 was released today by the Education Review Office (ERO), together with an accompanying report The Teaching of Sexuality Education in Years 7 to 13: Good Practice, June 2007.

The report is the result of a review of the quality of sexuality education in 100 schools conducted by ERO last year. The review was commissioned by the Ministries of Women’s Affairs, Health, and Education.

Women’s Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel said the report found that students were motivated to learn and valued sexuality education highly in an environment where they felt safe to ask questions and where there was a good rapport between teachers and students.

"Schools that provide effective sexuality education programmes share many characteristics including programmes that are regularly updated; well planned with clear direction; use modern and appropriate resources; and have a strong emphasis on a culture of school-wide respect and effective support networks for students."

Lianne Dalziel said the review was conducted as a result of the agencies’ concern about New Zealand’s sexual health statistics amongst young people.

"Internationally, New Zealand has high rates of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections amongst young people. We believe that improvements in their knowledge, skills, and attitudes will result in more informed decisions by young people about their sexual and reproductive health and will reduce risky behaviour.

"Overseas research tells us that countries with comprehensive sexuality education, social openness in attitudes to discussing sex and sexuality, and accessible, low-cost health care and contraception have better sexual and reproductive health outcomes for their young people."

Education Minister, Steve Maharey, said this is the first time sexuality education has been reviewed since it became compulsory to teach in schools in 2001. It is taught as a part of the Health and Physical Education Curriculum.

"I welcome this report, which is an important indicator of where things are at. It shows that there have been good overall improvements since the last review, and that many schools are doing well.

“However, there are some schools still struggling with aspects of it and ‘The Good Practice Report’ will be a valuable tool for them to provide more effective programmes."

Health Minister, Pete Hodgson, said the review was part of a whole-of-government approach to reduce the number and proportion of teenagers with sexually transmitted infections; reduce the rate of unplanned teenage pregnancies; and improve the ability of teenagers to avoid and/or deal effectively with coercive and other abusive behaviours.

"Effective sexuality education is an important part of ensuring they are better able to protect their overall well-being both now and into the future," said Pete Hodgson.
