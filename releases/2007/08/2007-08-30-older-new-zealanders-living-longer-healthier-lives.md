Older New Zealanders are living longer and are healthier than previous generations, according to a report released today by Senior Citizens Minister, Ruth Dyson

The Positive Ageing Indicators 2007 report shows that most older people have adequate incomes, enjoy a good quality of life and own their own homes.

"New Zealand, like other OECD countries, has an ageing population and older people are playing an important part in the life of our communities.

"This report gives us an idea of how older people are faring in this country, and helps us identify issues and areas where we need to take action," Ruth Dyson said.

The report from the Ministry of Social Development will be repeated at five yearly intervals to enable the government to measure the progress being made in improving the wellbeing of older New Zealanders.

The Positive Ageing Indicators report is organised around 10 outcome areas that capture aspects of wellbeing and quality of life for older New Zealanders. Each area holds a set of indicators that use data from a range of sources, including the Census.

"What stands out is that the majority of older people report that they are satisfied with their lives, and are enjoying adequate incomes and good health. They are well-equipped to participate actively in their communities if they want to."

The report also shows that more older people are staying in paid work past superannuation age.

"With the current tight labour market, it’s good to see older people who have skills, talent and experience choosing to continue working or to resume employment part time or full time," Ruth Dyson said.
