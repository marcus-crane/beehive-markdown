Two new tool kits to help businesses better manage flexible working arrangements and work-life balance have been launched by Minister of Labour Ruth Dyson and Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel today.

The ministers launched the tool kits at Wellington book sellers Unity Books, where staff have been trialling flexible employment practices.

The two tool kits – one targeting small and medium-sized business, and the other designed for larger enterprises - have been put together by the Department of Labour after consulting New Zealand businesses and other organisations about what was working well for them.

"With record low unemployment we have a tight labour market and offering flexibility can help employers get and keep the right staff. As a result, many New Zealand firms are embracing the challenge of offering employees more flexible work options," says Ruth Dyson.

"The tool kits represent the practical advice and experience of New Zealand business owners and managers whose staff have already been using flexible work, such as roster management, job sharing or working from home, to other employers now looking to introduce and manage flexible work and work-life balance arrangements."

Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel says flexible work relationships can offer real benefits to small and medium sized enterprises.

"Flexible work places are more than win/win but are in fact a triple win - for the employer, the employee and the work team," says Lianne Dalziel.

"Commitment and trust are a two way street. If you are committed to your employees they will return the favour because it develops a personal relationship in which workers feel their needs are being taken seriously. In turn, this extra commitment by staff has lifted the level of customer service, and the reputation of the business.”

The tool kits are available on the Department of Labour website [www.dol.govt.nz](http://www.dol.govt.nz/worklife/making-it-work-index.asp)
