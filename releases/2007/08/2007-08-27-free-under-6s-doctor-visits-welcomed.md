Pacific Island families are set to benefit from free doctor’s visits for their children aged under six, says Acting Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

The Labour-led government announced today an investment of $8.25 million investment to fund free health care for kids under six years old.

The funding will come into effect from 1 January 2008 and will be made available each year for all doctors who commit to provide free health care for children aged under six.

“I don't want any parent, grandparent and caregiver to think twice about taking their young child or children to the doctor because of how much it costs,” said Laban.

“This is more good news for our Pacific communities. New Zealand’s Pacific population is younger and growing faster than any other group. This will allow more of our Pacific families access to quality healthcare earlier.

“The Labour-led government is serious about investing in our Pacific communities. Last week I was proud to be a part of the launch of two new plans aimed at lifting the economic potential and prosperity of Pacific people in New Zealand over the next decade,” said Laban.

The Pacific Economic Action Plan and the Pacific Women’s Economic Development Plan focus on key areas for development including education; workforce development; business development; creative, emerging, and growth industries; entrepreneurial culture; and leadership.

“As part of my travels around the country I will be spreading this positive message.

“It is important to me that all Pasifika families and communities are made fully aware that they can access free doctor’s visits for their under 6 family members, and that staying healthy is critical to economic and social well being.

“It is important that New Zealand's Pasifika peoples can fully contribute to, and share in, New Zealand's success,” said Laban.
