Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today that the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) are working together as part of a Pacific regional fisheries protection operation.

“Two RNZN officers have joined the crew of the USCG vessel Walnut in what will become an annual personnel exchange which will enhance cooperation between the USCG and the RNZN”, said Mr Goff.

“The RNZN officers boarded the Walnut in Honiara and will be onboard for almost a month as the vessel patrols the Economic Exclusion Zones of several Pacific states and territories.

“While the Walnut is in the South Pacific, it will participate in operation Kuru Kuru, an annual multilateral maritime surveillance operation focusing on detection and enforcement response to illegal maritime activity. Other countries involved include; Australia, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Cook Islands and France.

“During the deployment the RNZN officers will work together with their USCG colleagues to develop protocols for the sharing of vessel sighting information between the RNZN, USCG, New Zealand Maritime Coordination Centre and the Fisheries Forum Agency to maximise the detection and identification of vessel engaged in illegal activity.
