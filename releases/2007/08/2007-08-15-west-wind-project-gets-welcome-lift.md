State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the announcement today by state-owned Meridian of the go-ahead for a major new wind farm in Wellington.

"Shareholding ministers were consulted in relation to the decision of the Meridian Board to proceed with West Wind from an economic viability perspective, and we were satisfied with the economic rationale for proceeding," Trevor Mallard said.

"A project such as this is very important in the context of the Labour-led government’s energy strategy and our desire to promote renewable generation, sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint of the electricity generation sector. It is also another important step in the development of a world-class infrastructure for New Zealand that will provide the right conditions to help transform our economy into one that is innovative, high wage and high value.

"This wind farm is also expected to be a world first. Despite a reduction in the overall number of turbines from the planned 70 to 62, West Wind should be the most productive wind farm in the world due to the wind conditions at the site combined with the choice of turbines to best suit the unique conditions.

"The project is also expected to generate wider benefits for Meridian, increasing the power available for transfer south, reducing the risk of South Island shortages, and enabling the generator to manage its South Island hydro storage more efficiently," Trevor Mallard said.

The wind farm will be located in Makara across the Quartz Hill farm site and Terawhiti Station. Final consent for the wind farm was granted by the Environment Court in May 2007.

West Wind will have a total capacity in excess of 140 MW, and is forecast to produce over 570 GWh of electricity on an annual basis, which is enough for around 75,000 average homes. First power is expected to be generated in early 2009.
