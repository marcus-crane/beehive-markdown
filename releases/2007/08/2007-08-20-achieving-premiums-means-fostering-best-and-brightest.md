Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton today emphasized the need for the primary industries to find a way to attract skilled people into its workforce.

“For three years now unemployment in New Zealand has been under four percent,” Jim Anderton said. “At the 'supply' end, low unemployment has made it tough to find skilled staff. It has put a premium on industry initiatives to develop more skills. At the 'demand' end, the changing face of agriculture is demanding more skills than ever.”

Mr Anderton was speaking at the Human Capability in Agriculture and Horticulture Forum in Wellington. He said that the future of the primary industries, and New Zealand’s economy, lies in developing niche markets that command premium prices.

“The ability to do that that will rely on having a skilled workforce. The industry has to front up to the challenge of where the skills are going to come from. Strong working relationships between tertiary educational institutions, industry training organizations and the primary production sector and the businesses they represent, will be critical to success.”

“Agriculture is going to be competing with other sectors over the long haul to attract and retain people. It will need a strategy to recruit and retain the best and brightest,” Jim Anderton said.

He went on to throw a further challenge out to the industry: “Young people considering a career look at employment practices, working conditions, pay rates and career pathways. It's up to industries to show New Zealand communities that they are good employers.

“The government is ready to work with industry to help it meet the future demands for people. And in doing so, we will unlock higher living standards for all New Zealanders,” Jim Anderton concluded.
