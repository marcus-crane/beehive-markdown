Foreign Minister Winston Peters today congratulated Timor-Leste’s newly appointed Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmao.

The appointment of Mr Gusmao, the former President, follows recent parliamentary elections, which were monitored by the international community, including observers from New Zealand.

“Xanana Gusmao's special place in recent Timorese politics and history, and his acknowledged status among his own people, put him in a unique position to help close worrying divisions in Timorese society,” Mr Peters said.

“New Zealand hopes the new government will be accepted by all sides. Timor-Leste faces challenging times ahead, and it will be important that the country’s constitutional processes are fully respected.

“We therefore urge all political leaders and people in Timor-Leste to work together to promote a peaceful, stable and prosperous society.

“New Zealand remains committed to assisting Timor-Leste with its nation-building process.

"Since 1999, we have contributed $30 million in bilateral aid, focused on rural livelihoods, basic education and good governance, while New Zealand Defence Force personnel and Police continue to make a significant contribution to security and law and order there," Mr Peters said
