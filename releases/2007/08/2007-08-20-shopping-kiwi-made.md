Shoppers are being urged to put Kiwi made on their shopping list by a multi-media advertising campaign that kicks off today.

Beginning with an iwi and commercial radio campaign, the Government’s [Buy Kiwi Made](http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz/) promotion will target shoppers across the country.

"The key message we’re getting out to consumers is to look for the label that says 'Made in New Zealand' or the kiwi in a triangle trademark," says Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made.

"We’ve researched this campaign very carefully and we know that consumers don’t want to be talked at or scolded.

"We want to be informed in an engaging way about the benefits, both for ourselves and for our communities, of buying kiwi made goods."

A series of newspaper advertisements is scheduled to begin this week and outdoor advertising will follow.

"We have a fantastic series of television commercials starting on 23 September and these feature a talented New Zealand actor and a hot off the press Kiwi music track," says Ms Bradford.

"The creative concept will stay under wraps until then, but it was one of four tested with consumers and scored the highest in terms of communicating the message and engaging consumers."

Ms Bradford said that retailers were key to supporting the campaign.

"We have free point of sale materials available from the Buy Kiwi Made website," she said.

"It’s great to hear that more than 50 retailers have already signed up with Buy NZ Made as members."

Since the campaign commenced, 112 manufacturers have become members of Buy NZ Made, which licenses use of the kiwi in a triangle logo.

"We expect to see the total number of manufacturing members increase by another 200 before the end of 2008," she said.
