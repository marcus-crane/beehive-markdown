"The future for Maaori is to get a good education, stay in learning for a longer period and strive for excellence in all things," said Minister of Youth Development Nanaia Mahuta.

Social Development and Maori Affairs Ministers Steve Maharey and Parekura Horomia today launched *Ka Hikitia - Managing for Success: The draft Maori Education Strategy 2008-2012*.

"We all have a responsibility as parents, kaumaatua, aunties and uncles to encourage rangatahi to stay at school and engaged in their learning. When we take an interest in their lives rangatahi begin to understand that they are important and so is their future," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"I know that there is a growing expectation in Maaori families that success in education is absolutely necessary and in today's world, opportunities for rangatahi are extensive. With a good foundation in education rangatahi can move in to opportunities in tertiary education, modern apprenticeships, employment and further training in a broad range of industries.

"All that is possible when we create the right learning environment for rangatahi. More importantly there is current research that informs us that teachers make a difference for Maaori students. When a positive learning environment is created then the desire to learn can be enhanced – like turning on a light switch," said Nanaia Mahuta.

The Labour-led Government has put a strong emphasis on encouraging full participation of Maaori in early childhood education and improving access to Maori language education, and providing incentive to encourage more young Maaori into teaching as a career.

The Action plan introduced by Minister Horomia and Minister Maharey sets out to:

- Target a 20 per cent reduction in the truancy rate of Maori students in Years 1 and 2, and Years 9 and 10
- Increase Maori participation in early childhood education from 90 to 95 per cent by 2012
- Boost literacy, numeracy and the number of Maori achieving university entrance.

Public consultation over the next three months will include 13 hui and meetings with key stakeholder groups. A final strategy is expected to come back for government approval in March next year.
