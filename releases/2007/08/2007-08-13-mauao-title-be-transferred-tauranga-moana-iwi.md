The government has signed an agreement with Tauranga Moana iwi and Waitaha to transfer Mauao to the iwi of Tauranga Moana and to recognise the importance of the mountain to Waitaha.

The Crown has previously agreed that the title of Mauao (Mt Maunganui), a landmark mountain, be returned to the local iwi and a preliminary agreement was initialled in July 2007.

A final agreement was signed over the weekend by iwi representatives and Mr Horomia on behalf of the Crown.

Mr Horomia welcomed the agreement, and thanked both the iwi negotiators and Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui, also a local MP, who together worked hard to ensure the agreement was reached.

“The agreement acknowledges the historical and traditional relationship of the iwi to the maunga (mountain) and the government had undertaken to introduce legislation to give effect to the transfer as soon as practicable,” Mr Horomia said.

The iwi of Ngâi Te Rangi, Ngâti Ranginui, Ngâti Pûkenga have agreed to the transfer of title to them of the maunga. The agreement also recognises the special historical significance of Mauao to Waitaha.

Under the agreement, Tauranga City Council will continue to manage the historic reserve and the transfer has the council’s support, Mr Ririnui said.

“The public’s rights to access and use the maunga ( Mt Maunganui) will continue unaffected. The transfer does not form part of any Treaty settlement, Mr Horomia said.

“We are pleased the Labour-led government has taken another step in putting right past wrongs. The title transfer will further strengthen the relationship between government and Tauranga Moana iwi,” the ministers said.
