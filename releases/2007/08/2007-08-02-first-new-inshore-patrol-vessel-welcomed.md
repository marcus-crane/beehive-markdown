Defence Minister Phil Goff announced the launch this week of the Rotoiti, the first of four new Navy Inshore Patrol Vessels (IPVs). Built entirely in New Zealand, the Rotoiti will be formally named at a ceremony at the Tenix shipyard, Whangarei this Saturday.

"This is another significant step in the introduction into the Royal New Zealand Navy of seven new ships under Project Protector. The Inshore Patrol Vessels are an impressive capability. At 55 metres long and with a 3000-mile range, they will contribute significantly to the patrolling of New Zealand’s 15,000 km coastline, and our Exclusive Economic Zone, the fourth biggest in the world", said Mr Goff.

"The design and operation of the IPVs reflects their primary role of multi-agency operations in support of national security tasks. Their versatile capabilities will also include surveillance, response and boarding operations, and search and rescue. Secondary roles for the vessels will be in New Zealand disaster relief and civil defence aid.

"Project Protector exemplifies the importance of a whole-of-government approach to the security of our borders. The IPVs will enhance the capabilities of a broad range of agencies, including Customs, Fisheries, Police, Conservation and Foreign Affairs, to pursue their resource patrol and protection roles.

"The Protector fleet will be tasked by the National Maritime Coordination Centre, which manages agencies demands for maritime assets. The available pool of assets to meet these demands will be greatly enhanced by the arrival of the Protector vessels. They will work alongside Customs and Police inshore vessels, and the RNZAF P-3K and patrol aircraft.

"Project Protector is a tribute to the strength and competitiveness of New Zealand industry. Under the Project Protector contract, New Zealand companies will deliver goods and services worth at least NZ$110 million. To date, $85 million worth of contracts have been awarded to New Zealand industry.

"By the end of 2008, the Navy’s Protector Fleet will comprise of seven ships of three different classes; one Multi Role Vessel (MRV), two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) and four Inshore Patrol Vessels (IPV). Rotoiti will now complete the ship fit-out at Whangarei and will be officially handed over to the Navy later in the year.

"The role of the Inshore Patrol Vessels recognises that the future security of New Zealand is not only about dealing with potential military threats but is also about securing our resources, protecting our biodiversity and guarding our borders against transnational crime", said Mr Goff.
