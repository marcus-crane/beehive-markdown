Transpower’s application for a major electricity transmission project is now available online and at local libraries and councils for anyone wanting to view the proposal, Minister Pete Hodgson says.

The Minister is encouraging anyone who has a view on the proposed electricity transmission line to familiarise themselves with the documents now that they are publicly available and before the period for public submissions begins.

“I made the decision to call in the application under the Resource Management Act because of its national significance and the level of public interest in it and I believe it’s vitally important that the public have their say,” Pete Hodgson says.

“The first step is to learn about the application, and how the proposal will affect people in the seven districts the proposed line will go through.”

“The application is extensive and I urge anyone thinking of making a submission to get a head start by familiarising themselves with it. Legal requirements mean that from the time the project is publicly notified – public notification is expected to be on 8 September - there will be 20 working days for anyone with an interest to get their submission in.”

From 22 August, the application documents will be on Transpower’s website (see [www.gridnewzealand.co.nz](http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz)). There will also be links to Transpower’s application documents via the websites of the Ministry for the Environment, the seven councils, Environment Waikato and Auckland Regional Council. Councils and libraries will also have publicly-available copies of the documents.

If anyone has questions about the process, or would like to obtain sections of the application on CD, or the whole application on DVD, they can call 0800 876 447.

Pete Hodgson announced on 9 August he would use provisions in the Resource Management Act to call in Transpower’s proposal to build the electricity transmission line. He announced an independent Board of Inquiry who hear public submissions and then consider the project. The Board of Inquiry will be chaired by a current or former Environment Court judge.

“Anyone will be able to state their views to the Board, whether they are in favour or opposed to the proposal,” Pete Hodgson says.
