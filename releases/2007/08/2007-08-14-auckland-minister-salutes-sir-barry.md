Minister responsible for Auckland Issues Judith Tizard tonight paid tribute to the immense contribution of Sir Barry Curtis, who has announced his retirement from local politics at the next local-body election.

"Sir Barry has been the driving force behind Manukau City’s transformation from a series of small villages surrounded by farmland to one of New Zealand’s largest cities," said Judith Tizard.

"Since 1983 Sir Barry has transformed Manukau City into a fast-growing, multi-cultural, and modern city. His constant local energy and regional knowledge have become the model for Mayors nationwide. He will leave an amazing legacy for the people of Auckland."

"As Auckland Issues Minister I have had much to do with Sir Barry, and his presence will be missed." Judith Tizard said.
