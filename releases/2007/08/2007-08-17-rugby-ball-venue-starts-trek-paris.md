New Zealand’s bid to make an indelible impression on international audiences during the Rugby World Cup is about to begin with the giant New Zealand Rugby Ball Venue leaving by ship for Paris on Saturday.

"This unique and eye-catching venue is aimed at promoting New Zealand as a tourist destination and as a place to live, work and invest," Minister for the Rugby World Cup Trevor Mallard said.

"The ball starts its voyage from Auckland to Paris on Saturday. It will take six weeks to reach Paris before being inflated in front of the Eiffel Tower, on the Champs de Mars, during the final stages of the Rugby World Cup where it will showcase New Zealand tourism and trade to international audiences and visitors."

Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said: "This venue has not been seen before, it has never been tried before – it is a one off, pure piece of Kiwi ingenuity and design and a perfect venue for hosting clients and potential business partners of kiwi firms. This is a great opportunity to lift New Zealand's profile."

The Rugby Ball Venue is 12 metres high and 25 metres long and can hold up to 220 people. Events at the ball will be accompanied with a special menu designed by world-renowned New Zealand chef Peter Gordon.

Over 40,000 people are expected to experience a "virtual" New Zealand when they visit the venue while in Paris.

A stylish and sophisticated interior blends with the entire skin of the ball which acts as a gigantic oval screen for promotional videos. Short films promoting New Zealand, and made to fit the shape of the ball, will be shown during the day.

The venue is part of New Zealand's five-year buildup to maximise the opportunities for New Zealand when we host the world cup in 2011 and it will be traveling to other venues.

The Rugby Ball Venue project is a cross-government initiative involving Tourism NZ, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Labour, and Ministry for Culture and Heritage.
