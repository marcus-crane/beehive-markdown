Informed and assertive consumers should be the driving force behind Country of Origin Labelling, not the Government, says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

“The Green Party’s second attempt at legislating for mandatory Country of Origin Labelling by the Green Party still misses the mark.” says Judith Tizard.

“Rather than looking at ways in which Government, industry and retailers can work together to increase food labelling, Sue Kedgley’s latest proposal seeks a heavy handed legislative approach that can only result in price rises for consumers."

The Green’s first attempt, the Consumer’s Rights to Know (Food Information) Bill, introduced in March 2006, failed to get through the Parliamentary process. While this was due to a range of objections, the cost that mandatory labelling would transfer to the customer was a major factor in the Bill’s demise.

The Green’s latest proposal seeks to have mandatory country of origin labels on all single component foods, reviving just one aspect of the earlier unsuccessful proposal.

While the Government wholeheartedly supports the right of consumers to have access to information that informs their purchasing decisions, mandatory country of origin labelling will raise the cost to the end purchaser and provides no further information about the production process or product safety. Having access to safe, affordable and good food is a priority, and the Labour-led Government is not willing to put this at risk.

“Businesses taking pride in their products, their production processes, and in their country can choose to label the country of origin. At the end of the day this must be a sensible commercial decision, not Government restriction.”

“The Green Party would be better to target their campaign at retailers and suppliers, not the Government.
