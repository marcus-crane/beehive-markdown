Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today in Whangarei plans for a new $21 million police station to be built in the city.

Helen Clark announced the decision during a visit to the Northland district.

The new police station will be purpose built and centrally located on the corner of Walton and Cameron Streets. It will bring together all Whangarei police under one roof.

The current police station was built in the early 1960s and comprises four buildings spread over two separate sites.

Helen Clark said it has long been recognised that the old police station does not meet modern-day policing requirements or the needs of the community it serves.

“I am pleased to be able to announce that Whangarei's new police station will provide police with purpose-built accommodation and the community with a single, well located point of contact for their police,” she said.

The new station will also include space for police to work with community groups.

As part of the Government's commitment to making public buildings more sustainable, the new station will be built to a standard equivalent to a four Green Star Rating.

Construction will start in November this year and is due for completion by December 2008.

Helen Clark said the new station is part of the major investment the Labour-led Government is making in the future of policing in New Zealand.

“We have opened more than 30 new or refurbished stations since Labour came to office at the end of 1999. Now it is Whangarei's turn to benefit from this big investment programme with a brand new police station," Helen Clark said.
