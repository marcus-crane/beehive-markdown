Good quality interactions between teachers and children in early childhood education continue to have benefits in adolescence, according to a new education report released today by Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The report, from the Competent Children, Competent Learners study, looks at the associations between early childhood education and young people’s competencies at age 16.

“The research clearly shows that aspects of early childhood education were still making a contribution to young people’s competency levels at age 16.

“This once again reaffirms the Labour-led government’s commitment to early childhood education with [20 hours Free early childhood education](http://www.teamup.co.nz/earlyyears/about/20+Hours+Free/default.htm) (ECE) for three and four year olds in teacher-led services.”

[Competent Children, Competent Learners](http://www.nzcer.org.nz/default.php?products_id=134) is a longitudinal study, which began in 1993, and has followed the progress of around 500 students from late pre-school through into secondary school. The project is undertaken by researchers at the New Zealand Council for Educational Research.

The study found that positive influences on adolescent competencies can be attributed to:

- teachers who respond to the needs of individual children;
- teachers who guide and encourage children in activities;
- teachers who ask children open-ended questions;
- teachers who frequently join children in their activities; and
- centres which encourage print awareness in children’s activities.

Mr Maharey said the findings underlined the importance of quality education from an early age and are consistent with a growing body of similar international research.

“Young people who had attended an ECE centre which rated highly on the quality of the interactions between the teacher and the child, and centres which had moderate or high ratings for providing a range of books and printed material, had higher scores on average for literacy, numeracy, and logical problem-solving,” he said.
