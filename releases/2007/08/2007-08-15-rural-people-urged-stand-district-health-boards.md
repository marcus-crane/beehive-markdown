Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor says few rural New Zealanders have so far put up their hands for election to local district health boards.

Nominations close at noon on 24 August for the October DHB elections, which are being held by postal vote at the same time as local government elections.

Mr O'Connor encouraged rural people who want to make a difference to the health of their community to act now.

"Nearly 150 elected positions are available on the 21 DHBs nationwide for people passionate about how health services are delivered in their region.

"With less than 10 days left to register, time is beginning to run out, so any rural people who want to ensure DHBs have a rural voice should put their hands up."

The Government has invested significant funding to improve the health status of rural populations and to meet the challenges of reducing health inequalities, Mr O'Connor said.

"In order to ensure the best investment of rural funding in rural communities, the rural perspective needs to be heard at the board table."

Nearly 80 per cent of the almost $10 billion spent on health each year is devolved to the country's 21 DHBs. On top of this, the Government provides extra funding –  
More than $100 million in the last financial year – to DHBs with rural populations due to the specific challenges of delivering health care in rural areas.

Mr O'Connor said DHBs allocate funding not only to GPs, but also to address the wider areas of workforce retention, including pharmacists, nurses and midwives.

"It's well known that rural communities often face challenges in these areas. We need to work harder to reduce the impact of chronic diseases, enhance access to health services, and improve overall health outcomes in our rural communities."

The 2007 DHB elections will be the second to be held under the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. DHB elections are also held ‘at large’, which means that every voter living in a district will be able to express a preference for every candidate who stands for the board.

More information, including a candidate information handbook, is available on the Ministry’s website – www.moh.govt.nz/dhbelections – or from DHBs.
