Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel says the government is aware of the situation with regards to finance companies and continues to monitor it.

”The NZX and the Securities Commission, as independent regulators, have acted promptly by asking direct questions of finance companies about the reliability of their disclosures,” Lianne Dalziel said.

”Trustee companies have an important role here as well, and the government is looking to them to monitor the health of the finance companies they supervise, and to ensure those finance companies are making proper disclosures and are complying with their trust deeds.

“As I have said before, the government’s role is to create a regulatory environment that promotes transparency. This is exactly what we are in the process of doing through the decisions announced in June as a result of the two-year Review of Financial Products and Providers. This represents the largest ever reform of the non-bank finance sector and the decisions were made with the wide support of the industry. We are now in the process of implementing them.

”Aside from the actions being taken by the independent regulators, the government’s current assessment is that no government intervention is warranted at this stage,” Lianne Dalziel said.
