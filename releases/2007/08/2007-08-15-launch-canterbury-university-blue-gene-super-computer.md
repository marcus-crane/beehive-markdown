*Speech notes for launch of IBM Blue Gene super computer for University of Canterbury School of Engineering*

I want to congratulate the university on the launch of this computer.

And I want to join with you in celebrating the commitment to world class research and international connections that it represents.

I understand that even before it was commissioned, this Blue Gene supercomputer was ranked among the hundred most powerful in the world.

And it therefore ranks this university - and New Zealand - among the big players in super-computing research.

It's hard for a lay person to conceive of how much computing power is harnessed here. Less than forty years ago when the first astronauts walked on the moon, the largest computing processors around filled rooms. Today, that computing power is dwarfed by the onboard processors available in everyday cellphones. Moore's Law, saying computing power doubles every eighteen months, has held true ever since.

And so we have arrived at today when machines of breathtaking power are available.

It's not about rocket science. It's about using research to improve our lives and to open new opportunities.

We didn't always need a computer with this much power when I was an academic doing research in economic history. But it is needed for example, at the Christchurch School of Medicine to research conditions like stroke and diabetes. Researchers there will be able to model blood flow and chemical reactions in the brain and get insights that were not available before because computers were not powerful enough.

The supercomputing power harnessed here is a critical element of modern day research.

Research is critical to New Zealand.

The government has a vision for New Zealand of a highly skilled, innovative economy capable of competing in a globalised world with smart products that command a premium.

Innovation gives us a competitive edge.

And innovation comes from research.

If we want world class innovation then we need world class research.

We need the private sector doing research for new products - which is why the government introduced a new tax credit to promote more research and development.

And we also know that universities are hotbeds of innovation-led research.

To stay ahead they require both world class researchers, and world class equipment.

We're here today to launch an example. This is a world class computer. It's one of the 25 most powerful supercomputers operating in academia anywhere in the world. It makes the University of Canterbury the first research institution in the Southern Hemisphere to have an IBM Blue Gene supercomputer. And it puts this university among other elite research-led universities, including Harvard, Princeton and MIT. Those universities are synonymous with excellence in their academic output.

World class research and innovation depends on developing international connections. No matter how smart we are, we will never have a monopoly on the best ideas. So if we want access to the best we need to collaborate with others and exploit the opportunities that deepening connections in a globalised world can bring us.

This supercomputer is an example of those connections working. I understand the relationship the university has with IBM has helped to bring the two together to install the Blue Gene computer here.

And there are more connections behind today: the MacDiarmid Institute at Victoria University in Wellington and AUT in Auckland will be foundation partners in the Blue Gene project.

The government is currently making some of the most substantial changes to our tertiary system ever. The point of those changes is to increase quality and capability in our tertiary sector. I want the tertiary sector to achieve value for money for the taxpayer and to be responsive to the needs of everyone with a stake in the sector's future. It has to be equipped to provide world-class education, skills and research.

The government has strongly backed capability in the university sector in particular with $129 million of new funding in this year's budget.

We want to see a strong and vibrant research capability in our universities. We want to see them equipped to take their place as world-leading researchers.

We're celebrating that today.
