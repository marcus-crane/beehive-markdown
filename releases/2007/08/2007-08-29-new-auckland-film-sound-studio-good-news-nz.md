New Zealand is cementing its place in the international market for screen production with world class facilities, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today at the opening of a $7 million film sound studio in West Auckland.

Prime Minister Helen Clark was opening the new 20,000 square foot sound stage at Henderson Valley Studios, before attending the premiere of The Tattooist. The film is the result of a partnership between New Zealand’s Eyeworks Touchdown and MediaCorp Raintree Pictures of Singapore, and follows the negotiation of a film co-production agreement between New Zealand and Singapore.

Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard says the expansion of screen production facilities in Auckland is good for New Zealand’s film and television industries.

The sound stage in West Auckland is estimated to be New Zealand’s largest, and is tall enough to have a two-storey building constructed within it. The government is providing funding to the project as part of the Auckland Screen Production Major Regional Initiative, which also includes funding to help the region build and market the industry’s capability," Trevor Mallard said.

Helen Clark said that the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest growing region for global entertainment in the next five years, with China, Japan, and South Korea leading much of that growth.

"Our investment in this sound stage and in building the industry’s capability is therefore timely.

"New Zealand’s stunning scenery has always made us a desirable shooting location. But it’s our competitive edge in creativity, innovation, and experience which makes Kiwis stand out on the international stage of screen production. The work put in by all the people involved in this development will ensure that that edge continues to be recognised internationally," Helen Clark said.

Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said the investment in the new sound stage showed how strong partnerships between the private and public sector could benefit the industry.

"The creative industries are an increasingly valuable part of New Zealand’s economy, and this kind of project is significant. It is also important that Auckland has the infrastructure necessary to ensure that it is internationally competitive in screen production," Trevor Mallard said.
