A bill which increases openness of the Family Courts was introduced by Courts Minister Rick Barker today.

“The Family Courts Matters Bill amends legislation to further increase the openness of the Family Courts and improves a number of processes and procedures in the Family Courts,” said Rick Barker.

“The Labour-led Government has already increased openness for guardianship and other proceedings under the Care of Children Act 2004 and is now extending similar provisions to other Family Court proceedings where appropriate.

The Family Courts Matters Bill will:

- Allow accredited news media reporters to attend hearings of certain proceedings;
- Allow support persons to attend proceedings with the Judge's permission; and
- Allow anyone to publish a report on Family Court proceedings, providing there is no information identifying vulnerable persons or children without leave of the Court

“Following the successful pilot programme, the Bill takes the first step towards introducing non-judge led (or family) mediation on a permanent basis. This can divert less complex family disputes away from formal court proceedings and resolve them quickly and inexpensively. Mediation is particularly helpful for resolving matters about the care of children as it helps separating couples sort out arrangements that will work best for them.

The Bill also makes a number of minor process and procedure changes designed to improve the operation of the Family Courts. These include:

- allowing some administrative functions to be carried out by court registrars to relieve the pressure on Judges
- allowing Family Court fees to be set out in Regulations so that the fees will be brought together in one place as for other Courts, and allowing fees to be waived in appropriate cases;
- extending the availability of counselling to people such as grandparents and other family members to help resolve matters about parenting orders and parenting agreements under the Care of Children Act 2004
