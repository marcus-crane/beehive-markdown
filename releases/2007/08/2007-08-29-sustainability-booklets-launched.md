Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today launched a new set of booklets to help tourism businesses develop while reducing their impact on the environment.

The launch of the Tourism Ministry-produced Best Practice Sustainability Guides took place at the annual Tourism Industry Association conference in Auckland, one of the biggest tourism events of the year.

Mr O'Connor said the set of eight booklets will give tourism operators ideas and advice on ways to make their businesses more sustainable.

"Sustainability, in terms of how we treat the environment, in our business practices, in how we interact with our communities, and in the way our unique culture is developed, has to be the foundation of the tourism sector, indeed of all New Zealand industries, into the future.

"The booklets provide very practical advice in areas such as energy efficiency, business management, minimising waste, water conservation, wastewater management, sustainable design, supply chain management and community relations.

"They act as comprehensive, in-depth guides for businesses which have already done the easy things like changing their light bulbs to more energy efficient ones, and who are now looking for more areas to develop responsible business practices."

Mr O'Connor said the eight guides are specifically designed to help specific parts of the tourism industry:  
·accommodation,  
·visitor attractions,  
·transport operators,  
·marine activities,  
·fresh water activities,  
·land activities – at one location,  
·land activities – on the move,  
·food and wine.
