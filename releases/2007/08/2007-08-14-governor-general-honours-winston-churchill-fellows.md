Travelling overseas to research new concepts before bringing this knowledge back to New Zealand enriches our communities, says Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

Laban is speaking at a special awards ceremony hosted by the Hon Anand Satyanand, Governor General of New Zealand, at Government House today to honour twenty recent [Winston Churchill Memorial Trust](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Trust-&-Fellowship-Grants-New-Zealand-Winston-Churchill-Memorial-Trust?OpenDocument) Fellows.

Fellowships are awarded to New Zealanders to travel abroad to conduct research that will benefit this country.

Research topics have included using renewable resources to supply energy to homes, identifying marketing opportunities for New Zealand theatre, improving services to victims of domestic violence, and investigating management options for contaminated land.

“By studying international best practice, and bringing that knowledge and experience home, the Winston Churchill Fellows benefit their local communities, local businesses, and ultimately all of New Zealand,” said Laban.

“The [Labour](http://www.labour.org.nz)-led government is committed to building and supporting strong, sustainable and connected communities.

“These Fellowships allow communities to better meet new challenges, opportunities and solve their own problems, while benefiting New Zealand in the process,” said Laban.

Since its 1965 inception, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has helped over 610 New Zealanders to undertake research overseas. Churchill Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs and typically spend from three weeks to three months overseas.

Britain’s wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill strongly believed in people working abroad to develop a particular area of expertise, and then returning to make a greater contribution to their home communities. Churchill Trusts also operate in the United Kingdom and Australia.
