Legislation to position New Zealand as an attractive destination to host major events, and to ensure major events run smoothly and safely was passed by Parliament today.  
"The Major Events Management Bill is an important step in ensuring that New Zealand continues to be seen as a viable and attractive host country for major events of international significance," Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said.

"The role of these events in attracting international visitors, raising New Zealand’s international profile, and the consequent economic opportunities from tourism and associated sectors, mean that such events have obvious benefits for New Zealanders.

"New Zealand will host the Rugby World Cup in 2011, the Rowing World Championships in 2010 and the FIFA Under-17 Women’s Football World Cup in 2008. New Zealand will also co-host the Cricket World Cup in 2015, so it is important we have this legislation in place.  
"International events such as these cost a huge amount to stage and companies pay very large sums of money to become "official sponsors". In return for their investment, the company secures the rights to promote itself and their goods or services in association with the event.  
"The Major Events Bill ensures that New Zealand is in line with other countries by providing protections against "ambush marketing" - the actions of companies or advertisers who unfairly try to free ride off and capture these sponshorship benefits for themselves without the authorisation of the event organisers and without paying a cent.

"Companies that free ride off major events undermine the value of official sponsorship and they threaten the viability of obtaining sponsorship for future events. Without this legislation, New Zealand would risk losing out on hosting rights for major events - events that deliver substantial economic and tourism spinoffs when we host them here.

"This legislation will therefore also provide a significant marketing advantage for New Zealand when bidding for future events.

"This bill is consistent with ambush marketing legislation for other major events like the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, FIFA Football World Cup and Cricket World Cup enacted in countries like Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, China and the West Indies," Trevor Mallard said.  
The bill only applies to major events, sporting or otherwise, that are of international significance that meet strict criteria and that are publicly declared to be "major events" by the Minister for Economic Development.

The bill is not intended to prevent businesses from going about their normal, everyday activities - there are a range of safeguards and exceptions for existing rights and honest business practices including advertising. It does not impose a blanket ban on advertising within a 5km radius of a venue - as it applies only to advertising that is in "clean zones" - ie venue premises or areas directly proximate such as the adjacent footpaths, road and carparks), areas visible from clean zones and on "clean transport routes" (motorways, state highways and railway lines within 5km of the venue).

Also banned under the bill is pitch invasion and behaviour such as bottle-throwing which disrupt international sporting events, create the potential for injury to participants and game officials, security personnel and pitch invaders themselves. This behaviour is not only potentially dangerous but can also result in international sanctions for the sporting organisation or stadium owner.

Pitch invasion will be punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months (unchanged), or a fine not exceeding $5000 (previously $2000).
