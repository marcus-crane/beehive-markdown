"While the National Party, bereft of any policy of their own, has Chester Borrows busy in the House asking about ministerial meetings, this Labour led Government is making meaningful changes to our criminal justice system," Justice Minister Mark Burton said today

"He mentions inter-generational crime, well I'm pleased to point out that we already have a wide range of initiatives operating that address youth offending to break the cycle of crime," he said.

"There are currently 40 projects funded to put effective interventions in place for community and youth at risk, five Iwi crime prevention partnerships, and development of risk assessment tools by Police and Child, Youth and Family to enable appropriate targeting of interventions for young offenders as well as a range of family violence initiatives to address the cycle of violence.

"Through engagement with local authorities we have made progress in ensuring public spaces are designed to promote safety by reducing the risk for a crime to be committed through the Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Principles.

"In fact in Mr Borrows' own Wanganui community these very principles are being implemented in the public spaces around the new UCOL complex."

"It's time the National Party realised that its endless whinging and ill considered criticism is no substitute for real ideas, workable policy and effective action.

"This Labour led Government has the ideas, has developed the policies and is taking effective action," Mark Burton said.
