Robust economic growth in New Zealand over the past five years of a Labour-led government has had a positive impact on youth in the labour market, Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

A [new report](http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/youth/2007/summary.asp) focusing on changes in labour market outcomes for New Zealanders aged 15-24 released by Department of Labour today, shows more youth are in work and the unemployment rate is lower than five years ago.

“Over the past five years, employment growth of 2.9% each year for those aged 15-24 was higher than the 2.5% recorded for all ages," said Mr Maharey.

“Youth skill levels and wages have also risen faster for youth than for all ages. This reflects better education and substantial changes to minimum wage laws.

“Many youth aged 15-19 combine secondary and tertiary education with part-time work. They are developing valuable work ethics and skills that will contribute to them realising their potential.

“New Zealand’s youth labour market stacks up well internationally. The youth participation rate was the 7th highest of the 27 OECD countries with comparable data and youth unemployment was the 8th lowest.

"These results are good news but there is always more to do. This Labour-led government is committed to linking young New Zealanders to training, successful careers and bright futures so they can contribute to this country's economic development.

"Programmes such as the [Modern Apprenticeship](http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/standard.aspx?id=473) scheme, the [Industry Trainee](http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/standard.aspx?id=470) scheme and [Gateway]()"&gt;Youth Transition Services operating in 14 regions to ensure young people make a good transition from school into employment or further education. Budget 2006 saw a further $2.5 million invested for the expansion of these services in 2007/08," said Mr Maharey.

The report primarily sources data from the quarterly [Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS)](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-jun07qtr-hotp.htm) from Statistics New Zealand and also uses other internationally comparable measures to give a well-rounded picture of New Zealand’s youth labour market.

The NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) measure referred to in the report captures the group not engaged in an activity.

"However, the NEET figure of 6.6% of 15-19 year olds doesn't count young people involved in other activities that could contribute to their well-being or are "in-between" activities for a short period of time, such as being on holiday from work or study or recently having returned from overseas," said Mr Maharey.

"The youth who are most at risk are those receiving an Unemployment Benefit. The number of youth aged 18-19 receiving this benefit has dramatically reduced. In December 1999 when Labour took office there were 17,500 youth receiving an Unemployment Benefit, at the end of June this year there were just 990.

"This government is fully committed to its shared goal with the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education, training or other meaningful activities by the end of this year," said Mr Maharey.

The report is a response to a market need for information on and analyses of trends for specific labour market groups, such as youth.
