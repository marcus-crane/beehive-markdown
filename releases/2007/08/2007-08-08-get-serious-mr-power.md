"Simon Power really is engaging in desperate flights of fancy. In the face of the Government's carefully considered provisions to tackle organised crime groups, Mr Power makes the ridiculous suggestion that decisions Cabinet has taken, from work directed in May were "stolen" from his "back of the envelope" weekend conference speech." Minister of Justice Mark Burton said today.

"This is further evidence of that National Party's complete lack of credibility when it comes to serious policy development.

"The measures I released yesterday in response to a Parliamentary Question include:

- Changes to the [Section 98A of the Crimes Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1376755357&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jd=a1961-043%2Fs.98a&record=%7B18158%7D&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1961-043/s.98a) that will increase the maximum sentences for the offence of participation in an organised criminal group from 5 years to 10 years.
- This will mean Police can use interception devices in investigating these offences and will therefore better enable participation to be charged as a stand-alone offence rather than an add-on.
- The [Sentencing Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1376755357&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B8C212%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) will also be amended to provide that it is an aggravating factor when an offence is committed for the benefit of or under the direction of, or is associated with, an organised crime group.

"These measures build on the improvements to Section 98A that this Government made in 2002, the establishment of the National Interception Centre which undertakes electronic intelligence aimed at organised crime and the Centralised Monitoring Centre which significantly improved Police interception capability.

In addition the [Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Bill](http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/a/5/7/00DBHOH_BILL7801_1-Criminal-Proceeds-Recovery-Bill.htm) currently before Select Committee and the development of strengthened Anti-Money Laundering legislation are also well advanced.

"Further work on the government's organised crime strategy and potential law changes to tackle gangs, has been brought forward, with proposed measures to go before Cabinet in the not too distant future," Mark Burton said.

"Given this Government's proven record of serious policy intervention - perhaps I should ask Mr Power just where he got wind of Labour's already taken decisions, to pose as his own.

"Perhaps he's just another example of a National Party MP confused over which Party he aspires to belong to.
