Associate Justice Minister Clayton Cosgrove says the passing of the Wills Bill by Parliament today will make it easier for New Zealanders to make wills and give will-makers peace of mind from knowing their estate will go where it is intended.

Mr Cosgrove said having clear and effective wills legislation is important, especially since wills allow people to provide for their loved ones when they are gone.

“Legislation that makes it clear what is required for an effective will and that allows defects to be overcome when appropriate eases the burden on both the will-maker and those who are left behind,” Mr Cosgrove said. “Basically wills speak for people who are no longer able to speak for themselves.”

The new Wills Act 2007 consolidates the existing legislation on wills into a single, plain language statute. The previous wills legislation was set out in a United Kingdom Act from 1837, which had to be read together with several other Acts.

The new Act also reduces the risk of a will-maker’s wishes being undermined by a poorly drafted or badly executed will.

“The old-fashioned language of the original Act, together with the numerous changes and modifications made to it over the last 170 years, made the previous legislation confusing and unnecessarily complicated,” said Mr Cosgrove.

Mr Cosgrove said the new Act does not radically change the law but rather modernises it. “People who already have up-to-date wills will not need to change them.”

Mr Cosgrove said he would like to thank the Law Commission and the Justice and Electoral Committee for making the new legislation possible.

**Background Information: Wills Act 2007**

**The Law Commission published Succession Law: A Succession (Wills) Act (Report 41) in 1997. Why is the government implementing the reforms now?**  
Over the last year, the government has been committed to giving effect to a number of Law Commission reports which propose sensible, useful law reform that aims to make existing law clearer and more accessible. The Arbitration Amendment Bill, the Succession (Homicide) Bill, and the Property Law Bill (which are currently progressing through Parliament) are all based on Law Commission reports.

**Why is the Act necessary?**  
The previous wills legislation was set out in a several Acts including the original Wills Act 1837 from the United Kingdom. The archaic language of the original Act, together with the numerous changes and modifications made to it over the last 170 years, made the legislation inaccessible to the average New Zealander. The Wills Act restates the current legislation in modern language in a single statute.  
The Act also modernises certain aspects of the law on wills, including by reducing the risk of a will-maker’s wishes being undermined by a poorly drafted or badly executed will.

**Will the Act affect my existing will?**  
If you already have an up-to-date will, there is no need to change it or make a new one, as generally the changes only affect wills made after Act comes into force.  
There are two key exceptions to that general rule: changes to the High Court’s powers to (1) correct errors in wills and (2) use external evidence to interpret wills will also apply to wills made before the Act comes into force. These new powers will not undermine existing wills. Rather, they will enable the Court to give better effect to will-makers’ intentions as expressed in their wills.

**How will changes in relationships affect wills?**  
There are a number of developments in this area.  
•The existing rule that marriage revokes a prior will (unless the will was made in contemplation of that marriage) is extended to civil unions.  
•The existing rule that dissolution of a marriage revokes dispositions to a former spouse is extended to dissolution of a civil union.  
•Previously, a formal separation order prevented a person inheriting from his or her estranged spouse or civil union partner if that person died intestate, but not if he or she died leaving a valid will. The Act resolves this anomaly by providing that an estranged spouse or civil union partner will also be disinherited under the deceased’s will if there was a separation order in force at the time of death.

**What changes are there to requirements for executing a will?**  
Will-makers are no longer required to sign at the end of the will. This was a common problem in “home-made” wills. Under the new Act a will is valid regardless of where it is signed, although the will still has to be properly witnessed. However, the Act also enables the High Court to validate wills that do not meet these formalities and that would otherwise be invalid, provided the High Court is satisfied it expresses the will-maker’s intentions.

**Who can make wills?**  
The following people can make wills:  
•Anyone aged over 18  
•Anyone aged under 18 who is or has been married or in a civil union or de facto relationship  
•Anyone aged under 18 who has agreed to marry or enter into a civil union with another person (although the will only becomes valid once the marriage or civil union actually takes place)  
•Anyone else aged under 18 can make a will if they first satisfy the Family Court that they understand the nature and effect of their actions

**Do the changes mean that I will be able to make a will without a lawyer?**  
A will-maker did not actually have to take legal advice to make a will under the former legislation. However, certain formalities had to be satisfied for a will to be valid, and disposing of property by will could be complicated. Consulting a lawyer was sensible to ensure that nothing was overlooked and that the will gave full effect to the will-maker’s intentions.

That will continue to be the case under the new Act, although the Act does seek to make the law clearer and more accessible. The Act also makes it easier to dispose of property in certain circumstances (for example, to non-charitable unincorporated associations) and enables the courts to give better effect to will-makers’ intentions.

**Was the Bill changed at all between introduction and enactment?**  
The Bill did develop further during the legislative process. All of the changes made were consistent with its underlying policy:  
•A number of changes were made that did not substantively change the Bill as introduced, but that did clarify it and make it easier to understand. For example the word “testator” is now seen as an outdated term and has been replaced by the more commonly used “will-maker”. This was consistent with the objective of making wills legislation easier for the average New Zealander to understand.  
•A change was made to what the Court could consider when determining whether a will was made in contemplation of a marriage or civil union. A will is not revoked by the will-maker’s subsequent marriage or civil union (the general rule), if the will was actually made in contemplation of that marriage or civil union. As introduced, the Bill was the same as the previous law – it provided that, to avoid being revoked, the will had to expressly state that it was made in contemplation of that marriage or civil union.  
The Bill was amended so that the Court can also consider the circumstances in which the will was made when determining whether the will was made in contemplation of that marriage or civil union. The result is that, even if the will does not expressly state that it was made in contemplation of that marriage or civil union, it will not be revoked if the surrounding circumstances nevertheless show that it was made in contemplation of that marriage or civil union. That will ensure that better effect can be given to a will-maker's intentions.  
•Section 10, which relates to wills made by minors who have agreed to marry or enter into a civil union with another person, was extended in a similar way.  
•The commencement date was changed from 1 July 2007 to 1 November 2007 to allow time to make necessary consequential amendments to the High Court Rules.  
•Finally, the definition of who may make an informal will was amended. The Wills Act allows seafarers and members of the Armed Forces to make wills that do not comply with the usual formalities in certain limited circumstances. As introduced, commercial seafarers at sea could have made informal wills, but members of the Armed Forces on New Zealand Defence Force ships could not. That was inconsistent, and the Act was amended to ensure that members of the Armed Forces on Defence Force ships could also make informal wills.
