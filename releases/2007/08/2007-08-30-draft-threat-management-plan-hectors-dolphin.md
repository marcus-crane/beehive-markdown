Conservation Minister Chris Carter today released the draft Hector’s Dolphin Threat Management Plan for public consultation at Willow Park Primary School, Northcote, Auckland.

“Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins are a national taonga we cannot afford to lose,” Chris Carter said. “Their future is grim unless impacts on the species are managed. The Maui subspecies is now down to just 111 individuals, making it the world’s rarest marine dolphin.”

The draft plan was developed by the Ministry of Fisheries and the Department of Conservation and builds on discussions of the range of threats facing the dolphins.

“The Labour-led government strongly supports a strategy to ensure these unique dolphins can be enjoyed by future generations. We need to increase their numbers as quickly as possible,” Chris Carter said.

Options include consideration of four new marine mammal sanctuaries, extension of an existing sanctuary, and managing non-fishing-related issues, such as marine tourism.

Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said measures were already in place to reduce the effects of fishing on the dolphins but concerns remained.

“We are consulting to determine whether additional measures are necessary to protect the dolphins and, if so, what those might be. The discussion document canvasses a wide range of potential measures. We will take whatever steps are necessary.

“Input from stakeholders will provide important information. The Ministry of Fisheries has contracted an independent research provider to gather information on the social, cultural and economic impacts of any further threat management measures,” Jim Anderton said.

The draft plan is now open for public consultation. Submissions close on 24 October 2007. Copies are available on [www.fish.govt.nz](http://www.fish.govt.nz), [www.doc.govt.nz](http://www.doc.govt.nz)

At the end of the consultation period, advice will be prepared for the Ministers. A decision is expected in November, in time for any new management measures to be in place before Christmas.
