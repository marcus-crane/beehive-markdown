The Hutt Valley is the first region in New Zealand to adopt the 'No Exceptions' strategy which supports the inclusion of disabled people in all sport and physical recreation, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"This shows a commitment to work with sport and recreation providers to provide more accessible opportunities for disabled people," Trevor Mallard said.

Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC), the Hutt Valley District Health Board, Hutt City Council and Upper Hutt City Council have all approved the initiative, and have each committed $5000 to assist with the declaration.

The declaration commits the District Health Board and the Hutt Valley local authorities to:

- Encourage and assist local sport and recreation organisations to develop programmes for people with disabilities;
- Guide the development of sport and recreation facilities, programmes and services in order to maximise accessibility; and
- Facilitate sponsorship of sport and recreation opportunities for people with disabilities.

"In making this declaration, SPARC, Hutt Valley District Health Board and the local authorities have issued two challenges to the people of the Hutt Valley," Trevor mallard said.

"The first challenge is to the sport and recreation community to increase the opportunities available in the area to disabled people. The second challenge is for disabled people in the Hutt Valley to become more physically active by making the most of those opportunities.

"Disabled people benefit from participating in physical recreation and sport. Benefits include increased social interaction, feelings of belonging to a wider community and opportunities for further skill development. They can also enjoy better overall health, an enhanced immune function, increased mobility."

SPARC is the Crown Entity responsible for promoting, encouraging and supporting sport and physical recreation in New Zealand.
