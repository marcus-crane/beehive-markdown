The Prime Minister Helen Clark poured the first bioethanol-blended petrol today in Auckland, as Gull New Zealand launched the first commercially available biofuel for New Zealand motorists.

"I congratulate Gull on being the first oil company to make this move, well before the Biofuels Sales Obligation starts next year," Helen Clark said.

"Gull's new fuel provides motorists with real choice, helps New Zealand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and takes New Zealand a step further towards achieving sustainability."

Climate change minister David Parker said the [Biofuels Sales Obligation](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28359) the government announced in February this year will require biofuels to make up 3.4 percent of fuel companies' sales by the year 2012. The obligation is due to commence in April 2008.  
"Introducing biofuels to New Zealand will reduce overall emissions of carbon dioxide from New Zealand vehicles and will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than a million tonnes between 2008 and 2012," David Parker said.”

Gull’s FORCE 10 fuel is a blend of 10 percent bioethanol, which is produced at Anchor Ethanol (a Fonterra subsidiary company) and comes from their Reporoa distillery. The fuel is then blended at Gull’s Mount Manganui terminal. In New Zealand, bioethanol is made as a by-product of the dairy industry and in future could be made here from crops such as maize.

"The transport sector accounts for 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions. Gull's initiative is another example of the business sector stepping up and helping put the country on a more sustainable path," Helen Clark said.

"It also shows how government leadership on sustainability can stimulate new kinds of business opportunities. In this case, we see a by-product being turned into a useful resource, with benefits for the environment."
