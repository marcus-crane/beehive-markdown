Climate change is among the biggest issues facing the New Zealand and Australia tourism industries, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said following a meeting of tourism ministers in Australia.

Mr O'Connor met with Australian federal and state tourism ministers in Canberra recently.

Mr O'Connor said both countries are particularly vulnerable to the indirect impacts of climate change, such as European consumers' concerns over long haul flights, and should work quickly to mitigate these concerns.

He said the discussions were another reminder that the New Zealand tourism sector must set bold sustainability goals in the upcoming tourism strategy to 2015.

"Climate change and sustainability are issues of huge importance for New Zealand and our tourism industry. We must continue to make our visitors feel good by giving them the confidence that we are at the global forefront of environmental management.

"That's why our tourism strategy for the next eight years, which is due to be launched in the next couple of months, has to be bold and inspire the industry to lead into the future.

"The strategy is an opportunity for tourism and ultimately New Zealand Inc to send a strong signal to the world that we are world leaders – not only in environmental management, but also in the way we sustainably manage our culture, our economic growth and our communities."
