Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui officially launched two mobile oral health units on behalf of the Ngāti Hine Health Trust in Kawakawa today.

Speaking at today’s launch of the Trust’s new mobile dental units, Mita Ririnui said “I congratulate the Trust, the Ministry of Health and Northland DHB on getting this initiative going, I know this day represents the culmination of two years of hard work and I would like to acknowledge your shared vision, mutual support and ongoing commitment to improving oral health for our tamariki and rangatahi.”

The new units were built as part of a Ministry of Health project to support Māori health providers to improve the oral health status of their local population. The units being launched today will deliver an array of community based oral health services including treatment, preventive care, oral health promotion and education. Ngāti Hine Health Trust has over 10 years of experience in oral health and this investment will position them well to continue their excellent work.

“It’s no secret that we are still living with the various legacies brought about by the social and economic changes during the 1980s and 1990s” Mita Ririnui said. “Māori have taken more than their fair share of hits because of these changes, and it is an absolute tragedy that our beautiful tamariki and rangatahi have been affected by events that occurred before most of them were even a twinkle in their parent’s eyes”

The Government has made Oral Health a priority, allocating an additional $10.2 million per annum operating funding and investing $100 million in capital funding to improve dental services for children and young people over the next five years.

“We’d all love movie star like smiles, but that is not what these oral health initiatives are about. They are about reducing oral health inequalities by improving access to appropriate oral health services that meet the needs of all tamariki and rangatahi and by empowering Māori oral health providers.”

“They are also about the government continuing to work with our communities and investing in the health of our tamariki and rangatahi. After all, they are our stars of the future.”
