"The National Party is playing destructive games with the country's sustainable labour market,'' said Immigration Minister David Cunliffe. "It's time they put the future of the horticulture and viticulture industries ahead of their own short-term political ends.''

Mr Cunliffe was commenting on remarks by Lockwood Smith, Craig Foss and John Key on the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme.

"Industry leaders have clearly stated their support for the RSE scheme which will lend more certainty and continuity in filling labour shortages.

"Meanwhile John Key is calling it 'impractical', but doesn't understand the Working Holiday Scheme is still available, and Craig Foss thinks it is a 'disaster waiting to happen' despite the large number of workers already projected.

"Now Lockwood Smith doesn't appear to know the difference between a 'fudge' and a proper cabinet process – which is why he will remain in Opposition.

"The National Party is divided, confused and sending mixed messages to the industries involved. It has no coherent policy in this area.

"Mr Smith's call for the continuation of the Seasonal Work Permit scheme takes no account of the fact that this was always a stop-gap measure, that it has been open to abuse, that there are significant risks to our border security in extending it, and it could increase the number of foreign nationals working illegally here.''

The RSE was announced in October 2006, and introduced in April 2007 following extensive consultation between the Government, industry leaders, community groups and employers.

Praising the scheme's introduction, Horticulture New Zealand President Andrew Fenton said at the time: "We are delighted the (Seasonal Labour Strategy Governance) group has been able to bring to life a programme designed by horticulture and viticulture employers …''

In the first three months of the scheme registered or soon to be registered employers have indicated they would like to take up more than 3,200 workers.

"The Government is committed to working with industry leaders to ensure adequate labour supplies. The crops will not be left to rot on the ground," Mr Cunliffe said.

"As with any new scheme there are issues to be worked through. I want to make it crystal clear that the Government is listening carefully to concerns raised. A number of additional measures are being considered and will be before Cabinet in the near future.''
