National has once again demonstrated it will do anything – except formulate its own policies – to get elected, Labour Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

"The National Party consistently voted against paid parental leave when it was first introduced in 2001 and it voted against extending the period of paid leave from 12 to 14 weeks at every stage of the legislation in 2004. So it is rather surprising to see a complete reversal by National's Hollow Women saying they might support extending the scheme.

"National didn't want the introduction of paid parental leave, or for parents to get an extra two weeks of paid leave, but now it has flip flopped. Can New Zealanders trust anything the National Party has to say on this issue?

"Anne Tolley is on record in 2001 saying that if National ever got back into power they would scrap it. She was also quoted in the New Zealand Herald as saying paid parental leave is 'driven by '70s feminist union ideology rather than by the real needs of women in the 21st century'.

"Judith Collins told the Sunday Star Times: 'I would have much rather had a tax cut than paid parental leave', but today told the New Zealand Herald she could have done with paid parental leave when she had a little child – which is it?

"Kate Wilkinson obviously thinks the government has no role to play in relation to paying parents to take leave to look after their children because she told the Dominion Post in May 'when it came to home life, the state should butt out.'

"Now we have John Key saying he 'thinks' he supports paid parental leave – has he made up his mind for sure yet? Or will he flip flop back to the National Party position against it?

"I am pleased the Families Commission report into paid parental leave has sparked a nationwide debate. Research has shown New Zealand parents have benefited from our Labour-led government's Paid Parental Leave scheme and are eager to contribute ideas to improve and extend the scheme.

"Our government will look at four different areas where the scheme could be improved – the 10 per cent of women in paid work who currently miss out on any payment at all, the level of money that people get, the length of time, and the fact that few fathers access the scheme at the moment."
