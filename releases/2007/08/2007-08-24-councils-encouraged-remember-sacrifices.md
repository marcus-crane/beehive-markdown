Veterans’ Affairs Minister Rick Barker has encouraged councils to name new streets after those who have fought and died fighting for New Zealand.

“Many events took place during last year’s ‘Year of the Veteran’ honouring the service of veterans and demonstrating the value local communities placed on their veterans,” said Rick Barker.

Rick Barker said he particularly admired the initiative of Queenstown Lakes District Council, who included names from local war memorials on the list of approved council names for developers to use when naming new roads.

“Street names are an excellent way of honouring the service and sacrifice of those who fought and died for the lifestyle and freedom we all enjoy in New Zealand today. Naming street after those who made the ultimate sacrifice is a tremendous way to keep their memory alive.

“I have written to local councils throughout New Zealand strongly encouraging them to consider using the names from local war memorials when naming streets,” said Rick Barker.

Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association president John Campbell believes others should follow the lead of the Queenstown Lakes District Council.

“The Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association supports and applauds this initiative, and sees it as an appropriate and significant way in which all New Zealanders can remember the sacrifices of these brave young Kiwis,” said John Campbell.

Rick Barker said he has already received positive feedback from Mayors around New Zealand about the suggestion.
