The Minister of Justice, Hon Mark Burton, today, welcomed the Law Commission report on search and surveillance powers.

“This is a very significant report with important implications for the future of law enforcement. The report sets out to find a commonsense solution to the tension between the requirements of modern investigation techniques and the rights of citizens”, said the Minister.

“In particular, the need to tidy up the law in the area of surveillance powers is essential to address ever-changing technology and its use by both law enforcement agencies and offenders”.

“There is now considerable consultation required by the Commission and Justice Sector Officials, and the Government will be giving careful consideration to the reports many recommendations in preparing its formal response,” said Mark Burton.

Now the report has been tabled, further consultation will take place with relevant government agencies and, Cabinet will consider the matter later this year.
