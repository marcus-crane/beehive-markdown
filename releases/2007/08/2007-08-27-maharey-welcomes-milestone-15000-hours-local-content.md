Broadcasting Minister, Steve Maharey, today congratulated NZ On Air for clocking up 15,000 hours of government-funded local content on television, all but four of which have made it to air.

The Minister is hosting NZ On Air’s celebration at the Banquet Hall at Parliament this evening to mark this huge milestone for TV 1 and 2, TV3, C4, Prime TV and Maori TV.

"The Labour-led government is committed to the core objective of building national identity and this huge milestone is a clear example of the success of public broadcasting reflecting New Zealand culture and pride.

“More than 10,000 hours of local content were broadcast across six free-to-air channels last year – the highest ever levels of New Zealand content on television.

“That compares with just two free-to-air channels screening around 2,000 hours of local content in 1988. Thanks largely to NZ On Air, more New Zealanders have come to expect and enjoy more local content on our screens, both funded and commercial.

“We can look back today at NZ On Air’s 18-year history of funding television programmes that have changed the face of New Zealand broadcasting.

“There have been the big drama successes: Shortland Street; The Insiders Guide series; Mercy Peak; Outrageous Fortune. There have also been many entertaining Kiwi comedies. Billy T James; ‘broTown; Eating Media Lunch; and Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby.

“I congratulate the board and staff of NZ On Air, past and present, and the passionate and committed programme makers and broadcasters.”
