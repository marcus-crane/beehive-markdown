“National backbencher Kate Wilkinson’s empty rhetoric and hollow concern for our courts ignores the significant progress made by the Labour-led Government cleaning up National’s mess,” said Courts Minister Rick Barker.

“Following years of neglect in the nineties and a reduction in spend in real terms, the Labour-led Government immediately took action and invested an additional $156 million into the Ministry of Justice to help bring our courts into the 21st century,” said Rick Barker.

“I’m proud of what a Labour-led government has delivered so far and relish the opportunity to continue delivering.

“We’ve hired more judges, we are employing more staff at our busiest courts, we are rolling out technology such as video conferencing and ‘real time’ transcription, and establishing a national roster to better use judicial time, we have invested in new courts, refurbishing courts and providing more court rooms around the country. I will stand by Labour’s record any day.

“Our investments are making a difference. In the High Court disposals have increased by 9.4% in the last two years. In the District Court disposals have improved by 8%. This in the face of an exponential increase in the number of cases being brought to the courts as a result of our strong stand on crime and on the strength of our first class police force.

“Last year the District Court progressed over 180,000 cases and nine systemic stays were granted. Four of these related to accommodation pressure in the Blenheim Courthouse which, thanks to the Labour-led Government’s building programme, has now been resolved.

“Labour has robust policy and we are delivering on it. The flip-flop opposition meanwhile has nothing at all to offer.

“If National were genuinely concerned about Courts then not only would they have developed some policies, but they would vote for the Criminal Procedure Bill which will streamline court processes by, amongst other things, speeding up the depositions process.

“Wilkinson’s typical moaning and grizzling ignores the reality that this is a Government that is delivering for New Zealand communities,” said Rick Barker.
