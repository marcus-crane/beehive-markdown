"The future of our country is in good hands judging by the commitment and passion demonstrated by the Youth MPs at Youth Parliament this week," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

As part of the fifth Youth Parliament which closes today, the 121 aspiring MPs have questioned Cabinet Ministers, and tabled Select Committee reports on current youth issues including party pills, NCEA, school leaving age and youth justice. And they've debated tax incentives to reduce household greenhouse gas emissions.

"Youth Parliament 2007 has successfully brought together a diverse range of creative, passionate and intelligent young people from around the country who have learnt more about our democratic processes and how they can influence them," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"And we in turn have had the opportunity to listen to the positive voices of young people – to hear their opinions and learn more about their approach to issues that affect them.

"I look forward to tabling their Select Committee reports when Parliament resumes so that all MPs are aware of their views on these issues."

For the first time a contingent of 24 youth observers from around the Pacific has sat in on Youth Parliament to learn about New Zealand's democratic processes.

Nanaia Mahuta says, "Youth Parliament has also practiced what it's preached - we've paid carbon credits to cover off the Youth MPs domestic flights and train travel, as well as the international flights for the 24 youth observers from around the Pacific and Myanmar".

"I look forward to the contribution these young people make to their schools, marae and community. They are our future leaders and decision-makers and through their active participation they can make their communities - and our country - a better place," says Nanaia Mahuta.
