"Youth Parliament is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate New Zealand’s increasingly diverse youth population and increase understanding amongst different groups within our community," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Youth Parliament 2007, which is the 5th Youth Parliament held, begins with the Powhiri today and sits until Wednesday afternoon. It gives the 121 Youth MPs the opportunity to experience and contribute to the Parliamentary decision-making process.

Nanaia Mahuta said the Youth MPs, selected by the 121 electorate and list MPs, and the 10 Press Gallery members are a “good reflection” of New Zealand’s gender mix and society’s increasingly multi-cultural makeup.

“I am pleased to see so many Youth MPs and Youth Press Gallery Members from such varied backgrounds. Diversity is one of the cornerstones of this government’s vision for New Zealand and our young people are the future of this country. If we can promote tolerance and understanding of diversity among them, then the ripples will be felt among our communities and the country as a whole,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The ethnicity of the Youth MPs and Youth Press Gallery members is as follows:

- 60% of the youth MPs are female compared with 32.23% of current MPs;
- 19% identified themselves as Maori or Maori/ European which is comparable to the current Parliament, at 17.36%;
- Nearly 7% identified themselves as Pacific (including Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island and Niuean), compared with 2.48% in the current Parliament;
- And nearly 8% identified themselves as Asian (of Sri Lankan, Chinese and Korean descent respectively), compared with just 1.65% of current MPs;
- 1 participant is hearing impaired.

“Each of these 121 Youth MPs will bring diverse skills, ideas, values and experiences to Youth Parliament which reflects the new face of New Zealand," says Nanaia Mahuta.

“This will benefit our country only now, but also for future generations.”
