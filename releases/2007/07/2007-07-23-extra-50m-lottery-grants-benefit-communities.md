Lottery profits are up and communities across the country will benefit, Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board Presiding Member Rick Barker said today.

“The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board will distribute over $171 million to the community and statutory bodies in the coming year – almost $50 million more than last year,” said Rick Barker.

“The increase in lottery profits has also enabled the Lottery Grants Board to award approximately $24 million in one-off allocations for 2007-08.

“It’s an excellent partnership: the New Zealand Lotteries Commission makes the profits and the independent Lottery Grants Board allocates the funding to three statutory bodies and through its distribution committees,” said Rick Barker.

Creative New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission (including funding for the New Zealand Film Archive), and Sport and Recreation New Zealand will together receive an extra one-off amount of $15.75 million additional to their allocation of $63.34 million for 2007-08.

Lottery distribution committees will receive $84.16 million. $43.34 million will go to the Lottery Community Committees for grants to community groups. This is an increase of over $5 million on the funding provided in 2006-07.

An amount of $40.81 million, an increase of $16.20 million, is allocated to the specialist distribution committees (Lottery Environment and Heritage, Community Facilities Fund, Health Research, Marae Heritage and Facilities, Outdoor Safety and the Minister’s Discretionary Fund). This includes a $5 million boost goes to the recently reactivated Lottery Community Facilities Fund for 2007-08 bringing the total available for capital works to $13 million.

An additional one-off extra allocation of $4.5 million has been made to the Lottery Outdoor Safety Committee. Further one-off funding totalling $3.88 million is to be allocated to Lottery Health Research, Auckland Community and Wellington/Wairarapa Community Committees.
