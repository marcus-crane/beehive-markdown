Foreign Minister Winston Peters will lead a delegation of MPs, business people, NGOs, officials and media on a week-long visit to Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, and Samoa from Sunday.

"Strengthening New Zealand's relationship with Pacific nations is a priority for this government, and taking such a diverse delegation around the region is a valuable way of developing the personal networks that can add real substance to the partnerships we are trying to foster in the Pacific," Mr Peters said.

"The delegation includes a strong number of MPs, reflecting the growing interest here in building ties with other Pacific parliamentarians, and the sizeable number of business people reaffirms the importance of Pacific trade for the private sector.

"Equally, the Pacific is the main focus of many of our NGOs, who alongside the government's development agency, NZAID, make substantial contributions in areas such as education, health, governance, law and justice, economic growth, as well as disaster relief," Mr Peters said.

In the Solomons, Mr Peters will meet Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, before being briefed by senior officials of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), and Honiara-based New Zealand defence and police personnel serving in RAMSI.

In the Marshall Islands, the Minister will meet with President Kessai Note and Foreign Minister Gerald Zackios, while in Samoa he will meet Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, and Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telefoni Retzlaff.
