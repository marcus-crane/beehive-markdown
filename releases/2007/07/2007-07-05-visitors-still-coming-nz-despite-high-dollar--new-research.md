The strength of the Kiwi dollar is having a slight influence on the number of visitors to New Zealand, new research released today by Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor shows.

A key finding of the research, undertaken for the Tourism Ministry by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), is that in the long term, the exchange rate is not a determinant of tourism growth.

"Even in a high exchange rate environment, visitor numbers perform very well, particularly from our largest markets, Australia and the United Kingdom," Mr O'Connor said.

"While many of our export industries are feeling the heat from the rising dollar, this finding is heartening at least for one of our top income earners.

"The finding supports the view that many people who choose to come to New Zealand are prepared to pay extra for the quality experience they expect and receive when they get here. The high dollar also has some direct benefit in that our marketing dollars overseas go further."

The research finds that: '… changes in the exchange rate have very little influence on visitor arrivals. A 1 per cent increase in the value of the New Zealand dollar is estimated to reduce the number of visitors by 0.02 per cent.'

"According to the report, the main reason why tourism is not buffeted about quite so much as other export industries is that underlying trend growth in visitor numbers and average expenditure is very strong," Mr O'Connor said

The report says the most important factor is income growth in overseas markets. It says that a 1 per cent growth in world incomes typically drives growth in tourism numbers by 1.7 per cent.

The research does show however that a high dollar has an impact on visitor spending and domestic tourism. Clearly this study provides tourism leaders with much food for thought as we move forward, Mr O'Connor said.
