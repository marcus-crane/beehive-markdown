Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker is visiting Northland with Far North Mayor Yvonne Sharpe today.

“I want to ensure that people who need assistance or care are receiving it and that people are safe. I want to get an on the ground assessment of the effect of the weather on the area which I will report back to Cabinet on Monday,” said Rick Barker.

Rick Barker today urged anyone caught up in a civil defence emergency, such as last week's Taranaki tornadoes and the extreme weather currently lashing the north of the North Island, to make use of the assistance available.

“Local communities hare demonstrating great resilience in rallying around and supporting those in need. I’m concerned however that some are reluctant to access the support available. For instance I was in Oakura on Friday and heard the story of an 80 year old woman who lived alone, telling rescuers she was fine and that there are people in far greater need than she.

“I want to make it clear that in civil defence emergencies the Government will meet the welfare costs of people who need accommodation and care immediately after an event.

“A Government helpline Line (0800 779 997) has been activated for those needing assistance and I encourage people who need welfare assistance such as temporary accommodation or basic supplies to get in touch.

"In the coming weeks, assessments will need to be undertaken in both Taranaki and the upper North Island as to the extent of damage to infrastructure and public services in order that Government can consider the contribution it needs to make. At the moment welfare, not money, is the priority.

“The recent civil defence emergencies are a timely reminder for people to take the necessary steps to be prepared. New Zealand is prone to extreme weather and natural events and people need to be prepared by having food, water, back up power radios and material to keep sheltered and warm, keeping their insurances up to date and having a plan in place,” said Rick Barker.
