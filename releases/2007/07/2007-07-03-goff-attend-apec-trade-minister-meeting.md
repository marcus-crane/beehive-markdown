Trade Minister Phil Goff leaves tomorrow for the APEC Trade Ministers' Meeting in Cairns, Australia from 4 to 6 July.

“The agenda for the APEC meeting in Australia is wide-ranging but Trade Ministers will want to give serious consideration to the WTO Doha Round following the breakdown of recent talks in Potsdam between the G4,” Mr Goff said.

“The failure to reach an understanding in Potsdam was a real setback. But my sense is that WTO members want to keep working for a deal. APEC economies collectively account for close to half of world trade and have a strong interest in having solid global trade rules and continued trade reform. I therefore expect a very focussed discussion in Cairns on what we can do as a group to move the Doha process forward.

“APEC’s agenda also has a very solid focus on regional developments. We are due to report to Leaders in September on ways to further promote economic integration in the Asia-Pacific, including the possibility of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. While this is not something which is going to happen overnight, it is a concept I would like to see move forward through further policy development and dialogue.

"We will also be discussing how APEC can intensify its work programme in important areas such as structural reform, trade facilitation and model FTA chapters.

"A key issue for discussion by Leaders later in the year will be climate change, clean development and energy security. APEC Trade Ministers will discuss the trade aspects of this agenda," Mr Goff said.

APEC member economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.

The G4 comprises the United States, EC, India and Brazil.
