New Zealand welcomes the news that North Korea has sealed its Yongbyon nuclear reactor facility, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“This is an important stage in the process of securing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula," Mr Peters said.

"All the countries involved in the Six Party Talks (North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, and Japan) are to be congratulated for adhering to the commitments they negotiated.

“It is pleasing that North Korea has admitted International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors once again, and we hope all participants of the Six Nations Talks will continue to work rapidly towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.

"Important steps have been taken in recent days, but much remains to be done, and we encourage all parties to continue that work with dedication and patience.

“New Zealand is watching progress closely, and we remain fully supportive of the Six Party Talks process. The development of our own relations with North Korea is dependent on further progress being made."

Mr Peters said the shutdown of the Yongbyon reactor and the readmission of IAEA inspectors were part of the initial actions agreement reached by Six Party Talks countries in February.

South Korea has begun shipping heavy fuel oil to North Korea as part of the deal, and this assistance should make it possible for further progress to be made over coming months, he said.
