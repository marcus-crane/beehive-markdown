Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today he would not comment on the offer by Dubai Aerospace Enterprise for Auckland International Airport.

“As shareholding Minister in Air New Zealand I have an obvious conflict of interest,” said Dr Cullen.

“I am therefore delegating my decision-making powers under the Overseas Investment Act 2005 to Associate Finance Minister Trevor Mallard.”

The Minister will be making no further comment.
