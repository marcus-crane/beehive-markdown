Investing in major events offshore and at home is an important part of New Zealand's economic development and tourism strategies, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr O'Connor said that despite Team New Zealand losing out in the America's Cup overnight, the worldwide television exposure this country has gained from the event has been massive – estimated by some to be as much as 100 million.

"A huge television audience has seen New Zealand at its best – a team of highly talented and professional people utilising state-of-the-art technology and innovation to compete with the best and best-resourced in the world.

"It makes good sense to invest in major events such as challenging for the America's Cup and the hosting of the Rugby World Cup in 2011 because they have a real impact on the New Zealand economy.

"With the tourism benefits of Lord of The Rings starting to tail off, New Zealand must remain on the radar globally. By demonstrating to the rest of the world that we have the resources and infrastructure to host and challenge for premier events we back up the promises given by our highly successful 100% Pure campaign. When visitors come to New Zealand they should and do expect the best.

"I sincerely hope the tourism industry supports the government's view that the America's Cup team should continue, that it should be based in New Zealand and that Auckland should host an America's Cup regatta again. Cabinet's decision to make $10 million available to contract vital team members while negotiations occur around details of commercial sponsorship is a very sensible one."
