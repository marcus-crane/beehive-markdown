Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker is inviting New Zealanders to have a say in how we achieve a resilient New Zealand by making submissions on the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Strategy.

The strategy lists the high-level goals and objectives of the civil defence sector and is being released today for an eight-week period of public consultation.

“This is a strategy for all New Zealanders because it’s everyone’s responsibility to understand and manage the hazards we face,” Rick Barker said.

“The key message of the Labour-led Government’s ‘Get Ready Get Thru’ campaign is that we all need to be aware of the hazards we face in this country and be prepared to manage by ourselves for up to three days in the event of an emergency.

“The strategy itself is a key element in how we ‘get ready’ and how we ‘get thru’ and has been developed by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management in cooperation with the civil defence sector.

“Everyone has an opportunity to take a look at the draft strategy and voice their expectations of civil defence in New Zealand and the process for realising those expectations,” said Rick Barker.

The Final date for submissions to be received is Friday 21 September 2007.

The draft strategy and information about making a submission are available at: [www.civildefence.govt.nz](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz)
