Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the release of a new guide for people interested in becoming "angel investors" in early stage and high potential kiwi businesses.

Trevor Mallard said the "Business of Angel Investing Guide" developed by the government's New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF Limited), would serve as a resource for people interested in investing in businesses and who wanted to learn the basics.

An angel investor is an individual who provides capital and often expertise to early stage businesses. Angels typically invest their own capital, however a small but increasing number of angel investors are forming angel networks to share research and pool their investment capital.

In addition to funds, angel investors can often provide valuable management advice and access to important contacts and markets.

"I am very pleased to support the guide, as angel investing is an important component in the work that is going on to transform New Zealand into a high wage, high value, innovative and export-led economy.

"The Labour-led government has recognised the importance of supporting very early stage businesses and that's why we have a government $160 million venture capital programme. Venture capital plays a key role in the innovation process, especially in commercialising research and development, lifting exports, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity.

"Angel investments in promising New Zealand businesses represent the seeds of our economic future. In many ways, angel investors epitomise the kiwi spirit of having a go, achieving success, and passing hard-won wisdom and experience onto the next generation.

"Many businesses which have the potential to become globally successful need the help and support of an "angel" in the early stages," Trevor Mallard said.

The guide, developed by NZVIF with the assistance of experienced angels already active in the New Zealand market, is designed to help potential angels find their way into the market.

The guide was developed as part of the NZVIF Seed Co-Investment Programme, a $40 million government funded investment programme aimed at small to medium sized businesses with strong potential for high growth. It provides  
Crown capital to support the further development of an early-stage investment market by matching private capital invested in the early seed and start-up stages of a business."  
The key objectives of the Seed Co-Investment Fund are to encourage and enhance the development of angel investor networks, stimulate investment into innovative start-up companies, and increase capacity in the market for matching experienced angel investors with new, innovative start-up companies.

**Angel Investing Guide Q & A**

**What is an angel investor?**  
An angel investor is an individual who provides capital and, often, expertise to early stage businesses which can't source traditional sources of business funding. Angels typically invest their own capital, however a small but increasing number of angel investors are forming angel networks to share research and pool their investment capital. In addition to funds, angel investors can often provide valuable management advice. mentoring and access to important contacts and markets.

**What are the returns on angel investments?**  
Angel investors are exposed to high risks and expect that some investments will fail. A few investments may result in a return of five to ten times the original investment over a 5-10 year period. Investors typically invest in a portfolio of prospective firms in the hope that 10-20 per cent of the investments will be significantly successful. Each investment will have a defined exit strategy, such as plans for an initial public offering or a trade sale of the business.

**Is there a large angel investing market in New Zealand?**  
The angel market in New Zealand has long been predominantly informal. Over the last two to three years it has become increasingly vibrant with the launch of several angel networks modelled on similar organisations offshore, especially the West Coast of the United States. The Seed Co-investment Fund has been a catalyst for the formation of formal angel networks and evolving practice standards - the Angel Investing Guide is an example.

**What sort of businesses are suitable for angel investing?**  
New Zealand is producing world class intellectual property in a number of areas such as ICT, life science and niche manufacturing. This world-class IP is behind the creation of a significant number of early stage companies that need angel involvement to succeed. Angel investors are enabling these companies to grow in scale and to become an increasingly strong and positive force for New Zealand's economic growth. Angel investors usually seek businesses with innovative products or solutions that have international market potential. Management capability is another key factor and founders often need to bring in experienced executives to take the business to the next level.
