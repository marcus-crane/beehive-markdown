Health Minister Pete Hodgson has welcomed news New Zealand's free breastscreening programme, BreastScreen Aotearoa, has resumed advertising after a three-year break.

A previous advertising campaign stopped in April 2004 when an extension of the successful programme - from 50-64 years to 45-69 years – meant almost twice as many women became eligible for free screening.

From 1 January 2005 to the end of December 2006, a total of 309,899 women in those age groups were screened, an almost 40 percent increase over the same period two years before.

Facilities and workforce pressures meant advertising stopped for a time but with and additional two new providers in Auckland and additional three mobile screening vans – bringing the total number covering the country to 11 - Pete Hodgson is urging women to take advantage of this vitally important service.

“Quite simply, screening saves lives and with another advertising campaign now underway I urge women to make sure they get their regular checks,” Pete Hodgson says.

Other initiatives to ensure as many women as possible get regular breast screening include:

- Service agreements that fund the transport of Mâori and Pacific women to screening sites
- Increasing the flexibility of screening hours available so that screening can occur at times that better suit Mâori and Pacific women - i.e. Saturday afternoons and after hours
- Making the BSA 0800 number free to cellphones
- Piloting new ways of working with GPs to increase referrals to the service
- A national and international recruitment scheme for Medical Radiation Technologists (MRTs) and Radiologists
- Building of three new purpose built breast screening facilities: BreastScreen
- Coast to Coast at Midcentral DHB, BreastScreen Central at Hutt Valley DHB, and BreastScreen HealthCare at Otago DHB
