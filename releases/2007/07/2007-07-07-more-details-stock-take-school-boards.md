Education Minister Steve Maharey has today revealed more details of the current stock take of the role of Boards of Trustees in New Zealand schools in a speech to the New Zealand School Trustees Association Annual Conference in Wellington.

"The Ministry of Education is currently carrying out a stock take, to find out how school governance can be better supported to improve students' achievement and keep students learning at school for longer.

"We know from NZCER research* that 93 per cent of secondary school boards have a good or very good relationship with principals, and 85-90 per cent are working well and providing effective management.

"However, this research also highlighted that some boards lack expertise in areas such as the law, or strategic planning, and many feel they have too many responsibilities.

"The Ministry of Education stock take will find out more about how boards of trustees work, what they do well, and how the government can help them function better, particularly helping them to access effective training, development and expert advice and support."

Mr Maharey says it is essential that trustees commit to ongoing professional development during their term of office, "If the boards need extra support, I am confident we will be able to help them.

"The school board system is one of the great strengths of our education system, and this stock take aims to further improve that system.

"Boards of trustees play a crucial role in providing the strategic direction for our schools and their work should support the best educational opportunities for every child in their school."
