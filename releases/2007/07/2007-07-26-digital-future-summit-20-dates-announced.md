Minister of Communications and Information Technology David Cunliffe has announced the dates of the Digital Future Summit 2.0, a key step towards defining New Zealand's digital future.

The [Digital Future Summit 2.0](http://www.digitalsummit.org.nz/) on 28-29 November will explore how this country can maximise "being digital'' to address the challenges of becoming a high-tech, high-value, creative economy and society.

Chief executives, and senior business and community leaders are urged to engage with this 'call to action,' which will result in a refreshed Digital Strategy for 2008 and beyond.

"The event will be an important step in driving forward New Zealand's digital strategy," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Individuals and businesses concerned about broadband speed and access, high-tech business growth, and the social and sustainability issues that technology brings, should all seize this opportunity to contribute to planning for a digital future.

"A range of senior ministers will attend and contribute, and a high level of participation is anticipated from individuals, businesses, and community groups.''

The Digital Future Summit 2.0 will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Auckland, 28-29 November 2007.
