Immigration Minister David Cunliffe has described an attack on the integrity of the Accredited Employer Scheme as 'derisory'.

Answering the National Party's Immigration spokesman's accusation of undue union involvement in the scheme, Mr Cunliffe said:

"There is no union veto over the scheme. The immigration service runs it, not the unions.

"In the last year the approval rate for employer accreditation applicants has been 98.3 per cent. If National's vacuous accusations had any substance that would imply the unions were doing a pretty lousy job.

"In fact the Department has a timely record in this area. The average time to process an application to become an accredited employer is 31 days. Once an employer has become accredited processing times for individual migrant work applications for the period 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 took on average ten days.

"The department's performance has been professional and Mr Lockwood Smith would do well to look into the facts before disparaging that performance.

"If this derisory effort is the best the opposition can do, then it must be a very quiet news day."
