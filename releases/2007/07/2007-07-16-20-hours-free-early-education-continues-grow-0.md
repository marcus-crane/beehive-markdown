The number of children and services offering 20 Hours Free Early Childhood Education is still growing with official figures showing 72 per cent of eligible children are now in, says Education Minister Steve Maharey and Mâori Affairs Minister, Parekura Horomia.

The latest Ministry of Education figures show 1678 more three and four year olds are now enrolled for the free hours, bringing the total to 66,825 – that's up 2 per cent from the 70 per cent rate on day one, just two weeks ago.

73 more early childhood education providers have decided to offer the 20 hours free policy, with 64 per cent of eligible services now on board – up from 62 per cent.

Steve Maharey and Parekura Horomia today visited the Clyde Quay Kindergarten in Wellington, to mark the first day of their new term and the first day that kindergartens are delivering 20 Hours Free ECE.

Steve Maharey said 99 per cent of kindergartens are offering this visionary policy, and today is the historic day that parents using kindergarten can benefit from their free hours for the first time.

"The Labour-led government firmly believes that cost should not stand in the way of providing access to early childhood education, and the unique thing about this policy is that it's available to all parents, regardless of their income, or whether they work outside the home."

Parekura Horomia said up to 19,000 Mâori three and four year olds are in eligible early childhood education providers. 40 per cent of them are in kindergarten and 33 per cent are in education and care centres – many of these three and four year olds will benefit from 20 Hours Free ECE.

"26 per cent of Mâori children aged three and four also attend kôhanga reo, and I expect a significant number of eligible kôhanga to come on board shortly. This policy is great news for Mâori parents, our whânau will benefit significantly from it.

‘’Te Kôhanga Reo National Trust is currently working through the administration of the scheme with kôhanga and expect at least half of the nearly 500 kôhanga to become eligible and begin offering Free ECE around September.”

"Up to 1240 children are also benefiting from 20 Hours Free ECE at 64 of the 94 eligible Pasifika services across the country."

Steve Maharey said more early education providers are continually applying to offer the policy, so the take up figure will continue to rise and more New Zealand families will benefit.

"Tens of thousands of families are now saving money every week because of this Labour-led government policy. 20 Hours Free ECE is the most significant expansion of the education system since the roll out of free secondary education by the First Labour Government in the 1930s."
