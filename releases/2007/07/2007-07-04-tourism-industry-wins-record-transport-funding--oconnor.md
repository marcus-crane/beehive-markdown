Tourism businesses are among the big winners from the Government's record transport spending this year, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Land Transport New Zealand has announced a record $2.4 billion of spending for land transport infrastructure and services in this year's National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), a four per cent increase from last year.

Mr O'Connor said the record level of funding is being allocated for a range of projects that will improve the country’s roads and passenger transport services.

"The funding balances the need to lift investment in public transport, as part our commitment to protecting the environment, with improving the quality and safety of routes to out-of-the-way places, where many of our spectacular tourist attractions are located.

"Regions which benefit include Northland, the East Coast, the Bay of Plenty and large parts of the South Island, all of which have economies that rely heavily on visitors.

"Northland region's roads and state highways get $108 million for new projects and to continue construction of the Kerikeri heritage bypass, and extending road seal on SH 1 from Waitiki Landing to Cape Reinga.

"The Bay of Plenty gets $161 million, including $95 million for state highway improvements and $51 million for maintenance of state highways and local roads to go towards reducing tourist traffic congestion."

More than $95 million is allocated for investment in Gisborne and Hawkes Bay's land transport network, including $55.7 million for maintaining state highways and local roads, an increase of $1.4 million over 2006/07. Projects include widening and sealing of most major access routes to forests in the region.

South Island land transport networks receive $308 million. This includes $40 million for Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman, $118 million for Canterbury, and $117 for Otago and Southland.
