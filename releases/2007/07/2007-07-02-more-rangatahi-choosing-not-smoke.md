"Even more rangatahi are making positive health choices and are choosing not to smoke," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta following figures just released which found that teen smoking rates have halved in the last 8 years.

Figures released by ASH New Zealand show that teen smoking rates have dropped from 28.6% in 1999 to 14.2% last year.

"As Minister of Youth Affairs it's great to see that less than half of all Year 10 students have had a puff of a cigarette," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The survey found the rate of rangatahi who have never smoked has increased from 31.6% in 1999 to 538% in 2006.

"More young people are starting to realise that they can make small changes to improve their lives. Each step towards a positive healthy lifestyle is a step forward.

"We know that more than 5000 New Zealanders still die from smoking-related illnesses each year – but the choice is in the hands of every smoker," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"Sometimes young people start smoking because of peer pressure and they believe it's a ‘cool' thing to do. Others live in a household with adults who smoke. Tobacco is a very clever drug and before you know it, you are hooked."

"The recent tobacco-use survey found that the majority of youth smokers would not smoke if they had their lives over again.

"Young people who want help, support or advice to stop smoking should call their local Quitline (0800 778 778) where they will receive support and information about a cessation programme – that's a great first step."

“I want to encourage all young people to make positive choices in their lives," says Nanaia Mahuta.
