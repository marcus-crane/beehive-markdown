The Pasifika community and the government can be congratulated on their progress towards raising educational participation and achievement for Pasifika students,  
Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Releasing the first monitoring report under the Pasifika Education Plan, Mr Maharey said the report showed that Pasifika education is heading in the right direction to achieve most targets.

“The Pasifika Education Plan Monitoring Report 2006 helps the Ministry of Education know where it’s doing well, and as importantly where it could do better. It enables the Ministry to accelerate its efforts in areas that matter most,” he said.

“We’re going to keep working with Pasifika communities to lower the suspension rate, meet teacher registration targets in Pasifika early childhood education, and lift participation in Modern Apprenticeships and Level 4 industry training.

“Our regional offices have been working hard to address these issues over the last twelve months, and that’s clearly bringing results,” Mr Maharey said.

“The number of Pasifika children in early childhood education, the percentage of Pasifika children leaving school with NCEA Level Two, and the number of Pasifika people in tertiary education and modern apprenticeships are all growing faster than for any other group.

“At the same time, the number of Pasifika children leaving school with no qualifications is shrinking faster than for any other group,” he said.

“Our work ahead will continue these improvements. Raising achievement is the top priority in Pasifika education, and I expect to see measurable gains over the life of the Plan and beyond.

“Meeting our goals and targets for Pasifika Education is not a maybe; it’s a must-do,” Mr Maharey said.

The next Pasifika Education Monitoring Report will be released in February 2008. It will capture evaluation data and bring reporting into line with a regular February release date.
