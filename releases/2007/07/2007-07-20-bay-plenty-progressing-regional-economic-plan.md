Good progress is being made in the Bay of Plenty region in response to the new regional economic development policy aimed at encouraging large scale regional commercial projects and the growth of more internationally competitive firms, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said in Tauranga today.

"The regional economic development policy changes that I announced in April are aimed at helping regions to drive their own economic growth and to make strong contributions to the national economy and New Zealand’s efforts in the global marketplace.

"One of the key changes for the Bay results from the consolidation of the current 26 regions down to about 14 in order to achieve better scale. This change will see the merger of Western Bay of Plenty, Eastern Bay of Plenty and Rotorua regions into one large region," Trevor Mallard said.

"By having one big region, it will be more capable of collaborating and tackling large economic development projects and working to attract and develop exporting firms that are of scale and internationally competitive. This policy is an important part of the Labour-led government's work to lift our living standards by building a strong, high wage, export-led and innovative economy.

"A wider regional approach will also be better placed to focus on providing strategic leadership on broader economic issues that cut across all the localities within the Bay of Plenty, while still allowing the excellent work happening at the local level to continue.

"It is very encouraging to see that the Bay of Plenty already has a strong focus on business and industry and to see local government and the region’s economic development agencies working together.

"For example I understand an economic profile of the Bay of Plenty region has been prepared as a base from which to build collaboration and to start identifying areas of common interest. That shows great progress towards getting agreement on a regional governance structure for economic development, and is very encouraging," Trevor Mallard said.

The Bay of Plenty region is one of the most diverse in New Zealand, covering a significant geographical area and is a key part of the New Zealand economy. The economy has been growing steadily, however with its wide variances in social and economic status; the Bay of Plenty faces some real growth challenges. For example, the region is more dependent on agriculture and primary processing than many other regions in New Zealand.

To assist the Bay of Plenty regions to consolidate, a one-off payment of up to $50,000 (GST exclusive) per existing region can be applied for to meet specific costs associated with consolidation. Therefore, the Eastern Bay of Plenty, Western Bay of Plenty and Rotorua can access up to a maximum of $50,000 each, or a total of $150,000, to assist with the consolidation process.

- Under the new policy, the Major Regional Initiatives Fund is replaced with a contestable Enterprising Partnerships Fund focusing on substantial regional projects that are commercially driven, generate substantial economic benefits for the region and align with national economic transformation goals. Funding under this programme will be approximately $9 million in 2007-08, $10.5 million in each of the following two years and $11.5 million a year after that.
- A new Regional Strategy Fund will give each of the 14 regions access to a maximum of $750,000 over three years to develop and implement regional economic development strategies. The aim is to encourage a medium-long term view so that regions focus on key projects for growth rather than less important, short term activities.
