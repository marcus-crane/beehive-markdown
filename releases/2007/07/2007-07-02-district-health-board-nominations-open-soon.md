Health Minister Pete Hodgson is urging anyone interested in standing for this year’s District Health Board elections to start thinking about it now.

Nominations for the October DHB elections open in less than a month, on Friday 27 July, and are being held by postal vote at the same time as local government elections.

The Minister would like to see the boards include people from a wide variety of backgrounds with a range of skills so that a strong community voice continues to be heard in DHB decision making.

The 2007 DHB elections will be the second to be conducted under the Single Transferable Voting (STV) system. This means that every voter living in a district will be able to express a preference for every candidate who stands for a board.

“It’s important the public understands it’s their health service and their community so they should ensure they have their say in the decision making process,” Pete Hodgson says.

Candidates should also carefully consider potential conflicts of interest before putting their name forward.

“If candidates are in any doubt as to whether you have conflicts of interest, they should seek appropriate guidance,” Pete Hodgson says.

Information on conflicts of interest is included in the Ministry of Health’s candidate information handbook.

The handbook, along with other election information, is available on the Ministry’s website – [www.moh.govt.nz/dhbelections](http://www.moh.govt.nz/dhbelections) [– or from DHBs.]()

Nominations for candidates for the 2007 DHB elections open on Friday 27 July and close at midday on Friday 24 August.
