Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker today presented an updated version of What’s the Plan Stan? to pupils at Lucknow School in Havelock North.

Rick Barker said that today’s launch of the updated What’s the Plan Stan? resource forms part of the Labour-led Governments goal of increasing public awareness and preparedness for the hazards we face.

"As the past few weeks have highlighted, New Zealand is constantly exposed to the risk of disaster,” said Rick Barker.

"What’s the Plan Stan? was launched in April last year and uses role-playing, quizzes, an inter-active CDROM, stories and colourful cartoons to deliver messages about how to prepare for and survive disasters.

“Teachers have been tremendously enthusiastic about What’s the Plan Stan? Based on teacher feedback, I’m pleased to be delivering the first of the ongoing updates for this great resource designed for eight to 12 year-olds.

“In response to requests from teachers we’ve also added a story book and audio CD suitable for children aged five to eight. The stories are about how the dog Stan and his friends cope with earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, floods and storms. Each story is followed by a checklist of what to do before, during and after a disaster.

“As well as the new stories, there’s an updated map, the latest disaster pictures, a video of school earthquake drills, links to games and quizzes.

“Today’s kids are smart. The 10 year-old English girl Tilly Smith saved many lives during the Boxing Day tsunami, because she’d learned in a geography class the first signs of a tsunami.

“What’s the Plan Stan? will not only give our kids the knowledge that will help them all their lives, but I hope they will take the messages they learn in class back home with them and make their parents and families aware of the need to be prepared in the event of a disaster.

“Every primary and intermediate school has been sent the updates which can be loaded on the school intranet. This is a resource that will always be on the mark and that will help build confidence in kids and their families,” Rick Barker said.
