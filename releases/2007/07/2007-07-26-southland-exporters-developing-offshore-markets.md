Southland firms are proof that distance does not need to be a barrier to developing long-term business relationships in international markets, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said today during a visit to two successful Invercargill exporters.

"Improved export performance is critical to New Zealand's future prosperity so it is great to see innovative Southland firms embracing the opportunities that exporting offers companies to grow.

"Obviously this growth does not just benefit the businesses exporting. Businesses supplying the exporters, the people employed by those businesses and the wider community of Southland all benefit from our exporters' success in the global economy," Trevor Mallard said.

During his visit to boat building company Stabi-Craft Marine and heater manufacturer Yunca Heating, Trevor Mallard noted their strong focus on design and product development, which made their products attractive to overseas buyers looking for quality.

"Both companies have also worked hard to cultivate relationships overseas and are not afraid to ‘think global’ - in terms of customers, competitors and ways of doing business. This approach is essential if New Zealand companies want to succeed internationally.

"The Labour-led government is supporting this approach through Export Year which is aimed at building our exporters capabilities, aspirations and the foundations for long-term export growth, and also through the economic transformation agenda which is all about government working with business to transform New Zealand into an export-led economy that is high wage, high value and innovative."

Stabi-Craft and Yunca recognised the value of working in partnership with organisations like government economic development agency New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) to make the most of international growth opportunities. Both companies have received government assistance through NZTE, including funding from the Market Development Assistance Scheme.

Yunca Heating was awarded a $100,000 market development assistance grant in 2006 and Stabi-Craft Marine was awarded a $100,000 market development assistance grant this year.  
"Budget 2007 increased the amount of funding for this scheme to more than $50 million annually because it is an effective way of giving our exporters the right assistance they need to develop opportunities overseas.

"I urge businesses looking to crack new markets overseas to consider using this scheme and also other services offered by NZTE to help them," Trevor Mallard said.
