Academic performance and qualifications of Maori school-leavers show improvement, according to two new government reports, and Associate Minister of Education Parekura Horomia is calling for a "redoubling" of efforts to boost the trend.

The reports, 2006 School Leavers Statistics and Senior Secondary Student Achievement Fact Sheet 2004-2006, which have been released by Education Minister Steve Maharey today, summarise key statistics on 2006 school leavers, and achievement by senior students in NCEA 2004-2006.

"I am delighted to see that our Maori youth show improved performance academically and in the qualifications they gain prior to leaving school. They are staying at school longer, and the results are significant," said Mr Horomia.

"However, the margin between Maori students and their European/Pakeha counterparts remains the same. There is improvement on all fronts, but the discrepancy is still there."

The report shows that Maori school leavers are under-represented in the group that has UE or a Level 3 qualification or higher, but have shown a similar level of improvement to the other ethnic groups. Fifteen per cent of Maori leavers were at this level (compared to 36 per cent of total school leavers). For Maori this is an increase of three per cent from 2005

Maori school leavers with little or no formal attainment have decreased to 22 per cent, a three per cent improvement from 2005. The proportion of Maori school leavers who left without reaching a Level 1 qualification dropped from 49 per cent in 2005 to 44 per cent in 2006.

Forty-six per cent of Maori boys left without reaching a Level 1 qualification, down from 53 per cent in 2005 - continuing a trend of improvement. Forty two per cent of Maori girls left without reaching this qualification, down from 45 per cent in 2005.

Mr Horomia said that the continuing margins between Maori and European/Pakeha students call for an increase of effort.

"I think this report says of those who have an influence on Maori achievement: 'Must try harder'. We need to redouble efforts to boost Maori achievement and reduce the margin."

Mr Horomia said the onus wasn't just on the education system. "I've seen tremendous success in individual schools. Alfriston College for example has reduced absenteeism among Maori, and Porirua College has reduced the percentage of students who leave with no formal qualifications to well below the decile average."

Iwi, hapu and whanau also had a critical role to play, he said.

"With the support of boards of trustees, teachers, parents and our Maori communities, I am confident that schools can improve on the promising results of this latest report."
