Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton’s desire to see no-one under 20 years of age on the unemployment benefit has been almost achieved, he said today.

Mr Anderton said that in July 2000, he advocated that instead of the dole, everyone under 20 who didn’t have fulltime work should be offered a place in free-of-charge education or vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.

“Back then, I said that governments had tolerated youth unemployment for far too long. Successive governments had allowed the catastrophe of youth unemployment to ravage a generation. I called on New Zealand as a nation to do something about it. I believed it was an achievable vision to eliminate youth unemployment.

“Today, I am delighted to celebrate the achievements of the Labour-Progressive Government in this area: at the end of June this year, only 990 people aged 18 and 19 are receiving the unemployment benefit. It’s a wonderful turnaround.”

The number of 18 and 19 year-olds receiving the unemployment benefit in 1999 was 17,514 and has fallen to just 990 this month.

Mr Anderton attributed a lot of that to the policies of the Labour-Progressive Government which had re-introduced trade training and apprenticeships and had boosted the economy and job numbers.
