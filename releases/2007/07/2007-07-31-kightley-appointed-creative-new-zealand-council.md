Acclaimed New Zealand-Samoan writer, director and actor Oscar Kightley, has been appointed to the Creative New Zealand Council, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture, and Heritage Helen Clark announced today.

Oscar Kightley’s three-year appointment begins on 1 August 2007.

“Oscar has considerable experience across theatre, film and television, and will bring valuable skills and insight of Pacific creative communities to the Council’s deliberations. I welcome his willingness to contribute to this major arts development organisation,” Helen Clark said.

Oscar Kightley replaces Peter Brunt, who has completed two terms on the Council.

Creative New Zealand works to encourage, promote and supports the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The Council is responsible for overall policy development and is the “public face” of the organisation. It guides the development of Creative New Zealand’s three-year Strategic Plan, and determines the division of funding between the two arts boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi.
