Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton paid a personal tribute to his political friend and kiwifruit pioneer Rod MacDiarmid of Kerikeri at his funeral on Saturday. Jim Anderton said Rod MacDiarmid’s death defines a generation that New Zealand is fast losing.

“Many of Rod MacDiarmid’s lifelong habits and attitudes were forged by the Great Depression, of being a part of a family that was up against hard times but knowing also that they were not alone in their deprivation but one of many afflicted by economic circumstances beyond their control,” Jim Anderton said.

“The fact that Rod was honoured by New Zealand and his brother Alan MacDiarmid received a Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2000 for the discovery and development of conductive polymers shows that no-one needs to be held back by circumstances of birth in New Zealand. I am sure Rod would agree with me when I say that this is still the case here in New Zealand.”

Rod MacDiarmid was awarded a New Zealand Order of Merit for his service to horticulture and the community. He was also honoured last year at the Centennial Gala Dinner for the Kiwifruit Industry in Mt Maunganui as a pioneer of kiwifruit growing.

“Rod MacDiarmid was very much a New Zealander of his time - quiet, understated, modest with a gentle sense of humour. He was practical but also intellectual. He embodied kiwi egalitarianism. At the same time he was enormously positive about people and encouraged high achievement. As an example, he was so proud of his granddaughter, Olympic yachtswoman, Sharon Ferris, not only because of her world-class achievements in yacht racing but also because of the fact that she was always prepared to speak to young people about setting their dreams high– and inspiring them to “go for it”,” Jim Anderton said.

“Waste was anathema to Rod – in 1989 he was a foundation member of the NewLabour Party which I led because the economic policies of both Labour and National were creating mass unemployment and running down the economy. For people like Rod this was a foolish waste of talent and potential and would cause irreparable damage for generations to come – which he was right about.

“I am enormously sad to lose such a fine friend but happy to know that Rod was very pleased by the momentous changes that have been made over the past seven years by the Labour-Progressive coalition government. He was happy to contribute to them in any way he could, by being involved, by organizing into his late eighties and also with substantial generous donations. His time and efforts have been worth it. He has made a great difference and will be remembered for his contributions across the board both to horticulture and to New Zealand,” Jim Anderton said.
