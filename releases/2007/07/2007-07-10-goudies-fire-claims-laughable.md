Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker, while welcoming National MP Sandra Goudie’s first foray into the ongoing discussion on the future of fire and rescue services, said it was disappointing she was misrepresenting the issues.

“Sandra Goudie’s claim that I am failing to consult the sector is laughable,” said Rick Barker.

“I’m not sure what Sandra Goudie’s definition of consultation is, but I would have thought releasing two discussion documents, one in 2004 and one in April this year, would count.

“Since April I have visited fire stations all over New Zealand and spoken to over 500 paid and voluntary firefighters about proposals outlined in the most recent public discussion document, New Fire Legislation: A framework for New Zealand's fire and rescue services and their funding.

“The next step is to analyse the 360 submissions we have received on the proposals, and in light of these, look to develop legislation which we will also consult on.

“Sandra Goudie fails to comprehend a fundamental point in the proposals. If councils wish, they can retain responsibility for rural brigades and there will be no change to the status quo.

“If councils choose to relinquish control to the new Fire and Rescue Service then this organisation will be tasked with ensuring that the appropriate operational arrangements are in place so that whoever arrives first at a fire, rural or urban, will have the mandate, training and equipment to respond.

“It is the cooperation and goodwill between brigades, fire authorities, and their communities which makes the existing complex structure work. I am committed to ensuring this cooperation continues as we work with the sector to build a more effective and forward looking structure.

“The proposed reforms seek to ensure certainty over coverage and better support the work firefighters do. Sandra Goudie has yet again got it wrong,” said Rick Barker.
