A new service that should help transform the efficiency of New Zealand’s court system was launched today by the Minister for Courts, Rick Barker.

“The new National Transcription Service makes greater use of digital technology in courtrooms. It will improve evidence recording and transcribing and introduces consistency in the way transcription services are managed in courts across the country, said Rick Barker.

“The new technology enables us to transcribe and record evidence differently, and means witnesses are able to speak at a normal, uninterrupted speed. As well as providing a better experience for witnesses, it will help reduce the length of trials.

“Over the next year, we are progressively providing new or updated digital audio technology called ‘For the Record’ in 82 courtrooms. While this is already used in 38 courtrooms in the District Court, for the first time it will soon be available for trials in the High Court and Maori Land Court.

“All hearings in courtrooms equipped with ‘For the Record’ will be recorded and transcribed by Court Reporters located outside the courtroom. Transcripts of the evidence will be provided back to the court “in real time” – within thirty minutes – so there is an almost immediate record of proceedings.

“Until now, all transcription has been done locally. In the future, work will be shared among a national pool of Court Reporters based at 14 court sites and two Service Centres.

“Sharing the workload means scheduling of hearings will not be disrupted by the unavailability of local transcription staff.

“When fully operational in June 2008, Court Reporters at any location will be able to transcribe a hearing from any ‘For the Record’ enabled courtroom that is connected to the National Transcription Service.

“The Wellington Service Centre has just started operating and is already providing transcription services to District Courts in Wellington. The second Service Centre is due to open in Auckland in November.

“The launch of the National Transcription Service is one part of a comprehensive and ongoing programme of improvements to the court system under the Labour-led Government. Other technological investments supporting the goal of providing first class justice services include videoconferencing and judicial decisions on-line,” said Rick Barker.
