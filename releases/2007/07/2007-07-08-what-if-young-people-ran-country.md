"Today 121 Youth MPs from around the country take over Parliament to provide a youth voice on current issues during Youth Parliament 07," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

[Youth Parliament](http://www.youthparliament.govt.nz), which is held every 3-4 years, will be officially opened by the Governor-General Anand Satyanand and the Prime Minister Helen Clark this morning.

"Youth Parliament provides an exciting opportunity for these Youth MPs to understand the parliamentary decision-making process and how they can contribute to it. It gives them the chance to express their views to politicians, government officials and the public," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"The Youth MPs' programme mirrors the way Parliament functions as closely as possible and they'll debate and vote on climate change legislation, have the opportunity to question Cabinet Ministers, and they'll sit on Select Committees to consider issues and submissions in some depth.

"Young people in New Zealand are an amazingly talented and diverse group and make up a significant proportion of our population. We need to use opportunities like this to listen to the positive voices of young people," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Minister will table the Select Committee reports in Parliament so they will be available to all MPs, and the Youth Press Gallery and other media will also report on Youth Parliament 07.

For the first time a contingent of 24 youth observers from around the Pacific will sit in on Youth Parliament to learn about New Zealand's parliamentary and democratic processes.

"Youth Parliament is an opportunity to showcase the passion and commitment of these young people who are actively involved in making their communities – and country - a better place," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"They are our future leaders and decision-makers. And maybe some of them will be back here as MPs.”
