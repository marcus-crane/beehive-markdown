The major policies of the Labour-led government which came into force yesterday will have a significant and positive impact on the education and health of our Mâori whânau, as well as help them save for their future, says Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

July 1 marked the implementation of KiwiSaver, eligibility for 20 hours free early childcare education (ECE) and the final roll-out of cheaper doctors' visits and prescriptions.

Mr Horomia said Labour's policies were designed to ensure the rising tide lifted all boats – an approach designed to improve access to public services like health and education and to lift family living standards.

Mâori have traditionally accessed general practitioners less frequently than non-Mâori and fees have been a barrier for many of our whânau, Mr Horomia said.

Yesterday marked the final roll-out of cheaper doctor's visits, which will half the cost of the visits for all those enrolled in a primary healthcare organisation, who have not yet been eligible. Most prescription costs have also dropped to $3.

More Mâori children are now in ECE than ever before – 90 per cent of all Mâori children experienced some form of ECE in 2006, up from 85 per cent in 2000.

"But we still want more of our tamariki attending as research shows it significantly improves school educational achievement," Mr Horomia said.

The majority of Mâori children (73 per cent) are in kindergarten and other early childcare centers, most of which will benefit from the new ECE funding, which will save families up to $4500 a year per child.

Twenty-seven per cent are in Kôhanga Reo and many of those will also be to access the 20 Hours Free ECE once they come on board, Mr Horomia said.

Kiwisaver will make it easier for whânau to save for their retirement, with the government matching employee contributions by $20 a week or $1040 each year.

Employers will also be required to contribute a further $20 a week.

The government is providing a $1000 kickstart for those who join up and will also provide up to $5000 in a deposit subsidy for lower-income first home buyers.

"This in itself is a good reason for young people to sign up. But the benefits of retirement savings – especially for the Mâori community which because of its disproportionately large youth population will account for an increasingly significant amount of New Zealand's working population – will also be considerable, " Mr Horomia said.
