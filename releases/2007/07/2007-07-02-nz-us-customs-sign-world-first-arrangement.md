"New Zealand has taken a major step forward towards securing our global trade with the signing of a world first arrangement between New Zealand Customs and the United States in Brussels," says Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

United States Customs and Border Protection and New Zealand Customs, represented by Chief Executive Martyn Dunne, signed the Mutual Recognition Arrangement in Belgium.

Under this arrangement, the United States recognises New Zealand exporters who have signed up to Customs voluntary Secure Exports Scheme, as 'low risk' trading partners.

"I want to congratulate NZ Customs for actively contributing to New Zealand's bilateral relationship with the US," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"The arrangement is a “world first” under the World Customs Organisation’s trade security standards framework. Currently 140 countries have signed up to this framework but only New Zealand and the United States have taken it to this level.

"This is a significant acknowledgement of the quality and integrity of New Zealand Customs supply chain security programme," says Nanaia Mahuta.

Customs developed the trade security initiative in response to overseas markets tightening their border controls following the events of 9/11.

Partners in the Secure Exports Scheme (SES), which include Fonterra, can pack and securely transport their goods without interference, from the point of pack to the point of loading for export. In return, partners benefit by facing less risk of delays from Customs intervention and inspection.

"The signing provides concrete evidence of New Zealand's commitment to assuring the security of SES partners' trade, while keeping their trade moving across international borders.

Under the arrangement, SES partners will receive cargo facilitation benefits for goods exported to the US. The benefits may include predictability in their supply chain, reduced levels of security inspection of containers, priority attention when selected for security inspection, and priority clearance at times of disruption to border operations.

The Minister says the arrangement is significant for both New Zealand and the US as it increases confidence in the low risk status of SES partners' goods prior to arrival in the US, through to international collaboration in developing border management programmes that deliver cost-effective regulatory practices at border crossings.

"This agreement also provides a launch pad for New Zealand Customs to develop similar agreements with other trading partners who have equivalent trade security standards."

"Once again New Zealand has punched above its weight in the global trade arena by signing this 'world first' arrangement with one of our largest trading partners, says Nanaia Mahuta.
