Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel has welcomed the news that 10 of the 34 companies selected in 2007 as case studies for a prestigious American MBA programme are New Zealand firms.

The [Global Access Program,](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x5344.xml) is an international field study by MBA students at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. It matches a team of students with an international technology company to develop a comprehensive business strategy that will enable the company to move to the next stage of their corporate development.

This next stage may be to launch a new product, expand internationally, locate and secure a strategic partner, or raise additional capital. In nine years the program has developed growth plans for 209 companies in 10 foreign countries.

"I am delighted that thanks to support from the government, through [New Zealand Trade and Enterprise](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/), New Zealand firms will benefit from the expertise and new ideas of the GAP teams," Lianne Dalziel said at a function hosted by New Zealand consul-general Rob Taylor in Los Angeles last night.*

"One of the things I enjoy about my job as Minister for Small Business is the opportunity to meet so many talented and energetic people who inspire others with their ideas and creativity and passion for their business," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Sometimes they share their 'secret' of turning a good idea into a commercial proposition and then taking on the world. All of those involved in GAP know that often that so-called secret is really about building capability – taking a good idea, then developing an effective strategic plan, or roadmap if you like, that guides the company in moving successfully to the next stage of its corporate growth. So I'd like to thank everyone involved in the program for the role they are playing in building Kiwi business capability."

Lianne Dalziel congratulated the New Zealand companies who have been selected for GAP.

"It is their foresight and tenacity in building their business capability and taking their ideas and products to the world that strengthens New Zealand's capacity to produce world class firms that can conquer the tyranny of distance, scale and scope."
