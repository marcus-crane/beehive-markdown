Minister for ACC Ruth Dyson, together with New Zealand First Deputy Leader Peter Brown have welcomed the release of the draft report into the Review of the way in which Physiotherapy Services are Funded and Accredited by ACC

"This review is the result of the confidence and supply agreement the Labour-led government has with New Zealand First," said Peter Brown.

"I congratulate the reviewers Bill Wilson and David Goddard for their hard work. The draft report appears rigorous, and has been well supported through the process of engagement with interested parties," said Ruth Dyson.

"I look forward to further deliberations and the final report."
