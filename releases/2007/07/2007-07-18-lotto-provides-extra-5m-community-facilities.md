Additional funding is being made available to build or improve community facilities, Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board Presiding Member Rick Barker announced today.

“There have been high levels of community interest in the Lottery Community Facilities Fund since applications opened on April 30th and I’m pleased to announce the funding available is rising from $8 million to $13 million,” said Rick Barker.

“In 2002 falling lottery profits resulted in the Lottery Community Facilities Fund being discontinued. Not only have increasing lottery profits enabled the Lottery Grants Board to reintroduce the Fund, it has allowed the funding available to increase by $5 million.

“As a result $13 million is now available in this funding round to support a wide range of community facilities projects.

“Applications close on the 27th of this month however there’s still time for community groups wanting to upgrade or build multi-purpose community facilities to apply,” said Rick Barker.

Lottery funding is generated by NZ Lotteries’ profits, which are transferred to the Lottery Grants Board and flow on to directly benefit the community.
