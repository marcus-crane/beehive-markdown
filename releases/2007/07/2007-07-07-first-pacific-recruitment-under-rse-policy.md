Pacific workers are now being recruited under the Recognised Seasonal Employer policy to meet seasonal labour needs, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

Marlborough-based contracting company Vinepower is the first company to be granted an ‘Agreement to Recruit’ by the Department of Labour, and is travelling to Tonga to recruit 20 workers.

"The Recognised Seasonal Employer policy was designed to give employers strong incentives to train and upskill Kiwis, and fully utilise what is already available, before looking for labour overseas," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Only when it has been determined that no New Zealanders are available to work, can labour be sourced from Pacific countries.

"Vinepower’s application has been checked by the Department of Labour and Ministry of Social Development to ensure no Kiwis are missing out on jobs.

"Pacific governments have already been working to smooth the way for employers wishing to recruit. Vinepower will work closely with the Tongan government - which has pre-organised work-ready groups from villages for employers to recruit from.

"Vinepower’s lead needs to be followed by the rest of the industry – who should be planning their labour needs now.

"With the RSE policy, Government has developed a framework for recruiting seasonal workers to meet industry’s needs both now and in the future.

"Government is committed to working in partnership with the horticulture and viticulture industries to find long term solutions to industry issues. The Recognised Seasonal Employer policy not only helps meet this commitment, but upholds Government’s objective for New Zealanders to have first opportunity at employment in these industries," said Mr Benson-Pope.

To date, nine New Zealand businesses have been granted Recognised Seasonal Employer status.
