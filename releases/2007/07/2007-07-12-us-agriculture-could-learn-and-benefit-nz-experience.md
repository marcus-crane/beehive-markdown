Addressing the California Farm Bureau Federation in Sacramento yesterday, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton spoke of New Zealand’s interest in developing partnerships with American farmers. ”I believe producers here potentially could benefit from access to New Zealand's agricultural skills and expertise if this market were more open to us,” he said.

The Farm Bureau is the largest farm organisation in California and has over 94,000 members in 56 counties. In the first engagement of his trade mission to the United States and Mexico, Jim Anderton outlined New Zealand’s experience of doing away with farming subsidies.

“Three decades ago we used to provide subsidies per head of livestock and we ended up with seventy million sheep. Our farmers used to follow the money − they would produce for the subsidies the government gave them, instead of following market signals and switching crops or markets when prices fell or conditions turned. We had to change and subsidies were ended.”

Jim Anderton explained how the New Zealand economy has become much more responsive. “We have to be smarter and more efficient than anyone else, because we are smaller and further away from major markets than just about anyone. We invest talent, research, innovation and knowledge into our primary sectors because that is the only way to overcome the obstacles we face in distance and size.”

“I can empathise with the worries your policy-makers have about opening up to competition. I urge you to follow our example and open your markets to our products. For one thing, that would better position US farms as you face growing competition from emerging Latin American producers.

“The mighty American economy was founded on the idea that you can build undreamt of wealth by giving consumers what they want. If you don't, someone else will come along and give it to them instead. And if they come up with something better − good luck to them. That's all New Zealand wants − what we call a 'fair go'.

“Our innovation, our natural competitive advantage and our consumer-led business practices would give you an opportunity for excellent product development,” Jim Anderton said. “The door is open for American business to access the knowledge and tools we have developed to be a leading agricultural producer. And I hope our warm relationship can grow to take full advantage of those opportunities.”
