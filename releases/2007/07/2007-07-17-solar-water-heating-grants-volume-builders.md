Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons, today launched a grants scheme to encourage builders and developers to put solar water heating on more new homes.

A $3,000 grant is being offered to volume builders, who construct more than 20 houses a year, to install a solar water heating system on a show home. In addition a $500 grant per home is available for builders who commit to install solar water heating systems on at least 20 new homes within a year

Solar water heating systems installed under the scheme must meet certain energy performance, price and installation standards.

“Volume builders who participate in the new scheme will be able to reduce the cost to new homeowners of solar water heating systems, by negotiating bulk-purchase arrangements with accredited solar water heating suppliers” Ms Fitzsimons says.

“Solar water heating is growing in appeal to homeowners, but it is the building industry that will be the determining factor in making solar water heating a mainstream option in New Zealand”

“Hot water typically accounts for around $800 of the household energy bill. A well designed and installed solar water heating system can provide between 50 and 75 percent of a household’s annual hot water needs”.

“Today's announcement is good news for the building industry, householders, and climate change” Ms Fitzsimons says.

The solar water heating programme is part of the Government’s commitment to sustainability. It results from the post-election agreement with the Green Party. The programme also includes:

- Increase demand by providing independent consumer information on solar water heating;
- Grants and loans for homeowners for one-off installations of solar water heating systems;
- Improving information and capacity issues by working with industry;
- Assisting with the costs of training solar water heater installers;
- Encouraging solar water heating systems on publicly owned buildings; and
- Providing guidelines for local authorities to reduce the cost of building consents.

### Questions and Answers

1. **What is a volume builder?**  
   For the purposes of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EECA) scheme, a volume builder is a builder or developer who constructs 20 or more new houses in a calendar year
2. **What is the eligibility criteria for the solar water heating volume build grant schemes?**
   
   The criteria include the following factors:  
   **Industry standards:**  
   To ensure industry standards around product and installation are met, the volume build grant schemes are only available for the purchase of a packaged solar water heating system from solar water heater importers or manufacturers accredited by the Solar Industries Association. The accreditation process requires that various standards are met.
   
   These systems are tested to various Australian/New Zealand standards, these are:
   
   - ASNZS 2535 or equivalent standard which relates to thermal performance testing
   - ASNZS 2712 which relates to design and construction, and
   - ASNZS4234 (Draft) which relates to system performance.
   
   **Indicative energy performance of systems:**  
   Only systems that have had their energy performance modelled, and published, are eligible for funding assistance.
   
   **Cost effectiveness threshold:**  
   The threshold is the maximum amount an installed solar water heating system may cost to be eligible to apply for government assistance. If the total cost (including installation and building consent) is above the threshold, government assistance is not available.
   
   The threshold for finance assistance is based on the energy performance of the system, the cost of electricity and other assumptions relating to cost savings over a period of 20 years. The threshold is not a recommended retail price, or a guaranteed price.
3. **What is a packaged system?**  
   A packaged system is made up of specified component parts of a solar water heating system. These are:
   
   - the cylinder/tank
   - the collector panel this can either be a flat panel or an evacuated tube
   - auxiliary components e.g. controller, pump.
   
   It will need to be installed by either an approved installer or a licensed plumber.
4. **What does a volume builder need to do to get into the schemes?**
   
   - talk to an accredited supplier and build a relationship with him.
     
     L
   - decide on the supplier and the system(s) you wish to install
   - work through with an accredited supplier how you can install the packaged solar water heater in a cost effective way. The volume builder may be able to negotiate on the price of the packaged system. This negotiation is between you and the accredited supplier.
   - purchase a packaged solar water heating system from an accredited supplier who has a published threshold for finance assistance.
5. **What is an accredited supplier?**  
   The Solar Industries Association requires that a company’s product and installation standards must comply with and meet the standards in the “Code of Practice for Manufacture and Installation of Solar Water Heating Systems in NZ”. Accreditation is therefore designed to ensure the quality of the supplier’s product and installation. It is a safeguard for the public.
