Prime Minister Helen Clark is to make official visits to Malaysia and Indonesia from 15-20 July.

“Indonesia and Malaysia are founder members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations. New Zealand is dedicated to working closely with ASEAN, including on the development of wider regional integration in the Asia Pacific region.

“During these visits, I will meet with Indonesian President Yudhoyono and Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah, both of whom visited New Zealand in 2005.

“Both are important leaders in the Islamic world. Our government is working to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue, and I expect this also to feature in our discussions.

“New Zealand is committed to strengthening governmental, trade and economic relations,and people to people links with Indonesia and Malaysia.

“Malaysia is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year, and this is also the fiftieth year of our diplomatic relations. New Zealand has played a role in helping Malaysia to overcome security threats from the 1950s and to develop peacefully,” Helen Clark said.  
“From the days of the Colombo Plan, many young Malaysians have been educated in New Zealand. Today Malaysia is among our top ten trade partners with two-way trade totalling close to $1.7 billion. Education and defence continue to be strong components of our relationship.  
“My visit to Indonesia acknowledges the importance New Zealand attaches to Indonesia’s emergence as a major democracy in Asia, and as an increasingly influential player on global foreign policy issues. New Zealand supports Indonesia’s commitment to political reform and its efforts to promote religious tolerance and inter-communal relations,” Helen Clark said.  
New Zealand’s annual development assistance to Indonesia is the largest in the region, and co-operation between our police forces is significant. Indonesia was New Zealand’s 10th most important market last year, taking more than NZ$613 million in exports.  
A business delegation reflecting New Zealand expertise in developing education, ICT, biotechnology, agricultural research and related technology will accompany the Prime Minister, on these visits.
