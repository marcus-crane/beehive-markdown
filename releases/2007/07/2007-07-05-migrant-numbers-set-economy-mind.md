The New Zealand Residence Programme for the coming year has been set in a slightly lower band to take account of the continuing strong economy, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

"The number of migrants being sought under the programme in 2007-08 has been set in the range 45,000 to 50,000," Mr Cunliffe said.

"The range for the 12 months to June 30 was 47,000 to 52,000. Current indications are that about 47,000 people will have been approved for residence during that year."

People who wish to migrate to New Zealand must apply under one of the programme's three residence streams: Skilled/Business, Family Sponsored, or International/Humanitarian.

Each stream is allocated a percentage of the total number of residence places. The Skilled/Business Stream approvals account for 60 per cent, Family Sponsored 30 per cent and International/ Humanitarian 10 per cent.

"As I have said on a number of occasions recently, with the economy strong and New Zealand competing in a global market for skilled migrants, our top priority at present is ensuring we get high quality migrants while not adding to inflationary pressures.

"At the same time, many employers continue to report skill shortages. Migrants with the appropriate skills are an important way to meet those shortages, but there are others.

"This Labour-led government is strongly committed to training New Zealanders, such as with our highly successful Modern Apprenticeships policy.

"Temporary migrants can also be used to fill immediate skill shortages. The government recognises the skill and talent contribution from temporary migrants. In conjunction with our residence programme I have directed the Department of Labour to investigate a range of initiatives to improve employer awareness of, and access to, temporary work policy.

"Immigration temporary work policy is labour market tested, to ensure available New Zealanders are employed before overseas migrants. Improving the accessibility of temporary work policy would help to address skill shortages, but still support the government’s effort in limiting inflationary pressure."
