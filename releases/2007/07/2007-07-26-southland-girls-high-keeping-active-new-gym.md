Southland Girls High School students were applauded for their commitment to encouraging healthy lifestyles by Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard today at the official opening of the school's new gymnasium.

The new facility, which adjoins the existing gymnasium, was funded by the Ministry of Education, local fundraising, and support from the current and past School Board and Parent Teacher Associations.

"Developing a facility such as this requires an enormous amount of organisation and planning. This is an achievement for which you can all be extremely proud" Trevor Mallard said.

Research indicates that in recent years there has been a decline in the number of young people being physically active, especially young women.

"Having access to top-notch facilities is essential to getting young people involved. This gymnasium is a fantastic asset to the school and wider community."

"The Labour-led government is committed to reversing the trends of decreasing physical activity by investing in physical activity co-ordinators, support programmes and resources that can be used in schools to encourage students to lead physically active lives.

"What we also need to remember is that it is not just about playing sport but about being active - that can mean walking to school instead of catching a bus, going for a bike ride or going to the pool on the weekend.

"I also challenge Southland sports clubs to get involved with schools and encourage students to continue with their sport once they have finished school, and at the same time boost their adult numbers.

"Through our recently launched Mission-On campaign, we are committed to giving young people the tools to get active and make healthy choices."

"I commend Southland Girls’ High School for their commitment to encouraging a healthier lifestyle. This has been a focus for your school over the last three years as demonstrated by the school canteen offering a wide range of healthy food alternatives. And now, with a new gymnasium, students have the opportunity to develop positive physical activity and nutrition choices."
