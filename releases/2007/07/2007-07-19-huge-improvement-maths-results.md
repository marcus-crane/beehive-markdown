The achievement of Year 6 maths students has hugely improved because of numeracy projects that focus on better teaching, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The Numeracy Development Projects (NDP) have been carried out at the majority of primary schools since 2000, and have improved maths results for all students. Secondary schools have been involved since 2005 and are also starting to show some progress.

Steve Maharey says the projects focus on new ways of teaching, for example setting out clear learning steps from basic to advanced levels, and giving teachers better assessment tools.

"This is a perfect example of personalising learning, with teachers identifying the skills and weaknesses of students, and using better teaching methods to respond to them. It's not about only helping those at the bottom end, but focusing on improving achievement across the board.

"The results of two thirds of Year 6 students are either at or above the expected level in addition and subtraction, and in multiplying and dividing, in schools that followed the projects over several years. This is a massive jump in achievement.

"There has also been a significant drop in the number of at-risk students, for example 14 per cent of Year 6 students are now at-risk of under achieving in fractions, decimals and percentages – that's a dramatic drop from 42 per cent in 2002.

"This proves that one of the most effective ways of raising numeracy is by working with teachers to improve their teaching methods. It shows that investments by the Labour-led government in teacher's professional development has been worthwhile."

During 2006, the number of secondary school students achieving only basic level maths dropped from 15-18 per cent, to about 5 per cent. Steve Maharey says this is a good sign given that secondary schools have only been using this method of teaching maths since 2005.

"Maori and Pasifika primary students show the most significant improvement, for example the achievement of Maori students in fractions, decimals and ratios shows an average improvement of about one level of achievement, and Pasifika students improved by more than one level. There are nine stages, or individual levels in the primary school maths curriculum."

The Numeracy Development Project was first set up in 2000 due to the poor maths performance of many New Zealand students in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
