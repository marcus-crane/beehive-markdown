In Washington DC today, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton walked the corridors of Capitol Hill to share New Zealand’s experience of farming successfully without subsidies.  
During the day, Jim Anderton also held bilateral talks with US Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Johanns. He signalled New Zealand’s continued desire for a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, while acknowledging the domestic political difficulties facing the Administration in furthering the trade liberalisation agenda.  
Mr Anderton discussed with the Secretary the opportunities for increased cooperation in agribusiness and in research and development, building on an already strong relationship in international trade policy. Mr Anderton noted from his visits in California that both countries faced similar problems relating to agricultural emissions, climate change, sustainability and water issues.  
Jim Anderton also met with the Under-Secretary of State, Reuben Jeffery III, who is the most senior State Department official responsible for Economic, Business and Agricultural Affairs. In a broad-ranging discussion Mr Anderton emphasised the government’s desire to strengthen relations with the United States. The Minister and Under-Secretary discussed the critical importance of completing the Doha Round of Trade talks as well as ways New Zealand and the United States can continue to work on other critical trade and security issues which face both countries.  
"The reception I have received in Washington has been very warm. However, I have been greeted with much dismay at the stalling of the Doha Round talks, which has led to a reluctance in Congress to renew trade negotiating authority for the Administration to advance both multilateral trade liberalisation and bilateral free trade agreements."  
Mr Anderton also met separately with Senator Mike Crapo, Representative Bob Goodlatte and Representative Ron Kind to advance New Zealand’s interests in the upcoming US Farm Bill.  
Earlier in the day the Minister met with President of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Bob Stallman, and with representatives from Fonterra and Meat and Wool New Zealand.  
The day ended with the Minister hosting a barbeque, along with Meat and Wool New Zealand at the New Zealand Embassy, attended by over 100 influential individuals on the Washington agricultural scene, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of refrigerated shipping from New Zealand. Jim Anderton’s speech notes for the barbeque can be viewed at http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node/30052.  
Tomorrow Jim Anderton plans to hold further meetings with the Deputy Under Secretary for Agriculture, responsible for Research, Education and Economics, Dr Merle Pierson, and with the Chair of the House Agricultural Committee, Congressman Collin Peterson.  
On Saturday Jim Anderton departs for Mexico for further agricultural trade talks.
