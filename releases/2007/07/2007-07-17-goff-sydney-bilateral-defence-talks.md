Defence Minister Phil Goff leaves for Sydney on Wednesday to attend the annual bilateral defence talks with Australia, hosted by his Australian counterpart, Dr Brendan Nelson.

"Our defence relationship with Australia is our most important. We work together closely in the Pacific and elsewhere. These talks provide a key opportunity to exchange views on security trends and mutual cooperation", Mr Goff said.

"The situations in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands will be the lead items in our discussions but we will also look at wider issues of stability within the South Pacific.

"On Timor Leste we will be discussing what needs to be done post election to ensure peace and stability is maintained which will allow us to create an exit strategy for the international force serving there.

"We will need to address issues like ensuring the Timor Leste Police and Military are able to maintain order in a disciplined way and ensuring that effective government and governance measures are in place to meet the economic and social development needs of Timor Leste.

"The RAMSI mission in the Solomon Islands has been effective in drawing the country back from becoming a failed state. The regional approach taken to working to address the problems in the Solomon's involving all 16 member states of the Pacific Island Forum has proved successful and developments there represent a marked improvement in peace and stability.

"RAMSI intervened in the Solomon Islands at the request of the Solomon Islands Government and its Parliament. The mission enjoys the overwhelming support of the people of the Solomon Islands.

"Some questions have arisen recently about the ongoing consent environment to allow RAMSI to work in the Solomon Islands and the Facilitation of International Assistance Act which empowers our police and defence force personnel and provides them with immunity for actions taken in carrying out their duties. Continuation of the Act is a matter for decision by the Solomon Islands Government.

"Other agenda items include our global defence commitments, the current situation in Afghanistan, security in Asia and trans-national security issues.

"The defence talks between Australia and New Zealand are substantive, and both reinforce the close dialogue we enjoy on security issues and contribute to the interoperability between our forces on matters of mutual concern", Mr Goff said.
