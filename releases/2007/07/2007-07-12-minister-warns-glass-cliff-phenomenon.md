Successful businesswomen who break through the 'glass ceiling' should be careful they don't find themselves teetering on the edge of another phenomenon – the 'glass cliff', Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

Speaking to senior women business leaders at a lunch hosted by executive recruitment firm [Hobson Leavy](http://www.hobsonleavy.com/index.html) in Auckland, Lianne Dalziel said the term the 'glass cliff' was coined following a UK study which found that company performance leading up to the appointment of a director differed depending on the gender of the appointee.

For companies that appointed men to their boards of directors, share price performance was relatively stable both before and after the appointment.

"However, companies that appointed a woman were more likely to have experienced consistently poor performance in the months preceding the appointment. This became known as the ‘glass cliff’ phenomenon, where women’s leadership positions are relatively risky or precarious since they are more likely to involve management of organisational units in crisis," Lianne Dalziel said.

The report released in March this year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, looked at why some British companies apparently seemed to experience poorer performance following the appointment of women to their boards.

"International trends have showed that, in general, companies with women on boards tend to perform better. And it makes sense – if everyone sitting around the boardroom table has the same background, then they are not going to see the full range of risks and opportunities for their company. Diversity is good for boards," Lianne Dalziel said.

But the UK [study](http://www.cipd.co.uk/subjects/dvsequl/sexdisc/_wmnbrdrmtp.htm?IsSrchRes=1) showed that when provided with details of two equally qualified candidates for a leadership position – one a man and one a woman – respondents overwhelmingly favour the female candidate if the opening is described as difficult and involving a high risk of failure because interviewees believed that women possess particular abilities that are especially valuable in times of crisis.

"But I suspect the respondents are not being entirely upfront, because I think they think that women have less to lose," Lianne Dalziel said.

"While a directorship is a challenging step and a great opportunity, it is critical to ensure that the position is the opportunity it is made out to be."
