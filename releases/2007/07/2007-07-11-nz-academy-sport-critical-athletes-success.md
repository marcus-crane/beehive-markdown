The work the New Zealand Academy of Sport (NZAS) - North Island does goes a long way to helping our elite athletes make their way to the top Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said at the official launch of the NZAS - North Island's new Wellington office.

The NZAS operates as Sport and Recreation New Zealand’s (SPARC’s) high performance network throughout the country, providing specialist services to elite athletes and coaches.

NZAS-North Island currently operates from an Auckland base, and their new Wellington office, located in the Central Library building, will serve as the hub to provide high performance athlete and coach support services for the lower North Island.

"It’s critical that we have the people and resources in place to support athletes and coaches throughout the North Island, including Wellington and other major centres that were formerly serviced by NZAS Central," Trevor Mallard said.

"Wellington-based elite athletes such as mountain runner Kate McIlroy and Black Sticks goalkeeper Kyle Pontifex rely on these services to maintain their top form as they prepare to compete at the highest levels.

"But it’s not only our current elite athletes who need these services - New Zealand’s up-and-coming athletes also benefit from the Academy network.

"I have great admiration for the energy, enthusiasm and skill of the Academy of Sport personnel who invest their time and effort to ensure that athletes like Kate and Kyle have every chance to succeed on the world stage," said Trevor Mallard.
