Environment Minister David Benson-Pope is seeking advice on the Electricity Commission's approval of Transpower's proposal for a new transmission line between south Waikato and south Auckland.

As part of its application process, Transpower will need to lodge applications for approval under the Resource Management Act with a number of councils, which have jurisdiction over land where the line would be built.

Mr Benson-Pope said it was his understanding that these applications were not yet complete.

The Minister has a number of options for intervention available to him including "calling-in" the project to ensure a more streamlined process.

"No decision will be made until Transpower has submitted its applications in full and I have had time to evaluate them.

"I expect material will be made available to me in the next fortnight and I will make a decision once I have had time to consider it," said Mr Benson-Pope.
