John Key and the National Party must clarify their position on cheaper doctor’s visits and prescription charges after an apparent u-turn, Health Minister Pete Hodgson says.

A series of ambiguous remarks from National health spokesman Tony Ryall, reported in the New Zealand Herald last week and saying his party will leave lower fees “undisturbed”, contradicts the party’s previously-stated opposition to universal affordable primary care.

Mr Ryall's so-called health 'discussion paper' – already 14 months overdue – will apparently include a promise to leave funding for lower fees intact but the party’s previous position has been to scrap the funding to pay for tax cuts.

Pete Hodgson says National is trying to have it all ways. Is the party endorsing one of Labour's most popular policies or not?

General practices, patients, and families will need more clarity from National.

"The Labour-led Government’s investment in primary health has cut the cost of seeing the doctor by around half," Pete Hodgson says. "This has saved the average family around $550 every year.

"This has been an important achievement for Labour in government, but it has required a massive $2.2 billion investment – an investment National opposed at every possible opportunity.

National must be made to clarify what words like 'undisturbed' mean. The Labour-led government has committed to continued investment to maintain the value of subsidies over time, so practices can keep fees low without risking their viability.

"A pledge to not disturb current funding levels does not go far enough. If subsidies aren't adjusted, fees will rise.

"John Key and Tony Ryall don't believe that the government should be lowering doctor's fees – this is only about telling people what they want to hear.”
