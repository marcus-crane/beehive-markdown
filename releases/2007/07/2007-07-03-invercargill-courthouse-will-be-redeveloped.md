A new proposal to redevelop the existing Invercargill Courthouse was outlined by Courts Minister Rick Barker today.

“Over the last seven and a half years the Labour-led Government has undertaken the largest Court building programme in New Zealand’s recent history. As part of this, Budget 2005 provided $10.5million to design and build a new courthouse in Invercargill,” said Rick Barker.

“This is a Government that listens and that’s why, following consultation with local stakeholders such as the Invercargill City Council, Vibrant Invercargill, and local lawyers, a new proposal has been developed which will keep the courthouse in the CBD.

“Redeveloping the existing Don Street courthouse will create more space, address security concerns, and caters to the local preference to keep the courthouse in the centre of Invercargill.

“Accommodating the overwhelming local preference for the courthouse to remain in the CBD will delay the start of the project as new plans will need to be drawn up and discussed with stakeholders.

“At this stage construction could be expected to start in late 2008 for completion in late 2009 to mid 2010, depending on the extent of the redevelopment.

“Delays in this case are acceptable as we will be developing an updated Court house that will meet Invercargill’s needs and is in the location key stakeholders want. The finished court will be better for it,” said Rick Barker.
