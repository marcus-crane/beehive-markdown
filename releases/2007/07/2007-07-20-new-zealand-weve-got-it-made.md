The work of 250,000 New Zealand manufacturers is celebrated in a nationwide insert being distributed with major newspapers and magazines next week as the first phase of the Government’s Buy Kiwi Made media campaign.

The publication was unveiled by Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made in Auckland today at the manufacturers’ launch of the campaign.

“We’ve shone the light on New Zealand manufacturing to profile some of the innovative people and ideas behind the products that are made,” Ms Bradford says.

“We recognise that for Buy Kiwi Made to be a success, people need to understand that our manufacturing sector is amazingly broad and diverse and has always been a mainstay of our economy.”

"Manufacturers are not finding it easy at the moment with the high dollar and high interest rates. However valuing and purchasing Kiwi made goods is a practical way that all New Zealanders can support this important sector," says Ms Bradford.

Today’s launch in Avondale, Auckland will be at the premises of leading furniture and foam manufacturer, Vita New Zealand Limited. The function is also to be addressed by Business New Zealand Chief Executive CEO Phil O’Reilly, by Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard – who is a manufacturer in his own right - and by Council of Trade Unions Secretary Carol Beaumont.

The campaign has been developed in close co-operation with Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd, a private organisation, which operates the ‘kiwi in a triangle’ trademark.

Ms Bradford says that the consumer campaign will launch on 20 August. “It is vital to engage manufacturers and retailers now in preparation of the massive consumer interest in Kiwi made goods that the campaign will generate later this year.”

The $6.3 million Buy Kiwi Made media campaign celebrates New Zealand manufacturing and encourages domestic producers to label their qualifying goods as "New Zealand Made”. It will encourage retailers to stock and promote New Zealand made products. Consumers will then be able to support New Zealanders with their shopping decisions, via the purchase of Kiwi made goods.

“I urge all New Zealand manufacturers to get behind the Buy Kiwi Made media campaign, by labelling qualifying goods to assist retailers and thus enabling customers to identify products that have been made here. Manufacturers should also consider becoming members of the Buy New Zealand Made programme, which entitles members to label their qualifying products with the iconic ‘kiwi in the triangle’ trademark," Ms Bradford says.
