Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed New Zealand’s sadness at the death of former Cook Islands Prime Minister Sir Tom Davis.

Sir Tom was Prime Minister from 1978 to 1987, and the Cook Islands High Commissioner to New Zealand in 2004 and 2005.

“On behalf of the government and people of New Zealand, I extend to the family of Sir Tom, and to the government and people of the Cook Islands, our sincere condolences," Mr Peters said.

“Sir Tom was a remarkable leader and made an extraordinary contribution to public life in the Cook Islands.

“He had a special relationship with New Zealand, having attended Kings College in Auckland, and graduated from Otago University Medical School in 1945.  
"Sir Tom subsequently became an honorary Professor of Polynesian Migration and Culture with Te Wananga O Aotearoa, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Otago. In 2004 he launched the first Cook Islands Maori Language curriculum in New Zealand.  
“The achievements of Sir Tom, and in particular the remarkable contributions he made to medicine and to Polynesian culture, earned him considerable admiration in New Zealand, and he will not be forgotten,” Mr Peters said.

Details of Sir Tom's funeral, which is expected to be held in Rarotonga, are not yet available.
