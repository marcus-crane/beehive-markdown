Education Minister and Palmerston North MP Steve Maharey is welcoming young MPs to Youth Parliament 2007, to learn how it works and discuss a range of education issues, including NCEA and how to keep students in school longer.

Steve Maharey is vacating his seat this week, while 17-year-old Palmerston North Youth MP, Susannah Neild gets some hands on experience in New Zealand's fifth Youth Parliament.

"Youth Parliament is about giving young people a valuable insight into the workings of Parliament, and the opportunity to express their views to us as politicians, and to government officials and the public.

"Youth MPs will be able to offer us their views and personal experience of how the education system can work better. Susannah Neild is from Palmerston North's Awatapu College and has a personal interest in students staying at school.

"Susannah is a hard-working and motivated student and youth MP, who will make a significant contribution to Youth Parliament 2007."

Youth MPs will discuss the NCEA qualifications system during a select committee hearing, and Steve Maharey will be asked about it during Question time today.

The Maori select committee will also debate whether there should be a higher minimum age for leaving school, and how to keep more students learning at school for longer.
