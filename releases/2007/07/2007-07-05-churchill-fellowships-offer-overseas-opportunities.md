New Zealanders wishing to travel abroad to conduct research are invited to apply for a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowship, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders to benefit their communities by researching international best practice, and bringing this new knowledge and experience back to New Zealand,” said Laban.

Laban said that since 1965, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has helped over 600 New Zealanders as diverse as entertainers, scientists, teachers and community workers, to undertake research overseas.

Britain’s wartime Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, strongly believed in people going overseas to develop a particular area of expertise, and returning to make a greater contribution to their community back home. Churchill Trusts also operate in the UK and Australia.

Churchill Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs. They typically spend from three weeks to three months overseas. Past Fellows have researched a vast range of topics.

Applications close on 31 July 2007. Application forms for travel in 2008 can be obtained from: Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, Department of Internal Affairs,  
PO Box 805, Wellington, Ph: 0800 824 824, email: trusts@dia.govt.nz.
