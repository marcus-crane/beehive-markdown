Trade Minister Phil Goff will attend the annual meeting of Pacific Islands Forum, Trade Ministers in Port Vila, Vanuatu on the 2nd and 3rd of August.

"Our meeting in Port Vila provides a timely opportunity for members of the Forum to advance their vision of a single market in the Pacific”, said Mr Goff.

“In Port Vila we will discuss capacity building, intellectual property, the WTO, rules of origin and the revenue consequences of trade liberalisation. Most of all I am hopeful that we will be able to initiate a process to map out a way ahead under PACER.

“A month ago I indicated that New Zealand, together with Australia, had expressed interest in consultations under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). That agreement, which came into force in 2002, provides a framework for negotiations on a gradual and progressive move towards trade and economic integration in the region. It reflects Forum Leaders’ vision, from the time of their first meeting, of a single market embracing developed and developing members.

“We have been liaising with our Forum partners who, despite their current preoccupation with negotiations with the European Union, seem generally receptive to the idea that it is time to start thinking of their future engagement with Australia and New Zealand.

“What is needed is a comprehensive agreement, much broader than simply free trade in goods. The island countries need to draw strength from being part of a larger economic grouping.

"This process is not about trying to extract maximum pledges of future assistance or maximum trade access but of mapping out sensible progressive adjustments. All countries in the region would benefit from a more vibrant and cooperative regional economy", said Mr Goff.
