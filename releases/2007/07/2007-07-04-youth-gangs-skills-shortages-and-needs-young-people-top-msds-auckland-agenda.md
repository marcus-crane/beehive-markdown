Youth gangs, the needs of young people and regional skills shortages are some of the priorities in the Ministry of Social Development’s Auckland Annual Regional Plan, launched today by Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope.

The regional plan is one of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand over the coming fortnight. The plans set out each region’s specific needs and development opportunities and how the Ministry is responding to these.

Mr Benson-Pope says the plan contains a number of significant projects that will have a positive effect on many people living in the region.

“The plan outlines what the Ministry is doing to support our diverse communities. It also highlights initiatives in place to help deal with the issue of youth gangs,” he said.

Some of the key projects included in the regional plan are:

·Auckland Youth Support Network: The Ministry is leading this cross-agency network to find and implement solutions to the issue of youth gangs in Auckland.

·Youth Transition Services: There are now three Youth Transition Services operating in Auckland with support from the Ministry. This service is supported by the Ministry and helps young people move successfully from school into training or employment.

·Industry Partnerships: The Ministry is working with industry leaders to address regional skill and labour shortages. This includes a partnership with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, which is assisting migrants to gain work experience and employment.

The regional plan outlines the activities of all of the Ministry’s service lines within the Auckland region. These include: Child, Youth and Family, Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Integrity Services, and Senior Services.
