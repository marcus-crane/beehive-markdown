A 10 per cent increase in spending by domestic travellers in New Zealand this year shows there is an increasing feeling of prosperity in our country, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr O'Connor was commenting on new Ministry of Tourism data out today, which demonstrates that domestic travellers within New Zealand spent $7.6 billion in the year to March 2007, an increase of 9.1 per cent compared to the same period the previous year.

"This is very encouraging data. The exceptionally strong New Zealand dollar has meant more Kiwis are travelling overseas, but rather than doing this at the expense of seeing more of their own country, they are doing both. That is testament to the great tourism products in New Zealand and the professionalism of our tourism and hospitality businesses.

"It means that thousands of cafes, restaurants, hotels and motels, transport companies and other tourism operators up and down the country are sharing the rewards of our strong economy."

Mr O'Connor also congratulated the AA for its high-profile '101 Must-Do's for Kiwis' campaign, which started last year.

"The AA's campaign captures the imagination and helps remind Kiwis of New Zealand's special qualities and the great things to see and do here at home."

Mr O'Connor said domestic tourism is of great importance to the tourism industry, and it was important for the industry and the Government to keep working together to get the best out of it.

"At the same time we must continue to work strategically to maximise export earnings by positioning New Zealand internationally as a special, unique and environmentally-friendly place to visit for a top quality experience."

The research shows that spending on overnight trips increased by 9.9 per cent to $4.9 billion. The number of overnight trips was 4.3 per cent higher at 15 million. On their overnight trips New Zealanders stayed 2.3 per cent more nights away from home.

The Domestic Travel Survey is a telephone survey of 15,000 New Zealand residents undertaken throughout the year. A range of data and reports from the survey are available on the Ministry of Tourism’s research website – www.tourismresearch.govt.nz
