MetService will install a new weather radar in Taranaki by July 2008, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven announced today.

“The radar will be one of three to be installed in the North Island and represent a significant investment in new infrastructure. The first is to be installed in Taranaki, followed by two others in the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne/Hawke’s Bay areas,” said Mr Duynhoven, commenting in the wake of the tornadoes which have hit Taranaki.

The new radars costing $10 million in total, were agreed to by the Government in Budget 07, and will provide improved weather monitoring and warning coverage for these regions, which are not well served by the existing radar network. Currently coverage of Taranaki does not provide sufficient detail needed for detecting and warning of storms like those which spawned last week’s tornadoes.

“This upgrade of New Zealand’s weather radar network was the result of a number of years of planning and testing by MetService, and will take several years to implement. The existing weather radar network was significantly upgraded only 18 months ago. The new technology providing enhanced capabilities, has proved to be very effective.

“This technology will also be used for the expansion of the network. As well as infrastructure improvements, MetService has a programme of research and development on the nature of New Zealand’s thunderstorms which is now bearing fruit in new capabilities for forecasting such storms,” Mr Duynhoven said.

The systems will increase the effective weather radar coverage of the North Island from 24 percent to 78 percent.

“This will give more precise weather data and will be of great advantage to anyone dependant on weather forecasts such as farmers and fishermen and importantly for those involved in emergency management. As we have seen, severe storm events such as the recent tornadoes in Taranaki can produce a lot of damage to a small area in a very short time and can be incredibly distressing for those in our communities whose property and belongings are damaged or destroyed as a result,” said Mr Duynhoven.

The group controller for the Taranaki region’s Civil Defence Emergency Management, David Lean, said he was delighted at the news.

“The Taranaki region has always been subject to intense rain and storm events as evidenced by the spawn of tornados that hit the region last week. We're looking forward to the installation of the new weather radar, and the enhanced ability to monitor and anticipate such events,” said Mr Lean.

“The new radar systems will greatly improve weather monitoring and enable MetService meteorologists to provide a severe thunderstorm watch system for much of the country. Weather radar is an essential tool for meteorologists to watch for and track these storms and provide people with warnings of their approach,” said Paul Reid, MetService’s Chief Executive.

The MetService is also developing a ‘nowcasting’ service and within 18 months will be in a position to offer more precise warnings of thunderstorm movement and activity. ‘Nowcasting’ enables up to the minute data to be produced for users.

The new weather radars will add to those already operating near Warkworth, Wellington, Rakaia and Invercargill.
