Cabinet has funded the continuation of work against didymo and southern saltmarsh mosquito, Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

Mr Anderton said the Labour-Progressive Government was commited to protecting New Zealand’s citizens, environment, and economy from introduced pests and disease.

“These two programmes, against southern saltmarsh mosquito and didymo, are significant. Didymo in particular is one where Biosecurity New Zealand is now leading the world in its knowledge on tackling this pest.”

Mr Anderton said $13.3 million over the next four years would be spent on a long-term management plan for didymo. This funding also included a contingency fund to deal with any North Island find of didymo.

Didymo, an exotic freshwater algae, was found in South Island rivers in October 2004. It has not yet been found in the North Island.

A programme to eradicate the southern saltmarsh mosquito from New Zealand has been underway since 1998 with successful elimination of the mosquito from eight of the 12 sites so far.

Mr Anderton said a further $11.2 million over the next three years would be spent on continuing attempts to completely eradicate the southern saltmarsh mosquito. A further $6 million is for a contingency fund to tackle the mosquito if found outside the current eradication target areas.

The southern saltmarsh mosquito is a vicious biter and can transmit Ross River virus to humans, as well as posing an economic threat to New Zealand.
