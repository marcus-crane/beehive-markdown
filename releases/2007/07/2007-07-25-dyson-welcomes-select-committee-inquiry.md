Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed a parliamentary inquiry into the care and rehabilitation of youth sex offenders.

The Social Services Committee will examine the services available for young sex offenders around New Zealand and other matters covered by its terms of reference.

"Our Labour-led government has provided funding for rehabilitation and prevention services for young sex abusers through successive budgets," said Ruth Dyson.

"The Ministry of Social Development through Child, Youth and Family Services fund many community based therapy programmes which are internationally recognised and have been evaluated as effective.”

The committee will examine the placement, supervision and custody of youth sex offenders in the custody of Child, Youth and Family Services and examine the arrangements and programmes available for their rehabilitation.
