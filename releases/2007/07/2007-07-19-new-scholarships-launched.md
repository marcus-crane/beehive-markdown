Māori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today launched a range of revamped scholarships for Māori students, with an increased overall pūtea and a greater focus on post-graduate studies and the development of Māori leadership.

The Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships Fund Board was established by an Act of Parliament in 1945. It aimed to recognise the bravery of the 28th battalion and its Victoria Cross hero Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu and to assist future generations of young Māori to achieve both academically and within their own communities as leaders of Māori.  
“In 2006 and 2007 the Board reviewed the previous scholarships and designed a new range to cover a wider range of purposes from Doctoral, Masters and Undergraduate studies, to a leadership scholarship for enterprising, innovative and influential Māori,” Mr Horomia said.

The scholarships are funded from both the Government and interest on the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund Board investments.

“A significant financial boost for the scholarships in this year’s Budget will see annual funding more than doubled to $217,000 a year by 2009/10, and is another example of the Labour-led government’s commitment to Māori education,” Mr Horomia said.

The new scholarships are of similar value to the Bright Futures, Enterprise and Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships.

The previous scholarships were for tertiary students and worth $5000 a year, but only one post-graduate scholarship was awarded. The scholarships announced today will offer more financial support to successful applicants, with the new leadership scholarships worth up to $30,000.

Applicants have always had to be Māori, but the board has added new criteria, including the requirement they are able to whakapapa to a member of the 28th Maori Battalion.

The Board is looking for applicants who share the characteristics of the 28th Māori Battalion :Te ao Māori me te ao Pākeha (an ability to walk in both Māori and non Māori worlds), Kawa, ngā Tikanga me te Reo, Rangatiratanga, Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga, Whakaritenga, Te Wero, Mātauranga

“The current government goals of economic transformation are reflected in the purpose behind the Ngārimu scholarships, to support Māori aspirations within tertiary education and Māori participation within the area of research and development,” Mr Horomia said.

NB: The scholarship forms will be available on the Ministry of Education’s website from 25 July. www.minedu.govt.nz

I te rangi nei, I whakamānutia e te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia, ētahi momo tahua ngore whakahou, mō ngā tauira Māori, te pūtea whānui kua whakanuia, te arotahi kaha ake ki ngā akoranga tauira māhita, me te whanaketanga o te kaiārahitanga Māori.

I whakatūria te Poari o te Pūtea Tahua Ngore Whakamaumahara ki a Ngārimu VC me te Rōpū Hoia Māori o 28, I tētahi Tūre Pāremata I te tau 1945. Me te whāinga ki te whakanui I ngā mahi toa a te Rōpū Hoia o 28 me tōna hoia toa a Te Moananui-nui-a Kiwa VC, me te āwhina I ngā reanga Māori taiohi kei mua, kia eke ki ngā taumata mātauranga, ki roto anō I a rātou hapori hei kaiārahi mō te Māori.

“I te tau 2006 me 2007, I tirohia e te Poari ngā tahua ngore o mua, ka hangaia ngā momo hou kia whakapā atu ki ētahi kaupapa whānui ake, mai I ngā akoranga Tākutatanga, Māhita, me te Akonga, atu ki tētahi tahua ngore kaiārahitanga, mō ngā Māori whakahinonga, wairua auaha, whai mana,” i kī a Horomia.

Ko ngā pūtea mō ēnei tahua ngore, nō te Kāwanatanga me ngā hua itareti mai I te whakahaumitanga o ngā moni a te Poari o te Pūtea Tahua Ngore Whakamaumahara ki a Ngārimu VC me te Rōpū Hoia Māori o te 28.

Hei tā Horomia, “ Ko tētahi hikinga nui mō ngā tahua ngore ki roto i te tahua moni kāwanatanga I tēnei tau, ko te taparuatanga o ngā moni atu ki te $217,000 ia tau, hei te tau 2009/10, ā, koia nei tētahi ake o ngā kaupapa piripono a te kāwanatanga Reipa- ārahi ki te akoranga Māori.”

He rite te wāriu o ngā tahua ngore hou nei ki ērā o Bright Futures, Enterprise me Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships.

Ngā tahua ngore o mua I tukuna ki ngā tauira kura tuatoru, e $5000 ia tau, ëngari kotahi noaiho te tahua ngore tauira māhita I tukuna. He nui ake ngā āwhina moni o ngā tahua

ngore kua pānuitia I te rangi nei ki ngā tauira angitu, tae atu ki ngā tahua ngore kaiārahitanga hou, piki atu ki te $30,000.

Ko te Māori anake ka āhei ki te tono, ēngari kua hangaia he tikanga hou, tāpiri atu ki te tikanga here, me whakapapa rā anō ngā kaitono ki tētahi o ngā hoia o te Rōpū Hoia Māori o 28.

Kei te rapu te Poari I ngā kaitono e whaiwāhi ana ki ngā āhuatanga tohu a te Rōpū Hoia Māori O 28: Kawa, ngā Tikanga me te Reo, Rangatiratanga, Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga, Whakaritenga, Te Wero, Mātauranga.

I kī a Horomia, “Kei te whakaatatia ngā whāinga huringa ōhanga a te Kāwanatanga ki roto I ngā take kei muri I ngā tahua ngore o Ngārimu, arā, te tautoko I ngā wawata Māori I roto I te wāhanga akoranga kura tuatoru, me te whaiwāhitanga Māori ki roto I ngā wāhi rangahau, me te whanaketanga,”.
