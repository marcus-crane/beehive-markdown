Foreign Minister Winston Peters, currently in Korea, will travel to Manila over the weekend to attend next week's Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Post Ministerial Conference and Regional Forum.

In Manila, Mr Peters will also attend the fifth South West Pacific Dialogue, an East Asia Summit meeting, and meet bilaterally with a range of colleagues.

The Post Ministerial Conference involves the ten ASEAN countries meeting with their Dialogue partners – New Zealand, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.

The Regional Forum, which involves 26 countries, is the largest regional meeting of its kind to discuss political and security issues of common interest.

“New Zealand has been an ASEAN Dialogue partner for over three decades, and these meetings provide important opportunities for us to engage with ASEAN on common economic, political and security issues," Mr Peters said.

"ASEAN is a key part of New Zealand’s broader relationship with Asia. Its members play a central role in developments that are shaping the future economic progress and stability of the region.

"One topic of discussion will be the ‘Framework for Cooperation’, which was endorsed by Ministers last year. It is an excellent initiative that will provide impetus and structure to our engagement with ASEAN in coming years.

"The East Asia Summit meeting provides an opportunity to discuss initiatives ahead of November's Summit in Singapore. It is unique grouping, bringing together ASEAN plus China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, and New Zealand, to find ways of enhancing cooperation in areas such as energy security, and economic and financial initiatives.

"The South West Pacific Dialogue is also important to New Zealand. It involves the Philippines, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, and talks will traverse regional security, maritime issues, and cultural interaction," Mr Peters said.
