Cabinet today approved additional funding to assist meeting response and recovery costs following the storms which struck the upper North Island last week, said Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker.

“Last week I visited Northland and the Coromandel and saw first hand the extent of the damage. The storms have resulted in millions of dollars worth of damage, and I expect Government’s total contribution will be in the millions.

“Today’s announcement reflects the Labour-Led government’s commitment to ensuring the safety and welfare of our communities. Whilst the cost of the actual damage is yet to be calculated, the funding approved today will help the region recover in the immediate days and weeks.

“Only once the final assessment has been completed, will we be in a position to consider the total contribution the Government will make,” said Rick Barker.

The Labour-led Government response to date includes:

- Meeting all welfare costs arising from the severe weather event including temporary accommodation and basic necessities.
- An interim payment of $1 million to help councils meet the cost of response and recovery
- On Friday last week I authorised the payment of $100,000 to the Far North District Council Mayoral Relief Fund
- Provision of up to $2,500 for those severely affected by the flooding and with limited resources to enable them to re-establish their households.
- Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope has announced initial funding of $500,000 to Enhanced Taskforce Green to help the clean up
- An 0800 Emergency Response helpline (0800 779 997) has been activated. So far 630 calls have been received
- The New Zealand Defence Force provided two Iroquois helicopters to assist with the movement of food and water into isolated areas
- The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has funded the appointment of two Agricultural Recovery Facilitators to help coordinate the rural recovery process at a cost of $100,000
- Inland Revenue (IRD) is providing tax relief to affected farmers
- At a minimum, the government will meet the majority of the costs of rebuilding council roads as well as pay the full cost of restoring state highways

“The focus, in times such as these, is not who will pay the bill, the priority is on ensuring the safety and welfare of our communities and families. We know that it will cost millions to recover from the recent storms and we will deal with that when it comes. For now, the focus must be on making sure that people are safe and cared for,” said Rick Barker.
