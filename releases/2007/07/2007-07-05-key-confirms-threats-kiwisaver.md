John Key has today confirmed that National is considering scrapping the KiwiSaver tax credits as suggested by his finance spokesperson, Bill English, earlier this week.

On Radio New Zealand today John Key raised the prospect of cutting KiwiSaver tax credits. This follows Bill English’s hints on Tuesday that National would cut New Zealand Superannuation.

John Key has yet to respond to calls to clarify National’s position on the future of New Zealand Superannuation.

“Labour is publicly committed to both KiwiSaver and New Zealand Superannuation,” Acting Finance Minister Clayton Cosgrove said today. “National, on the other hand, has now confirmed it is considering scrapping major elements of KiwiSaver and is hinting about income-testing and means-testing Superannuation.”

“This is back to the future for National. When they were last in government they cut superannuation to fund tax cuts. It looks like this is what they are planning again.”

“Dr Cullen has previously announced that he will be looking to spell out a timetable for personal tax cuts in next year’s Budget. This will be done without cuts to either Superannuation or KiwiSaver.”

“We reject John Key’s divide and rule approach to Superannuation. National should stop playing politics with Superannuation and start being honest with New Zealanders about their true plans.”
