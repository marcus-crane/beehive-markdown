New Zealanders who are carers for family and non-family members are being asked for feedback on what changes would help them juggle these roles alongside other commitments, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Speaking at the launch of the consultation document *Caring for New Zealand Carers*, the Minister said the public responses will help the government identify carers’ issues and priorities and reflect these in a national Carers’ Strategy.

“We’re asking the public and carers in particular what information and support should be made available to improve carers’ choices to balance their role with jobs, education, family and community life,” Ruth Dyson said.

The consultation is part of the government’s wider range of initiatives to support carers. This year’s budget saw an additional $6 million committed over four years for family caregiver support.

“Our Labour-led government recognises that there are many people who play a vital role in looking after people who need support. We have done a lot already to support these valuable carers and we want to do more,” said Ruth Dyson.

The Strategy is being developed in partnership with the Carers Alliance, a network of 43 non-governmental organisations. A national strategy with a supporting action plan for carers is to be developed by April 2008.

Developing the Carer’s Strategy is part of the Government’s ‘Choices for Living, Caring and Working’ ten year strategy which aims to provide parents and carers with choices about how to balance their work and family commitments.
