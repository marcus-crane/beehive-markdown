Trade ministers in the Asia-Pacific region are determined to see results from the WTO Doha Round Trade Minister Phil Goff said today at the meeting of APEC Trade Ministers in Cairns.

"It is well understood that the breakdown of talks among Brazil, the EU, India and the US represented a real setback. But the focus had now shifted to the wider multilateral negotiation in Geneva", said Phil Goff.

"The chairs of the WTO's negotiating groups for agriculture and non-agricultural market access have announced overnight that they will issue new negotiating texts by mid-July. Negotiations on those texts will resume later in the month. Capitals will have the month of August to analyse the new proposals before an intensive negotiation gets under way at the beginning of September.

"The challenge is to make that process work. What I heard in Cairns was a commitment by all of those present to work for the breakthroughs that are now desperately needed.

"The APEC ministers, who represent a cross-section of developed and emerging economies, were clear that a deal would have to deliver real gains in terms of genuine new market access and cuts in farm subsidies. Without that we don't get the boost to growth and development that is central to the whole exercise.

"APEC trade ministers have issued a statement focusing specifically on the WTO negotiations which is doubly welcome because it means that economies accounting for half of world trade have joined in highlighting the urgency and importance of the task we now face.

"It is essential that this process be given a chance to work.

"The tone of the discussion in Cairns was sober. We all understand that if we don't get the breakthroughs this time then the round goes into hibernation for some years. It is up to all of us to make it work but members will need to show care and restraint in the way they react when the new texts come out in mid-July.

"One thing is certain, all of us will find things in those texts that we don't like but we have to support the chairs. If members undermine the chairs and their process then it will be some years before we get another chance to get a deal. The stakes are too high for that", Mr Goff said.
