As New Zealanders we are quite rightly proud of our track record as a global leader in women's rights.

Our status as the first country in the world to grant women the vote is part of our identity as a nation. We have a long history of promoting human rights and the rights of women such as: equal pay for equal work; equal access to education and training; universal superannuation. Women have equal rights to conclude contracts and to inherit and own property. We are held equally responsible for our behaviour under the law. But despite all this, until now we still could not claim to have a clean slate in international women's rights.

In May we removed the final legislative provision that enabled discrimination on the basis of sex by passing an amendment to the Human Rights Act to allow women to serve in frontline roles in the police and military. In fact, this amendment was simply catching up with practice as the forces had voluntarily allowed women full access to combat roles since 2000. So, changing the law was symbolic, but it contained a powerful message.

I am taking that message to the world on August 2 (3 August NZT) when I have the privilege of presenting New Zealand's 6th report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women - known as CEDAW. By providing accountability for governments that are signatories to the Convention, the Committee works to promote and protect the rights of women around the world. For that reason, [CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/) is commonly referred to as an international bill of rights for women.

New Zealand ratified the CEDAW Convention in 1985, but because of that provision in our law to exclude women from combat we were obliged to register a reservation. We have repeatedly been urged by the CEDAW committee to take the necessary steps to withdraw this reservation. That simple change in the law has finally allowed us to do so.

New Zealand still has much work to do before we can claim to have full equality in our hearts and minds as well as in law. The Labour-led government is committed to addressing those areas such as pay equity and family violence that continue to cast shadows over our aspirations to be a truly non-discriminatory society.

I am proud that it has been under my watch as Minister of Women's Affairs that we can proclaim to the world that we truly have no reservation in tackling discrimination. But we will not be diverted from our goal that all New Zealand women have personal and economic security in a society that embraces both diversity and equality. That's why this government had the vision to develop the [Action Plan for New Zealand Women,](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/news-and-pubs/publications/action-plan.html) which we continue to deliver on to enable women to have real choices in their lives.
