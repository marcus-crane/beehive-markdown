Veterans' Affairs Minister Rick Barker today encouraged Vietnam veterans and their families to register their details with Veterans Affairs New Zealand.

“As part of the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached last year between the Government, the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association, officials are collating a register of those who served in Vietnam and their families.

“The register will help us paint a clear picture of the possible effects of their service, and allow us to monitor the trends in the health and well being of Vietnam veterans and their families. It will allow us to identify current and future issues, and to address these through tailored case management.

“Over 2,750 people have already registered and as a result we have been able to identify people unaware that they were eligible for assistance. As a consequence War Disablement Pensions have been awarded, ex gratia payments have been made, and veterans have been assisted with their wider health needs.

“A free medical check is available under the MoU and once registered, Vietnam veterans will be contacted with information about how to access this. Not only will the free medical check help identify the effect of service on individual Vietnam veterans, but it will help provide a fuller picture of the overall health and wellbeing of Vietnam veterans as a group.

“Another key component of the package is the establishment of a Trust which will make discretionary payments to Vietnam veterans and their families suffering serious difficulties, but whose concerns are not addressed elsewhere in the package. I expect to make a further announcement on this shortly.

“While it is pleasing that over 2,750 registrations have been received, there are still many who have not yet put their names forward and I strongly encourage Vietnam veterans and their families to do so“, said Rick Barker.
