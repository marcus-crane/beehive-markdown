New Zealand has withdrawn its final reservation to a United Nations bill of rights for women, Women's Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

"New Zealand has completed the final chapter in our efforts to show we are a credible voice internationally in women's rights. We can be very proud of our achievement," Lianne Dalziel said.

In making the announcement to the Ministry of Women's Affair's international caucus on women's issues, Lianne Dalziel thanked them for their role in helping to develop New Zealand's sixth report to the 39th session of the UN Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/)) which she will deliver in New York next month.

New Zealand was not able to fully comply with the convention until it removed an exemption to the Human Rights Act to allow women to serve in combat in the military. That was done in May.

"I'm proud that the defence forces acted voluntarily to change their practice so that we could remove the exemption," Lianne Dalziel said. "It took time to allow equipment and procedures to be changed so that women could fully participate, but they began that process willingly in 2000. Now the law has caught up, and as a result we have been able to formally withdraw our reservation to CEDAW."

"In celebrating this milestone, we need to acknowledge that equality in law and equality in reality are two different things. As a nation we still have a way to go to achieve pay and employment equity; to see women participating in all parts of the economy and, in particular in modern apprenticeships, in greater numbers; and to end the terrible scourge of domestic violence."

Lianne Dalziel will present New Zealand's sixth report to the committee in New York on 2 August, accompanied by Women's Affairs [Ministry](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/) chief executive Shenagh Gleisner and Diane Mara of [PACIFICA](http://www.pacifica.org.nz/), one of the Ministry's social partners.

Three non-governmental organisations – [Maori Women's Welfare League](http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WomensOrganisations/MaoriWomensWelfareLeague/en), [National Council of Women](http://www.ncwnz.co.nz/) (NCW) and Pacific Women’s Watch – will present shadow reports to the UN committee earlier in the week.
