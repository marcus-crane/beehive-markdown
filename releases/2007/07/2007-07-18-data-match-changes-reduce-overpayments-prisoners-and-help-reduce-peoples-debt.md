New legislation aimed at preventing and recovering benefit overpayments to prisoners through improved data matching processes was tabled in Parliament today.

Tabled by Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope, the legislation extends the use of information already transferred between the Ministry of Social Development, the Department of Corrections, New Zealand Customs and the Accident Compensation Corporation.

People sentenced to prison are not eligible to receive benefits from Work and Income. Where prisoners have received payments, debts are established and they are required to pay back the money.

"It has not always been possible to stop payments immediately if a client enters prison, usually because the client has not told the agencies that they have been imprisoned," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The current data matching process is effective in identifying overpayments and debts that arise from Work and Income clients who have not, for whatever reason, notified Work and Income of their change in circumstances. However, the procedural requirements of the Privacy Act limit Work and Income's ability to act at the earliest opportunity to prevent debts arising.

"Under current legislation, when the data match identifies that a person in prison may be receiving a benefit or a student allowance, Work and Income is required to notify the client in writing that their payment will be stopped. The agencies must then wait ten days before ceasing payments. This gives the client time to respond to the letter in case of mistaken identity.

"Under the new legislation, the need for the ten day waiting period will be waived for those prisoners positively matched.

"In addition, the frequency of data matches between the Ministry of Social Development and Corrections has been increased from weekly to daily.

"The legislative change will also allow for the information currently gathered in data matching to be used to locate people who have debts with Work and Income so repayments can be made.

"Improving data matching will further ensure the integrity of the benefit system and see that prisoners do not receive payments that they are not entitled to," said Mr Benson-Pope.
