Around 70,000 lower South Island households could be eligible for smaller power bills under proposed changes to electricity tariff charges, Energy Minister David Parker has announced.

The Labour-led government is introducing legislation today which will allow it to raise the threshold for Low Fixed Charges eligibility under the Electricity Act, from 8000 kWh per year to 9000 kWh for those domestic consumers in Christchurch and south of the city. The West Coast will not be included in the tariff changes because power consumption there is lower on average than other southern regions.

David Parker said while around 50,000 lower South Island households already benefited from the 8000 kWh limit, another 20,000 should be eligible under the higher threshold.

“People in the lower South Island generally use more electricity than those in warmer parts of the North Island, especially during winter. The original threshold means a large number of people down south have not been eligible for lower fixed charges, and we want to rectify that.”

The low fixed charge tariff is available to domestic consumers living in their primary dwelling. David Parker said the dollar benefit to people will vary by area, depending on how individual networks and retailers applied the tariff.

“People whose electricity consumption is well below the threshold are likely to notice greater savings than those who use more. I urge people to check with their electricity supplier to see if they are eligible to take advantage of low fixed tariff charges.”

The Minister said a customer using 8,000 kWh each year in the lower South  
Island should be around $20 per annum better off on a low fixed charge tariff, compared to the standard non regulated tariff. A 6,000 kWh consumer who may have already have benefited by about $50 will now benefit by about $70.

This change is in addition to other measures the Labour-led government has introduced to promote energy efficiency, such as support for the installation of solar hot water heating systems, and EnergyWise home grants for better insulation.
