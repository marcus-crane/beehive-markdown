Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove has today congratulated Palmerston North City Council on being the first local authority to gain accreditation as a building consent authority under the government’s tough new rules to help ensure buildings are designed, built and inspected right the first time.

He presented the council with its accreditation certificate today on behalf of International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) at a function in the Council chambers.

Mr Cosgrove said Palmerston North City Council’s accreditation is a major milestone in building sector reforms designed to lift the standards and performance of building control functions in local government.

The building consent authority accreditation and registration scheme is among a suite of Building Act 2004 reforms to strengthen the building sector and improve public confidence, in the wake of problems such as leaky buildings. Other reforms include the licensing of building practitioners, and a top-to-bottom review of the New Zealand Building Code.

Mr Cosgrove says being first across the line reflects this council’s commitment to, and investment in, preparing for accreditation over the past two years.

“The council has boosted its building controls staff numbers by eight, from 12 to 20, and has put these staff through training programmes so they are well equipped to meet the new, high quality inspections and processing standards,” he said. “The council has also upgraded its information technology with field staff now using electronic tablets to input data into the database. These investments will directly benefit people who apply for building consents.”

“The success of the process is a great credit to the Palmerston North City Council.”

A number of other councils are on the verge of accreditation, with the majority of councils making good progress towards it. Some local authorities are finding it a challenge to meet the tough, new requirements, so the government has provided $3 million of funding to assist with this, as well as making case advisors available to help councils improve their systems and make funding applications.

Mr Cosgrove also praised the Palmerston North City Council and the Manawatu District Council for entering an arrangement for the City Council to undertake building control functions on behalf of the District Council.

“I commend and congratulate both councils for working together like this, using one of the options for accreditation available under the Building Act. They will now use the same top-notch, accredited building control services to efficiently process building consent applications to a high standard.”

The City Council now needs to be registered as a building consent authority by the Department of Building and Housing. Mr Cosgrove said that will be a straightforward process that will occur later this year.

“Palmerston North City Council has done exceptionally well and its ratepayers can be proud of the council’s building control operation, as well as have confidence in its building inspection and consenting processes,” Mr Cosgrove said.
