More than $10 million will secure more than 500 places for children in Early Childhood Education (ECE), funding providers to expand or build new services, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey is today announcing two new rounds of funding which will extend quality ECE to more young New Zealanders.

"The Discretionary and Establishment grants are providing funding to set up new centres or to expand existing ones to cater for increasing demand, particularly in the Auckland area. The funding is part of the Labour-led government's commitment to make early education more accessible and affordable.

"The grants will support the further roll out of 20 Hours Free ECE, which started at teacher-led centres this week. More than 65,000 three and four year olds are accessing the policy from day one, representing 70 per cent of eligible children. There are early indications that this take up rate will increase further, as more services are applying to offer the policy.

"ECE is a key priority for the Labour-led government, through these grants, the 20 Hours Free ECE policy, and the wider 10 year ECE strategy to create more qualified teachers, more new centres and a better quality of education.

"The Discretionary Grant, worth $9.6 million, is being allocated to 16 providers looking to either build new or extend their ECE centres, to increase participation particularly for children from low socio-economic and isolated communities.

The $9.6 million is the first round of an annual $16.2 million Discretionary Grant Scheme.

Steve Maharey is also today announcing more than $235,000 in Establishment Grants, to help 14 other new ECE services get the resources they need to operate a centre, for example a licence, extra staff or equipment.

The Establishment grant is a quarterly allocation, out of an annual total of $1.2 million.

"The Labour-led government is investing $770 million in ECE in 2007/08 to boost participation, improve quality and lower costs for families. A child who attends ECE has a much better chance of succeeding in school and later in life, and cost should not stand in the way of families accessing quality early education."
