Energy Minister David Parker acknowledges the hard work the Electricity Commission has devoted to analysing Transpower's proposal for an upgraded transmission line into Auckland.

The Commission announced today that it confirmed its previous draft approval of Transpower's planned upgrade.

Transpower must still obtain Resource Management Act approval before the upgrade work can commence.

"The Commission's role is to provide an independent assessment of whether the transmission upgrade is timely and cost-effective, and meets the needs of the power system," David Parker said.

"I am confident that this role has been carried out robustly and fairly."

"This has been a long and difficult process and I acknowledge the time and effort all parties involved have put in. It is now time to move on to the next stage of the process."
