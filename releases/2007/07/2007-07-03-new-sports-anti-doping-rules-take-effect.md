**Media Release 29 June 2007**

A new, streamlined sports anti-doping scheme for New Zealand comes into effect on Sunday, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Since last October, when Parliament passed the Sports Anti-Doping Act, Drug Free Sport NZ, Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) and national sporting organisations have been working to put in place a new, more efficient anti-doping scheme.

The scheme takes effect from Sunday 1 July 2007 when the new Sports Anti-Doping Rules will become the official anti-doping rules for many of New Zealand’s athletes, coaches, and other sports participants.

"Rather than every sport having its own anti-doping rules, national sporting organisations are now able to sign up to one national set of anti-doping rules that Drug Free Sport NZ will ensure are up-to-date with international anti-doping requirements," said Trevor Mallard.

"This will reduce paperwork for national sports organisations that previously had to develop their own policies. It will also reduce confusion for athletes, coaches and officials.

"The Rules will also make it easier for Drug Free Sport NZ to investigate doping cheats and where necessary extend those investigations to include coaches and others who may be involved," said Trevor Mallard, who is on the governing body of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

"So far, almost every national sporting organisation has indicated that it is going to adopt the Sports Anti-Doping Rules which shows their commitment to maintain a level playing field for all athletes in the spirit of honesty, ethics, courage and fairness.

"New Zealand has always had a very good record in doping control and our anti-doping practices, including the very important education component, are up there with the best in the world. The new scheme provides a model for other countries to follow," said Trevor Mallard.
