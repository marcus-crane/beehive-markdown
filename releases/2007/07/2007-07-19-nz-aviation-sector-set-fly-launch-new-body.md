The establishment of new industry organisation Aviation New Zealand is an important milestone for the sector as it moves to take advantage of significant emerging global opportunities for export growth, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"Aviation New Zealand is a new industry body aimed at bringing the sector together to enable New Zealand to gain real traction and success in the international aviation marketplace," Trevor Mallard said when he launched the new organisation in Auckland today.

"It's especially fitting to see this launch take place in Export Year 2007 - which is all about building our exporting capabilities, making our firms more globally competitive, and paving the way for export growth over the long term. These developments are important as the Labour-led government works with business and industry sectors to transform our economy into one that is high wage, innovative and export-led.

"The New Zealand aviation industry has huge exporting potential particularly in areas such as aviation engineering, airport technologies, infrastructure, ground support and aviation training and services.  
"Estimates are that 10,000 more passenger aircraft will be needed globally in the next 10 years, and that maintenance, repair and overhaul expenditure will go up 45 percent in that time to around NZ$75billion per year. On top of that some 55,000 new pilots are needed in China alone by 2025.

"The size and speed of this growth means that to be successful, the New Zealand industry must scale up. Customers in India and China will not be interested in a proposal to train five pilots, they want many more. We need to aggregate New Zealand capabilities and achieve consistent, top quality training.

"Our aviation manufacturers and service providers must collaborate, to replicate the one stop shop solutions being implemented by our international competitors - so the establishment of Aviation New Zealand is indeed very timely," Trevor Mallard said.

Last year, under the Sector Initiative Fund, the Labour-led government provided funding for the Aviation Industry Association to undertake a review of the industry’s capabilities, and export opportunities. This review led to the establishment of Aviation New Zealand which is charged with developing an export strategy for the industry.
