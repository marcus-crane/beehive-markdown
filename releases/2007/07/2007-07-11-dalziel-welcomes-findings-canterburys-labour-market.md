Christchurch East MP Lianne Dalziel today welcomed a new report showing solid employment growth, a decline in unemployment and increased labour force participation in the Canterbury region.

The Department of Labour's Annual In-Depth Report for the Canterbury Region details the characteristics of Canterbury's regional labour market, the changes it has undergone and some key outcomes of these changes.

The [report](http://www.dol.govt.nz/News/Media/2007/aidr-canterbury.asp) shows employment in the region grew higher than the national average between the 2001 and 2006 Census. Unemployment in the region declined from six percent to four percent over the same period.

The report also shows labour force participation rates are at historically high levels in Canterbury.

""The high unemployment levels of the 1990s have been relegated to the history books. Young New Zealanders have only ever known low unemployment and high labour force participation both in Canterbury and across New Zealand thanks to the policies of the Labour-led government," said Lianne Dalziel.

"At the same time we have seen a huge drop in the number of Cantabrians receiving a benefit," Lianne Dalziel said.

In 1999 the total number of working age people in Canterbury receiving a benefit was 39,826. This number is now 25,674– a drop of 36 percent.

"And the good news doesn't stop there. In 1999 15,916 people in Canterbury were receiving an Unemployment Benefit. Now, under the Labour-led government there are just 1,283 – a drop of 92 percent.

"This report contains useful data and can now be used as a tool for future planning and decision making by government agencies and the private sector.

"The measurement of regional and sub-regional labour market conditions is important to allow local decision makers to identify areas where focus is needed most," said Lianne Dalziel.
