The number of children set to benefit from 20 Hours Free ECE is steadily rising already, less than a week after launch day, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Speaking at the New Zealand Childcare Association Annual Conference in Paihia today, Steve Maharey said 1 July marked a historic watershed in education in New Zealand, as the Labour-led government took responsibility to publicly fund education from the age of three.

"More than 65,000 three and four year olds are already getting their free hours in teacher-led services across the country. That's 70 per cent of eligible children in from day one.

"The Ministry of Education has now got up to a thousand more three and four year olds in the pipeline, at services that have applied to offer 20 Hours Free ECE. Those children and services will likely be in the next round of funding this month."

The Chief Executive of the New Zealand Childcare Association, Nancy Bell, says there is resounding support from her members for 20 Hours Free ECE, "78 per cent told us they would opt in from the start, and every day there are more centres joining their group.

"Our members believe in the vision behind this policy, and see the difference it's already making for children and families."

Steve Maharey says ECE centres can apply at any time over the next year to get involved in this popular policy, which is saving families up to $4500 a year per child.

"20 Hours Free ECE is not a subsidy. The Labour-led government is fully funding twenty hours of early childhood education to the accepted quality standard, just as we fully fund schools to the accepted quality standard.

"This policy is the most significant expansion of the education system since the rollout of free secondary education in the 1930s. It gives our children the best possible start in life, regardless of where they live or how much their parents earn."
