New reports released today show New Zealand’s labour market is performing well in all regions, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

"These In-Depth Regional Labour Market Reports analyse 12 regions from Northland to Southland and show consistent improvements in labour market measures across New Zealand between the 2001 and 2006 Censuses.

"Unemployment is down and each region has advanced with improvements in labour market participation, growth in high-skilled and skilled occupational groups and more people having higher qualifications," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The 12 reports, prepared by the Department of Labour, offer one of the first sub-regional presentations of data from Population Census 2006.

"Given the variety of characteristics within regions, this sub-regional analysis is particularly valuable, allowing a once-in-five-year snapshot of the labour market at a particularly fine breakdown.

"Access to this information will improve knowledge of the regional labour market among strategy and policy makers, labour market participants and others who have an interest or a stake in each region’s labour market.

"Stakeholders have said they want access to this information for their discussions around the challenges presented in their regions," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The annual reports combine both quantitative and qualitative market information.

The data comes mainly from Population Census 2006, with some additional data from Statistics New Zealand surveys and labour market information from the Department of Labour. The qualitative information has been gathered at a regional level.
