A new tool to encourage agricultural and commercial use of composted organic waste was launched by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today.

CompostNZ is the lead industry organisation that promotes organic resource recycling and use in New Zealand.

Mr Benson-Pope congratulated CompostNZ for taking the initiative to create new markets and establish demand for locally produced, top quality compost.

"Compost is an example of how waste can be converted into a highly sought after, commercial product with environmental benefits," said the Minister at the launch of the Compost Toolkit, held at Perry Environmental Composting Facility in Tauranga today.

Organic waste, such as household garden waste and commercial landscaping waste, is one of the two largest streams of waste going to New Zealand landfills at 23 per cent. Over 312,000 tonnes of organic waste yearly is already diverted from landfill.

"It's time to accelerate our efforts to reduce waste in New Zealand. Individuals must be responsible for reducing, reusing or recycling their waste.

"The Labour-led government will be encouraging households and industry to divert more green waste, food waste and commercial organic waste from landfills. One way will be through the Sustainable Households programme and the introduction of dedicated waste minimisation funding to develop comprehensive nationwide infrastructure," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Ministry for the Environment is also working with the organics recycling industry to further boost its research and development capabilities and provide tools for producers to provide natural alternatives to traditional inorganic fertilisers and pesticides.

"As momentum gathers around the Labour-led government's sustainability agenda we have an opportunity to take big steps forward towards our long-term vision of a zero-waste New Zealand," Mr Benson-Pope said.

The Ministry for the Environment’s Sustainable Management Fund (SMF) contributed $100,500 (ex GST) to help CompostNZ develop the compost toolkit and end-user materials based around the compost standard, published in late 2005.
