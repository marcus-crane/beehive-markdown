International experts in Antarctic fisheries and ecosystems will gather in Christchurch on Monday for three weeks of science analysis, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand is a leading contributor to the Antarctic Treaty System, and we are pleased to have so many eminent Antarctic scientists here, especially during International Polar Year," Mr Peters said.

“They hold a wealth of knowledge, and their work here will contribute to important policy decisions concerning the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean.

"The meetings will focus on methods for assessing Antarctic fish stocks, and for describing relationships among Antarctic marine species. Discussions will also add further understanding to the impact of fisheries – including krill and toothfish – on the Antarctic marine ecosystem.

"This is the first time such a group of scientists have met in New Zealand under the auspices of CCAMLR, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

"CCAMLR was set up under the Antarctic Treaty in 1982 to manage fisheries in the Southern Ocean, and to minimise the impact of fishing on other marine life. New Zealand is a founding Member.

"The findings of this meeting will be fed in to the Antarctic Treaty System through CCAMLR, which meets in Hobart in October," Mr Peters said.
