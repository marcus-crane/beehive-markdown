Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is welcoming the launch of Mâori Television’s second channel, which will ensure a continuing Mâori language presence in the digital environment and faciliate more prime time programming in te reo.

The announcement was made today by Mâori Television chief executive Jim Mather and representatives of the two stakeholders in Mâori Television; Mr Horomia, on behalf of the Crown, and Tu Williams, the chairman of the Mâori broadcasting electoral college Te Pûtahi Paoho.

The new channel is scheduled to be launched next year and will screen 100 per cent te reo programmes over three hours each night between 7.30 and 10.30pm – prime time viewing hours. It will transmit via the Freeview platform and also be free of advertising.

Mr Horomia said the second channel would enable Mâori Television to enhance the services it delivers to fluent Mâori speakers and learners of te reo, without compromising its statutory requirements to promote te reo and tikanga Mâori in both English and Mâori languages to a broad audience.

“There will be no decrease in the amount of Mâori language programming on the first channel – in fact over time the creation of programmes for the second channel is expected to increase the Mâori language content on the first channel.”

The second channel is a key component of Mâori Television’s digital strategy, and will ensure a continuing Mâori language presence in the digital environment.

“This is particularly important as digital technologies are likely to result in more new channels in New Zealand and, without a dedicated Mâori digital television service, there is the potential for a diminished presence of Mâori language and culture in the lives of all New Zealanders,” Mr Horomia said.

The 2006 Health of the Mâori Language Survey (the Survey) showed that 71% of Mâori surveyed watch Mâori language programmes on mainstream television, which shows that there is a need to ensure that Mâori language programmes feature in the digital environment.

In addition the survey revealed a rapidly growing appetite among Mâori adults for Mâori language programmes on television.

“A second channel dedicated to the Mâori language during prime time will support the goals of the Mâori Language Strategy to increase both language skills and the use of the Mâori language in the home.”

The Labour-led government increased Mâori Television funding by $23.1 million over four years in Budget 2007. The money was to support Mâori Television’s plan to move to digital television, to establish infrastructure for it and to add new programming content including on the existing, Mr Horomia said.

“Maori Television has already demonstrated its commitment to public service broadcasting by giving New Zealand viewers new insights into, and knowledge of, Mâori communities, people and events and therefore our national identity.

“It is also becoming an increasingly important language development tool and I have no doubt the extra te reo programming produced as a result of the second channel will continue to enhance both its significance and its reputation.’’

Question and Answers – Launch of Mâori Television’s Second Channel

Launch of Second Channel and increased hours on Existing Channel

1.Why is Mâori Television launching a second channel?

The second channel initiative is a key component of Mâori Television’s digital strategy, and will ensure a continuing Mâori language presence in the digital environment. This is particularly important as digital technologies are likely to result in more new channels in New Zealand and, without a dedicated Mâori digital television service, there is the potential for a diminished presence of Mâori language and culture in the lives of all New Zealanders.

Another aim of the second channel is to better serve the needs of fluent speakers, Mâori language learners and full immersion Mâori language households. A second channel dedicated to the Mâori language during prime time will support the goals of the Mâori Language Strategy to increase both language skills and the use of the Mâori language in the home.

2.Is there a demand for a second channel on Mâori Television?

The 2006 Health of the Mâori Language Survey (the Survey) showed that 71% of people surveyed watch Mâori language programmes on mainstream television – this shows that there is a need to ensure that Mâori language programmes feature in the digital environment.

In addition, Mâori adults have a greater appetite for Mâori language programmes on television than ever before .  
3.How is the second channel funded?

Budget 2007 funded Mâori Television to implement its plans to move to digital television, including the launch of a second channel.

4.What types of programmes will be included on the second channel?

The second channel will broadcast a mix of new programmes, existing library content and international indigenous programmes.

5.How many hours will the second channel broadcast?  
The new channel will broadcast a total of 1,100 hours per year, or three hours per day between 7:30pm and 10:30pm.

6.What is the impact of the second channel on the existing channel?  
The impact is considered to be minimal. The existing channel will retain its current programme format, including the formula for programme selection.

7.How many Mâori language hours will be broadcast on the existing channel?  
The existing channel will increase the number of broadcasting hours to a total of 3,500 hours each year (an increase of 500 broadcast hours per annum).

It is anticipated that as more Mâori language content is made available on the second channel, this can be used to supplement and increase programming on the existing channel.

Budget 2007 Funding for Mâori Television Service

8.How much did MTS receive in this year’s Budget?

Mâori Television received $20.1 million in operating funding and $3 million in capital funding.

9.What was this funding for?

The extra funding is to support Mâori Television’s plan to move to digital television. The funding is also to add new programming content and to establish infrastructure for the digital broadcasting.

Language Revitalisation and Television

10.How does MTS contribute towards language revitalisation and or the goals of the Mâori Language Strategy?

The focus of reversing language shift in New Zealand is to restore intergenerational transmission. Government cannot directly ensure this, as it is a choice for each whânau to make. However, Government can support language revitalisation by providing a supportive environment, especially in homes. Along with other initiatives, Mâori Television helps to achieve this.

The pervasiveness of broadcasting means that it can have a significant impact on individuals, communities, and on wider society. Mâori Television ensures that the Mâori language is recognised as a living language. In turn, this encourages all New Zealanders to value the language as an integral part of our New Zealand society.

General - Digital TV

11.Why has the Government invested in Digital TV?

The government’s rationale for its interest in and support for the introduction of free-to-air digital television is that it wishes to ensure positive outcomes in the following areas:

•Universal access: ensuring that all New Zealanders have free access to digital television services;

•Ownership: ensuring the future viability of government-owned broadcasting entities as vehicles for achieving policy objectives;

•National identity: ensuring the continued presence of public service broadcasting and local content on free-to-air television; and

•Transformation: ensuring that innovations in broadcasting keep pace with related initiatives (for example, government’s National Digital Strategy) in placing New Zealand at the forefront of technological development.

Investing in digital transmission will ensure that the impact of previous investments in public broadcasting are preserved and enhanced.

12.What are the costs for people to sign up to digital service?

In order to receive the Freeview service, the end-users will need:

•A set-top box  
•A satellite dish or UHF aerial (for land-based transmission)

Prices for a satellite dish and a set-top box suitable for satellite transmission retail at a cost of around $600-$700 (excluding installation). Unlike Sky or Telstra Clear InHome TV, no monthly subscription is required to receive a Freeview service.

NB: satellite-based transmission of free-to-air television and radio started 2 May 2007. Rollout of Digital terrestrial transmission (DTT) is expected in February 2008. DTT will provide the lowest-cost digital television option for end-users, who will be able to re-use their existing television sets and UHF antenna, with the addition of a digital set-top box at a retail cost of around $200-$300.

13.Will Mâori viewers be able to afford it?

Figures show that 20-30-% of Mâori subscribe to Sky and therefore will already have a satellite dish. This means that they will only have to purchase a set-top box. Likewise, Mâori that have a UHF aerial will only have to purchase a set-top box. A digital set-top box retails for around $200-$300.

Mâori Television Service will still be available on analogue until analogue switch over (ASO), sometime between 2012 - 2015. This will enable consumers the time to make the necessary purchases to switch over.
