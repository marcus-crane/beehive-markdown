Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today urged recreational fishers to make sure their voices are heard on issues relating to the management of New Zealand’s fishery. “Everyone has a shared interest in managing the resource in a way that provides for our needs today and ensures it is available to us in the future. Right across all dimensions of the fishing sector there is broad support for change,” Jim Anderton said.

Out of the country on a trade mission to the United States and Mexico, his address was delivered by DVD to the Recreational Fishing Council’s Conference being held in Auckland.

“One area where we have seen acknowledgment of overlapping interests is in the work the Recreational Fishing Council has done with the government to promote Shared Fisheries,” Jim Anderon said. “There hasn't yet been a consensus on a particular set of specific proposals, but the recommendations presented to me by the recreational fishing sector, Te Ohu Kaimoana and the Seafood Industry Council identified common ground.”

Mr Anderton talked about the constructive contribution the Recreational Fishing Council is making to fisheries issues but also emphasized that the effective participation of all amateur fishers is essential for Shared Fisheries. “I want to encourage those amateur groups outside the Council to pick up on this opportunity to work constructively with other sectors. You will wither be part of the solution or part of the problem,” he said.

Jim Anderton acknowledged that, as well as the Shared Fisheries proposals, there are many issues being looked into by the Ministry of Fisheries. “There is a lot to consult on, and I know this places demands on the recreational sector. It is essential that you have a strong and united voice if you are to maximise your influence,” Jim Anderton said. “The key issue is that, to make it work, it is essential for everyone to engage constructively, and to work together. I know everyone can't get everything they want. But we should all be able to get what we can accept.”
