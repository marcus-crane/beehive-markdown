Food Safety Minister Annette King says New Zealand’s position as an internationally admired leader in food safety is assured with the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) becoming a fully independent government department.

NZFSA became a stand-alone public service department on 1 July 2007.

Ms King, speaking at a function for NZFSA industry and consumer stakeholders in Wellington today, said: “When it was first set up back in 2002, NZFSA was a semi-autonomous body attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF). Its functions and powers were invested in the Director-General of MAF, and then comprehensively delegated to NZFSA. It was a compromise arrangement for a government agency, but at that time it was accepted that MAF was New Zealand’s only credible brand in international trade.

“However, NZFSA has grown and evolved in the past five years. The NZFSA brand is well recognised and can now confidently take its place on the world stage as a highly reputable and credible agency among consumers of New Zealand food, producers, importers and exporters. It is clear that it no longer needs to be attached to MAF to maintain that credibility,” she said.

“NZFSA will continue to protect and promote public health and safety in relation to food and food-related products, and to develop economic opportunities by facilitating access to international markets for these products.”

Ms King says she is pleased Dr Andrew McKenzie has accepted the role of Acting Chief Executive of the new agency. “Under his leadership, NZFSA has become a vibrant agency with a high level of morale and purpose, respected both within New Zealand and internationally for its people and their ability to formulate and deliver cutting-edge strategy and policy. I am confident that the new, stand-alone NZFSA will continue to serve New Zealand’s interests well into the future”
