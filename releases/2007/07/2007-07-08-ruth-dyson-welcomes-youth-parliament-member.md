Minister for Disability Issues and MP for Banks Peninsula Ruth Dyson today welcomed 17 year old Kaitlyn Gulland as a Youth MP at the start of New Zealand’s fifth Youth Parliament.

Kaitlyn Gulland, from Van Asch Deaf Education Centre, is one of 121 Youth MPs who will get invaluable hands-on experience of how Parliament works.

“Youth Parliament 2007 is about giving young people the opportunity to understand the Parliamentary decision-making process, as well as the chance to express their views to politicians, officials and the public,” said Ruth Dyson.

“Young people are our future leaders and Youth Parliament 2007 is a fantastic way of introducing the next generation to the institution of Parliament. It can only improve the quality of our democracy to have as many New Zealanders as possible familiar with the way Parliament works.”

Youth Parliament is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate New Zealand’s increasingly diverse youth population while increasing understanding amongst different groups within our community, said Ruth Dyson.

“As a Deaf person, Kaitlyn not only represents Banks Peninsula but she represents disabled New Zealanders who are increasingly able to live an ordinary life in our society.”

“Diversity is one of the cornerstones of our government’s vision for New Zealand and our young people are the future of this country. If we can promote tolerance and inclusiveness among them, then the ripples will be felt throughout society.”

Youth Parliament is organised by the Ministry of Youth Development on behalf of the Minister of Youth Affairs, and in consultation with the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and New Zealand’s 121 MPs.

Running in tandem with Youth Parliament 2007 is the Youth Press Gallery where 10 youth participants will duplicate the workings of the actual Parliamentary Press by reporting on the workings of Youth Parliament 2007. They will have their stories reported in the mainstream press.
