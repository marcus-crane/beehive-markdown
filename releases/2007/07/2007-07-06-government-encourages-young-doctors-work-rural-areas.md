The first ever rural medical immersion programme for New Zealand medical  
students was officially launched today by Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor

Six Otago University students are spending their entire fifth year of study  
working in rural communities in Queenstown and the West Coast. Students from around the country typically spend only two to six weeks working in rural practices.

The Government is working hard to address issues around recruitment and retention in rural general practice," Mr O'Connor said at the opening of the pilot programme at the Lakes District Hospital in Queenstown.

"The programme is an important step in encouraging the next generation of doctors to spend time working rural New Zealand.

“It encourages students to consider a career in rural health and it also strengthens rural practice by having rural faculty teaching in the communities.”

The Government is supporting the programme, run by Otago University's Dunedin School of Medicine, with funding of $300,000. If successful the Government would like to see other, similar opportunities made available.

Mr O'Connor said rural medicine was a great opportunity for doctors of all ages.

"Rural health is the one of best forms of medicine around, and provides a stimulating career pathway for medical students and doctors.

"Congratulations to director Dr Pat Farry and the university for bringing the programme to life."

Studies done in Australia have shown students who complete a rural medical immersion programme are more likely to choose rural practice as a career pathway.

The programme adds to a number of initiatives underway to encourage and support health professionals to work in rural areas.

These include:

·The number of fully funded places for General Practice training will rise from 69 a year to 104 from next February.  
·Funding for rural GP training, including 10 rural scholarships to medical school and 20 rural rotations for trainee doctors.  
·From February 2008, up to 20 fifth-year medical students from Auckland University will have the opportunity to spend a year working and studying at Whangarei Hospital and smaller hospitals in Northland.  
·Rural bonus and rural premium funding – to support the rural health workforce.  
·Six rural nurses awarded scholarships to complete their Masters programme and register as Nurse Practitioners with prescribing competencies. A number of other postgraduate scholarships have been awarded to primary health care nurses working with rural populations.  
·Two new funding schemes for midwives practicing in remote and rural areas.  
·The Mobil Surgical Bus, which supports rural health professional development.
