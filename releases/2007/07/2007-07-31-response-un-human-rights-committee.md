The Government has lodged a response to the United Nations Human Rights Committee relating to a complaint about a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Courts Minister Rick Barker said today.

The complaint arose from an opinion from the Committee released in April of this year about an issue in the New Zealand Family Court about a child access case.

“While the views of the Committee are non-binding, the New Zealand Government welcomes the role that the Committee plays and takes its views seriously,” said Rick Barker.

“After a thorough review of the claims made, the Government notes that there were delays in the case but does not consider that they were undue or unreasonable given the complex nature of the child access proceedings,” said Rick Barker.

A copy of the Committee’s opinion and the Government’s response is available on the Ministry of Justice website at [www.justice.govt.nz](http://www.justice.govt.nz), or click [here](http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2007/response-un-hrc/index.html).
