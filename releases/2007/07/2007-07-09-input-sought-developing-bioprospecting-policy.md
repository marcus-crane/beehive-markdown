The government is exploring the idea of setting up a comprehensive policy framework to cover bioprospecting in New Zealand, Energy Minister David Parker announced today.

"The government's focus on sustainability means working to protect our unique indigenous biological resources, at the same time as recognising the potential they may hold for science and economic development."

Bioprospecting is the collection of biological material and the analysis of its material properties, or its molecular, biochemical or genetic content, for the purpose of developing a medical or other product.

"New Zealand does not have a comprehensive approach to bioprospecting policy. A coordinated and comprehensive framework will be more likely to generate and identify opportunities for New Zealand to share in and capture the benefits derived from bioprospecting activity," David Parker said.

"This framework is also needed to protect the use of traditional knowledge, such as Mâori knowledge or mâtauranga Mâori, associated with that biological resource."

The government is mindful of the relationship between the Waitangi Tribunal claim WAI 262 (known as the "flora and fauna claim") and bioprospecting policy. Proceeding with early consultation on the development of a bioprospecting framework should help inform the government's consideration of the Tribunal's recommendations, David Parker said.

Today, the government released a discussion document *Bioprospecting: Harnessing Benefits for New Zealand* as the basis of consultation.

Over the next three months, the government will be consulting with interested parties to build a better understanding of bioprospecting activity within New Zealand, and to see if a comprehensive policy framework to manage bioprospecting activities is needed.

"I encourage all interested parties to actively participate in discussion and information sharing that will contribute to development of the best policy framework for New Zealand," David Parker concluded.

Submissions on the discussion document close on Friday, 12 October 2007.
