Omega-3 produced at a new factory in the Manawatu will be good for both New Zealanders’ health and the health of the economy, Minister for Research, Science and Technology Steve Maharey says.

Mr Maharey today opened the new Speirs Nutritionals omega-3 plant in Marton, which will produce an omega-3 liquid that can be put into foods without a fishy aftertaste.

“Speirs Nutritionals is one of the companies leading the transformation of New Zealand’s food industry, and this factory is particularly pioneering,” Mr Maharey says.

“Omega-3 has a growing market due to its association with reduced heart disease risk, improved immunity, bone, joint and eye health and better brain function. The ability to include it in many different foods is a significant breakthrough. This new technology will really add value to the foods it goes into, creating exciting premium products.

“Such products will become increasingly vital to our economy, which will increasingly rely on high-value products rather than high-volume ones.”

The technology involved was developed in partnership between Speirs Nutritionals, Massey University, The Bio Commerce Centre and the Riddet Centre, which has recently been announced as a Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE).

“Cooperation between business and research organisations is extremely important; this new plant is a great example of this cooperation bearing fruit for New Zealanders.

“Sometimes so-called health foods are more about hype than reality. But Speirs really have the science to back up their product, and can show that it is the real deal.

“I hope that this factory will encourage more businesses to invest in R&D, which the Labour-led government is promoting through the new 15% Research and Development Tax Credit.

“This is the third innovation-based building I’ve opened in the Manawatu-Rangitikei region in 2007 and today’s opening really demonstrates that Manawatu has all the elements to make high-tech industries work.”
