Air pollution from home heating, transport and industry causes almost 1,100 premature deaths in New Zealand each year and costs around $1.1 billion a year, according to a Government-funded study released today by Environment Minister David Benson-Pope and Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

The [Health and Air Pollution in New Zealand (HAPiNZ) study](http://www.hapinz.org.nz/) shows that the highest cost of air pollution is premature death caused by long-term exposure to air pollutants. The main source of air pollution nationally is home heating, with transport being the primary source in Auckland.

"We are repeatedly seeing the damage air pollution does to human health, society and the economy. These effects are felt throughout the country, from towns such as Timaru to cities such as Auckland. We have recently seen improvements to air quality in some areas, such as Christchurch, but this report shows how important it is for all councils to progressively work towards meeting national air quality standards by 2013," said Mr Benson-Pope.

A number of Government initiatives have already been implemented to address air pollution including:

- Agreed [national environmental standards](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/standards/index.html), introduced in 2004, to improve air quality by 2013,
- Transport measures to reduce harmful emissions, and
- Major new sustainable housing initiatives such as the New Zealand wide [Warm Homes project](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/energy/warm-homes/), or regional initiatives such as Environment Canterbury's Clean Heat programme

Five years ago the Ministry of Transport commissioned a study on the impacts of air pollution on public health . Since then the Ministry has been developing policies to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and their effects on New Zealanders.

"This new report confirms that the Government must continue to take a hard line on tackling transport emissions and that the work we are doing must continue if we are to see a measurable improvement," said Ms Tizard.

The HAPiNZ study attributes an overall cost of $1.1 billion to the number of premature deaths from air pollution each year as well as other less obvious public health implications such as days spent in bed, days missed from work, and restricted activities due to illness.

"A number of successful and significant Government initiatives have been undertaken to improve New Zealand’s air. For example, the Government has just committed $72 million over the next four years for energy efficiency measures including funding to help New Zealand families live in warm, dry, healthy-homes that have clean and efficient heating," said Mr Benson-Pope.

A number of measures have also been introduced in the transport sector to reduce vehicle emissions:

- a visible smoke check is now part of the warrant or certificate of fitness test
- proposed changes to the Vehicle Exhaust Emissions Rule to improve the standard of vehicles entering the New Zealand fleet
- improved fuel quality
- new fuel specifications and,
- the Biofuels Sales Obligation

"The Government has made some big in-roads to improving our air quality, but there is still a lot more work to do," said Ms Tizard.

The HAPiNZ study, which was completed over four years, examined 67 urban areas and included 73 per cent of New Zealand’s population.

The $1 million study was jointly funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, the Ministry for the Environment, and the Ministry of Transport, with support in kind from the Ministry of Health and regional councils.
