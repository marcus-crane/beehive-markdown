Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed concern at the human rights situation in Myanmar when he met his counterpart U Nyan Win in Manila today.

“We met because Myanmar is our ASEAN coordinating country for the next three years, and we take our regional responsibilities to ASEAN seriously,” said Mr Peters, who is in Manila for the ASEAN Regional Forum and associated meetings.

“Our position on Myanmar has not changed, however. New Zealand remains deeply concerned about the political and human rights situation, and the lack of genuine reform there. We will continue to express these concerns to Myanmar directly and through appropriate regional forums.

“We would like to see Myanmar’s seven-point roadmap for a return to democracy fully implemented so that we can fully engage with them across the spectrum of our mutual interests.

“I also told Minister Nyan Win that the only way for Myanmar to rebuild its economy and improve the lives of its people will be to win back the confidence and support of the international community by restoring democracy.

“We note ASEAN’s views that engagement with Myanmar, and its continued membership of ASEAN, is the best way to seek to influence developments there,” Mr Peters said.

Myanmar’s status as coordinating country means it represents ASEAN in New Zealand’s regular meetings with the organization. Other ASEAN countries routinely attend ASEAN-New Zealand dialogue meetings, both at Ministerial and officials level. These meetings are co-chaired by New Zealand and Myanmar, with the officials meeting due to be held in New Zealand in December.
