Education Minister Steve Maharey celebrated both Pasifika language and Pasifika educational achievement today, when he launched 'Vagahau Niue in the New Zealand Curriculum' at Manukau’s Favona School.

'Vagahau Niue in the New Zealand Curriculum' is a set of guidelines to support teachers to deliver vagahau Niue (Niuean language) programmes in early childhood services and schools. It joins guidelines for Samoan and Cook Island Maori already available.

“The guidelines we’re launching today open up opportunities for any student to learn vagahau Niue in mainstream and bilingual classes.

“The addition of Pasifika languages to the language curricula enables education services to respond to their communities and to strengthen their contribution to New Zealand’s vibrant and multi-cultural society.

“Students with Niuean heritage will build awareness of their own identity and cultural values, and be able to participate more widely in the Niue community.”

Mr Maharey highlighted Favona school as one that was already making a difference through the use of vagahau Niue.

“Favona recently taught a whole-school topic around healthy eating and healthy living using vagahau Niue. Teachers used games, activities and books to incorporate vagahau Niue into their classroom planning, and the school offers extra-curricular language classes twice a week.”

Mr Maharey said the teaching of Pasifika languages, given a $4.5 million boost in Budget 2006, would continue to pay rich dividends for Pasifika education.

“Under the Labour-led government the number of Pasifika children in early childhood education, the percentage of Pasifika children leaving school with NCEA Level Two, and the number of Pasifika people taking part in tertiary education and modern apprenticeships are all growing faster than for any other group. At the same time, the number of Pasifika children leaving school with no qualifications is shrinking faster than for any other group.

“We are very proud of this success, and of the efforts of Pasifika communities to safeguard, promote and revitalise the use of their languages in New Zealand.”

The guidelines 'Tongan in the New Zealand Curriculum' will be launched next month.
