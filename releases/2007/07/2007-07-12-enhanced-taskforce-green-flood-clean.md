Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope today announced Enhanced Taskforce Green funding to help with the clean-up of flooding in Northland.

"It is the second time this year that the region has suffered flood damage and I have authorised funding for Enhanced Taskforce Green to help with the recovery," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The funding will allow for the employment of workers, supervisors and associated costs.

"The workers will be recruited from the unemployment register, students, and workers who’ve been displaced from their jobs because of the flooding. Taskforce workers are paid full wages.

"Work delivered through the taskforce can include fencing, building repairs, clean-up, re-sowing crops and clearing trees and debris.

"The funding package also includes help for the Far North and Whangarei District Councils. This funding may include light equipment and safety gear, vehicle hire and other necessary tools.

"Individuals or groups needing help to clean up after the flooding can contact Work and Income on 0800 559 009 or approach their local Work and Income office," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Work and Income is also offering emergency assistance to people affected by the flooding. Recoverable assistance payments and Special Needs Grants are available to meet people's immediate and essential needs. People needing help can call the government assistance helpline 0800 779 997.

"This assistance is available for things like repair of septic tanks, the replacement of bedding and furniture, and help with accommodation or food costs.

"As we continue to assess the impact of flooding on communities, government services will evolve to meet these needs.

"The Government is committed to helping the people of Northland get their lives back to normal as quickly as possible," said Mr Benson-Pope.
