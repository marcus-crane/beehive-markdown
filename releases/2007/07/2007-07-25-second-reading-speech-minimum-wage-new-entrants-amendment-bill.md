Madam Speaker

It gives me great pleasure to support this bill in its second reading, and I congratulate Sue Bradford from the Green Party on taking the initiative, introducing the bill to the House and stimulating the debate at Select Committee. I also want to acknowledge and thank the other members of the Select Committee for their rigorous consideration on this issue.

Since Labour was first elected to lead the government at the end of 1999, our governments have reviewed, and then raised, the minimum youth and adult wage annually. And that’s fact that I am very proud of.

It should be noted that under the last National Government the youth minimum wage was only 60 percent of the adult minimum wage. This Labour-led government has not only increased this to 80 percent of the adult rate, but it also has lowered the age of entitlement for the adult rate to 20 years under National to 18 now.

Prior to that, one had to work on the youth rate, if one was on the minimum rate, right up to age 20 years; now it is 18 years.

It is my view that those steps have been very positive.

But it is still obvious that there is a debate to be had about the suitability of paying workers at a different rate for the same job, just because of their age. That debate has in part been held at select committee and it’s now continuing.

Labour recognises that employees aged 16 or 17 often do the same work as adults and therefore earning less than their adult colleagues is unfair.

In employer submissions to the Committee considering the Bill, it was noted though that 16 and 17 year old workers often lack the work socialisation skills that adult workers have.

They also noted that they didn’t think it was fair that a youth supervisor was paid less than the adults they were supervising.

In response to the submissions and the original intent of the member’s Bill, the Committee has proposed that for the first 200 hours of employment a 16 or 17 year old be paid at no less than 80 percent of the adult minimum wage.  
After that 200 hour period, 16 or 17 year old employees will be paid the adult minimum wage.

Those 200 hours of employment can be accumulated across several different employers.

The previous speaker talked about increased compliance costs as if this is a new trigger. Actually this has changed the trigger from two full years and your 18th birthday to 200 hours, which even for a part time worker is a significant step forward.

Concerns that those younger workers who are already in positions of responsibility would be disadvantaged by this Bill have also been answered by the Committee recommending that this minimum rate would not apply to those 16 or 17 year olds who are employed as supervisors.

The enticement of young people away from the education system—from high school, polytechs, apprenticeships, or university—with the possibility of jobs that may pay higher in the short term, but are unlikely to lead to better career prospects long term, is an issue.

The 200 hours threshold is intended to protect against this possible risk of a negative impact if youth rates were completely abolished immediately.

This measure will be yet another step in this Government’s steady progress in ensuring that all workers, including young workers, have fair minimum pay protection.

This year, the youth minimum wage was increased from $8.20 to $9.00 an hour. This stands in stark contrast to the $4.20 per hour under the last National Government in 1999.

From Labour’s perspective, employers’ and unions’ voices, and the voices of young New Zealand workers, should be heard.

The select committee was an appropriate forum to host that debate. I know that the members of the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee gave fair consideration to both the perceptions and the facts around this debate.

I, want to personally thank the members of the select committee for their considered deliberations on this matter.

Their proposals offer a balanced way forward on a complex issue which addresses both employers’ concerns as well as recognising that younger workers doing the same job as adults should be paid fairly.

This member’s bill is another good example of the Labour-led government working with other parties in an MMP environment to achieve the best solution for the diverse interests of all those affected by these proposed changes.

I wish the next stages of this bill very speedy progress.

Thank you.
