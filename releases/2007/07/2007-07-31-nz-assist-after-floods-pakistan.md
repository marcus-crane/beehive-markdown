New Zealand will provide $500,000 in humanitarian assistance to Pakistan following serious flooding there, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

“While the focus of New Zealand’s aid is the Pacific, we are equally committed to helping the people of Asia in times of need," said Mr Peters, who is in Manila for the ASEAN Regional Forum.

“The combined effects of the monsoon season beginning on June 23 and Cyclone Yemyin on June 26 have claimed hundreds of lives across Pakistan.  
"Up to two million people have been affected, with at least 100,000 homeless. Most of those worst hit by the flood are poor and disadvantaged, including many Afghani refugees.  
"These people do not have much to begin with, and are very vulnerable to illness and disease. It’s important New Zealand does what it can to help them recover from this disaster."  
Mr Peters said New Zealand's contribution, through the government’s international aid and development agency NZAID, would go to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to help fund emergency shelter and supplies.
