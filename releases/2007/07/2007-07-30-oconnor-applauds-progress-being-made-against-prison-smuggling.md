Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said today he is encouraged by the progress the Corrections Department is making against criminal behaviour inside prisons.

"I cannot comment on Friday's arrest, but I consider the identification, apprehension and subsequent arrest of any corrections officers undertaking criminal activity to be a sign of success, given my determination to stamp out any illegal, unethical or inappropriate behaviour in the corrections system.

"The Labour-led Government has acted decisively, and has not shied away  
from this issue which the National Party did during the 1990s.

"In the past year, Corrections has set up an intelligence gathering system in each prison and a central investigation unit, and will continue to make improvements where necessary. These changes and improvements should be applauded. They will boost public confidence in the system and reassure the vast majority of hard-working corrections officers that inappropriate behaviour will not be tolerated.

"I am also moving to tighten the Corrections Act to create tougher penalties for smuggling drugs and unauthorised cell phones into prisons.

"The National Party's calls for a political inquiry do nothing to assist the ongoing progress that is being made. It can continue to bleat and the Labour-led Government and Corrections will continue to crack down on inappropriate behaviour.

"But let's put this issue in perspective – less than one half of one per cent of the more than 3000 front line corrections officers are suspended or sacked. However, I will not stand by while the actions of a few rogue officers damage the reputation of the vast majority of front line staff of a few officers do an exceptional job in a difficult environment."
