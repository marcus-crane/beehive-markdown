Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves for South Korea on Wednesday for talks with counterpart Song Min-soon and other Korean government ministers.

Denuclearisation efforts in North Korea, developments in the Asia-Pacific region, and the prospects of a New Zealand-South Korea Free Trade Agreement will be key points of discussion during Mr Peters' trip.

“Korea is one of New Zealand's most important international partners, both in terms of bilateral trade and world affairs," Mr Peters said.

"This visit is the first of the annual exchanges at Foreign Minister level we have agreed should occur as part of the 21st Century Partnership arrangement reached by President Roh Moo-hyun and Prime Minister Helen Clark in December 2006,” Mr Peters said.

“Included in the Partnership was an agreement to undertake a joint study on a Free Trade Agreement, and I will be emphasising the importance that New Zealand continues to put on entering FTA negotiations with Korea.

“This visit comes at a time when the South Korean government is seeking to resolve a major hostage situation in Afghanistan, where 23 Korean civilians are being held by the Taliban.

"The thoughts of the New Zealand government and people are with all Koreans at this time, as are our hopes for a speedy and successful resolution to the crisis," Mr Peters said.

As well as his meeting with Foreign Minister Song, Mr Peters will call on President Roh, and meet with Unification Minister Lee Jae-jung, who responsible for relations between the two Koreas, as well as members of the Korean National Assembly. He will also visit the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, which is just north of Seoul.

At the conclusion of the visit, Mr Peters will travel to the Philippines for the ASEAN Regional Forum and associated bilateral and regional meetings.
