The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, says the biggest research investment round in four years of $628 million will target key priorities like climate change and transforming the economy.

The annual investment round by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology includes $150 million to investigate how to promote sustainability and respond to climate change, and $311 million to boost primary sector research.

"One of the most pressing issues of our generation is to find out more about the drivers of climate change, what the impacts could be for New Zealand, and how we can reduce the risk and adapt to the potential changes.

"In this round, Victoria University has been granted $1.5 million over four years to carry out research in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean to help predict the impact of climate change."

This investment round also includes climate change research by Landcare, NIWA and GNS. They are among more than 30 organisations to receive funding including universities, Crown Research Institutes and private research organisations.

"Primary sector research is the biggest investment in this investment round at more than $300 million. Projects include work by HortResearch using fruit to develop natural ways of fighting asthma and eczema, rather than using steroids.

"This investment by the Labour-led government is vital to continue driving New Zealand's economic transformation, and reinforce our work to improve sustainability and business performance.

"This investment round is the biggest in four years, because of increased funding in Budget 2007 and money being freed up from previous research contracts that have ended.

"It complements the $630 million tax credit in Budget 2007 to boost the level of private sector research, which further underlines the Labour-led government's commitment to research."
