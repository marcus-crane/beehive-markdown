Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia has praised the courage displayed by SAS Corporal Bill Apiata in saving the life of a comrade under heavy fire in Afganistan and says the awarding to him of a Victoria Cross is well-deserved.

Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that she was delighted that the Queen had approved the award of a Victoria Cross to the New Zealand Special Air Service corporal for his gallantry in Afganistan in 2004.

"The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is the supreme military award for valour and when you read the account of Corporal Apiata's actions, there is no doubt he displayed extreme valour. He risked his own life in order to save that of a severely wounded comrade.''

" As Mâori Affairs Minister, I was disappointed that we could not posthumously recognise the bravery displayed by Lance Sergeant Haani Manahi during World War II, although I understood the Queen's desire to respect her father's wish not to make any further such awards for actions relating to WWII."

"Today's announcement is recognition of the contribution made to the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) by an individual, but to me also reflects the significant and valuable role Mâori continue to play in our armed services.''

There are currently 1978 people who identify as Mâori in the NZDF – nearly 14 per cent of personnel, Mr Horomia said.

The citation for Corporal Apiata's award records that the New Zealand patrol troop he was part of was attacked by a group of about 20 enemy fighters in pitch darkness, using rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns and rifles, Mr Horomia said.

As opposing forces pressed their attack towards the two men, Lance Corporal Apiata (as he was then) carried his comrade over seventy metres of broken, rocky, and fire swept ground, fully exposed in the glare of battle to heavy opposing fire, and into the face of returning fire from the main New Zealand troop position.

The citation says that a subsequent medical assessment confirmed that his fellow soldier would probably have died of blood loss and shock, had not Corporal Apiata acted as he did, Mr Horomia said.

Corporal Apiata is 35 years old. He was born in Mangakino, and grew up in Northland and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.

He affiliates to Ngâ Puhi through his father, but also has a strong affinity to Whânau-A-Apanui and the Tukaki Marae in Te Kaha.

Corporal Apiata will be invested with the Victoria Cross for New Zealand by the Governor-General, the Hon Anand Satyanand, at a special ceremony to be held at Government House, Wellington later this month.

Kua whakanuia e te Miniita mō ngā Take Māori, a Parekura Horomia, ngā mahi toa a tētahi hoia o SAS, a Corporal Bill Apiata, ki te tiaki ora I tētahi o āna hoa hoia, I tētahi pakanga nui ki Afganistan, me tana kī e tika ana te hoatu I te tohu Victoria Cross ki a ia.

I pānuitia e te Pirimia a Helen Clark I te rangi nei, e harikoa ana ia, I te whakamanatanga a te Kuini te tohu Victoria Cross, ki tēnei corporal o te  
Rōpū o SAS o Aotearoa, mō tāna mahi toa ki Afganistan I te tau 2004.

Ko te Victoria Cross o Aotearoa, koia nei te tohu o runga rawa mō te whawhai toa, menā ka pānuitia e koe te pūrongo o ngā mahi a Corporal Apiata, kahore he āwangawanga mō ngā mahi tino toa I whakaatutia e ia. I tukuna tōna ake oranga kia tiakina e ia tētahi o āna hoa hoia I te whara nui rawa atu.

" I te hinapouri ahau, te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, kahore I taea e ahau te whakanui I ngā mahi toa a Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi, I te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao, ahakoa I te mārama tonu te hiahia a te Kuini I ngā waihanga a tōna pāpā kia kaua e tukuna anō tētahi tohu pēnei, e pā ana ki WW11. "

"Ko te pānui I te rangi nei he whakanuitanga I te koha a te Rōpū Hoia o Aotearoa a tētahi tangata, engari ki ahau he whakaatutanga anō i te tūranga o te Māori ki roto I ngā ratonga hoia."

I tēnei wā e 1978 ngā tāngata Māori kei roto I NZDF – āhua 14 ōrau o ngā hoia katoa, I kī a Horomia.

I roto I ngā tuhinga mō te tohu a Corporal Apiata, e kī ana, I tau mai tētahi rōpū hoariri 20, ki te patu I te kapa o Apiata I waenga pō, me a rātou kariri nui, ngā pū mihini, me ngā pū tāngata, I kī a Horomia.

I te wā e whakakaha ana te hoariri I te patu hāngai atu ki te tokorua nei, ka hikina e Lance Corporal Apiata ( I taua wā), tana hoa mō te whitu te kau mita, I runga I te whenua kohatu, pākarukaru, I mua tonu I ngā rerenga kariri me ngā puhinga a te hoariri, ki mua anō o ngā rerenga kariri me ngā puhinga a ngā tūranga hoia o Aotearoa.

E kī ana ki roto I te tuhinga, te whakaaetanga a tētahi atotakenga tākuta a muri mai, mehemea kahore ngā mahi a Corporal Apiata, tērā ka mate kē tana hoa hoia, I kī a Horomia.

E 35 te pakeke o Corporal Apiata. I whānau ia ki Managakino, ka tipu ake ki Te Tai Tokerau, me te Rāwhiti o Waiariki.

Nō Ngāpuhi I te taha o te pāpā me te piringa anō ki te Whānau a Apanui, me Tukaki Marae kei Te Kaha.

Ka whakamaua te Victoria Cross o Aotearoa, ki a Corporal Apiata. e te Kāwana Tianara, a Hon Anand Satyanand, ki tētahi hui motuhake, ki Government House, ki te Whanganui ā Tara, a ngā rā ake o tēnei marama.
