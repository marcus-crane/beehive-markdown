State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the next steps towards implementation of the proposed merger of state-owned AgriQuality Ltd (AgriQuality) and Asure New Zealand Ltd (Asure).

"An initial analysis of the proposed merger has indicated that there is a strong case that the merger would lead to benefits for New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.

"Significant quantifiable gains are expected from a merger of the two SOEs, derived mainly from scale and scope economies, increased competitiveness and an enhanced national biosecurity response capability.

"We also expect better coordination of skills, technology and infrastructure across the food and agriculture assurance markets," Trevor Mallard said.

"Cabinet has agreed to undertake the next steps leading towards the merger, and further to this initial analysis, work is now being undertaken on a detailed implementation plan for the proposed merger of AgriQuality and Asure."

An Establishment Committee has been created with an advisory role, to assist the boards of the two companies to progress merger considerations.

John Spencer has been appointed as Chair of the Establishment Committee to lead the merger deliberations.

If the merger considerations are successful, then it is anticipated that the companies could be formally merged as early as October 2007.
