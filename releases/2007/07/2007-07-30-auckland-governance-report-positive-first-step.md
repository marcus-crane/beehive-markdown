The Government has endorsed the Final Report of the Strengthening Auckland's Regional Governance Project as a positive first step for strengthening Auckland’s regional governance, Minister of Local Government Mark Burton said today.

The Government also announced that it will establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry into Auckland. The Commission will examine and report on what local and regional governance arrangements are required for the Auckland region over the foreseeable future.

The membership of the Royal Commission and its terms of reference will be announced in due course. The Commission provides the opportunity for a broader and independent assessment of what is needed to achieve Auckland’s potential to be a truly internationally competitive place to live, work and do business.

"Ensuring Auckland’s future as an internationally competitive city and region is key to this Government's high priority of transforming New Zealand into an economically successful and sustainable nation," Mark Burton said.

"Through the Auckland Regional Project Report, Auckland councils have indicated there is sufficient agreement on the following steps to contribute to stronger regional leadership that is key to Auckland’s success."

The major elements are:

- A strengthened regional council (possibly called Greater Auckland) with all the functions of the current Auckland Regional Council plus some additional responsibilities, such as tourism promotion, regional economic development, and regionally significant events management;
- One Plan for Auckland that will promote social, economic, cultural and environmental wellbeing through prioritised action plans; and
- A Regional Sustainable Development Forum (RSDF), to develop and recommend the One Plan for adoption, the Forum will be a standing committee of the strengthened regional council.

"The aim is for Auckland councils to agree on membership and operation of the Regional Sustainable Development Forum and arrangements for developing and implementing the One Plan before the 2007 local authority elections.

"These and the other parts of the proposal provide a positive way forward to create a sustainable Auckland, and a clear way for the Government to work with Auckland on issues facing the region." Mark Burton said.

"The implementation of the model will now be undertaken by Auckland councils with support and engagement from central government."

Mark Burton said the model provided a platform for enhanced collaboration and improved planning and priority setting for the Auckland region.

"It builds on recent and current work to boost Auckland’s sustainability and competitiveness, and provides opportunities to link local and central government strategies, policies, delivery and funding.

"Work can begin on the model without the need for legislation," Mark Burton said.

I would encourage those interested in Auckland's future and especially those wanting to stand in the upcoming local body elections to read the final report, Mark Burton said.

Details of the model are available in the final report published on the [www.strongerauckland.org.nz](http://www.strongerauckland.org.nz/) website.
