South Korea has New Zealand’s full backing as it seeks to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, Foreign Minister Winston Peters told President Roh Moo-Hyun and Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon in Seoul today.

“We have grave concerns about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, and we support all efforts to bring peace and security to the Korean peninsula,” said Mr Peters, who yesterday was given a tour of the DMZ between the two nations, just north of Seoul.

“It is our long-held view that peace and security on the Korean peninsula is fundamental to the political and economic stability of the wider Asian region.

“President Roh and Minister Song were assured of New Zealand's continuing support for their country’s attempts to engage with North Korea, bilaterally as well as through the Six Party Talks.

“South Korea faces a difficult task in balancing the need to register its strong disapproval of North Korea’s provocative behaviour, and trying to reduce military tension on the peninsula through constructive dialogue.

“Similarly South Korea wants to provide food and other kinds of aid to the people of North Korea, but must keep pressing North Korea’s leadership to take concrete steps towards denuclearisation.

“New Zealand’s willingness to provide development assistance in support of efforts to encourage North Korea to engage more openly with the region was well received by both the President and the Foreign Minister.

“We have offered to contribute to the second stage of an energy package for North Korea once it meets its denuclearisation commitments. We are also willing to consider other forms of assistance, and are happy to be guided by Six Party Talks partners on what form and timing of any such assistance.

”These offers are very much in keeping with our 60-year partnership with South Korea that stretches back to our involvement in the Korean War."

Mr Peters is due to meet North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Pak Ui Chun, when he is in Manila next week for the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference and Regional Forum.
