The Crown represented by Treaty Negotiations Minister Mark Burton, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui and Te Runanga o Ngati Apa Society signed an Agreement in Principle (AIP) to settle the historical Treaty claims of Ngati Apa (North Island) today.

Treaty Negotiations Minister Mark Burton said today’s signing at Tini Waitara Marae in Turakina is a significant milestone for both the Rangitikei-based iwi and the government.

“I would like to congratulate Ngati Apa on reaching this important milestone. The recent significant progress we have made in these negotiations is the result of the constructive and collaborative engagement between the Crown and Ngati Apa, and I am delighted that this has led to our signing of this agreement together today,” Mark Burton said.

“This AIP contains unique redress designed to assist Ngati Apa to reach their objective of revitalising their tikanga (culture) and te reo (language). The Ngati Apa negotiators on behalf of their people, emphasised to me throughout the negotiations the importance of this goal and I am pleased that the Crown has been able to provide tangible redress to support that goal through the settlement".

The redress also includes an agreed historical account, Crown acknowledgements and a formal Crown apology for its breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, cultural redress including the transfer of 13 sites of traditional, cultural, spiritual and historical significance to Ngati Apa (North Island), and financial and commercial redress totalling $14 million, including the return of licensed Crown forest land.

The Crown and Te Runanga o Ngati Apa Society will now work towards a full Deed of Settlement, which will be subject to ratification by all members of the iwi. The parties hope to reach this milestone by mid-2008.

The Agreement in Principle is non-binding, and remains subject to the resolution of any overlapping claims. Following the release of the AIP, detailed consultation with overlapping iwi on the proposed redress package will take place to ensure that the interests of these groups are not prejudiced.

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today Ngati Apa was left with less than one per cent of their tribal whenua as a result of past Crown actions and land purchases, which in turn led to a loss of traditional tikanga and te reo. This is the first time cultural revitalisation redress had formed part of a settlement offer and said it may provide a precedent for other claimant groups. I congratulate Ngati Apa for the innovative approach it has taken to addressing this.

A settlement with Ngati Apa (North Island) will be the first comprehensive settlement in the lower North Island and is another step towards reaching the government’s objective of settling all historical Treaty claims by 2020.
