Finance Minister Michael Cullen flies to Coolum, Queensland next week for the 14th annual APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting.

“This is an excellent opportunity to engage with the leading Finance Ministers of the region and I look forward to hearing their views on issues close to New Zealand’s heart,” said Dr Cullen.

“The 21 member APEC forum remains important to our interests as its economies account for 71 per cent of our two way trade. 14 of our top 20 export markets are in the APEC region.

“It is vital therefore for our future prosperity that we continue working towards APEC’s goal of free and open trade and investment.”

The key themes for this year’s two day meeting are:

- *Making private capital markets work better in the region; and Transparency and sustainability of the public balance sheet.*

“New Zealand has a lot to contribute in this regard. Our public finances are much admired around the world for their openness. We are also committed to improving capital markets and I look forward to discussing KiwiSaver in that regard.

“The forum will also touch on the key economic challenge of energy security and climate change and this will be especially valuable in the context of the government’s proposed emissions trading scheme.”

Dr Cullen will hold bilateral talks with United States Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt, Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi, Chinese Finance Minister Jin Renqing and Chilean Finance Minister Dr Andres Velasco.

The meeting on August 2, 3 will be followed by the APEC Leaders’ Meeting in Sydney on September 8, 9.
