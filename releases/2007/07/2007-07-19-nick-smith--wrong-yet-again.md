Nick Smith either can't understand energy reports or he is trying to mislead the public, Energy Minister David Parker says.

"Last night in the House, National's climate change spokesperson tried to claim that MED's latest Energy Data File showed that coal use in electricity generation had gone up 9.7% last year."

"In fact he got muddled up with the figure for coal production – most of which is exported overseas to countries like Japan (which take responsibility for their greenhouse gas emissions when it's used)."

"The coal consumed in electricity generation in New Zealand actually decreased 4.8% from 2005 to 2006." *

"Nick Smith is either showing his ignorance of basic facts, or he thinks it's ok to try and fool the public," David Parker commented.

"Either way, it's not a pretty sight."
