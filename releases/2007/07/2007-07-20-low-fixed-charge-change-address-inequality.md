Changes in the pipeline to the Low Fixed Charge Tariff option are designed to address an inequality currently being experienced by South Island electricity consumers, Energy Minister David Parker said.

"At the moment, 52 percent of households in and north of Auckland are on the Low Fixed Charge Tariff, whereas only 9 percent of households in and south of Christchurch are.

"It's obvious that many in the lower South Island are missing out on the opportunity to take advantage of this rate for low electricity consumers, due in part to the colder weather in these regions.

"The benefits, while not large, are material for some people."

"The government has moved to address this inequality, by introducing legislation which will allow us to move the eligibility threshold from 8000 kWh per year to 9000 kWh per year for households in Southland, Otago and Canterbury (as far north as Christchurch). This is because 9,000 kWh is closer to the average consumption for this southern region than 8,000 kWh."

David Parker said the industry was consulted about the amendment to the Electricity Act earlier this year, through the Electricity Commission's retail markets advisory group. This group includes representatives from Trustpower, Contact Energy, Grey Power and the New Zealand Family Budgeting Services.

"The Low Fixed Charge Tariff option is a small part of the government's efforts to manage people's power bills. More important is the focus on energy efficiency," David Parker said.

"Promoting energy efficient lightbulbs, assisting the uptake of solar water heating, and providing grants for the insulation of low-income households are other effective programmes we are undertaking to help New Zealanders make more cost-effective use of our valuable energy resources."
