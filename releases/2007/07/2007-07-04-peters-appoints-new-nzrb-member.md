Liz Dawson has been appointed an independent member of the New Zealand Racing Board’s governing body, Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Mr Peters said Ms Dawson had the marketing skills and experience the industry was looking for at board level.

“Ms Dawson has 15 years experience in professional sports administration and marketing, with the New Zealand Rugby Union, the Warriors, the Hurricanes, and the successful Rugby World Cup 2011 bid. She also has a significant level of retail marketing experience,” Mr Peters said.

“The Racing Board has members with a wide variety of skills, but there was a shortage of marketing experience, so the opportunity to appoint a person with such a strong marketing background could not be missed.

"I am sure that Ms Dawson's experience will be invaluable as the Board seeks to give racing the appeal it deserves as an exciting entertainment option."

Ms Dawson’s term will begin on 1 August – the first day of the new racing season. She will join chairperson Michael Stiassny, independent members Julie Crengle and Warren Bell; and industry representatives Alistair Sutherland (thoroughbreds), Ray O'Connor (harness), and Thayne Green (greyhounds).
