Rural Assistance payments through the social support system will be made available to farmers suffering from the drought in the east coast of the North Island.

Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said that Cabinet had today approved the provision of Rural Assistance payments.

Mr Anderton said that despite the recent rain, the drought situation on the East Coast of the North Island remained serious and would continue to be so till well into spring. It was estimated that 36 per cent of beef and sheep farms in the region would be seriously affected and another 45 per cent moderately affected.

"Farms are likely to be further affected next financial year because of flow-on effects of the drought from lower stock numbers and reduced production," he said.

Mr Benson-Pope said farmers in financial hardship could be eligible for rural assistance payments through the Ministry of Social Development, and Cabinet had approved the provision of these payments to the North Island's East Coast farmers today.

"Demand has just started for such payments, but it is expected that demand will increase at the end of winter when farmers have run down their cash reserves. Feedback from MSD regional offices is that the greatest demand for Rural Assistance payments may in fact be in early to mid-2008 as farmers come to terms with financial losses due to drought conditions," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Mr Anderton said MAF would continue to fund agricultural recovery facilitators and field days on management strategies from its adverse events contingency fund until November this year.
