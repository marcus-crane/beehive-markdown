The government is investing another $1.086 million per annum in SAGES, a programme that links older mentors with people in need, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The government has committed around $2 million to the programme since it started in 2004. Older volunteers provide information and support to families in areas such as budgeting, healthy eating, positive parenting and networking.

"The SAGES initiative is about giving individuals and families access to supportive mentors who can help to make a positive change in their lives by passing on some of their life skills," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"For older New Zealanders who choose to participate in the programme, it can be a hugely satisfying experience.

"We’re already hearing back from a number of people for whom the initiative has been hugely beneficial. For example, people are telling us how it’s helped them improve their budgeting, or made it easier to access community services."

The programme is administered by the Ministry of Social Development’s Family and Community Services, which contracts non-government organisations to deliver it. There are currently 15 SAGES providers throughout the country.

The funding for this year will permit two new services to be established.

"What we’re hoping to see is more volunteers signing up to SAGES, who want to make a difference in people’s lives by passing on valuable knowledge, skills and experience," said Mr Benson-Pope.
