The National Party has shown again that its cupboard is bare when it comes to ideas to move New Zealand forward, Acting Agriculture and Biosecurity Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

In a speech today at Federated Farmers, John Key outlined his party's ideas for the rural sector.

Mr O'Connor, who is also Rural Affairs Minister, said the speech was a hollow sham.

"Mr Key outlined three areas he would focus on – strengthening rural communities, climate change, and research and innovation.

"But, as we have come to expect, he offered no detail on how he would achieve any of these.

"On rural communities, it is hard to know how slashing spending on much-needed infrastructure and vital services such as roading, health, education, industry training and police will 'strengthen' rural communities. That was National's policy throughout the 1990s and nothing has changed.

"On climate change, who know what he believes? Only two years ago he said climate change was a 'complete and utter hoax …'. How can the primary sector have faith in Mr Key to fight for New Zealand on economically vital issues such as Food Miles when he is an acknowledged climate change sceptic?

"Finally, National's 'research and innovation strategy' offers nothing that the Labour-led Government isn't already doing. This year's Budget invested an additional $107 million over the next four years to improve performance and sustainability. The Government also aims to further improve R&D spending through a $630 million package that includes tax incentives for businesses to carry out their own research. "

Mr O'Connor said what little actual detail the speech did contain revealed National's true agenda – it wants to return to the failed policies of the past, such as selling off Landcorp farms and privatising ACC.

"Selling Landcorp would deprive New Zealand of a farming organisation big enough to ensure large blocks of marginal land are put into production. It would also close off a vital pathway for young people to start careers in agriculture.

"Privatising ACC would inevitably result in higher premiums for high risk activities such as farming."
