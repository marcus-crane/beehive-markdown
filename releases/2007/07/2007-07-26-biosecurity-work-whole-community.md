“Biosecurity is more crucial to New Zealand than almost any other economy in the world,” Jim Anderton, Minister for Biosecurity, said today. “Many countries around the world are under siege from bombs and bullets. Our bad guys are biological. And we must pull together as a community to defend ourselves.”

Jim Anderton was addressing the New Zealand Biosecurity Institute’s annual conference in Wellington. He added that New Zealand can never let down its guard because there is always the possibility of new incursions. “We are part of the world, and as long as we expect to live in and travel to and from inside it, pests will make their way here, too. So it doesn't make sense to say we will eliminate threats. Our strategy has to be to minimise them as effectively as we can.”

At the start of July MAF Quarantine Service and Biosecurity New Zealand were brought together into a single unit called MAF Biosecurity New Zealand. “This more effectively brings together policy development, risk analysis, standards and operational functions,” Jim Anderton said.

“This does not mean that MAF is responsible for doing all the work. It means MAF is responsible for coordinating what we do to protect our biosecurity − at the border and before the border is reached − by surveillance, incursion responses, eradication programmes, and the transition to pest management.”

“Regional councils and central government agencies with biosecurity accountabilities must work together tackling biosecurity issues. This arrangement reflects that pest management is a responsibility for all of us. It is not something only for central government.

“It's important we get this right because our primary producers are crucial to our economic well-being, and their ability to compete in global markets depends on our biosecurity credibility,” Jim Anderton said.
