Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the appointment of businessman Stephen Tindall as the new chair of the Growth and Innovation Advisory Board (GIAB).

"I am also announcing three new appointments to the board - Icebreaker chie executive Jeremy Moon, farming industry expert Sam Robinson and Business New Zealand chief executive Phil O’Reilly.

"These new appointees will bring diverse skills and expertise to the work of GIAB. The appointments follow the resignations of previous GIAB chair Ann Sherry, Peter Biggs and Theresa Gattung whom I would like to thank for their valuable contributions and hard work," Trevor Mallard said.

The board was established by the Labour-led government in May 2002 to provide the Prime Minister and senior economic ministers with advice on how the government can best promote growth and innovation in the New Zealand economy. The objective is to foster an active sector-public dialogue about growth and innovation issues.

GIAB's focus is on helping determine which policies and practices are likely to work best to support the growth of New Zealand’s business sector, within the context of an inclusive economy (given New Zealand's unique competitive positioning, our history, and our culture), and how they can be implemented, for the greatest possible benefit.

The board brokers links between government and the business sector, to progress the mutual development of strategic growth initiatives. It meets bi-monthly as a full board, feeding advice into the government's economic transformation agenda.

There are 15 board members including chairs or representatives of the boards of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, The Foundation for Research Science and Technology and the Tertiary Education Commission, as well as leading private sector business people.
