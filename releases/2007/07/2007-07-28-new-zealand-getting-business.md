*Speech for dinner at Consul General's Residence*  
*Los Angeles*

Good evening. Rob, thank you for hosting this dinner, and for bringing together such an interesting group of New Zealand business people as well as the UCLA MBA teams who are involved in the Global Access Programme.

I confess that prior to discussing tonight with Rob, I knew nothing about the [Global Access Programme](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x5344.xml), which matches students with existing international technology companies to develop a comprehensive business strategy that is designed to enable the companies to move onto the next stage of corporate development. This next stage might be to launch a new product, locate and secure a strategic partner or to raise additional capital.

I have met enough companies in the growth phase of their lifecycle to know that this can be the most challenging time for a company, so to have a dedicated team of MBA students working on your company, undertaking the necessary research and applying all the skills they have learned to developing real solutions is a real bonus.

Through [New Zealand Trade and Enterprise](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/), New Zealand firms have been participating in this programme since 2002. Over 30 New Zealand companies have benefited already and another 10 have been selected this year. To me it’s a real win-win, with students undertaking applied research. And what a great benefit those firms will gain from the focused attention of some of UCLA’s best and brightest. So congratulations to those New Zealand companies that have been fortunate to be selected.

And thank you to UCLA’s Anderson School of Management for this great partnership that enables New Zealand firms to benefit from the talent you are generating from your world class graduate business school.

I want to talk briefly about New Zealand in 2007. I made the point in an address I gave last year that if you were designing a country, we couldn’t make New Zealand any less efficient in economic terms if we tried.

A significant land mass across two main islands and a dispersed small population; (in other words we have the population of Singapore, which has the advantage of the landmass of our largest lake); 96 per cent of our firms produce around 40 per cent of output, but employ only 30 per cent of employees at less than 20 employees each; (so scale and scope is a serious issue for our firms); we are experiencing the longest period of economic expansion in 30 years, but we have a large trade deficit; we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD, but significant skills and labour shortages; and we have the challenge of the New Zealand dollar at a record high against the greenback, but at the same time we are experiencing historic highs in some commodities (dairy being the prime example).

To deny that these are challenging times would be to deny reality, however I often make the point that I would rather have these challenges than those we faced in the 1990s with mass unemployment and economic recession. I still find it extraordinary that the number of people claiming the unemployment benefit has fallen from just over 170,000 to just under 30,000 in only seven years.

But that brings about its own challenges and skill shortages remain the single greatest barrier to growth in our business sector. That being said, I still have great confidence in New Zealand’s future. Part of that is driven off the inevitable infectious effect of visiting many of our innovative firms and meeting the New Zealanders that are commercialising good ideas and taking on the world. I cannot help but feel optimism when I know the challenges they are overcoming.

For such a small country we have an amazing number of ‘firsts’ in the world and they are still happening; such is the level of innovation and creativity our environment engenders. What we have tried to do in government is to match the business environment to the needs of business in order to support the growth of world class firms that can compete in the global marketplace.

As Minister of Commerce I have been focused on that all important area of ‘red tape’ and have been pleased to lead a totally different approach to identifying the regulatory barriers to growth from the perspective of the firms, rather than from the perspective of the government agencies and I will be making a final report to Cabinet at the end of August. I am very pleased with how that report is shaping up and although it is not earth shattering, I hope it changes the way government does business with business, especially SMEs who feel the weight of compliance more than the bigger companies.

I will say that New Zealand stacks up well internationally on any objective analysis of ease of doing business, such as the [World Bank index](http://www.doingbusiness.org/), which sees New Zealand ranked second only to Singapore. I am hoping that our ranking will be maintained or even restored to number one, given our announcement last week that companies registering on line can now also register for their company tax number with the Inland Revenue Department at the same time. With that number e-mailed back about an hour after registration, (instead of the 10 days it previously took), this makes New Zealand the fastest company registration system in the survey and enables firms to literally hit the ground running.

Another point that I want to mention is that government has been investing in the nation’s infrastructure at a pace where the delivery almost cannot keep up with the budgeted spend.

Finally, I want to mention the importance to New Zealand of its diaspora. This year in New Zealand a not-for-profit organisation called KEA –Kiwi Expats Abroad – won the Vero Small Business Support Supreme Award.

New Zealand has over 20 per cent of its current population living offshore, but I do not regard this as the loss that too many narrowly focused individuals do, (although if you are thinking about coming home, you will be more than welcomed). The point [KEA](http://www.keanewzealand.com/index.html) makes and I endorse is that New Zealanders living abroad are a global network of talent and should be seen as an opportunity for establishing relationships and making connections that can benefit both sides of the relationship.

When you have been away from home for so long it is hard to imagine what the place is like, given that you are relying on your memory for a current image. All I can say is that if you haven’t been there for a while, it has changed – and that change is for the better.

I am very proud to represent New Zealand in my roles as Minister of Commerce and for Small Business. And I will be very proud when as Minister of Women’s Affairs, I present New Zealand’s report to the UN Committee that oversees the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, ([CEDAW](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/)), which is my reason for being in the States.

New Zealand does rate well on the international stage and I think that is in part because we are a small country with big ambitions and we have never been afraid to take a stand on matters that we believe in. And even on CEDAW, we were ahead of the world in terms of granting women the right to vote, so I guess it is only natural that we are doing well there.

So thank you once more for coming out this evening. And thank you once more Rob for your hospitality. It is a genuine pleasure to be able to meet New Zealanders that are settled overseas and to explore what role they see themselves playing in New Zealand’s future. And it is a special pleasure to meet the the MBA students who are helping New Zealand companies achieve their potential.

Thank you.
