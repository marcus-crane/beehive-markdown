National Party MP Simon Power is getting desperate in his criticisms of the Corrections Department's prison build projects, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor says.

Mr Power resorted to rehashing old information in his latest attack in Parliament today on the $890 million Regional Prisons Development Project (RPDP), which is delivering, on time, 1621 new prisons beds across four new prisons to the corrections system, Mr O'Connor said.

"Today's breathless instalment revolves around a letter from Audit NZ to Corrections chief executive Barry Matthews last year, which Mr Power claims is 'embarrassing' for Corrections.

"The information Mr Power uses to criticise the Collaborative Working Arrangement-style (CWA) contracting method is old. The Audit NZ letter was one of many documents reviewed by the State Services Commission a year ago.

"The independent SSC report into the RPDP project, while pointing out some issues early on, gave credit to the department for achieving the overall outcome of the project – to deliver four regional prisons that can accommodate the forecast growth in the prison population.

"The report clearly stated that use of CWA contracting, which is successfully employed on big projects all over the world, was 'appropriate for the nature and scale of the \[RPDP] project'. It is not necessarily the best method for smaller construction projects."
