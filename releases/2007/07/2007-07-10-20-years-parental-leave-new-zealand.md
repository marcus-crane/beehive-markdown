Today is the 20th birthday of the New Zealand law that allows women and their spouse or partner to take leave from work to care for newborn or adopted children while protecting their right to return to work.

Labour Minister Ruth Dyson says today is a wonderful celebration of enabling legislation that supports the work and care choices of new parents.

“The Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 provides a statutory entitlement for women and their partners to take leave from employment on the birth or adoption of a child,” says Ruth Dyson.

“Its genesis was the movement to remove discrimination and provide a job protection framework while parents cared for their children.

“Twenty years on, this Labour-led Government is proud to be continuing this tradition and supporting working parents with children. In 2002, we introduced paid parental leave and since then we have extended the duration of paid parental leave to 14 weeks, broadened the eligibility criteria, and extended paid parental leave to self-employed parents.”

Ruth Dyson says research into the international experience of parental leave shows that a number of countries are strengthening statutory leave policies.

“The overall direction of change is towards increasing the flexibility of leave entitlements to best support families and extend and encourage fathers’ access to parental leave.”

A report on the extensive evaluation of the parental leave scheme released earlier this year showed that the scheme enjoyed support from parents and employers alike, as well as highlighting areas for improvement.

“It is great to remember that 20 years ago today New Zealand took a significant step towards ending discrimination for new parents and that today our law continues to support strong healthy families and the choices of working parents.
