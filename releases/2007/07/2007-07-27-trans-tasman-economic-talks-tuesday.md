Trade, economic and agriculture ministers from New Zealand and Australia will meet in Auckland on Tuesday for the annual CER ministerial talks.

Trade Minister Phil Goff, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton and Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard will be joined by Australia's Trade Minister Warren Truss and Minister of Revenue and assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton.

"CER ranks as the world's most comprehensive free trade agreement which has been of mutual benefit to both countries in enhancing our trading and economic relationship" Mr Goff said.

"Australia is New Zealand's most important market and New Zealand Australia's fifth largest market. Both are key destinations for tourists from each country and New Zealanders and Australians are free to live and work in either country.

"This meeting is an annual opportunity to endorse further collaboration, to review progress on the forward agenda, and to discuss trade policy issues.

"This year's talks will cover a broad range of issues, including regulatory and coordination issues like the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement and food regulation, market access issues, Single Economic Market developments, free trade agreement agendas and broader regional trade issues.

"A food and beverage sector Business Dialogue will run alongside the Ministerial talks and the New Zealand business delegation will be led by Zespri chief executive Tony Nowell.

"A significant issue of contention for New Zealand is that of apple access into Australia. Delays in finalising the Standard Operating Procedure which potentially would allow some access for apples in Australia is on the agenda and New Zealand's views on this issue will be expressed emphatically", Mr Goff said.
