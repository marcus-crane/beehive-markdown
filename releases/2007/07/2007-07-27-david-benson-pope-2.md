The Prime Minister this morning announced that Hon David Benson-Pope has offered his resignation from all portfolio positions.

The Prime Minister has forwarded advice to the Governor General to accept that offer.

"The way in which certain issues have been handled this week has led to a loss of credibility and on that basis I have accepted Mr Benson-Pope's offer to stand aside," Helen Clark said.

"I regret that this has happened, because Mr Benson-Pope has been a capable and hard working minister. Issues this week, however, leave no alternative," Helen Clark said.
