New Zealand women deserve better than the ill-informed musings and hollow promises of a National MP, Women’s Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

“Jackie Blue’s claim National would increase funding for the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and move the Ministry to more ‘active work’, smacks of breathtaking hypocrisy and ignorance.

“Not only has National’s policy been based on closing the Ministry altogether, National has opposed every advancement of issues important for New Zealand women since 1999.

“National’s reported change of heart sounds remarkably like another National party hollow promise to secure support, when the party’s actions have spoken volumes about its true position.

“National has opposed legislation, policy programmes and real initiatives aimed at supporting New Zealand women and New Zealand families. National’s record has been to oppose paid parental leave, pay and employment equity measures, the Working for Families programme and the 20 hours free early education childcare scheme.

“The National MP is apparently so concerned that she has put out six press releases since 2006 (the last one in March) and she did not take the opportunity to speak during the Appropriations debate in the House this week,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“Meanwhile, this Labour-led government is getting on with real work in advancing important issues. The Ministry has a [five-year action plan](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/news-and-pubs/publications/action-plan.html), developed from consultative meetings, and supported through high quality research and policy advice including gender analysis.

“This work ensures that all government departments deliver real outcomes for women through advances in economic independence, work life balance and wellbeing.
