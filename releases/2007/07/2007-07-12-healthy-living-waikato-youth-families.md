“Helping Waikato people to lead healthy, productive lives with the confidence that care and support is available when they need it is the focus of the Ministry of Social Development’s Annual Regional Plan for the Waikato,” said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta at the launch today.

The regional plan is one of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand. The plans set out each region’s specific needs and development opportunities and how the Ministry is responding to these.

“It outlines what the Ministry is doing to support tamariki, rangatahi, kaumatua and whanau, as well as those seeking work and the wider community. It also highlights what is being done to address the issue of family violence,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

Initiatives include the Youth Transition Service launched last month in Huntly, Ngaruawahia and Raglan. This service aims to ensure that rangatahi successfully transition from school to further education, training or employment. It encourages young people to develop their aspirations for the future and provide them with support to move down their chosen path.

Another youth initiative is to ensure that local teenage parents have access to the support and opportunities they need to succeed in life as individuals and parents. The Ministry will continue to support the Teen Parent Unit based at Hamilton’s Fraser High School to assist young parents to remain in education throughout pregnancy and parenthood. This holistic approach and supported environment has been paramount to the success of the unit, with 37 enrolments at the end of March 2007.

The Minister says the strength of the plan lies in the cohesive central government approach to local issues and their engagement with local communities.

“All the central government’s Social Development agencies are working together on this one plan for the benefit of the Waikato. And they are engaging with local community based organisations and using local knowledge and resources to resolve local issues,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

‘These connections are important to building strong, resilient and sustainable families and communities. And as this Labour-led government knows, strong communities build a strong nation.”

Nanaia Mahuta says, “Helping to create safe and positive environments is at the core of the work involving children and the region is investing in services that identify and support families with needs.”

“The plan includes a number of significant projects that will have a positive effect on people living in the region,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
