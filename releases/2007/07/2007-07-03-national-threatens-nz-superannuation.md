John Key needs to urgently clarify his party’s position on the future of New Zealand Superannuation following the unprecedented comments from his finance spokesperson, Bill English, in today’s New Zealand Herald.

Mr English is quoted in today’s Herald saying that the Labour-led Government is being too generous in its support for retired New Zealanders – the clearest indication yet that a National government would cut New Zealand Superannuation and KiwiSaver.

“All New Zealanders should be worried that National is dropping hints about scrapping universal superannuation,” Acting Finance Minister Clayton Cosgrove said today. "Labour has publicly committed to funding both KiwiSaver and New Zealand superannuation – National has so far refused to do the same.

"It was, after all, a National government with Bill English sitting around the cabinet table that cut superannuation in the 90s."

Mr English is also quoted as saying one of the reasons National is backing away from supporting superannuation is that it is unlikely to get votes for National at the next election, especially from young voters.

"This is blatant political expediency – Bill English isn't even trying to hide it. While this government is preparing for the challenges of an aging population, National is only worrying about winning votes to get into government at any cost. This proves yet again that they cannot be trusted in government.

"John Key claims to be the leader of the National Party and it's time for him to come clean with all New Zealanders and tell us whether National can be trusted not to cut Superannuation again."
