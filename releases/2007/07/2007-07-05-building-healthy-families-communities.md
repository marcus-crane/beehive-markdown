"Preventing family violence and the needs of rural communities are two priorities in the Ministry of Social Development’s Annual Plan for Taranaki, the King Country and Wanganui region," said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta at the launch today.

The regional plan is one of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand over the coming fortnight. The plans set out each region’s specific needs and development opportunities and how the Ministry is responding to these.

“The plan outlines what the Ministry is doing to support young people, families, people seeking work and the wider community. It also highlights successes in the area of youth employment. Most Work and Income service centres in the region are reporting zero levels of youth unemployment - the best result in 20 years,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

One such initiative is the Heartlands Service, which involves the Ministry working to bring more services to Heartland Service Centres based in Hawera, Taihape and Taumarumui. These centres, supporting our smaller rural communities, are one-stop shops that bring together services from government and non-government agencies.

"We’ve identified that for we need a much stronger focus on preventative actions especially at critical points when people are at their most vulnerable. These include early childhood, the transition from school to study or employment, parenthood and retirement.

"We want people to lead healthy, productive lives with the confidence that care and support is available when they need it.

"All the central government’s social development agencies are working together on this one plan for the benefit of the region. And they are engaging with local community based organisations and using local knowledge and resources to resolve local issues.

"These connections are important to building strong, resilient and sustainable families and communities. And as this Labour-led government knows, strong communities build a strong nation,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Further information

The regional plan outlines the activities of all of the Ministry’s service lines within the Taranaki, King Country and Wanganui region. These include: Child, Youth and Family, Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Integrity Services, and Senior Services.

Some of the key projects included in the regional plan are:

·Preventing family violence: The Ministry is working closely with other agencies in the region to address issues of family violence. Ministry family violence co-ordinators are working with other agencies in Te Rito Collaborative management groups in Wanganui and Taranaki. Also through Child, Youth and Family, the Ministry is piloting a new inter-agency approach to social work in Taranaki.

·Heartland Services: The Ministry will be working to bring more services to our Heartland Service centres based in Hawera, Taihape and Taumarumui. These centres, supporting our smaller rural communities, are one-stop shops that bring together services from government and non-government agencies.

·PATHS (Providing Access to Health Solutions): This programme was launched in Wanganui in June 2007 and is also operating in Taranaki. It aims to help people facing health barriers into work by bringing employment, training and health services together in a much more co-ordinated way. Regional PATHS workers are based in Work and Income service centres so they can work directly with clients.

·Through Child, Youth and Family there will be a dedicated Youth Justice team based in New Plymouth. The Wanganui and New Plymouth Youth Offender teams have led discussions on youth offending and are considering adopting the ‘Rock On Truancy’ programme.

·A Positive Programme for Parents - the Te Whanau Oranga programme is held on a Marae. This programme is run by ‘Mahia Mai a Whai Tara’ who are based in Waitara and are contracted to, and funded by Child, Youth and Family. The weeklong family programme includes budgeting advice, parenting skills and presentations from groups and agencies who provide services to support families and communities.

·This year, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other agencies, the region will, through the Ministry of Youth Development, highlight adolescence as a critical developmental phase and draw attention to the need for more ‘youth-friendly’ health services that are accessible across the region.

·The region is focusing on the development of initiatives such as the early assessment and counseling pilot for people with stress-related disorders, which has run in partnership with primary health organisations in Taranaki and Wanganui. We will pursue the availability of services that can provide expert drug and alcohol treatment coupled with a strong employment emphasis.
