Funding of $32 million will help 62 schools across the country build new facilities, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The funding is part of the [Schools Property Guide Programm](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=10924&data=l)e, which enables schools to enhance their learning environments and accommodate increased numbers of students.

"The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring all schools can create world-class environments for better teaching and learning," Steve Maharey said.

"It's up to the schools to decide what capital works they use the funding for. In the past schools have used funding from the programme for extensions to buildings or new administration blocks, halls and gyms."

The School Property Guide Programme has been operating since 1999 and has provided funding to over four hundred schools to date.

"Schools will be able to combine this funding with other property budgets they already have, such as the schools five year property programme to add new buildings and upgrade existing property," Steve Maharey said.

"The government currently invests $527.8 million a year in school property. The increase in property funding we've made since 1999 means instead of filling up potholes and mending the roof, schools can now use funding to continue modernising their buildings and creating environments suitable for the 21st century."
