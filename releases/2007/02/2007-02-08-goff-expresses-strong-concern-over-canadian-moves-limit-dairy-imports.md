Trade Minister Phil Goff today conveyed directly to Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson the New Zealand government's strong concern over Canada's plans to limit international imports of dairy based products.

"Canada today announced that it will invoke GATT Article 28 to limit imports of Milk Protein Concentrates", said Mr Goff.

"The decision may have significant implications for New Zealand dairy exports. This market is currently worth several million dollars to New Zealand and has significant potential to be worth much more.

“The decision by the Canadian Government to place limits on the importation of dairy ingredients that have previously entered the market freely goes against our long and mutually beneficial trading relationship. It also sends a negative signal to trading partners at a time when our shared commitment to freeing up international trade under the Doha Round negotiations is critical.

“The products in question fill an important market niche in Canada. Processors of dairy products and Canadian consumers alike benefit from these imports and constraints on imports will drive up costs for both.

"New Zealand will defend our World Trade Organisation (WTO) rights in this area, and insist on compensation for any trade losses suffered as guaranteed under GATT Article 28. This is a WTO mechanism that allows members to withdraw concessions agreed under the Uruguay Round and renegotiate tariff bindings.

"In the negotiations required under Article 28, New Zealand will be arguing strongly for the least restrictive regime possible and full compensation for any changes which might affect the New Zealand dairy sector.

"In my discussions with Minister Emerson, I left him in no doubt as to the seriousness with which New Zealand views these developments", Mr Goff said.
