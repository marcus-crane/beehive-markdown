Justice Minister Mark Burton and Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor today released the terms of reference for the Government’s review of the sale and supply of liquor to under-18-year-olds.

The review’s goals are to determine the harm caused by the sale and supply of liquor to minors, evaluate the effectiveness of current restrictions and develop proposals that might be necessary to address the causes of harm.

The project will also include a review of the provisions of the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 relating to the sale and supply to minors.

"The impact of underage drinking is significant for our communities and young people. This is why it's critical that we have a complete and factual picture of how under-18-year-olds are getting alcohol and accompanying trends," Mark Burton said.

"The scope of the review will mean that the underlying causes of harm to youth arising from drinking are fully canvassed; and that detailed proposals are developed to address the problems," Damien O'Connor said.

"The review will comprise two phases," Damien O'Connor said.

"The first phase will consist of research and analysis. Phase two will set out options and recommendations for reform for Cabinet to consider. Cabinet will finalise the timeline so that the matter is progressed this year."

"The debate that took place in November around Government MP Martin Gallagher's Bill concerning underage drinking highlighted a need for a focused review looking specifically at the effectiveness of current restrictions applying to under 18 year-olds," Mark Burton said.
