New Zealand has approached the Japanese government urging it to act in the best interests of the Nisshin Maru's crew and the sensitive Antarctic marine environment and take immediate action to move its stricken ship.

"Japan has cancelled the distress call for the Nisshin Maru because the fire on board is contained, the internal temperature is dropping, and the ship is no longer listing. This is good news, and I congratulate the Japanese crew on their efforts," Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"However, based on the limited information available, it appears unlikely propulsion can be restored to the Nisshin Maru. Electrical equipment has burnt out, including the main switchboard. It is effectively immobilised and without power in one of the most extreme marine environment's in the world.

"New Zealand believes it is imperative that the Nisshin Maru is towed further away from the pristine Antarctic coast, the neighbouring penguin colony, and the perilous ice floes in the ship's vicinity," Mr Carter said.

"At present there is a window of good weather which may last for two days. New Zealand has today contacted the Japanese government in Tokyo, and I have spoken to the Japanese Ambassador in Wellington, urging Japan to make the most of the benign weather and move the Nisshin Maru out of Antarctic waters in the safest and most practical way.

"Our information is the Nisshin Maru is currently lashed between two other Japanese whaling vessels, the Oriental Bluebird, which is a tanker carrying fuel, and the Yushin Maru II. These vessels are helping the ship avoid icebergs, but Maritime New Zealand fears this arrangement could become very dangerous if the weather turns and the seas become violent," Mr Carter said.

"New Zealand has made arrangements through the United States (US) Antarctic base in McMurdo Sound to get pictures to improve our assessment of the ship's situation. We are very pleased to welcome this cooperation from the US."

The pictures are dependent on the weather.
