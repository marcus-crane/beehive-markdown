A report released today by Forestry Minister Jim Anderton says a key aspect of New Zealand’s climate change policy is to use the carbon dioxide absorbed by forests to offset increased greenhouse gas emissions from other sources.

This study, prepared by Canterbury University’s Dr Bruce Manley:

1. delivers an update of deforestation intentions collected in a survey in 2005;
2. Presents new information sources on deforestation;
3. Quantifies future deforestation to 2020; and
4. Comments on uncertainty around deforestation intentions.
