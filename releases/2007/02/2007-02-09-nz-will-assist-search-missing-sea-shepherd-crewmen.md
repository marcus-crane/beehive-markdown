The New Zealand government will assist in any way it can to locate two Sea Shepherd activists missing in a Zodiac in the Southern Ocean, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"We learned early this afternoon that two crewmen from the Sea Shepherd's vessels are missing, and have been since mid-morning. This is deeply concerning, and what the New Zealand government feared most when the Japanese whaling fleet began whaling this year," Mr Carter said.

"While we are constrained by distance and the inhospitable environment in the Southern Ocean, New Zealand will help as much as we can in the search for these men. We have already issued a broadcast to all of the surrounding ships, and Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Co-ordination Centre is co-ordinating with nearby vessels, including Japanese whaling vessels, to assist in the search."

Mr Carter said media had also been enquiring as to whether the Sea Shepherd ships would be admitted to New Zealand ports now that they have been deregistered in their countries of origin.

"Standard procedures will be followed if the Sea Shepherd asked for one of its vessels to come to New Zealand. No formal request has been received as yet," Mr Carter said.
