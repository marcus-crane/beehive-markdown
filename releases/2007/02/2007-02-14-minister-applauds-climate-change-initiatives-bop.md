Climate Change Minister David Parker has applauded three Bay of Plenty initiatives, which tackle climate change in three different ways.

This morning the Minister spoke at the Dune Restoration Conference underway in Tauranga. "Enhancing and restoring our coastal dunes is an important insurance policy against sea level rise and storm surges," David Parker said. "I was pleased to see the actions being undertaken to make our coastlines more resilient."

Mr Parker also called into Argent Energy New Zealand, a subsidiary of a UK company, which produces biofuels.

"The government has just announced that it expects to see oil companies selling 3.4% biofuels by 2012," Mr Parker said. Argent Energy, which is already working on a feasibility study for a biodiesel plant in NZ, says the government's move provides added investor confidence for this plant to go ahead.

"That's great news, and proof that our policies will help business move New Zealand towards a sustainable future," Mr Parker said.

David Parker then visited Ballance Agri-Nutrients in Mt Maunganui. "This company is advocating the use of nitrogen inhibitors and nitrogen budgeting for farmers. This means farmers can cut nitrous oxide emissions, at the same time as saving money and reducing nitrogen run-off into streams and rivers."

"Projects such as these demonstrate how New Zealanders are already working to overcome the challenges of climate change," David Parker said.
