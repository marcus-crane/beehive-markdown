Following the release of a report into imported GM corn seed, Jim Anderton, the Minister for Biosecurity, has said that failures identified within the MAF Quarantine Service are disappointing and unacceptable but will be fixed without delay.

"David Oughton's report shows that we have the appropriate policies and standards in place to manage GM risk but clearance practices followed by frontline officers have been inadequate. There are many reasons why these mistakes occurred but there are no excuses. As the Minister responsible, I am ensuring that all the changes necessary to get compliance with the Government’s strict border requirements are made as soon as possible," Jim Anderton said.

The report by David Oughton, Inquiry into the Circumstances Associated with the Imports of Certain Corn Seeds in Late 2006, was commissioned by the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Murray Sherwin, who released it today.

"MAF has already begun to implement the recommendations of the report, particularly with regard to the computer system and training issues. I expect these deficiencies to be remedied and for the Quarantine Service to learn from the mistakes made so they are never repeated," said Jim Anderton.

A staggering volume of material and numbers of people are continually entering into New Zealand. Every day around 120,000 mail items, 12,000 passengers, 1500 sea containers, 400 vehicles and 82 aeroplanes arrive in New Zealand. This results in quarantine officers undertaking more than 13,000 inspections and making 31,000 data entries every day. And many of these volumes are on the increase.

"With those sorts of numbers, the complexity of managing threats at the border is growing. The Labour-Progressive Government has increased Biosecurity funding by 85% and nearly tripled the number of quarantine staff to meet increases in trade and travel volumes. Biosecurity is a rapidly evolving area and one about which New Zealanders’ expectations are growing. The truth is that we can never completely eliminate risk but we must have the best systems possible to minimise it," Jim Anderton said.
