"Here we go again,” Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today after the National Party’s latest flip-flopping policy on Mäori seats and the foreshore and Seabed.

“First they wanted to scrap Mäori seats altogether, then they decided they’d keep them, then they wanted to ask Mäori when they wanted to get rid of the seats, now they want to scrap them again,” Parekura Horomia said.

“The Mäori Party was led to believe they might have National’s support to send Tariana Turia’s private member’s bill to select committee, then John Key went back on his word.

“It’s no wonder the Mäori Party and Mäoridom are feeling aggrieved.

"This is what happens when you get policy developed on the hoof, and you ‘make the deal on the day’, depending on who your audience is.

"I have been consistently saying to Mäori people that they need to maintain a healthy scepticism towards softer National Party language on Mäori issues.

"I have every sympathy for the Mäori Party who may well feel led up the garden path by John Key on these issues."
