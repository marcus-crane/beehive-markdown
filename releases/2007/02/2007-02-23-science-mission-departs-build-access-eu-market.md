A mission of New Zealand scientists, business people and officials will depart for Europe on Monday, to hold talks and develop formal agreements with EU countries and science institutions, led by the Minister of Research, Science and Technology (RS&T), Steve Maharey.

Mr Maharey is the only minister from a non-EU country to have been invited to launch the world's largest publicly funded research and development programme, the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7).

"I will be meeting my European counterparts to discuss FP7, which has a budget of $100 billion over the next seven years, and to profile New Zealand research strengths.

"I will also advance the case to set up a Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement with the EU, and press for New Zealand involvement in new research programmes."

Mr Maharey says it's the first time in at least 15 years that a New Zealand science minister has had this kind of access to key players in science in the EU.

"This gives New Zealand a huge opportunity to get involved in research projects and sign memoranda and agreements with European countries for future collaborations."

The delegation leaves on Monday 26th February for an 11-day mission, which includes reinforcing bilateral ties with Germany, and holding talks with government ministers and officials in Denmark and Finland.

"Both of these countries transformed their economies by developing high technology, with Finland hugely benefiting from companies like Nokia, and New Zealand has a lot to learn from them."
