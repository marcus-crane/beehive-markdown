Government minister and Progressive leader Jim Anderton said today in Parliament that the government had laid a foundation of accomplishments over the past seven years, which meant that New Zealanders could face the future with a sense of optimism and confidence.

"This Labour-Progressive government is moving forward on the challenges ahead of New Zealand - from climate change, to social inclusion and ensuring opportunity for all. We are delivering the jobs and opportunities we promised New Zealand. I used to have a mantra when I became a minister that the problems of thirty years of mismanagement of New Zealand could not be solved in three years.

"In the last seven years there has always been a National Party opposition in this House wanting to turn back the clock and go back to the failed policies of the past. As this government created jobs and improved the incomes of New Zealanders, the National Party was opposed. They always promised to undo everything and go back to the job-destroying policies that stunted New Zealand's development in the eighties and nineties.

"As this Labour-Progressive government worked to protect the most vulnerable and ensure everyone had a place in their community, the National Party was always promising to go backwards. They opposed four weeks annual leave, but it's beginning on 1 April. They opposed working for families, but on 1 April eligible families will get $10 a week extra for each child. They opposed any increase in the minimum wage when it was $7.50 an hour. On 1 April it goes to $11.25 an hour for an adult and $9 an hour for young people and those in training.

"They opposed free childcare for pre-schoolers, but on 1 July parents will have access to twenty hours free each week. They tried to cut superannuation, but this coalition government has made super more secure with the NZ Superannuation Fund and Kiwisaver. They opposed 12 weeks paid parental leave to keep families together at the time they need it most – now it is 14 weeks and this includes self-employed people too.

"They opposed NZ Trade and Enterprise and every measure this government has put in place to work with governments and open new, export led, high-value, high-skill jobs for New Zealand. They even vehemently opposed Kiwibank, which is now a runaway success!

"But there is no point in trying to create a stronger economy unless we take all New Zealanders with us. Surely we learned that lesson in the eighties and nineties. You cannot have a strong economy when huge parts of New Zealand are struggling or being smashed. This government is ensuring that everyone has an opportunity and that we care for our most vulnerable citizens.

"I have a challenge for the National Party. Agree that New Zealand is on the right track and that New Zealanders have repeatedly chosen a fairer, stronger, inclusive New Zealand ready for the future - or admit that they still want to go backwards," Jim Anderton said today in the House.
