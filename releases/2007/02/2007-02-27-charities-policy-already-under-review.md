Finance Minister Michael Cullen says John Key's latest proposals on charitable giving are already under active consideration as part of the confidence and supply agreement with United Future.

"A discussion document on these matters is in the public arena and Mr Dunne and I have already been in discussions about the response we will make.

"The lack of policy in the National Party is obviously getting to Mr Key. Despite his talk of a "bold" policy, this is just a cut and paste from the discussion document.

"This means there is no real novelty about any of this. Announcements will be made in the context of the Budget," said Dr Cullen.
