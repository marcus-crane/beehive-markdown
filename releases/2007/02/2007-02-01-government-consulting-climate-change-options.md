The government is seeking direct feedback from farmers and foresters on ways to deal with climate change issues.

Farmer and forester forums are being held in eight North Island and five South Island centres over the next two months.

A discussion document released in December, Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change, puts up options to help the agricultural and forestry sectors deal with the effects of climate change.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Jim Anderton, says the government wants to know which mix of options is preferred by the sectors.

“The focus is on helping the sectors adapt to the impacts of climate change, make the most of business opportunities presented by climate change, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and increase forests (which absorb carbon).

“These public forums are the start of what I hope will be long term discussions with the sectors. Climate change issues are going to be on the table for decades to come, and solutions are going to depend on a constructive and durable relationship with the land management sectors,” Jim Anderton said.

David Parker, Minister for Climate Change Issues, said climate change is a reality. "No government can afford to ignore the economic, social and environmental impacts. We need to work closely with the sectors to ensure we put in place short and long-term measures.

"Every sector of the community is going to have to address climate change, not just agriculture and forestry.”

The farmer and forester forums will run from 13 February until 8 March in Gisborne, Nelson, Hamilton, Hastings, Whangarei, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Masterton, Christchurch, Invercargill, Greymouth and Dunedin. Details are attached.

Submissions on the discussion document close on 30 March 2007. No decisions will be made on the preferred policy package until after the submissions have been considered.

Regional hui are also being held in Gisborne, Nelson, Hamilton, Whangarei, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Christchurch, and Invercargill to discuss the government’s wider climate change and energy plans with Maori.

The document can be ordered on 0800 CLIMATE or downloaded from www.maf.govt.nz/climatechange. Details of the meetings are also available.
