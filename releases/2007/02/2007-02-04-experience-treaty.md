New Zealanders are encouraged to experience the Treaty of Waitangi during the touring Treaty 2 U exhibition or to view the original Treaty in Wellington on Waitangi day.

Treaty 2 U, which is touring 27 centres throughout New Zealand over 3 months, uses aged replicas of the nine Treaty documents and enables New Zealanders to experience the Treaty through sight, sound, video, cartoons, and animated graphics.

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says, " I would like to encourage all who have the opportunity, to visit Treaty 2 U. The Treaty of Waitangi continues to help us understand the past, make sense of where we as a people are now and builds on our national identity for the future."

Treaty 2 U covers the events that led up to the Treaty, from first contact between Mâori and Pâkehâ, to lengthy debate the night before signing. It explains what is written in the documents and the crucial differences between the Mâori and English versions. The exhibition follows the documents’ journeys during 1840 as more signatures were sought. And it looks at the varying expectations held by Mâori and Pâkehâ groups.

The exhibition is presented by three organisations with leading roles to play in looking after this country's treasures - The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Archives New Zealand, and the National Library of New Zealand.

Judith Tizard, Minister for both Archives New Zealand and the National Library and Associate Arts Minister, says the Treaty is one of this country's cultural treasures.

"The Treaty is one of just 120 documents in the world which are listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register because of its significance.

"On ANZAC day we visit war memorials or the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior; so on Waitangi Day, if you're in Wellington, head along to see the original of the Treaty of Waitangi."

The original Treaty of Waitangi is on permanent display at Archives New Zealand in Wellington.
