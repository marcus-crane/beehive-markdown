New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Saudi Arabia will be career diplomat Trevor Matheson, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Based in Riyadh, Dr Matheson will also be non-resident ambassador to the other Gulf Cooperation Council states of United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait.

“These countries are key partners for New Zealand in the region, and central to our interests in the wider Middle East," Mr Peters said.

"New Zealand's trading relationship with the GCC states is also important, which is reflected in the recent decision to negotiate a high-quality free trade agreement with them.

"Annual exports to the GCC states are worth more than $700 million, while they supply a significant amount of our oil imports.

“The Middle East is rapidly becoming a key outlet for our high quality niche products and services. Education is an area of particular growth, with Saudi Arabia recently announcing that over 350 scholarship students will be eligible to apply for study in New Zealand this year," Mr Peters said.

Dr Matheson, who takes up his appointment in May, was previously Private Secretary to Trade Minister Phil Goff, and to former Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton. His previous posting were to Geneva, Canberra and Rarotonga.
