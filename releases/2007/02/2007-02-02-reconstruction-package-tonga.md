New Zealand will provide up to $2 million towards a reconstruction package designed to support business recovery in Tonga following November’s riots in the capital, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“Around 136 businesses were directly affected by the riots and there have been severe repercussions for the Tongan economy," Helen Clark said.

“New Zealand will contribute to a Business Recovery Fund designed to spark the economic recovery and assist those who are most in need of help.

"The Business Recovery Fund will target small to medium size businesses, and will offer a business advisory service, loan subsidies for up to two years, and a credit guarantee scheme.

“The scheme has been jointly designed by New Zealand, Australia and the Government of Tonga. The package is a significant step on Tonga’s road to recovery and will help business owners repair and rebuild, as well as rehire employees," Helen Clark said.

Winston Peters said that to ensure accountability and transparency, New Zealand’s contribution will be held by the Reserve Bank of Tonga.

"The Reserve Bank of Tonga will distribute the funds to the commercial banks to reduce the cost of loans to individual business owners meeting the approved criteria. An independent monitor will be appointed to oversee the process," Winston Peters said.

“The recovery package will be funded by a reprioritisation of New Zealand’s existing $10.1 million annual bilateral aid programme with Tonga. Australia and the Government of Tonga are also likely to contribute to the fund.

"New Zealand provided $500,000 in assistance to Tonga immediately after the riots, funding expertise in areas of revenue loss, insurance loss adjusters, prosecution, defense and administrative law/constitutional reform," Winston Peters said.
