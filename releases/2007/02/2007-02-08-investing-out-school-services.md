New research on out of school services will be useful in planning further Government investment in the sector, Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope says.

The Minister welcomed today's release of the Family Commission’s report into the future of out of school services as a timely contribution to work already underway on ways to improve services.

“Cabinet will consider a five year action plan for out of school services in the coming months,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“We have already made a significant investment in funding to make quality out of school services more affordable for families.

“The income eligibility thresholds and rates for the Out of School Care and Recreation (OSCAR) subsidy have increased in the last three years so that 70 per cent of New Zealand families are potentially able to access the subsidy. In 2004, the maximum subsidy a family could get was $1.99 per hour. This had risen to $3.31 per hour in 2006.

“There has also been a doubling of funding to increase the provision of out of school services. The budget for assistance grants has grown from just under $4.3 million in 2002/03 to more than $10.7 million in 2005/06. The number of new out-of-school service providers was 70 in 2002. This had risen to 201 in 2006.

“The Government recognises the importance of ensuring families have access to affordable and quality services for their children after school. I’m confident that the work underway will further improve those services," said Mr Benson-Pope.
