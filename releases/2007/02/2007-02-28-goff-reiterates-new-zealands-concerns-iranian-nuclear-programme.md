Disarmament Minister Phil Goff today reiterated New Zealand's concerns over Iran's nuclear programme during an introductory call on him by Iran’s new Ambassador to New Zealand, His Excellency Mr Morteza Rahmani Movahed.

“We are disappointed that Iran has chosen not to comply with the provisions of United Nations Security Council resolution 1737. This is a lost opportunity for Iran to address the concerns of the international community," said Mr Goff.

"I have made New Zealand's position to the Ambassador absolutely clear.

“Iran's refusal to comply with the United Nations Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolutions seeking its compliance is a serious concern. Iran needs to act positively to rebuild the international confidence in its nuclear programme.

“Suspending its enrichment programme and allowing the IAEA unrestricted access in its efforts to ascertain the nature of Iran’s nuclear programme would enable the international community to gain confidence in its intentions.

"On 22 February, the IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had not suspended its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and thus had not complied with UN Security Council resolution 1737. UN Security Council resolution 1737, which was passed on 23 December 2007, imposed a range of sanctions on Iran’s uranium enrichment and ballistic missile programmes.

“As a member of the United Nations, New Zealand is bound by Security Council decisions. We are currently working on implementing the obligations in the resolution. However, it is unlikely that New Zealand is exporting any item to Iran that would come within the current sanctions.  
“It remains New Zealand’s strong preference that a peaceful, negotiated solution to this matter be reached. We call on Iran to do its part to realise this outcome,” said Mr Goff.
