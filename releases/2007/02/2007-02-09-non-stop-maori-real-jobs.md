"There are more Mäori in jobs making a valuable contribution to our society", said Parekura Horomia, Minister of Mäori Affairs and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment.

"The latest labour force figures from the Household Labour Force Survey ([HLFS](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-dec06qtr-hotp.htm)) show that for the year to December 2006 the unemployment rate for Mäori fell to 7.9 per cent.

"This is the lowest rate recorded since the HLFS began in 1986, and continues a consistent pattern of declines in quarterly figures. The latest quarterly figure of 7.2% is a highlight," said Parekura Horomia.

Mäori annual employment increased by 22,000 between December 2005 and December 2006.

"This demonstrates that polices of the Labour-led Government to get more people into jobs are working.

"Clearly, Mäori prefer to be in worthwhile and meaningful jobs, and actively contributing to the social, economic and cultural foundation of New Zealand.

"Mäori gains in employment under this Government, alongside strong involvement in education and training is providing a positive pathway to real opportunities.

"Mäori continue to participate in a wide range of training opportunities. I'm a huge supporter of young Mäori seriously thinking of taking up a trade. The regions need on-the-job trained trades people, just as it needs those in other professions. More Mäori are moving into these semi and high skilled occupations. Mäori are making increasingly effective choices to support their whänau.

"I applaud this approach, which will have greater gains for our people than any 'work for the dole' type schemes."

"Another great illustration of Mäori fulfilling their potential", said Parekura Horomia.
