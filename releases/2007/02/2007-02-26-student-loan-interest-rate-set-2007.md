The interest rate on student loans for the 2007-08 tax year has been set at 6.8%, down from 6.9%, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

“The interest rate, for those borrowers who still have to pay interest on student loans, is based on a five-year average of the ten-year bond rate, plus a margin to cover administration costs,” Mr Dunne said.

The change was approved by Order in Council today.
