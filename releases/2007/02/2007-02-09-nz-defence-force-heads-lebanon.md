Defence Minister Phil Goff farewelled New Zealand Defence Force personnel today as they deployed to Lebanon where they will be part of the UN effort to clear unexploded munitions in the south of the country.

"This deployment is a significant humanitarian contribution to assist the people of Lebanon rebuild their country and their lives. The New Zealand Defence Force is recognised internationally for the skill, professionalism and expertise it brings to the clearing and disposal of unexploded munitions.

"Our work in Lebanon will build on that reputation established through our work with unexploded ordnance detection and disposal in Cambodia, Laos and Mozambique.

"The challenge facing the UN is significant. There are an estimated 900,000 unexploded cluster munitions remain buried in South Lebanon in addition to an estimated 400,000 mines and 15,000 other types of unexploded ordnance.

"The New Zealand Defence Force is contributing two, ten person explosive ordnance disposal teams to the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre in Southern Lebanon (UNMACC-SL), each team will be in Lebanon for a six month period.

"The NZDF teams will work alongside teams from other organisations engaged in similar tasks contracted to UNMACC-SL who will also provide logistic and administrative support to the New Zealanders.

"The team deploying to Lebanon today consists of four explosive ordnance disposal technicians from the Royal New Zealand Navy and six surveyors from the New Zealand Army who will work together to locate, map and destroy unexploded ordnance.

"New Zealand is also working to ensure that the lessons learned from Lebanon translate into action to curb the use of cluster munitions. Their high failure rates coupled with the widespread use in urban areas has had a disastrous impact on civilian populations.

"New Zealand is at the forefront of international moves to limit the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions.

"This month we will be attending an international meeting hosted by Norway aimed at winning support for putting in place a legally binding instrument on cluster munitions. In recognition of our leadership role in this area and our expertise, Norway has asked New Zealand to co-chair the meeting.

"We will be working with like minded partners to develop new regulations that will address important issues such as; high failure of munitions to detonate on impact, banning the use of cluster munitions where civilian populations are concentrated and banning the use of old cluster munitions.

"New Zealanders have earned an enviable reputation for their work around the world in the management and disposal of unexploded ordnance. This niche and highly valuable contribution to UN operations will fill a vital role in making the cities and countryside safe for the people of Southern Lebanon as they rebuild their lives.

"Just as importantly we are working to try to ensure that the disastrous use of cluster munitions in Lebanon does not happen again elsewhere", Mr Goff said.
