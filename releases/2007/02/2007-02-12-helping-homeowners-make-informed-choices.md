Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove and Consumers’ Institute Chief Executive David Russell today launched the enhanced ConsumerBuild website, aimed at improving New Zealanders' understanding about building, buying, renovating and maintaining their homes.

The official launch was held at 3pm today at an Auckland East Tamaki show home that demonstrates up-to-date energy efficient and weathertightness construction features.

Mr Cosgrove said the show home is an example of the many practical, easy-to-understand tips offered for Kiwi homeowners on the enhanced site – www.consumerbuild.org.nz

"Buying a house is the biggest investment most of us make, so it is important to get it right,” Mr Cosgrove said. “We want to help buyers make informed decisions when looking at prospective homes. Knowing the right questions to ask and understanding when to engage expert advice will help people make sound investments for the future – whether they’re buying a home to live in with their families or to rent to tenants."

“We also want to help people maintain and protect their homes so they continue to be safe and healthy. Many modern homes are described as ‘low maintenance’, but this does not mean ‘no maintenance’. There is no such thing as a maintenance-free house.”

Mr Russell said the Consumers’ Institute was proud to be playing a role in providing the public with independent, accessible information about house building, buying and upkeep.

“In the drive to better protect consumers, we now have more regulations around house building,” Mr Russell said. “We have got better protection around the structural security of homes, weathertightness and energy efficiency, and it is crucial that consumers have access to practical information about these issues.”

Mr Cosgrove and Mr Russell said the new advice and information about leaky homes added to the ConsumerBuild site will also help both home buyers and home owners recognise and properly respond to weathertightness issues.

“A new Checklist for Home Buyers can be downloaded from the website - a simple, practical guide to help with the buying process. Homeowners can also download a new Checklist for Home Maintenance, which also offers easy-to-follow advice."

Other new content on the website includes real case studies of people with leaky homes and how they have dealt with them, and photos and drawings to help homeowners recognise weathertightness issues."

“We encourage all home owners and people in the market for a new property to check out the very useful advice on www.consumerbuild.org.nz."  
The new information on the website supports the current package of Government reforms aimed at ensuring New Zealand homes are designed and built right the first time.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

**What is the ConsumerBuild (www.consumerbuild.org.nz) website?**  
The website was jointly developed two years ago by the Department of Building and Housing and the Consumers’ Institute to provide an independent source of practical, consumer-focussed information on house building and renovation. It has now been significantly enhanced to include a section on home maintenance, guidance about house buying, and information about recognising and responding to weathertightness issues.

**Who is the website aimed at?**  
Home owners and prospective home buyers - anyone who is buying, building, renovating or maintaining a house to live in with their families or to rent to tenants.  
Banks, mortgage brokers, and councils are among those entities that have expressed strong support in linking ConsumerBuild to their own websites, in order to ensure consumers are connected to the advice they need before buying, building or repairing houses.

**How does ConsumerBuild fit into the Government’s building reform package?**  
The development of ConsumerBuild is part of a package of Government measures aimed at ensuring homes are designed and built right the first time. The website provides reliable, practical information designed to help homebuyers and homeowners to make informed choices.

The Government's reform package also includes: a major revamp of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service; the licensing of those who design and build while protecting the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) tradition; the review of the Building Code; the auditing and accreditation of Building Consent Authorities; building product certification; a financial assistance scheme pilot to help the worst-affected owners of leaky homes; and investigation into options for home warranty and professional indemnity insurance.
