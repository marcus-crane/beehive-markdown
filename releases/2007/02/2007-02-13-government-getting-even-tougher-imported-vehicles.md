The government is proposing even tougher restrictions on new car imports to ensure they comply with current international vehicle emission standards says Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

"We are proposing that imported new vehicles must meet the rigorous European and Japanese vehicle emission standards within two years of a standard being adopted in those countries," the Minister says.

"Previously, in our announcement prior to Christmas, we'd been suggesting a three to four year lag period. But Cabinet has reconsidered this."

"This Labour-led government is sending a clear message that we need to introduce newer better technologies that are fuel efficient and reduce vehicle emissions which contribute to air pollution and climate change."

"We need to ensure that our new imported vehicles can run on our improved fuel standards which are being introduced at the same time."

The proposal will be included in a draft Transport Ministry rule on entry restrictions for vehicle imports, which will be released for industry and public consultation in April this year.

The Minister says the draft Rule would set out a series of steadily increasing standards that used vehicles would have to meet and which may be ready to be implemented in 2008.

The measure is one of several recent government initiatives to improve vehicle emissions, including tougher emission standards for new vehicles; cleaner diesel fuel; and the introduction of the visible smoke check as part of the warrant of fitness.

"In addition higher quality vehicles will also help to improve the fuel economy of the country's fleet and improve vehicle safety," the Minister says.
