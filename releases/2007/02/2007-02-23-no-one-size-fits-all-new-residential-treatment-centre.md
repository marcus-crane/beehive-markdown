Associate Minister of Health, Jim Anderton opened the Care NZ Alcohol and Drug residential treatment service in Lyttelton today. He said that the economic measures of alcohol and drug abuse do not really describe the full extent of the damage to individuals, to families and to the strength of communities.

"According to the Ministry of Health, the social costs of alcohol misuse alone total between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion a year and our communities are incredibly vulnerable to the corrosive effects and the harm it causes. There are choices to be made about whether we are going to accept that harm, or whether we are going to do something about it," Jim Anderton said.

"There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to alcohol and drug treatment. And treatment needs to take account of other problems that can be present, and which, if unrecognised and untreated, will remain unresolved and increase the risk of relapse.

"The Labour-Progressive government has been working hard in this area to provide better treatment and support services. We invest around $80 million a year into alcohol and other drug treatment activities, including training and research. In a few weeks we will launch the Second National Drug Policy at Parliament.

"It will be the framework for identifying where the greatest drug-related harms are occurring and a guide for decisions about how we address those harms in health, justice, social development and education. Last year I launched the Mental Health and Addiction Action Plan, Te Kokiri, which sets the next steps for the big challenges we need to meet to do better at treating mental health and addiction.

"Top of the list for addiction is to improve the availability of high quality addiction services, make them easier to access and strengthen the links between those services and mental health services. The idea is that it shouldn't matter which door you come through, if you have a mental illness or addiction, individuals and their families should have effective treatment and support.

"This new facility, Harbour House, will provide an additional residential rehabilitation service that can be accessed nationally. I understand that the programme it offers is flexible and will be tailored to each individual.

Importantly, there is provision for counselling and education for families as well. The programme also includes a personalised fitness regime with a personal trainer to ensure that both body and mind are incorporated in the healing process. This residential service is built on the strong foundations of many years experience of work in the sector by Care NZ and its parent trust.

"I would like to wish Care NZ every success for this new venture. I congratulate you on the choice of this peaceful and beautiful site overlooking Lyttelton Harbour.
