Trade Minister Phil Goff launched Wellington Chamber of Commerce's major Export Year 2007 initiative, The Export Development programme at a breakfast function this morning.

"The Export Development programme is a regionally developed initiative aligned with both the objectives of Export Year 2007 and the regional growth strategy", said Mr Goff.

"The Export Development programme provides funding for Wellington Chamber of Commerce to employ a specialist programme manager to work with businesses to help develop their ability and capacity to export. The main focus of the programme in the region will be on businesses in the service sector.

“The programme will be run by the Wellington Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise who will provide funding for the employment of the programme manager.

"The programme manager will work closely with between 45 and 60 businesses. Each business entering the programme will undergo a capability assessment and a development plan will be created for that business based on the results of the assessment.

"The objectives of the development plan will be to identify available resources like training courses and specialised assistance that will benefit the business in the drive to export readiness. Once the plan is on place the manager will work with the business and the training and assistance providers to implement it and prepare he business for entering the export market.

"This programme will provide participating businesses with an intensive resource dedicated to not only building their export capability but also connecting the businesses to existing NZTE and private sector training and assistance.

“In line with the objectives of Export Year, this pilot programme will help ensure that participating businesses realise their exporting potential,” Mr Goff said.
