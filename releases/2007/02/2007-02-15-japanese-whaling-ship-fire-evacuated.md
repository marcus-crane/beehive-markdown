A Japanese whaling ship in the Ross Sea, the Nisshin Maru, has reported a fire on board the vessel, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"A distress call was received this morning around 5.15am New Zealand time. The fire appears to be very serious and has prompted the partial evacuation of the Nisshin Maru. It was not connected to protest action," Mr Carter said.

"The Nisshin Maru is the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship, and has over 148 people on board as well as heavy fuel oil. The latest information we have is that 126 crew have been evacuated from the ship to three other vessels in the whaling fleet. One person is so far unaccounted for.

"There remain about 20 people on board the Nisshin Maru fighting the fire. We are waiting for further information on how successful they have been," Mr Carter said.

"Primary responsibility for the distressed ship resides with the Japanese but the event has taken place inside an area for which New Zealand is responsible for search and rescue. It is located 100 nautical miles from the Antarctic Coast.

"New Zealand will assist in any way it can, and we are in regular contact with the Japanese fleet and other ships in the area through the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ)," Mr Carter said.

"Our priority is to work with the Japanese fleet to get the Nisshin Maru's crew to safety. However, we are also gravely concerned about the environmental risk to Antarctica's pristine environment if the ship is sufficiently damaged to begin leaking oil.

"We are working on contingencies to deal with this scenario at present. In the meantime, I wish the Japanese crew fighting the fire on the Nisshin Maru every good fortune. Their efforts will be crucial to averting further catastrophe."
