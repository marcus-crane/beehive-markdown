The Minister of Fisheries Jim Anderton is encouraging fishers from all sectors to comment on proposals for the future management of shared fisheries by the end of February.

"Shared fisheries are fisheries where commercial, customary and amateur fishers all target the same species. Snapper, blue cod, kahawai, tarakihi, gurnard, rock lobster (crayfish) and paua are examples of shared fisheries," Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton launched the [Shared Fisheries Discussion Document](http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Shared+Fisheries/default.htm) in October last year and reminded all interested stakeholders today that the consultation period finishes on 28 February 2007 and all submissions must be in by this date.

“In particular, I urge stakeholders, whether they support or have concerns, about the proposals to get their thoughts and ideas down on paper and send them to the Ministry of Fisheries by the end of the month. I encourage people to read the discussion document to come to their own view and have their say.

“Representatives of commercial, customary and amateur fishers have voiced their concerns about aspects of the proposals, now it is time to put them in writing so I can consider them.

Jim Anderton said the Government had no intention of undermining the Quota Management System (QMS) or the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Deed of Settlement. Jim Anderton assured stakeholders that he would not allow any reallocation to occur without compensation to quota owners. The Minister also said he hoped that any reallocation could be on a willing buyer/willing seller basis.

“The challenge before us is to manage shared fisheries in a way that ensures all New Zealanders get as much value as possible from them, not only today but into the future,” Jim Anderton said.

The proposals are designed to resolve a series of problems:

- Uncertainty over allocation which impedes constructive fisheries management and leads to litigation
- Poor incentives for the commercial and amateur sectors to work together to manage and conserve fisheries
- Poor information on amateur catch.

The proposals include some options, which could lead to allocation of fisheries changing between sectors. However, the discussion document also suggests redress for the commercial sector, which is not currently provided for.

“The way we manage these fisheries is important to our economy, our national identity, and to both Maori and päkehä cultural values. The document sets out some exciting new approaches to these issues, which I think offer hope of resolving some of the conflicting interests in these important fisheries,” Jim Anderton said from Christchurch.
