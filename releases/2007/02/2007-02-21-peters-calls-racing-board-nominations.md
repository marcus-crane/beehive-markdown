Racing Minister Winston Peters is seeking nominations to fill an independent member vacancy on the New Zealand Racing Board.

The Board comprises of seven members: an independent chair, three independent members, and members representing each of the thoroughbred, greyhound, and harness racing industries.

“There has been a revival of confidence in the racing industry since the tax changes last year,” Mr Peters said.

“The Board’s plan to return additional revenue to owners and punters has already had a positive impact, but there is still plenty of potential for further revitalisation of the industry.

“The Board has a vital role in that regard, and it is important that its members have the skills and experience to capitalise on recent developments and drive racing forward to new heights.

"Anyone can make a nomination for the board position. The important point is to have a strong pool of candidates from which to make this appointment,” Mr Peters said.

Nomination forms and further details about the Board’s membership, functions and powers can be obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs website (www.dia.govt.nz) or by calling (04) 495 9313.

The closing date for receipt of nominations is Friday, 23 March.
