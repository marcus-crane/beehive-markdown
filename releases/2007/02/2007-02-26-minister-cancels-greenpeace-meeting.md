David Parker was due to meet with Greenpeace representatives today to receive a report on their ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but has cancelled the meeting following an illegal stunt by its members earlier in the day.

"This stunt is a real disappointment. Not only is it unnecessary but it potentially puts lives at risk.

"I am surprised Greenpeace has not shown better judgment," Mr Parker said.

The Greenpeace stunt comes at a time when the government's climate change policies are bringing about real and sustainable change.

Earlier today, Meridian [announced](http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/aboutus/news/meridian+energy+first+nz+energy+company+to+have+certified+carbon+neutral+electricity+.htm) that they are the first energy company in New Zealand to have the electricity they sell certified carbon neutral.

Last week Contact Energy [announced](http://www.contactenergy.co.nz/web/view?page=%2Fcontentiw%2Fpages%2Fmediaandpublications%2Fpressreleases%2F2007%2F2007-02-23-contactoutlines2billioninanewrenewablegenerationpr&vert=mp&onlineMode=oh) a $2 billion renewables programme and the postponement of decisions on gas-fired Otahuhu C.

"While I can understand Greenpeace's concern to get its message about climate change across, this illegal stunt is a step too far. I have met with Greenpeace previously and will meet with them in the future, but I am not meeting with them at the moment" Mr Parker said.
