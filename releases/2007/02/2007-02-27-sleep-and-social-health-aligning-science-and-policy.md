**Address to the SPEaR Workshop: Sleep and Social Health - Aligning Science and Policy**

10.00am Nau Mai Room, Te Puni Kokiri 143 Lambton Quay, Wellington

Good morning and thank you to the organisers for inviting me to speak at your workshop on Sleep and Social Health – Aligning Science and Policy.

I believe that social health is important issue for New Zealand. It touches on three of the Government’s key priorities: economic transformation; families young and old; and national identity.

For me social health is about  
·a healthy functioning society; and  
·an individual’s health and wellness that gives a person quality of life, – allowing us to contribute, be productive, both in the workplace, and in the community.

I believe that all New Zealanders deserve a society where people have health and energy to participate: in meaningful employment, and in life outside of work.  
Sleep and fatigue are important aspects of social health.

Fatigue and sleep disorders impact on how we work, how we spend time with our families, and how we are involved in our communities.  
As Minister of Labour and for ACC, I hear a lot about fatigue. Fatigue from long work hours, from shift work that disrupts a person’s internal clock, or fatigue from dealing with demanding or stressful situations.

It’s an issue that concerns many New Zealanders.

·Almost 20% of New Zealanders now work more than 50 hours per week. These people are more likely to experience work related health problems;  
·A quarter of New Zealanders work some hours at night; and  
·Shift workers, night workers, and people working 50 hours or more a week finding it harder to spend time with family and friends.

We can manage work to minimise fatigue, but good restorative sleep is the only cure. But herein lies another problem.

We live in an age where it has never been easier to cut back on sleep and burn the candle at both ends. We live in a 24/7 society.  
If people don’t get enough restorative sleep, fatigue is compounded, and more serious sleep disorders can occur. 37% of people aged 30-60 years report never or rarely getting enough sleep.

Fatigue is of course not the only cause of sleep disorders. Health or lifestyle issues such as obesity can also play a part.  
The effects of this are of great concern.  
Research indicates that people who are not able to get enough restorative sleep have an increased risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and increased rates of error.

Over time, the government and other groups have made progress on fatigue and sleep related issues.

The Government’s high level policy initiatives include highlighting fatigue as something employers should consider in hazard management, through the 2002 amendment to the Health and Safety in Employment Act.

This has raised the profile of fatigue at work. The Department of Labour records show an increase in people identifying fatigue as a factor in stress, bullying, and in physical injuries.

The Government has launched two national strategies dealing with injury prevention and health and safety at work.

The New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy covers injury prevention in all areas of New Zealand, including road safety and the wider social health issues in suicide prevention.

The Workplace Health and Safety Strategy was launched in 2005, and has “Psychosocial Workplace Factors”, including fatigue, as a national priority.  
Government agencies participating in these strategies have collaborated with industry groups to produce guidelines on safety including information on fatigue. The ACC and the Road Transport Forum of New Zealand guidelines on health and safety in road transport is a good example.  
Maritime New Zealand is preparing guidelines for managing fatigue on ships following at least 10 fatigue related groundings and other incidents since the beginning of 2004.

Industry also has a vital part to play in improving fatigue management.  
One New Zealand forestry company has implemented fatigue management through improving the diet of their workers.

The company noted that workers in logging crews were not eating well – expecting potato chips, pies and coke for breakfast to keep them going all day.  
The company ran seminars for logging crews on fatigue and stress, and good eating for the heavy physical work they were doing.

Some of the logging contractors now provide food to keep the crews energised, and have noted improvements in production through the day.  
They have also taken the step to provide recovery food for the trip home from the forest. Workers not only have more energy for their families, but are also better rested for work the next day.

This example highlights the positive effects of managing fatigue on productivity, work-life balance, as well as health and safety. We need more leaders like this.  
Employers can do much to assist employees on shift work with sleep. Airlines are finally starting to realise that providing good accommodation for international flight crews is so vital to a restful nights sleep, which helps them to do their job well.  
Companies can also support staff once they leave the factory by providing tips for sleeping after shift work, and monitoring how well staff are coping with a shift regime.

Overseas, employers in the French nuclear industry have even taken the step of providing sound proofing material for the shift worker’s bedrooms.  
To some this may seem excessive. But in a high risk sector, this company needs its staff in peak performance while at work.  
To make more progress we need everyone’s involvement. The issues involved with sleep problems and fatigue are complex. No single group has all the responsibility, or all the answers.

As a society, we all need to keep openly discussing our expectations for life:  
·What do employers expect of the people they employ?  
·What do workers expect out of their work?  
·How can we balance this against what we expect or aspire to for our lives outside of work?  
·How does our work affect our ability to meet our life aspirations?  
·How does our general wellbeing and lifestyle affect our work?  
·And how much of this is dependant on our ability to have good sleep, regardless whether our sleep time is at night or during the day?

This is a discussion we need to have within government, between government and employers groups and unions, and in the wider community.

So what can you do to help?

The purpose of this workshop is to align science and policy. Policy makers and researchers do not always have the same priorities for research. One is looking for evidence for planning and policy formulation, while the other is looking to extend knowledge.

It’s important in this area that policy makers and researchers are able to understand each other. So today, take the opportunity to talk, share ideas, and learn from each other.  
Most importantly, start a few joint projects which meet the needs of both researchers and policy makers.

The same goes for policy people from different areas of government. As I have said, no one group or department has all the answers, or all the ability to influence change.

Part of the reason for whole-of-government strategies such as the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy, and the Workplace Health and Safety Strategy, is to provide a framework for government agency co-ordination and co-operation

Please take this opportunity to strengthen and broaden your networks … and sleep well tonight.

Thank you.
