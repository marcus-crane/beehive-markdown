Energy Minister David Parker has responded swiftly to an overseas report that biofuels will push food prices up in America.

"The overseas piece from Bloomberg does not reflect the realities of the New Zealand situation", Mr Parker said.

"The bulk of our domestic demand in the near term is likely to be meet from by-products such as tallow.

"In the future biodiesels from sewage and bioethanol from woody plants are expected to become viable. New Zealanders don't eat any of these.

"Kiwis are good at growing things. If biofuels were to force overseas food prices up, New Zealand's exporters would actually stand to gain from the situation", Mr Parker said.
