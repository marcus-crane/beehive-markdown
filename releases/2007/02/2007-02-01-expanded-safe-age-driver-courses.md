Older people across the country have the opportunity to brush up on their driving knowledge and skills with the rollout from today of a revised and expanded version of the popular Safe With Age driver refresher course, says Transport Minister Annette King.

She says improvements to the course include redeveloped teaching materials, a new focus on self-assessment and alternatives to driving, and the offer of a subsidised private on-road driving lesson for all participants.

The improvements to Safe With Age have been made possible by the Government’s commitment of an additional $550,000 for older driver education, part of a package of changes introduced in December last year to make the driver licensing system more responsive to the needs of older New Zealanders.

"In 2005, Labour promised to abolish the mandatory driving test for those aged 80 and over. We delivered on that promise in December, putting an end to a practice which had caused much concern for older New Zealanders,“ says Ms King.

“Older drivers no longer have to undergo a mandatory test every two years, but many would like the chance to refresh their knowledge and skills in a supportive and stress-free environment. The improved Safe With Age course provides that opportunity.”

Safe With Age is a free course, run by local groups and co-ordinated by Land Transport New Zealand. There are currently 40 course providers across the country, running approximately 400 courses for up to 5000 participants per year.  
Land Transport NZ aims to increase the number of participants to 8000 per year.

Note: Transport Minister Annette King launched the revised and expanded Safe With Age course at 11:30am today at Sprott House, 29 Messines Rd, Karori.
