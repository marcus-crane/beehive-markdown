The Labour-led government will help Kiwi households take practical steps to fight climate change, improve energy efficiency, save money, and reduce waste, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

A household sustainability campaign was announced as part of the government's sustainability agenda by Prime Minister Helen Clark in her statement for the opening of Parliament.

"The campaign will focus on practical ways in which New Zealanders can act to make their households more sustainable," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"By making relatively small changes to the way we use energy we can all play a meaningful role in preserving our environment. The changes we make also have immediate health and financial benefits, as well as having longer-term benefits to our communities, our country and our planet.

"For example, New Zealanders are already using 1.5 million energy-saving bulbs in their homes, which has the same positive environmental impact of removing 18,000 cars from our roads.

"The campaign will build on and seek to integrate the practical advice and help already being given by government agencies, NGOs and the private sector. Local government in particular is active in community-based sustainability campaigns."

"The Ministry for the Environment has already published three new booklets offering New Zealanders information about climate change and everyday tips on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

"The household sustainability campaign will aim to raise awareness of both existing programmes and new initiatives and connect people to them," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"We know that New Zealanders care about their environment and are concerned about climate change.

"A recent survey showed 78 per cent of respondents believed they needed to make lifestyle changes to reduce global warming. This campaign will offer them the information and the tools they need to make a difference," David Benson-Pope said.

Full details of the campaign will be announced in Budget 2007.

### Q&A -- Household sustainable living programme

***How will it help people make savings?***  
The focus is on informing people about simple things they can do to make savings and help the environment, and where they can go for help in doing those things. That includes:

- Energy efficiency tips and assistance -- cut the power bill by providing help on small changes around the house, choosing cheap-to-run appliances and fittings, and making houses warmer and drier.
- Fuel saving tips -- practical advice on how to save petrol when driving or by using alternatives, support for workplace and school travel plans, and how to choose an efficient car.
- Water efficiency and waste reduction advice.

***Why is such a programme needed, don't people already know this?***  
Recent surveys have shown that most people think they need to make lifestyle choices to reduce global warming, and the government wants to make it as easy as possible for people to understand the choices they have and make the changes they want. The success of similar programmes overseas shows there is a real demand for such a programme. People want to know what they can actually do.

Such programmes can also be very successful. For instance, a scheme to get energy efficient light bulbs into Canterbury households succeeded in selling enough bulbs to have five bulbs in around 80 per cent of target households. The bulbs cost just $10 for five and are set to deliver lifetime savings of around $500 compared to ordinary bulbs.

***Isn't there a lot of assistance out there already?***  
Yes, there is. The purpose of this programme is not to duplicate what already exists, but rather to make it much easier for people to find information and programmes.  
Some of the programmes that already exist to help are:

- [Sustainable Living Programme](http://www.sustainablehouseholds.org.nz/about1.htm) -- practical hints and community classes sponsored by nearly 30 local councils
- [4 Million Careful Owners](http://www.4million.org.nz) -- website and programme offering advice on climate change and household rubbish
- [EnergyWise](http:) -- this EECA programme offers both general energy efficiency advice and grants for insulation for low income households
- [Warm Homes Project](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/energy/warm-homes/index.html) -- this central and local government programme targeting insulation and clean heating in areas with air quality issues
- [Solar water heating programme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F27855) -- advice on choosing a solar water heater and financial assistance
- [Efficiency labels](http://www.energystar.govt.nz/) and ratings on appliances
- [Fuel$aver website](http://www.fuelsaver.govt.nz) -- advice on choosing a fuel-efficient car and driving habits to keep fuel bills down
- SmartBuild website -- launching soon, this will give detailed advice on building and running an energy efficient and sustainable home.

***Why target the household sector when industry and agriculture present far bigger challenges?***  
The answer is that all sectors and all New Zealanders can play their part in tackling key issues such as climate change. Of all the sectors in the economy, household energy use and transport are two of the fastest growing. They are also sectors in which simple actions can result in significant savings for individuals and the wider economy, as well as benefits to the environment.

***What sort of programmes will be run with local government, NGOs and the private sector?***  
Many organisations already do a great job in promoting sustainable activities, for example the Bluff Healthy Homes Project which is supported by iwi and the private sector as well as government.

One goal of this programme is to galvanise such activity where third parties want to partner with government to do so. It is envisaged that the initiative will provide a focus for such programmes.
