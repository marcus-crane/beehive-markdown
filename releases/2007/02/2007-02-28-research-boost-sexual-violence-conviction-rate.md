*Joint Statement from Hon Lianne Dalziel, Hon Mark Burton and Hon Annette King*

The government is committing $900,000 to fund research to encourage adult victims to report sexual violence attacks and boost the conviction rate for sexual offences.

The Ministers of Women’s Affairs, Justice and Police have welcomed the announcement of a grant from the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology to fund a two-year research project into improving the justice system for adult victims of sexual violence.

The project, led by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice and the New Zealand Police, will investigate how many reports of sexual violence in new Zealand end up with a successful conviction, look at ways to improve the likelihood of victims making formal complaints and investigate how victims can best be supported through the criminal justice system.

Women’s Affairs Minister Lianne Dalziel said it is difficult for many victims to talk about what has happened to them because of embarrassment and fear.

“Going through the trial process can exacerbate this and it can be even worse if the victim and offender are known to each other. We want victims to feel they will be safe and supported if they report such attacks,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Justice Minister Mark Burton said sexual violence is signifcantly under-reported in New Zealand.

“Of those who do report, it is not currently known how many will be successful in obtaining a conviction. In the UK, and other comparable jurisdictions, the chance of obtaining a conviction for sexual violence is well below 10 per cent. This affects victims’ confidence in the justice system, and means many offenders are not being held accountable,” Mark Burton said.

Police Minister Annette King said the project supports current Police action on adult sexual violence.

“Police has developed an adult sexual assault policy and continues to work on refining its interviewing and investigation policy for adult sexual assault cases,” Annette King said.

“Research overseas has demonstrated that the investigative stage is one of the four key points at which victims drop out of the criminal justice system. This project will provide comparative data for New Zealand, and seek to establish the causes of this drop-out rate.”

It is estimated that sexual violence costs the New Zealand economy $1.2 billion per annum.

“This research has the potential to reduce these costs through better targeted services, increased offender accountability and behaviour change,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The research will involve NGOs and others working in the area of sexual violence to get the best results, Lianne Dalziel said.

“This is project contributes to the Labour-led government’s focus on families young and old, including our extensive work on Effective Interventions, our Crime Reduction Strategy, the Action Plan for New Zealand Women and the Safer Communities Action Plan. It will also inform the government’s longer-term efforts to eliminate family violence through Te Rito and the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families.”

“We are determined to involve the whole of government in reducing crimes of violence so that New Zealanders can feel safer, and know they will get the best support possible.”
