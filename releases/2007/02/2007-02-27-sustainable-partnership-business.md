A series of seminars to help New Zealand businesses develop sustainable business practice will begin on Thursday, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

“Business has a big contribution to make to improving New Zealand's overall sustainability. Industry has the opportunity to cash in on the commercial opportunities which worldwide interest in sustainability creates,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

The [Ministry for the Environment](http://www.mfe.govt.nz) and [Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce](http://www.wgtn-chamber.co.nz/) are working together to host Sustainable Business - Sustainable Environment seminars in the Wellington region, Marlborough, Kapiti, the Manawatu, Taranaki, Wairarapa, and Hawke’s Bay. The seminars show businesses how sound environmental practices are also good for business.

“These seminars are an example of the government and industry representatives working together to deliver an important service to New Zealand businesses. This is a great opportunity for businesses to learn how to implement sustainable business practice in their own organisations.

“Now more than ever, businesses are looking at ways to help reduce their operating costs and improve efficiency. Cutting business costs can mean potential benefits for the environment. For example, energy efficient practices, reduction in the use of consumables and recycling waste can all reduce business operating costs, while being easier on the environment.”

The seminars have a mix of private sector and government agency speakers, and include case studies from businesses with a successful track record in sustainable business practice. So far, nearly 90 businesses have enrolled in the Palmerston North seminar. Attendees will be pointed towards programmes where they can achieve recognised environmental management certification or awards for sustainability.
