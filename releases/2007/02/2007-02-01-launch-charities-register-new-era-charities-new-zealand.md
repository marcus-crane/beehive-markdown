Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today said that the launch of the Charities Register marks the beginning of a new era for charities in New Zealand.

From today, the [Charities Commission](http://www.charities.govt.nz) will begin to receive applications for registration under the Charities Act 2005. Registration is voluntary.

"The new Charities Register will lead to the increased transparency of charitable organisations and will help to strengthen the public’s trust and confidence in the charitable sector," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"It will do this by ensuring that only genuine charities gain registration – that is, those organisations who advance religion, relieve poverty or have a purpose that is otherwise beneficial to the community as their main purpose."

The Charities Register will also improve the quality and accessibility of information about the charitable sector.

"Not only will the Register give New Zealanders the ability to make well-informed decisions about the charities they wish to support, but it’s also good news for the charities themselves."

"Benefits of registration include income tax and gift duty exemption, a greater level of public trust and confidence, representation at the Charities Commission’s Annual Meetings and extra visibility for charities to potential donors and supporters."

"The Labour-led government is committed to supporting a strong, healthy, independent and well-resourced sector which builds the social capital all societies need to thrive."

"The launch of the new Charities Register builds on other achievements by the Labour-led government in the Community and Voluntary sector, such as increased resources and funding for volunteers, the establishment of the Charities Commission and the formation of a dedicated Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector,” said Laban.
