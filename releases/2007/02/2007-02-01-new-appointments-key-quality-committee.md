Health Minister Pete Hodgson has announced new members to the Quality Improvement Committee, (formerly Epiqual - the National Health Epidemiology and Quality Assurance Advisory Committee).

The new-look committee will also have revised terms of reference, which will focus more on developing a shared learning environment in the health sector, so that innovations that improve the quality of healthcare can be more quickly adopted throughout the system.

"The new committee will allow a greater focus on quality and safety. It will be responsible for identifying examples of innovation or best practice in health around the world or locally that could be used in New Zealand," Pete Hodgson says.

"One of my priorities for the health sector is achieving value for money and a strong quality and safety agenda will go a long way towards achieving this," Pete Hodgson says.

"I have appointed Patrick Snedden as the chair of the Quality Improvement Committee. Mr Snedden is the chair of the Counties Manukau District Health Board. He is also a business adviser to Health Care Aotearoa Inc, which is the largest alliance of health care providers in the primary health sector in New Zealand outside the IPA (Independent Provider's Association)."

Pete Hodgson says other new members that have been appointed are Barbara Crawford, Kevin Hague, Jean Hera, Alan Merry, Catherine Rae, Mary Seddon and Judi Strid. Robin Youngson and Jim Vause have been reappointed for a second term. Cindy Farquhar, Barbara Greer and Barry Taylor continue as members.
