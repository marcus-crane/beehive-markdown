Prime Minister Helen Clark and President of the Labour Party Mike Williams say that Mr Field's public comments amount to an announcement of intention to run against Labour at the next election and so have invited expulsion.

His membership of the Labour Party is effectively at an end. The President will now be recommending Mr Field's expulsion to the New Zealand Council of the Party.
