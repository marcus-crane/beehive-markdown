Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Health Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed the release of Treasury reports on the health sector that underline the challenges New Zealand faces in meeting the rising cost of and rising expectations for health care, and in measuring productivity.

"The reports dealing with the review of the health sector highlight what we have in common with other developed countries, namely the increasing cost of prescription drugs, a high quality workforce, technology and the increasing burden of disease in an ageing population," said the Ministers.

"This government has been investing in the health sector, building new hospitals, improving the quality of health care and allowing all New Zealanders to see their GPs for a much lower cost.

"Despite our successes, challenges remain.

"As we have been saying for some time, the higher cost of health care, including increasingly complex and expensive technology, places big burdens on the fiscal purse.

"For instance, in 1990, health spending per head was around $1,400 in today's dollars; in 2006, this has risen to $2,300. Treasury projects health spending as a proportion of GDP to rise from 6.2 per cent in 2002 to 13.5 per cent in 2051.

"We are not alone. Most OECD countries face similar challenges and it is important these issues are debated by all New Zealanders.

"Treasury findings tallied with a Review of the Ministry of Health released last year which found the Ministry's challenges were to further develop their leadership and responsiveness to the health sector.

"Treasury also looked at whether we are getting value for money from some of our health expenditure. However, the report is two years old and makes clear that measuring productivity is a difficult task.

"Treasury acknowledged less than a quarter of DHB activity was able to be measured. Outpatient attendances, which were not measured, may have grown more rapidly than services that could be measured.

"The difficulty that Treasury had measuring productivity has resulted in the subsequent development of a set of headline indicators which are currently being trialed in six DHBs. The pilot will conclude at the end of next month."
