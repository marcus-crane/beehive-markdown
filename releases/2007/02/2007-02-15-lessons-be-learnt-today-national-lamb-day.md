Minister of Agriculture, Jim Anderton celebrated our first National Lamb Day with a meat industry BBQ in Parliament today and said that there were lessons to be learnt from the initial voyage of refrigerated lamb 125 years ago.

"It was touch and go whether the first shipment of frozen lamb would reach its destination in London. The captain of the Dunedin had to take a hacksaw to create extra holes as makeshift air ducts when the ship was becalmed in the tropics and air passages had begun to ice up. Captain Whitson's operation was so successful that air began to circulate almost immediately and the captain was on the verge of freezing to death. As in all happy endings, the captain was saved, the meat was saved and 4,931 carcasses, mainly of mutton, arrived safely and solidly frozen, in London," Jim Anderton said.

"But imagine how different New Zealand would have been if that trip had failed. The government of the day was offering a five hundred pound bonus for the first company to successfully ship meat to Britain and I don't hear many people today complaining about the government picking that particular winner.

"There are other lessons about our economy today that we can take from New Zealand's unsung hero of refrigerated shipping, William Saltau Davidson. First, Davidson went overseas to find the refrigeration technology. He didn't invent refrigerated shipping; his insight was to see how it could be adapted to meet New Zealand's needs. We prosper when we are open to the ideas of the world and when we use them to build on our existing advantages.

"The pioneering shipment changed everything about New Zealand and when I hear someone tell me that New Zealand can't do something, I remember this first voyage. We should reflect on the power of innovation to transform our economy and improve the well being of New Zealanders.

"Today science is dominant in the production chain of lamb. Freezing works are much more automated. They look, feel and smell nothing like the chains I worked on as a young student and credit here goes here to the industry workforce.

"As we celebrate the success and history of this $5 billion a year industry, I hope we also learn the lesson for the future about how we can manage the industry successfully and humanely.

"We have never been better prepared to meet the challenges of the market and we owe a lot to refrigerated shipping. We owe a lot to lamb meat for earning us a large part of our keep for a century and a quarter. And we owe a lot to the people involved, from pioneers like William Saltau Davidson and Thomas Brydone, to the scientists today, from the freezing chain workforce, to farmers in their muddy gumboots.

"New Zealand is never going to live in a world in which anyone owes us our living. But thanks to Davidson and his successors our options remain open. I am confident that the industry's commitment to building on its strengths will position it well for the next 125 years," Jim Anderton said in Wellington
