Merging innovation and environmental sustainability has seen a New Zealand organisation create leading-edge guidelines for industry to follow, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.  
The Minister was speaking at the launch of [Plastic New Zealand’s](http://www.plastics.org.nz/default.asp) Design for Environment Guidelines, a project funded by the Ministry for the Environment’s [Sustainable Management Fund](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/funding/smf/index.html).  
“These guidelines are a first for New Zealand and I congratulate the plastics industry for having the foresight and drive to produce them. They are an example to other industries of how sustainable practices can benefit the environment and the economy,” said Mr Benson-Pope.  
The guidelines, aimed at reducing the environmental impact of plastic products, will be used by marketers, product designers, raw material suppliers, toolmakers, manufacturers, distributors and brand owners.  
Plastics NZ represents more than 200 companies and 75 percent of the plastics industry which employs 8000 people and has an annual turnover of $2 billion.  
The industry recognises that to be internationally competitive and profitable, future growth needs to be based on innovative and sustainable use of New Zealand’s resources.  
Mr Benson-Pope said the guidelines are another small, but positive step towards achieving zero waste while growing New Zealand’s economy.  
Key features of the guidelines include:

- an explanation on how Design for the Environment (DfE) may benefit a business
- a simple checklist to assess the potential for DfE improvements for a business’ product
- a detailed section on how to manage a DfE programme.

Although the plastics industry has achieved strong growth, its commitment to sustainable practices has reduced the total amount of plastic sent to landfills, with more than 31,000 tonnes recovered for reuse last year.  
The guidelines now serve as the core text for the Design Diploma offered by Plastics NZ to members and workers in the plastic industry to increase their skills and knowledge.  
The guidelines are the latest tool to come out of the government’s New Zealand Waste Strategy. The document can be viewed online at: [www.plastics.org.nz](http://www.plastics.org.nz/_attachments/docs/bpp-dfe-final-1.pdf).
