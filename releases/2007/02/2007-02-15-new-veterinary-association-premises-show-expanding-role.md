Agricultural Minister, Jim Anderton opened the new premises of the New Zealand Veterinary Association (NZVA) today in Wellington and said that the facility reflected the growth of animal based industries and the increasingly important role of the veterinary sector.

"Our animal production industry is estimated to be worth a ‘farmgate’ value of $11 billion and the industry needs vets in a number of crucial ways," Jim Anderton said. "Not only do our vets look after our farm animals but they are in the front line of disease prevention. They are likely to be the first to detect suspected exotic diseases.

"There is also the comfort and valuable services vets provide to tens of thousands of households. We have around seven hundred thousand dogs and 1.2 million cats in New Zealand.

"Any hint of quality problems with our exports would be the perfect excuse for countries, with domestic producers of similar products, to keep our products out. This makes veterinarians a vital link in the quality assurance process, helping New Zealand maintain the highest overall standards.

"There are now an additional million dairy cattle on our farms than there were in 1996, and the number of dairy herds has almost trebled in the South Island. It is no wonder that the demand for veterinary services is rising. This has predictably led to a shortage - not just here, but around the world.

"The fact that a lot of veterinary work is in rural areas means rural lifestyles have to be enticing enough to attract and retain staff. As we demand more balance between work and other parts of our life, such as family and leisure, the demands of 24-hour veterinary practices present demands for workforce planning as well. I want to acknowledge the work the Veterinary Association has done on this issue.

"The Labour-Progressive government has also a role to play. There are more places being funded at the Massey veterinary school and the tuition subsidy for undergraduate training has been increased. Over the last seven years government has helped to develop our regions, making them better and more exciting places to live in and attracted skilled people to them.

"The Veterinarians Act, passed in 2005, now provides for a more flexible registration system. More vets with overseas qualifications not recognised here can sit the relevant exams.

"NZVA has made valuable contributions to policy development in the skills area. It brings in vital knowledge and experience from the field. It has been able to bring experienced expertise to new legislation as well - not just the Veterinarian Act, but also issues such as Animal Welfare, Dog Control and even HASNO legislation.

"The veterinary profession is an example of how knowledge and technology is crucial to the development of our primary industries. I congratulate the veterinary sector on the contribution it has and is making to bring us to today. And I look forward with every confidence to a future for the industry which will be very positive," Jim Anderton said.
