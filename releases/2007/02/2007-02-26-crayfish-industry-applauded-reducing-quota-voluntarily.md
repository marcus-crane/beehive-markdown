The Minister of Fisheries, Jim Anderton applauded the decision of the CRA 4 (Wellington, Wairarapa/ Hawkes Bay) rock lobster industry which has voted to voluntarily reduce their catch for the 2007/08 fishing year.

"It is great to see quota holders actively managing their catch allocation to get the best economic return – that’s what the Quota Management System (QMS) is all about. The CRA 4 fishery is declining, but according to our most recent stock assessment, the stock size is still above the level where I would have concerns about sustainability and meeting my obligations as Minister of Fisheries," Jim Anderton said today on hearing the CRA 4 decision.

"If future stock assessments suggest the stock is below acceptable levels, I will cut catches, because that is my responsibility. In making this decision, CRA 4 shelve part of their Annual Catch Entitlement for rock lobster. In reality, the quota holders are showing that their commitment to the fishery is long-term – they’re not about making a quick buck and moving on.

"The industry people are looking at the longer-term and saying they can get better returns overall if they leave fish in the water today in order to improve catch rates tomorrow and thus reduce their operating costs.

"In today’s world of higher fuel prices, uncertain foreign exchange rates and ever changing market demands, it makes good sense.

"I am pleased to see that fishers, rather than being focussed on taking every fish they are entitled to, are looking to get the best value from their fishing right. This signals a good way of working together, " Jim Anderton said.

Background to the CRA 4 ACE (Annual Catch Entitlement) Shelving

Quota holders in a fishery always have the option of collectively managing catch within the TACC (i.e. the catch allocated to commercial fishers by the Minister). The reasons for collectively choosing not to catch some of their catch allocation (that is, to shelve Annual Catch Entitlement) include:  
§To improve economic efficiency in the fishery – sometimes economic returns are better if more fish are left in the water because this improves catch rates and reduces the costs of fishing.  
§To avoid a TACC cut, which can affect book value – if abundance in a fishery falls below the level required by law or the accepted proxy/target (i.e., the level that can produce maximum sustainable yield), then the Minister has an obligation to reduce catches - fishers will sometimes act voluntarily to retain the fishery above this level and avoid catch limit

Since the mid 1990s, the CRA 4 fishery has experienced a period of high abundance, most likely due to an unusually high settlement of juvenile rock lobsters in the early 1990s.

In the past few years the fishery has been declining towards what we refer to as our reference stock level. The reference stock level is used as a proxy for the “stock level that produces maximum sustainable yield” – which is where the Minister’s obligation lies (the Minister is required by law to keep the stock at or above the level that produces maximum sustainable yield).

If the stock falls below the reference level, the Minister is obliged by law to cut the Total Allowable Catch (the TAC) and reduce associated catch allowances as appropriate - voluntary ACE shelving cannot be used as a substitute for the Minister taking this action.

The 2005 stock assessment showed the stock was declining but still above the reference level. It was projected the stock would remain above it for the subsequent 3 years. If current catches continue, many consider it likely the stock size will fall below the reference level.

CRA 4 quota holders are concerned about reducing economic returns as the costs of fishing have increased and catch rates are decreasing. They are also concerned that there may be TACC cuts ahead.

In sitting down to talk ACE shelving, they are looking for opportunities to improve economic efficiencies and returns, by increasing abundance in the fishery to levels that provide for improved dollar returns. In doing so, they are showing their long-term commitment to the fishery.
