The number of people receiving the Unemployment Benefit continues to plummet, as does youth and long-term unemployment, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

“Thanks to the Labour government the number of people on the Unemployment Benefit is down to 37, 595 – less than a quarter of what it was under National. This reflects our historically low unemployment rate of 3.7 percent,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“On top of this, the number of unemployed youth aged between 18 and 19 has fallen by 83 percent under this government. There were 18,000 such young New Zealanders unemployed in 1999 but now there are less than 3,000. These numbers reflect this government’s determination to see all young people in education, training or work.

“The number of people who are unemployed long-term has also fallen since Labour took office. 70,000 people had been unemployed for more than a year under National compared to around 14,000 today – a reduction of 56,000.

“This government is committed to getting New Zealanders into work, and this commitment is reflected in the latest figures of success,” said Mr Benson-Pope.
