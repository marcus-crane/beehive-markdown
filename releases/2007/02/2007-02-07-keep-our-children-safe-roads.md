Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death of children up to 14 years of age, Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven said today.

“With the new school year it’s vital to get off to a good start in road safety – for everyone who uses the roads. There are important safety messages parents and schools can repeat and reinforce. It is also critical that adults set a good example with safe behaviour on our roads,” Mr Duynhoven said.

For keeping children safe as pedestrians:

Encourage children to use pedestrian crossings appropriately whenever these are available;

If you are waiting for a child, ensure you meet them on their side of the road – never wait for a child on the opposite side of a road;

Always hold the hands of young children on pavements and crossing the road, or use reins if you have more children than hands;

Point out hazards to children while you are walking along with them;

Never allow children to play on the roadside. Play should be reserved for the garden, parks and other protected areas;

Ensure your children do not listen to i-pods or talk/text on mobile phones while they are crossing roads – they need all their senses to do this safely  
For the safety of younger and older children as passengers:

Always ensure children are correctly restrained in an approved child restraint when travelling in a vehicle – even for very short trips;

Take particular care getting children into and out of vehicles and do not load/unload children in high traffic areas – walk a little bit further;

Make sure all hands are inside the car before shutting doors. (Getting small children to put hands on noses before the door is shut helps.);

Warn your teenagers against travelling with unlicensed drivers or drivers who have been drinking – always ensure they have an alternative means to get home;

Make sure they are aware of appropriate speeds for the conditions and encourage them to speak up if they feel the driver is travelling too fast  
"Drivers should take particular care when coming out of driveways, especially if you have a fenced section that can hide small pedestrians and pavement cyclists from view.

“Over the last five years, the total number of children killed, aged between 5 and 15, was 132 – with 980 seriously injured. This includes those using the roads as pedestrians and cyclists, as well as drivers and passengers. Reinforcing road safety messages is essential if we are to change this.

“Remember, too, that children learn respect for road safety from a very early age – make sure you always model good driver, pedestrian and cyclist behaviour,” Mr Duynhoven said today.
