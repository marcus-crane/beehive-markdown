A number of groups have raised concerns with Food Safety Minister Annette King about the proposed approval of genetically modified high lysine corn LY038, and as a result she has requested that the Ministerial Council seek a review of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) proposal to approve the corn.

FSANZ recommended that the Ministerial Council approve the sale and use of food derived from LY038 corn. The corn has been genetically modified by Monsanto to have increased levels of the amino acid lysine and has been designed as an animal feed. Corn is not traditionally a good source of lysine, and conventional diets for some animals (such as pigs and chickens) are characteristically deficient in lysine and require the addition of supplemental lysine for optimal growth and performance.

Though the corn has been developed as an animal feed, there is a chance that it could inadvertently enter the food chain, so, as with all other GM animal feeds, it has to be approved for human consumption before it can be approved as an animal feed.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is the trans-Tasman body with responsibility for drafting food standards, which are ultimately decided upon by the Australia New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council (ANZFRMC).

Annette King is a member of the ANZFRMC, which is responsible (amongst other things) for the development of food regulatory policy and policy guidelines for setting food standards that are shared between Australia and New Zealand. It has the capacity to adopt, amend or reject standards and to request that these be reviewed.

The Minister sought a review on the grounds that there were inconsistencies between the processes described in the domestic and international standards, in particular, the choice of comparator. The process may, as a result, need revisiting in order to ensure consumer confidence is maintained.
