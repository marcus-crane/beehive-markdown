The new system that prevents fine dodgers from travelling overseas proved its success over the summer holidays, Courts Minister Rick Barker said today.

"[*Pay or Stay*](http://www.payorstay.govt.nz/) enables the [Collections Unit of the Ministry of Justice](http://www.justice.govt.nz/ministry/collections-unit-offices.html) to catch people with unpaid reparation or fines if they are travelling overseas.

“A total of 27 people with outstanding fines were stopped in December and January. Of these, 18 paid in full and the remaining 9 are either due to appear in court, having been arrested, or have arrangements in place to pay outstanding fines.

“The total amount owed by those stopped was $123,743, of which $48,537 was reparation owed to victims.

“The message to the community is clear. There’s only one way of making fines go away and that is to pay them. Serious fine evaders will pay the price, and will either not be allowed to travel out of New Zealand or will be stopped if they try to come in.

“People are recognising that it is better to pay up rather than being stopped at the airport, and are phoning our Call Centres to make arrangements to pay their fines.

“$15,000 was paid over the counter by one individual who was seeking to travel overseas in the Christmas period and who recognised that it was better to pay up than be stopped at the airport

“Another excellent trend is that some of those stopped for owing reparations have been people who now reside on Australia. These people used to be able to get away without paying their fines – now the moment they arrive back in New Zealand they are stopped and if they can’t pay, they are arrested," said Rick Barker.

The December and January figures bought the total number of people intercepted since the initiative began on 28 September 2006 to 41 people. The intercepts took place at Auckland (30), Christchurch (6), Wellington (3), Dunedin (1) and Hamilton (1). Thirty took place on arrival, while 11 intercepts took place on departure.

The total amount netted since the Pay or Stay initiative began is $808,662.

"Anyone who owes fines and reparation should take note; fines and reparation orders will not go away. The system will not forget and we won’t give up our efforts to collect," said Rick Barker.
