"Just released figures on new planting, replanting and deforestation confirm recent trends and highlight the need for urgent action on forestry policy,” Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“Deforestation is increasing, and new planting and replanting is steadily declining in the absence of Government intervention. We have to give serious consideration to taking action to address the environmental impacts of large-scale changes in land-use.

"The information, released today by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, reinforces the need for serious and rational debate on the forestry options in the Government’s Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change discussion document.

“We have to develop mechanisms to both manage deforestation and encourage new planting and replanting simultaneously. Options for this are being consulted upon at present,” said Jim Anderton.

It is estimated that 12,800 hectares, mostly in Canterbury and the Central North Island, of the forest harvested in 2006 will be deforested (converted to another land-use). That represents a third of the 38,800 hectares of forest harvested in 2006. Predictions are that a high rate of deforestation will continue until 2020 unless something is done.

“The overwhelming majority of this deforestation is being conducted by a handful of corporate property investors attracted by the profits from converting forests to high value lifestyle blocks and dairy land," said Jim Anderton.

"These corporate investors bought their forests after the Government announced in 2002 that it would limit the extent to which taxpayers would cover deforestation costs. So, the fact that the Government needs to address deforestation shouldn’t come as a surprise to these investors and that is something they should have considered when they decided to buy their forest.

"Undoubtedly, some investors are also accelerating their deforestation activities to take advantage of this period before measures to manage deforestation kick in,” Jim Anderton said.

“Regardless of the reasons, deforestation will cost the taxpayer around $650 million in greenhouse gas emission liabilities if no action is taken to control it or apportion some of the cost to those who are profiting. The considerable negative environmental costs from erosion, increased run-off into waterways and flood risk are also being borne by communities and the environment. This is neither sustainable nor fair.

“The Government’s focus is on measures that ensure that those driving large-scale deforestation meet at least some of the true costs of their actions. Such measures can then be balanced with incentives that reverse the decline in new plantings and replanting,” Jim Anderton said.
