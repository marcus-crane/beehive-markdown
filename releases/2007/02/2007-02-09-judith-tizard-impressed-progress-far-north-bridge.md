Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard has been in the Far North today and is impressed with progress made to restate the Mitimiti Bridge linking Cape Reinga with the rest of New Zealand.

The southern approach to the bridge, which is part of State Highway One, collapsed in heavy rain resulting in the road closure.

The Minister, along with Transit's Northland Engineer Richard Green and Northern Operations Manager Joseph Flanagan, visited the Mitimiti Bridge located 40 kilometres south of Cape Reinga, to see the progress on the repairs and to talk with locals, civil defence staff and local government representatives.

Judith Tizard says she's impressed with the speed of Transit's response. "They flew in an entire team of contractors to fix the problem right away", the Minister said.

"It has required a huge effort under tremendously difficult circumstances and in a remote location. So it's required a massive effort and co-operation from all parties."

"Locals and tourists alike praised all those involved in the repair and were amazed at the speed with which Transit created a ford to restore access to this already isolated region".

Crews are on the job for about 14 hours today and the road is expected to reopen on Sunday morning.
