Judith Tizard says New Zealand music today owes much to the talent and innovation of Maori Music icons honoured at the launch of the inaugural Maori Music Awards held in Palmerston.

The Maori Music Icons honoured are Sir Howard Morrison whose career has spanned four decades; Missy Teka who along with Tui Teka has made a huge contribution to Maori music and the wider industry; Tommy Taurima a respected and influential composer; and Kapahaka icons Ngapo and Pimia Wehi.

In congratulating the five Maori artists, the Associate Arts, Culture & Heritage Minister Judith Tizard reflected on the contribution they and generations of Maori artists have made to New Zealand music.

"These icons are household names who have made a huge contribution to Maori music and culture as well as to New Zealand music. In addition Tommy Taurima and Ngapo and Pimia Wehi have also been generous in passing on their skills and knowledge to young Maori."

"The success of current New Zealand music and our bands overseas owes much to these icons. Early 60s show bands like the Volcanics, and Prince Tui Teka and the Troubadours blazed a trail overseas for today's bands.

"Music has always been a strong element of Maori culture so it's exciting to honour these people during Te Matatini, the national kapahaka festival currently on in Palmerston North."
