Child, Youth and Family Services Minister Ruth Dyson has announced that the Parekarangi site, south of Rotorua, is the preferred site for the new Youth Justice Central residence.

"Extensive testing of the Parekarangi site has confirmed that it is geologically suitable and that, together with the strong local support for the site, enables us to move to the next stage - formal designation of the land," said Ruth Dyson.

"However the site does present significant building challenges compared with the previous Kaharoa site and final details of the work are to be done and costs are yet to be finalised."

"CYF officials will prepare the Notice of Requirement for Designation under the Resource Management Act. Resource consents and building consents will then be sought. I expect futher geotechnical and civil engineering advice to be completed within the next two months."

"If the results of this advice are positive and barring unforseen circumstances, construction on the residence is expected to start before the end of this year."

Ms Dyson said "I would like to thank the people of Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty region for their patience during what has turned out to be a lengthy process. This residence is a vital resource for the youth justice system and a major investment for Child, Youth and Family. It was essential that we took the time and care we did to ensure that this site met the criteria required."

The 10-hectare site is on Parekarangi Trust land, off State Highway 30, Rotorua, 12 kilometres south of Rotorua City.

Child, Youth and Family is planning to seek a designation for 40 young people to be accommodated. The residence is planned to be built in stages. Initially 24 young people will be housed in the residence.
