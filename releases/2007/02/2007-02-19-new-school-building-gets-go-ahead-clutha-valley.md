Education Minister Steve Maharey has today announced that funding has been approved to rebuild Clutha Valley School, and work on the project can go ahead.

"The Clutha Valley community can look forward to their new, modern school, as $4.3 million has been allocated to build a six classroom state of the art school building.

"The new school will include a multipurpose library area, administration offices, and landscaping, to provide for a roll of 140 pupils.

"And contrary to reports, energy efficient features will be included, such as solar and under-floor heating, double glazing and a wood pellet fire boiler system. The new school will also have computer and communications systems."

Steve Maharey says the new facilities will be a huge benefit to the whole community, and are part of the Labour-led government's commitment to providing a world-class education system.
