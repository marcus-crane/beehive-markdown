Imagine being able to access medical technology that can remove blockages to an artery precisely, without having to undergo an operation, or the production of new bio-degradable materials which would in time remove environmental contamination.

These are just some of the future developments highlighted in the [Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies Roadmap](http://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/news/stories/initiative.html) launched by Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

“Nanoscience is one of the most exciting emerging sciences and offers huge potential benefits for New Zealand, such as more environmentally sustainable technologies,” says Mr Maharey.

"It involves making use of the tiniest materials, as small as a single atom or molecule, to build extremely small electronic devices, such as computer chips. Nanoscience deals with matter up to 80,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair."

Mr Maharey says the roadmap, which was developed by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, outlines New Zealand's world leading status in these fields.

"The roadmap will help guide research and build our country's science systems capabilities, so that our scientists stay at the cutting edge of developments and more effectively address challenges that may arise.

"It will also help ensure New Zealand has the ability to determine what overseas developments are useful here."

"It is important to ensure New Zealand has the world’s best systems to protect human and environmental health, while still allowing innovative science."

Over 400 scientists from around the world are in Wellington this week to attend the Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology Conference to discuss nanoscience and the potential for technology development in the industry.
