Education Minister Steve Maharey today launched a new programme, which will encourage higher levels of student engagement and retention in the senior school by improving careers information and guidance.

"The programme, Creating Pathways and Building Lives (CPaBL), will give students world class careers education to prepare them for lifelong learning," Steve Maharey said.

On a visit to Wellington High School this morning Steve Maharey said the Labour-led government was investing $7.59 million over the next two years in career education to help ease the transition from school to employment.

"The programme will improve the provision of career information, advice and guidance within schools. It will also specifically address the needs of student's at high risk of leaving school with an early leaver's exemption.

"As part of CPaBL, years 9 to 13 students will be given a range of advice and information tailored to their future career choices.

"The Labour-led government believes all students need to be able to access careers information so that they can make an informed subject choice for further study, vocational training and work decisions."

Currently 100 schools have been allocated funding to take part in the programme, which allows teachers to take part in professional development in order to help their school raise the profile of careers education.
