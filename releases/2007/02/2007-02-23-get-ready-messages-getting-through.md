The [Get Ready, Get Thru](http://www.getthru.govt.nz) public education campaign is raising awareness of the need to be better prepared for disasters, Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker said today.

Releasing the details of the six monthly Colmar Brunton research on the levels of preparedness and the effectiveness of the campaign, Rick Barker said that while there has been an increase in preparedness, many people are still not adequately prepared.

“It is pleasing that three-quarters of people have done something as a result of seeing the television ads,” said Rick Barker.

“This includes thinking about what they should do and talking about it with friends and family, as well as people who say they have started getting a plan and emergency items together.

“Our pre-campaign research showed that only 21% of New Zealanders were prepared should a disaster occur when they were at home. Six months after the launch of the [Get Ready, Get Thru](http://www.getthru.govt.nz) campaign 29% report they are prepared.

“These initial results are heartening but show we still have a long way to go. This week’s earthquakes in Auckland also highlighted that many people are still not as prepared as they should be.

“[Get Ready, Get Thru](http://www.getthru.govt.nz) is a long term programme to raise awareness of the hazards we face in New Zealand, improve understanding of what we each can do to reduce the risks, and create an environment where people make a commitment to being prepared.

“We have made a good start and the challenge now is to build on that momentum and continue preparing,” said Rick Barker.
