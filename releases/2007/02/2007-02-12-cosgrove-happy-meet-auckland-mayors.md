In response to Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey's request today, Building and Construction Minister Clayton Cosgrove said he is happy to attend a meeting of the Auckland Mayoral Forum to discuss the leaky buildings issue.

"I have met with all the Auckland Mayors individually in the past and am happy to meet with them again," Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said while he recognised the position of local authorities where the other liable parties had disappeared or gone bust, he said taxpayers did not improperly design, build or inspect these leaky homes, and therefore cannot be held liable.

"The Government has just passed [legislation](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=686039289&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BA23F5%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) in December 2006 to revamp the [Weathertight Homes Resolution Service](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/whrs-index) so that homeowners can more easily go after the liable parties to get the compensation they deserve, get their homes fixed and get on with their lives."

"Local authorities have insurance to cover their public liability, and it is not the role of the taxpayer to indemnify the insurance industry," Mr Cosgrove said.

"My focus and that of the Government has been, and continues to be, on transforming the building and construction industry to raise the benchmark for quality, improve consumer confidence in the sector, and ensure that buildings are designed, built and inspected right the first time, through a series of initiatives.

These include:

- the licensing of building practitioners while protecting the Kiwi do-it-yourself tradition,
- a complete top-to-bottom [review of the Building Code](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/bcl-building-code-review),
- the auditing and accreditation of building consent authorities,
- the $30.5 million revamp of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Service with a new Tribunal starting up on 1 April this year and
- a pilot lending assistance scheme for the worst affected homeowners, plus
- investigating a product certification regime and a home warranty insurance scheme.

Mr Cosgrove said that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the Colleen Dicks case as the matter is before the courts.
