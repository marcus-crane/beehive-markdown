The Government will pay half the estimated $2.2 million cost of resealing the runway at Taupo airport, says Transport Minister Annette King.

Ms King says the Government is a partner in the airport with Taupo District Council and as such shares the cost of capital developments.

“The airport is important to Taupo’s economy, as an entry point to the region and also as the base of a range of tourist facilities including sky-diving and helicopter charters,” she says.

Taupo MP Mark Burton has welcomed the decision. “Resealing is necessary to extend the life of the runway which has been in use since 1965. By confirming its half share of the cost, the Government has helped to secure the airport’s long-term future.”

Ms King says the decision can also be seen as expressing confidence in steps taken by Taupo District Council and by the airport’s users to resolve differences that have characterised their relationship in the recent past.

Mr Burton says it is anticipated that the reseal will be completed before the onset of cooler temperatures in the autumn. Construction work will be undertaken at nights so that normal daytime use of the airport will not be obstructed.
