A new report outlining and tracking the success of the education system has been launched today, by the Education Minister, Steve Maharey.

“The State of Education in New Zealand 2006” report is a vast resource of statistics, facts and figures around key aspects and national trends within education.

"It shows that New Zealand students perform at or above the international mean in reading, mathematics and science, and that record numbers of children are involved in Early Childhood Education.

"There is also detailed data around the improved level of students leaving school with qualifications since the introduction of NCEA. After little or no change in the previous 20 years, the last three years have seen the proportion of students leaving school with little or no formal attainment drop from 18 per cent to 13 per cent.

"The State of Education report also tracks tertiary education, revealing that the number of students who enrolled in tertiary rose by 45 percent from 2000 to 2005, and participation by Maori has grown by twice the rate of non-Maori since 1999."

Steve Maharey says by any measure, our education system is world-class, and this report brings together some of the enormous amount of information we have available in a useful and accessible way.

"I'd like to say a special thank you to all the teachers, principals and Boards of Trustees whose effort and hard work makes our education system a success."

The report has been collated from material on the Ministry of Education’s website for statistics and research, called Education Counts.
