Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor said he was astonished to see the ease at which the National Party was prepared to backtrack on its previous ideological position.

He was commenting on the National Party's announcement that it would fold the Corrections Department back into the Justice Ministry if it got into government.

"It's an extraordinary proposal coming from the very party that split the Department of Corrections from the Justice Ministry in the first place, back in 1995. It's another National flip-flop.

"The announcement has all the hallmarks of policy being created on the hoof, with the National Party unlikely to have done any proper analysis."

Mr O'Connor said he was confident Corrections chief executive Barry Matthews will steer his department through this difficult time and lead any essential changes required.

"Clearly there are issues that need to be addressed. This is the Government's priority for Corrections. It is difficult to know how proposing a bureaucratic change is going to have any immediate impact."
