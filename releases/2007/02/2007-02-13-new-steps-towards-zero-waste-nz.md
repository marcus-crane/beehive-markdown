Communities will be given new tools to minimise and manage waste as the Labour-led government accelerates its efforts to protect New Zealand's clean and green image, Environment Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

The new drive to cut down on waste and make it easier to dispose of was unveiled as part of the government's sustainability agenda, outlined by Prime Minister Helen Clark in her [statement for the opening of Parliament](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28357).

"It's time to accelerate our efforts to reduce waste in New Zealand," David Benson-Pope said.

"As momentum gathers around the Labour-led government's sustainability agenda we have an opportunity to take big steps forward towards a zero-waste New Zealand."

New initiatives -- to be formally worked through with local government and announced later in the year -- include:

- a network of public recycling stations
- the creation of a waste levy to fund projects to encourage recycling and recovery
- regulation to allow for mandatory product stewardship, including recognition of existing industry sponsored schemes

"Cutting down on waste and finding better ways to dispose of it is vital to our work to make the New Zealand economy fully sustainable," David Benson-Pope said.

"But it's also an important part of protecting the 'clean and green' image that all New Zealanders value.

"Over the past few years, our communities have made significant progress in controlling waste. For example, 72 per cent of all paper packaging in New Zealand now gets recycled - that's ahead of the target set in the New Zealand Packaging Accord.

"Local government is already showing leadership on this issue. Last November Timaru became the first place in New Zealand to introduce a three-bin recycling system and the Prime Minister is set to open a major new recycling facility in Palmerston North next week.

"Businesses are also calling for further action. The tourism industry is telling us that a top complaint they get from overseas visitors is about the lack of places to drop off recycling and rubbish as they travel around the country.

The full details of the government's waste minimisation and management efforts will be announced later in the year as well as in Budget 2007. Issues requiring legislation -- including the creation of a waste levy -- will be worked through in collaboration with other parties in Parliament.

### Q&A -- Waste minimisation and management

***What is proposed?***  
The government is increasing its focus on reducing and managing waste in New Zealand. In particular the government sees the need for a legislative backstop to support product stewardship schemes and additional funding, through a levy on waste, to increase the scope and effectiveness of local and national waste minimisation initiatives. The government will also to develop, in partnership with local government, develop a public space recycling programme.

Some of these proposals require changes to legislation before they can come into effect. It is probable that these will be included in the Waste Minimisation (Solids) Bill currently before the Select Committee and is expected to receive its second reading in July 2007. If successful, the legislation could be enacted before the end of the year.

***What is public space recycling?***  
Public space recycling is a network of recycling bins in public spaces so that people can recycle when they are away from home as well. This will also assist in providing tourists to our shores the option to recycle as they travel around the country.

The programme is likely to start in Auckland, and government will support local authorities with the costs. There will be further discussions with local government about how the programme will be developed, and it is hoped it will eventually expand to cover other public spaces such shopping malls, supermarkets and the like.

***What is the waste levy?***  
A waste levy is a levy on all solid waste going to a final disposal facility (like a landfill). The purpose of the levy is to provide a source of funds to fund projects to encourage recycling and recovery.

***What is product stewardship?***  
Product stewardship is a tool that encourages everyone involved in the manufacture, use and disposal of a product -- producers, brand owners, importers, retailers, consumers and other parties -- to take greater responsibility for the environmental effects of their products throughout the product lifecycle.

Product stewardship is a flexible approach which enables the best means of minimising the environmental risks of a product to be considered at the most appropriate stage of its lifecycle.

Examples of existing product stewardship schemes:

- Resene's Paintwise paint and packaging take-back
- the Packaging Accord
- Fisher & Paykel's whiteware take-back
- Vodafone's and Telecom's cell phone take-back
- refrigerant recovery
- TyreTrack for used tyres
- The Used Oil collection programme.

The Ministry is also working with industry to develop new schemes to address product waste issues with farm plastics, computers and TVs.

***What has already been done to better manage waste?***  
The New Zealand Waste Strategy sets out the Government's framework for the management and minimisation of waste. The strategy is a partnership between central and local government. Since the Waste Strategy was launched in 2002 there have been several areas of particular achievement including:

- Good progress by local government in improving community access to recycling and green waste diversion schemes, and in developing innovative waste minimisation and management initiatives within their communities;
- Good progress by central government in developing guidelines to improve the management of landfill sites and hazardous wastes, and by the waste sector and councils in implementing these.
- Increased central government engagement with businesses to achieve waste outcomes, e.g. through the Packaging Accord, and via voluntary product stewardship schemes

***What do I have to do as a result of the Prime Minister's Statement?***  
More details on any regulatory changes will be announced later in the year.
