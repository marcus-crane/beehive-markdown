Health Minister Pete Hodgson says that an additional 15,000 New Zealanders taking out health insurance in 2006 is unsurprising.

"About a third of our population opts to take out health insurance at any one time, and our population is [increasing by approximately 40,000 each year](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/national-population-estimates/national-population-estimates-dec06qtr-hotp.htm?page=para001Master), so the increase is in line with expectation," Pete Hodgson says.

"Similarly, the reduction in those choosing comprehensive insurance instead of opting for more limited coverage, is also unsurprising given that the cost of going to the GP has halved in the last few years for most people."

Pete Hodgson said that the final phase of the [reduced GP fees roll-out](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/wpg_Index/About-GP+visits), for those aged 25–44 years of age, begins on 1 July 2007, two years ahead of schedule.
