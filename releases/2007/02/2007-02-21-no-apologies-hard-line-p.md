Courts Minister Rick Barker today made no apology for the Government’s tough stance on methamphetamine.

Figures released by the Ministry of Justice show that, nationwide, the number of new meth-related committals increased 57% from 136 in 2004 to 213 in 2006; in Auckland the number of new meth-related committals increased 87% from 47 in 2004 to 88 in 2006.

“The Labour-led Government’s re-classification of methamphetamine in 2003 sent a clear message to people that selling P is a serious criminal activity,” said Rick Barker.

“While the re-classification has impacted on court caseloads in general I’m happy to see these cases coming to court, and I’m happy to deal with the caseload issue if it means getting this disgusting and dangerous habit out of our communities.

“It shows the Police are working harder than ever to track offenders with the intention of using or selling these despicable drugs to people, including children, in our communities. This rubbish must be cleaned up and the government’s commitment to stamping this problem out is having an impact.

“We’re using a variety of approaches to manage the increased number of methamphetamine cases. In conjunction with the Judiciary we have established a national roster of high court judges that allows the Judiciary to apply its judicial resource in areas where it is most needed.

“We have increased the number of Judicial support staff, renovated the Auckland High Court to better utilise space and make room for more judges and support staff, last year we appointed a further 3 new high court judges, and we have introduced video conferencing technology to speed up the hearing process.

“The Judiciary has asked Government to consider middle-banding methamphetamine and the Criminal Procedures Bill is already before the House that will allow some cases involving methamphetamine to be heard in the district court to assist with case loads. Methamphetamine would remain a Class A drug.

“I expect that with the support of the Opposition, this Bill will progress rapidly through the House.

“Recognising the impact methamphetamine has on case loads the Government has acted to bring more Judicial resource, support resource and changes in legislation. I want this rubbish out of our communities and I will not apologise for that,” said Rick Barker.
