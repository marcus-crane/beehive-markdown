The newly-signed agreement to protect Lake Taupo shows how serious the Government is about protecting New Zealand's waterways, says Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

Agreements establishing the Lake Taupo Protection Project were signed today on the shores of the lake by Mr Benson-Pope, on behalf of the Government, and Environment Waikato and Taupo District Council. Ngati Tuwharetoa, as kaitiaki of the Lake, are also partners in the project.

"At almost $82 million over 15 years, this is the largest environmental project in New Zealand," said Mr Benson-Pope. "It's the biggest, but it isn't the first such project and it certainly will not be the last.

“Lake Taupo is an icon, for locals, all New Zealanders and for overseas visitors but it is an example of the water-related challenges we are facing across the country.

"Like many of our waterways, Taupo’s water quality is under threat from land use activities in its catchment. The lake's water quality is deteriorating due to excess run-off of nutrients, particularly nitrogen."

The Lake Taupo Protection Trust is charged with developing a programme of work for the next 15 years that will reduce by 20 percent the amount of manageable nitrogen flowing into the lake.

"Use – and misuse – of water is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st Century," said Mr Benson-Pope. "The problems faced by Lake Taupo are not unique and they are not isolated.

"The Government has acknowledged the challenge and through the Sustainable Water Programme of Action we are developing a strategic, nationally consistent approach to water management. Other initiatives include improving water quality in the Rotorua Lakes and a water management plan for the Waitaki Catchment.

“The Taupo mission has the added significance of being a model for future projects. Central government, local government, regional interests and iwi are working as one on this project and that is the way of the future."

The event was also attended by Taupo MP Mark Burton, who called the day a significant milestone for environmental protection both in Taupo and New Zealand.
