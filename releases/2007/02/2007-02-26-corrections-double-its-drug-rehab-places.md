The Corrections Department is doubling its efforts to help prisoners address their alcohol and drug use.

Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor announced today that three new drug treatment units will open over the next two years, which will result in more than 500 prisoners per year getting access to intensive treatment.

A unit will open at Hawkes Bay Prison in April 2007 followed by one at Rimutaka Prison in July 2007 and another at Spring Hill Corrections Facility near Auckland in July 2008.

Drug treatment units have already been established at Waikeria, Christchurch Men’s and Arohata Prisons.

Mr O'Connor said the programmes, run by specialist providers, make our communities safer by offering the kind of intensive treatment that gives offenders the chance to turn their lives around.

"Research shows that offenders who have been through a treatment unit are 13 per cent less likely to be re-imprisoned after 24 months than if they had not attended treatment.

"When you consider that 60 per cent of offenders are affected by alcohol or other drugs at the time of their offence, the potential for facilities such as these to reduce re-offending is very compelling."

The six-month programme provided for participants includes behavioural therapy, education on addiction and change, building new skills, group therapy and one-to-one therapy.

To be admitted to a Drug Treatment Unit, prisoners must:  
·Be assessed as alcohol and/or drug dependent.  
·Be able to complete a six-month programme before release.  
·Be assessed to have a high risk of re-offending or re-conviction.  
·Acknowledge and accept the need to do something about it.  
·Have sufficient intellectual capacity and English language ability to allow participation in a group situation.

While in the DTU prisoners must:  
·Adhere to the contract they signed upon entry into the Unit - including a stipulation to be drug and alcohol free.  
·Complete the required number of programme hours.  
·Agree to attend other activities and work education programmes when not participating in the DTU programme.  
·Submit to drug tests when required.
