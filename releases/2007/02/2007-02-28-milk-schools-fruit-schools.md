Tomorrow marks the 70th anniversary the introduction of free milk to New Zealand primary school children, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said from Corinna School in Porirua today.

The idea was first recommended during the Depression but it was not until 1935 when Labour swept to power that the scheme was introduced and children received a free half pint bottle at each morning break.

Health Minister of the day Peter Fraser said at the time it was “one of the most progressive instalments of socialism New Zealand ever had.”

"While the intention is similar with [Fruit in Schools](http://www.moh.govt.nz/fruitinschools) and [Health Promoting Schools](http://www.healthed.govt.nz/resources/abouthealthpromotingschools.aspx) the 21 Century approach is rather different. Children and their families are now interested in learning about good nutrition and exercise as contributors to good health.

"Here at Corinna School the students, the teachers and the local families have worked together to raise their awareness and improve their own outcomes. Yesterday they received their second National Heart Foundation Gold Award," Pete Hodgson said

"This community is serious about providing their own sustainable solutions and I rather think Peter Fraser would be very happy at that," Pete Hodgson said.
