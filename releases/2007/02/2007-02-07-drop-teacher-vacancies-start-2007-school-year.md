A drop in the number of teacher vacancies ahead of the new school year reflects the government's efforts to match teacher numbers with demand, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Schools will start the year with an estimated 753,000 students and 50,000 teachers but only about 370 teacher vacancies. This is less than one percent of all teaching positions.

"When school starts back on Wednesday there will be enough teachers available to meet demand, with relief teachers covering any vacancies."

Steve Maharey said the results of the government's investment in teacher supply initiatives are hugely encouraging. More people than ever are choosing a career in teaching and fewer people are exiting the profession.

"The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring that there will be no more than 15 children per new entrant class in Primary Schools."

Initiatives to improve the teacher-student ratio include:

- Starting salaries for primary and secondary teachers have increased each year since 2003 and are now around $40,000
- Training allowances, scholarships and student loan support
- More non-contact time to allow for professional development throughout teachers' careers and to give teachers more time to consider student needs
- Salary incentives and payment of removal expenses to encourage teachers to work in low decile schools
- International relocation grants to encourage New Zealand trained teachers to return, and encourage overseas teachers
- TV advertising of teaching as a rewarding and highly satisfying career
