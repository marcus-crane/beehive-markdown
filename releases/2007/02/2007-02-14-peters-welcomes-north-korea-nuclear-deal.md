Foreign Minister Winston Peters is welcoming news that North Korea has agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities in exchange for energy assistance and other measures.

“We are currently examining the detail of the agreement, but by all accounts it looks like a significant step,” Mr Peters said.

“We congratulate the participating countries in the Six Party Talks for being able to work through the issue of North Korea's nuclear programme. New Zealand has long believed that dialogue was the key to finding a solution.

“There will be challenges to resolve in the period ahead, but the agreement represents a significant step forward in a process which has been effectively stalled since the Joint Statement of September 2005.

“We hope this new deal can be speedily and fully implemented. We do not want to see a nuclear or security crisis on the Korean Peninsula.

"If North Korea demonstrates a genuine commitment to implementing the agreement, in particular by shutting down the Yongbyon nuclear facility and allowing the return of nuclear inspectors, the international community will be able to warm relations with Pyongyang,” Mr Peters said.

The draft deal was struck between North Korea and the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia in the early hours of Tuesday morning, but was referred to capitals for final approval. The deal was formalised late yesterday in Beijing.

New Zealand established diplomatic relations with North Korea in 2001 but development of the relationship has remained on hold due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile weapons programmes.
