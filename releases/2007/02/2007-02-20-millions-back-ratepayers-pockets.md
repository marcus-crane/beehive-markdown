The average rates rebate received by a New Zealand household is more than two and half times the size of a rates rebate received before changes were made to the scheme on 1 July 2006.

Eligible New Zealand households have received on average a rates rebate of $448 compared with $165 for the 2005/06 financial year.

The latest figures were released by the Minister of Local Government Mark Burton in Parliament today.

"The improved rates rebates scheme has proved very successful with New Zealand households with more than 90,000 receiving some $41,276,000 in rates rebates since 1 July," Mark Burton said. "The improved scheme is making a real difference for many New Zealand households."

"This compares with the 2005/06 rating year in which some 4,200 households received around $700,000 in rates rebates."

As at 1 July a number of changes were made to the rates rebates scheme. The key changes included:

- An increase in the maximum rebate from $200 to $500;
- In most cases the income threshold under which people will be eligible for a full rebate increased from $7,400 to $20,000, although quite a number of people earning over this figure are also eligible to receive a rates rebate depending on their rates bill;  
  oFor example, a married couple who received New Zealand Superannuation of $24,456 and are paying annual rates of $1,746 or more would still be entitled to a maximum rates rebate of $500;
- An increase in the additional income allowance for each dependent from $156 to $500.

"I would encourage all those who think they may be eligible for a rates rebate and haven't yet applied to check with their local council."

Application forms are available from local councils and on the rates rebates website: www.ratesrebates.govt.nz.
