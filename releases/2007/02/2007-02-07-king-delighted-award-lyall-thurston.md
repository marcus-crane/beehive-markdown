Food Safety Minister Annette King says she is delighted that Rotorua health and disability advocate Lyall Thurston has been recognised with a prestigious award for his work promoting fortification of flour with folic acid.

Mr Thurston, a Lakes DHB Board member and a past president of New Zealand CCS (formerly the Crippled Children Society), received the Flour Fortification Initiative (FFI) leadership award in Sydney this week. Australians Professor Fiona Stanley and Professor Carol Bower also received the award.

“Lyall has been a tireless advocate of fortification with folic acid, and has done much to raise public awareness that mandatory fortification of bread-making flour can reduce the number of neural tube defects,” Annette King says.

“Lyall’s eldest son was born with Spina Bifida, and while this explains Lyall’s commitment to fortification, his enthusiasm and dedication remains remarkable. Substantial progress is now being made toward national flour fortification. Much of that progress can be attributed to Lyall’s advocacy.”

In a Joint Communique from the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council on 25 October 2006, all Ministerial Council members reinforced their commitment to mandatory fortification with folic acid. The Ministerial Council discussed the Final Assessment Report from Food Standards Australia New Zealand on a proposal to mandate the fortification of bread with folic acid. Food Standards Australia New Zealand have been asked to review the proposed standard due to technical considerations with the implementation of the standard and compliance issues.
