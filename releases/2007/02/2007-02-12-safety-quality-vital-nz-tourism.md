Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said he was saddened to hear of the horrific weekend crash affecting a group of Korean visitors to New Zealand

Several seriously injured passengers are being treated in hospital after a bus overturned near Tokoroa on Saturday.

"It is troubling to hear of such horrific injuries and I wish the victims a healthy recovery."

Mr O'Connor said such incidents were unusual. It was vital to get to the bottom of what happened to minimise the prospect of it happening again.

"New Zealand's reputation as a world-class visitor destination is underpinned not only by the quality of what we offer, but how safe our country is for visitors.

"No-one yet knows what factors might have led to Saturday's accident. But regardless, we must continue to do everything we can to maintain the highest standards of safety across the industry. Anything less is unacceptable."
