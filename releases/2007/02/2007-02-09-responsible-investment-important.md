Finance Minister Michael Cullen today reiterated that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund operated independently within the rules set down in its governing statute.

"I should note these rules were set in part in consultation with the Green Party before the party decided not to support the fund at all," said Dr Cullen.

"I would of course welcome the Green Party's support for the fund and their input into discussion around the Private Member's Bill drafted by Maryan Street which deals with responsible investment issues for Crown Financial Institutions.

"The bill will give Parliament a chance to examine the current framework in a sensible environment.

"It should be noted that there are now an increasing number of initiatives available to investors who wish to work together to promote the principles of responsible investment.

"As an example, the Guardians of NZ Superannuation and the Government Superannuation Fund have recently become signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. This initiative was convened by the UN Secretary-General and developed by an international group of institutional investors to reflect the increasing relevance of environmental, social and corporate governance issues to investment practices."

**Note**  
The New Zealand Superannuation Fund was established in 2003 with an initial allocation of $2.4 billion. It aims to partially provide for the future cost of New Zealand Superannuation, thereby reducing the fiscal pressure on future governments as the proportion of the population aged over 65 climbs. At present, one person in eight is over 65. This is forecast to rise to one in four by 2030. By then the fund is expected to total over $120 billion. The fund currently invests over $11 billion.
