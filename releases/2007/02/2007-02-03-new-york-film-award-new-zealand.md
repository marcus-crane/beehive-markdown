The film made for Expo 70 in Japan, "This Is New Zealand", remastered by Archives New Zealand has won a prestigious award at the New York Festivals Film and Video Competition, Archives Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

"I'm delighted that the film took out a Bronze World Medal in the festival’s special venue film section at tonight’s ceremony in New York,” says Judith Tizard. "Rosemary Banks, New Zealand’s Ambassador to the United Nations accepted the award on our behalf.

“This award is a great credit to all those involved in both the making and recent remastering of the film.

“Made by the National Film Unit for the New Zealand Commission promotion at Expo ’70 in Osaka, the original "This is New Zealand" has not been available for public viewing for over 30 years because three projectors were required to screen it."

Archives New Zealand has restored and remastered the film at Wellington's Park Road Post Production facility so the three images can now be screened using one projector. The process used was digital intermediate where the original film is scanned, digitally manipulated and then put back on to film. The film is also available digitally.

“Previous attempts to create a combined film image using traditional optical methods suffered a severe drop in quality when combining three images into one.

“We brought back the original director, Hugh Macdonald, who helped oversee the digital intermediate process. Kit Rollings, the original sound mixer, also worked on the new sound track."

Judith Tizard said the film was seen by 2 million people during its time at the Osaka Expo’70 and on its return home it was seen by nearly 25% of adult New Zealanders.

“Having the film re-mastered is a great preservation success and as a result New Zealanders can see the film following the official New Zealand premiere in March.”
