Climate Change Minister David Parker has criticised Kyoto Forestry Association head Roger Dickie for making simplistic and misleading comments about climate change proposals.

"Mr Dickie asserts that owners have a right to the carbon sink credits for forests planted after 1990. This is simply not the case. Forest owners have no property right in carbon credits, just as emitters such as farmers have no current liability for their greenhouse gas emissions."

"We are devolving credits - for [new permanent forests](http://www.maf.govt.nz/forestry/pfsi/index.htm) – and we are the first [Kyoto country](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/about/kyoto.html) in the world to do so."

Mr Parker has also taken issue with misleading claims that the government is considering a $13,000 tax on landowners converting from forestry to other land uses.

“Nowhere in the [discussion document](http://www.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/discussion-document/index.htm) does it suggest a $13,000 tax for deforestation, despite the fact that $13,000 per hectare is the estimated cost to the taxpayer associated with deforestation.

“We have already stated that our preferred option is to allow historic rates of deforestation to continue but to control increases,” Mr Parker said.

"Worldwide, deforestation causes approximately 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Obviously, steps to limit deforestation are as necessary in New Zealand as they are in other countries."

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry officials start [nationwide consultation](http://www.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/) tomorrow on the discussion document, Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change.
