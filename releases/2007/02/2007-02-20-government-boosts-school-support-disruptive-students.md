Education Minister Steve Maharey is visiting Thorndon Primary School this morning to mark the implementation of a $4.5 million initiative, to provide greater support to schools with disruptive students.

"The 'Interim Response Fund' gives principals access to emergency funding to manage critical behaviour cases. In its first week of operation, five applications were approved for the funding from schools in two different regions needing additional support.

"The emergency fund is used when existing school-based resources have been exhausted, and is now available to schools throughout New Zealand.

Steve Maharey says it's designed to encourage schools to explore ways of keeping challenging students at school, and to ensure all staff have the support they need to maintain and foster a positive environment for students, free from disruptive behaviour.

“The fund gives ‘breathing space’ for an intervention plan to be drawn up for disruptive students. For example, the money can be used to pay for a teacher aide to assist with a challenging student.

The programme is designed for quick access, and schools must apply for the funding, develop an intervention plan and report the student outcome to the Ministry of Education.

The Interim Response Fund will provide $1 million in 2007, $1.5 million in 2008 and $2 million a year from 2009.

This initiative is part of 2006 Budget funding of $9.5 million over four years to help schools tackle disruptive behaviour.
