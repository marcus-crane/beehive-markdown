Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor and Associate Tourism Minister Dover Samuels are to visit Rotorua on Friday to highlight the growing importance of Maori tourism to New Zealand, and open two exciting new ventures.

Mr O'Connor and Mr Samuels are to open a new up-market bed and breakfast, The Mud Hut, and A-Kahu House, a boutique lake-edge accommodation.

The Mud Hut, close to Kuirau Park, draws on the Rotorua's cultural and geothermal aspects.

A-Kahu House at Kawaha Point on the edge of lake Rotorua is a private, boutique environment from which to explore Rotorua and learn about Te Arawa Maori people and culture.

Mr O'Connor said: "Rotorua is at the centre of some major tourism development. It is great to see serious investment in tourism infrastructure in one of New Zealand's premier tourism regions."

Mr Samuels said: "Maori tourism is continually being strengthened by ever-growing quality experiences offered by innovative, savvy businesspeople. No longer should Maori tourism be perceived as solely a drawcard for international visitors. I know many New Zealanders would love to enjoy the many exciting cultural experiences on offer."

The ministers will also visit the new Rotorua Events Centre, the venue for this year's Trenz tourism trade conference, and will meet with the board of Te Puia.
