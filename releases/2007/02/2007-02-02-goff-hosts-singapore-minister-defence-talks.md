New Zealand Defence Minister Phil Goff yesterday met with Dr Ng Eng Hen, Singapore's Minister for Labour and Second Minister for Defence, for talks on defence cooperation and regional security issues.

Dr Ng is in New Zealand to attend Exercise Thunder Warrior an annual artillery exercise held in Waiouru involving 470 Singapore Armed Forces personnel.

"Singapore is New Zealand's closest Asian defence partner", said Mr Goff.

"We have a long standing relationship which is today marked by increasing cooperation in training, defence exercises and security dialogue.

"Singapore worked closely with New Zealand in its first peacekeeping deployment in Timor Leste and we will be exploring future opportunities to cooperate in this area.

"Both countries have a strong interest in contributing to a stable and cooperative regional environment and international order.

"Increasingly this involves working together not only on conventional security threats but also other issues such as counter-terrorism, piracy, people smuggling and disaster relief.

"Exercise Thunder Warrior marks the tenth anniversary of New Zealand hosting Singapore at Waiouru for artillery exercises. It reflects the close and substantial relationship between out two countries, not only in defence but also in terms of our wider relationship", Mr Goff said.
