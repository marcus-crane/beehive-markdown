Well over a thousand extra Aucklanders will get their [elective surgery](http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/) treatment by 30 June.

About 765 people in Waitemata and another 640 in Counties Manukau will benefit from the increased elective funding announced by Health Minister Pete Hodgson late last year.

The $200 million funding boost is expected to increase elective treatment capacity nationally by around 10,000 people each year over the next four years.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson says the new money - Waitemata District Health Board will receive an extra $3.21 million and Counties Manukau, $2.975 million – will be used to fund a range of elective procedures in the first half of the year.

At **Waitemata**, 223 patients will get the general surgery they need, including people waiting for gall bladder removal, varicose vein surgery and skin lesion removal. About 35 patients will receive foot and ankle surgery, 250 will have a colonoscopy and another 36 will get access to cardiothoracic surgery. Another 165 women will benefit from gynaecological procedures.

“It’s pleasing to see both DHBs targeting a range of areas from general surgery through to heart surgery,’’ says Pete Hodgson.

At **Counties Manukau**, about 640 extra people will get the procedures they need, including general surgery for hernias, haemorrhoids and gall bladder removal.

Both boards are running extra outpatient clinics to assess and prioritise patients for the extra procedures and some surgery will be contracted to the private sector.

Pete Hodgson says there has been a lot of publicity about the fact people have been removed fromthe [booking system](http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/media-briefings.html) after boards over-promised on what they could deliver.

He says district health boards have been working hard to improve their booking systems to ensure they meet Ministry guidelines.

"People need to be treated fairly and honestly by the public system. The booking system is about clarity, timeliness and fairness. People need to know whether they will get to see a specialist within six months and whether they will get their operation. Not everyone will, and boards need to be up front about that,'' Pete Hodgson says.

To qualify for the extra money boards must meet the Ministry of Health's [guidelines for fair and effective booking systems](http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/guidelineinfo.html).

So far 19 out of 21 boards have met the guidelines and most others are close to being compliant. The Ministry is working closely with these boards to ensure their patients can benefit from the extra money.
