Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, is today urging community organisations wanting skilled support to get their applications in to the Community Internship Programme (CIP) now.

The Community Internship Programme provides grants for experienced people to work with community organisations, with a focus on building capacity.

The closing date for applications is Friday, 23 March 2007.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said the programme benefits both the community organisations and the interns who share their knowledge, skills and experience.

“These internships are a fantastic opportunity to strengthen relationships between the private, public, community and voluntary sectors by fostering co-operation and partnership,” said Laban.

Internship grants of $33,499, each the equivalent of six months full time employment, are available to approved organisations.

Administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, the programme aims to benefit community organisations by importing new, and otherwise inaccessible, skills and knowledge to a host organisation, leaving it stronger and more effective.

"Interns who participate in the programme broaden their experience, gain a renewed energy and a community perspective, which also benefits their home organisations.

"The Labour-led government supports a strong, independent and sustainable community sector.

"The Community Internship Programme is key to strengthening cross-sector relationships. These relationships help build social capital - the glue that holds communities together," Laban said.
