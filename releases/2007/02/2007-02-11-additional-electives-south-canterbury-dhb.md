Nearly 200 South Canterbury people will benefit from the area’s share of the extra $200 million announced for more elective procedures by Health Minister Pete Hodgson last year.

According to the South Canterbury District Heath Board 42 patients have already had their surgery at Timaru Hospital and by mid-year an estimated 195 people will have had surgery as a result of the new money.

"I am delighted that we are offering people more services with the additional money. Over the next month or so I expect most District Health Boards will announce their plans for the extra electives money,’’ Pete Hodgson says.

Among the procedures being performed in South Canterbury are ear, nose and throat operations such as the removal of tonsils and adenoids, non-joint replacement orthopaedic and dental procedures. Additional surgery for eye conditions and some gynaecological procedures is also planned.

Nationally an extra 10,000 people each year over the next four years will benefit from the extra money - South Canterbury DHB is receiving a total of $447,000 for the additional surgery this financial year.

To qualify for the extra money district health boards must meet the Ministry of Health's guidelines for fair and effective booking systems. So far 17 out of 21 DHBs have met the guidelines and most others are close to being compliant. The Ministry is working closely with these DHBs to ensure their patients can benefit from the extra money.

The South Canterbury proposal started at the end of last year and a number of proposals from other DHBs are starting or due to start soon. Further updates will be made shortly.
