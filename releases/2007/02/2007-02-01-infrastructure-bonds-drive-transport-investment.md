The government will shortly issue the first tranche of Infrastructure Bonds that will be used to help finance a multi-billion investment in land transport, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Treasury's [Debt Management Office](http://www.nzdmo.govt.nz/media/01feb07.asp) will hold a $200 million bond tender on 15 February, of which $50 million of the December 2017 maturity will be designated Infrastructure Bonds.

"The funds will be tagged for transport, helping finance the biggest road building programme this country has seen," said Dr Cullen.

"We are investing $13.4 billion over the next five years, $300 million more than we will receive by way of petrol excise duties, road user charges and motor vehicle registration fees.

"This underlines our commitment to build a world class transport network as a key part of the Labour-led government's strategy to transform this economy."

As announced in Budget 2006, the government will make up to $1 billion in Infrastructure Bonds available over the next five years, of which $425 million is already committed between 2006/07 and 2010/11.

"The $425 million will be used to accelerate key State Highway projects including the Manukau Harbour Crossing, Kopu Bridge Replacement, four laning of Longswamp to Rangiriri in the Waikato, the Christchurch Southern Motorway, and the investigation and design of Transmission Gully," said Dr Cullen.

From the bond investors' perspective, Infrastructure Bonds are identical to other government bonds.

But from the public's perspective, Infrastructure Bonds are specifically linked to long-term investment in roading, to make the link clearer between revenue and investment.

"Issuing Infrastructure Bonds allows us to accelerate our efforts to make vital transport improvements for the long-term benefit of New Zealand," Dr Cullen concluded.
