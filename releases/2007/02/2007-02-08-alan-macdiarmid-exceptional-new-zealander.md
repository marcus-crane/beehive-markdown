Professor Alan MacDiarmid was an outstanding scientist and an exceptional New Zealander, Research Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"Through his long and distinguished career, Professor MacDiarmid made an outstanding contribution to chemistry and the New Zealand science community," Steve Maharey said.

"Professor MacDiarmid and his research team were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 for the discovery and development of conductive polymers, or plastics than conduct electricity. In 2001 he was appointed a member of the Order of New Zealand, the highest honour of our Country. The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Victoria University is named after him.

"Professor MacDiarmid was born in Masterton in 1927. He gained his MSc in chemistry at Victoria University and completed PhDs at the University of Wisconsin and Cambridge University. He joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in 1955, and held the position of Blanchard Professor of Chemistry from 1988 until his death.

“Professor MacDiarmid was only the second ever New Zealand born and educated Nobel Prize winner. He was a pioneer of the information age.

"Professor MacDiarmid retained links with New Zealand throughout his career and will be remembered for his contribution of service to our country, and his outstanding scientific achievements."

Steve Maharey expressed his condolences to Professor MacDiarmid’s wife and family.
