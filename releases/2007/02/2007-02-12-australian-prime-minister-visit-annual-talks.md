Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Australian Prime Minister John Howard will visit New Zealand on 15 and 16 February.

“Mr Howard will visit for the formal bilateral meeting held annually between New Zealand's and Australia's Prime Ministers,” Helen Clark said.

“The relationship between New Zealand and Australia is as close a relationship as can be found anywhere in the world between countries. It is underpinned by common values, a shared history, and extensive cross-Tasman family links.”

“This annual meeting gives the Trans Tasman Prime Ministers the chance to review a number of important bilateral, regional, and international issues, and to give impetus to the huge range of other official contacts and work programmes which are ongoing between our two countries.”

“Our agenda will focus on the ever-closer economic partnership between New Zealand and Australia, our commitment to peace and stability in the Pacific, and other foreign and trade policy issues”.

“During Mr Howard’s visit, we will attend the final session of a meeting of trans-Tasman public sector chief executives, and re-open the recently refurbished Australian High Commission”, Helen Clark said.

While in Wellington Mr Howard will also meet senior New Zealand Ministers, and the two Prime Ministers will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial.
