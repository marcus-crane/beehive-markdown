Auckland Issues & Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard has warmly welcomed  
Auckland's first sustainable transport plan.

The plan, [released](http://www.arta.co.nz/xxarta/news/media_releasexx.cfm?entryID=C7B36548-BCD4-1A24-9DFD-F97A94096FEB) by the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) today, aims to reduce car journeys during morning peak traffic and to increase Aucklanders aware of the public transport choices available to them.

"I welcome the responsible approach and leadership being demonstrated to make sustainability part of the New Zealand way", says Judith Tizard.

"As the Prime Minister said in her [Statement to Parliament](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28357) this week, 'New Zealand's future is dependent on long term sustainable strategies for our economy, society, environment, culture and way of life'."

Helen Clark went on to say that without a commitment to greater sustainability in our resource use and way of life, we risk not only damaging our own environment, but also exposing our economy to significant risk.

"This government has been working to reduce transport gas emissions and also harmful vehicle emissions through campaigns such as ['Choke the Smoke'](http://www.transport.govt.nz/choke-the-smoke-index/). Currently it's estimated that 250 Aucklanders die each year from the impact of harmful emissions," Judith Tizard said.

"We have invested heavily in Auckland's public transport infrastructure so Aucklanders now have public transport choices.

"Sustainability inevitably comes down to the individual choices we make each day – what type of car we drive, whether we drive to the dairy or walk, whether the kids use the [Walking School Bus](http://www.roadsafeauckland.org.nz/Schools/index.cfm?id=1040), or we take public transport to get to work.

"I encourage Aucklanders to make responsible and sustainable choices."
