The Crown has lodged an appeal in the High Court in the case of a Romanian family who falsely represented the health status of a child to gain entry to New Zealand, says Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Mr Cunliffe says the decision of the Deportation Review Tribunal to allow the Vilceanu family to stay in New Zealand raises serious immigration and legal issues.

"As the matter is now sub judice, I can make no further comment," said Mr Cunliffe.
