Anne Tolley and the National Party should check its facts before issuing lazy and incorrect releases about Child, Youth and Family Services, says CYFS Minister Ruth Dyson.

"National MP Anne Tolley's release and attempt to table a report in the House today demonstrates that once again she either too lazy to read the information given to her or she is incapable of understanding it," says Ms Dyson.

"Had she read any number of key publicly available documents, she would know $17 million of Family Wellbeing Services funding was transferred to the Ministry of Social Development, and not cut as she continues to incorrectly assert."

"The details of the transfer of funding is available in three documents – in the [Non-Departmental Output Expense Report of CYF 2005/06](http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/publications/msd/2005-2006-ndoc-vote-sd.pdf) pages 1, 2 and 6; in the Budget Statement 2005, page 145 and in the Budget Statement 2006, pages 108 and 113."

"Child Youth and Family Services are having a number of successes such as reducing the number of unallocated cases from 3000 in October 2004 to 435 in October 2006, all during a period of rising notifications.

"The National Party and Anne Tolley should be acknowledging this significant achievement by our frontline social workers, instead of constantly attacking them and putting out incorrect and misleading press releases."
