Government Buy Kiwi Made spokesperson, Sue Bradford, expressed cautious optimism at the latest Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) figures released by Business NZ today.

The figures show a PMI for January 2007 of 56.0, up 1.7 points from December and 7.4 points from January 2006.

“The closure of some Feltex plants last year and the announced closure of companies such as Blunstone Shoes, Bright Wood (now partial) and the Christchurch Tip Top factory this year have given me cause for concern.

“However, I am pleased to see that expansion of other manufacturing companies have so far more than compensated for these closures. A strong manufacturing sector is essential for the economic and social wellbeing of this country,” Ms Bradford says.

“It ensures high levels of employment and helps address the balance of payments deficit.

“The manufacturing sector will also benefit from the Government/Green Party Buy Kiwi Made campaign which will be very visible from the second half of this year when the media marketing part of the campaign kicks in.

“There will also be a much more proactive Government Procurement strategy for locally-made and sustainable goods and services as part of the Government's sustainability strategy detailed in the Prime Minister's Statement to Parliament this week.

“In addition applications for the contestable Buy Kiwi Made Regional and Sector Initiatives Fund close in a couple of weeks on 2 March 2007. I am confident that this fund will also produce some creative projects promoting New Zealand manufactured goods,” she says.
