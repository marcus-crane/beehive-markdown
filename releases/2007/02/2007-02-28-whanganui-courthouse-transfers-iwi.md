The final step in the transfer of the Whanganui Courthouse site to local Mâori ownership was taken today with the signing of an agreement between the Crown and Whanganui Iwi.

Minister of Mâori Affairs Parekura Horomia signed the Deed of On-account settlement which provides for the Courthouse to be vested in the Pâkaitore Trust on behalf of the Whanganui Iwi.

The Courthouse transfer ceremony took place amongst Pâkaitore Day celebrations.

“Today's signing ends nearly five years of negotiation for the transfer of the Courthouse," Parekura Horomia said. "It is a fine testament to the persistence and fortitude of the Crown and Whanganui Iwi negotiators and I thank them for their hard work and commitment."

The Pâkaitore Trust will lease the Courthouse site to the Ministry of Justice for an annual rental fee.  
On-account settlements do not settle all the historical Treaty claims of an iwi, and instead are taken into account when a final settlement is reached with the Crown. In this case, the value of the Whanganui Courthouse will be part of the comprehensive settlement negotiated between the Crown and Whanganui Iwi in the future.
