Responding to claims at the weekend by the Kyoto Forest Owners Association that the Prime Minister is at odds with his office, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton says "This is utter nonsense, and the two newspaper articles cited prove this."

"The Prime Minister’s statement to the Sunday Star Times that there was never "any promise to industry that the credits would be devolved" is entirely consistent with my office’s comment to the Gisborne Herald.

"[The paper quoted my spokesperson](http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article.asp?aid=8358&iid=649&sud=27) as saying,

> *"No decision was ever made that carbon credits would be devolved to forest owners… prior to Labour coming to government, the then minister for the environment, Simon Upton, was telling people that it was his preference that carbon credits would be devolved to forest owners — but it was never government policy."*

“It is simply false to suggest that this statement amounts to an admission that the government promised foresters carbon credits.

"One should always be cautious about people trying to advance their personal financial interests by such tactics as rewriting history, or misquoting statements.

"The campaign by Mr Dickie of the Kyoto Forest Owners Association has no credibility and warrants that caution,” Jim Anderton said.
