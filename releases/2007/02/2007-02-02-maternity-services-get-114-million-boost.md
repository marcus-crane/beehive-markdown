Minister of Health Pete Hodgson has announced an additional $11.4 million (GST ex) for primary maternity services from 1 July 2007, at a meeting with key maternity stakeholders in Wellington yesterday.

The funding will be allocated through the Section 88 Maternity Notice, which is the contract through which the Government pays for primary maternity services.  
Pete Hodgson told participants that the $11.4 million funding, on top of the earlier funding injections, would promote the recruitment and retention of Lead Maternity Carers (LMCs).

In his announcement, Pete Hodgson acknowledged the quality of maternity services. He stated the Government's ongoing support of the LMC model and the need for nationally consistent service provision. However he called on all primary providers to continue to develop integration between services and professional groups so as to maximise services to women.

"To provide even better services for pregnant women, I am looking to you, the providers of services, to improve your connections with each other and with the different levels of maternity care," Pete Hodgson says.

"The New Zealand College of Midwives, New Zealand Medical Association, DHBs and the Ministry all hold the key to ensuring that there is a close alignment of maternity and other primary health care services", he said.

"I acknowledge concerns have been raised in relation to midwifery workforce shortages, particularly in rural areas, as well as large centres like Auckland and Wellington," Pete Hodgson says.

He reminded participants that as well as the additional funding, work has been underway for some time to address the workforce issues. This month, a pilot midwifery entry to practice programme has been rolled out. Over the next two years, a total of $4.7 million has been allocated to pilot a programme aimed at supporting new graduate midwives. In their first year of practice new midwives will be mentored to help increase their confidence as new practitioners, which is expected to aid the recruitment and retention of new graduate midwives.

"The Ministry of Health's Workforce Team within the Sector Policy Directorate in discussion with DHBs will be reporting to me by the end of this month on options for increasing the midwifery workforce. Midwives in some regions are coming under increasing pressure but work is underway to ensure we can meet future demand through a sustainable supply of competent, confident midwives", says Pete Hodgson.

**Background**  
In 2005, a review of the Section 88 Maternity Notice began. In December 2005, the Government injected $18.4 million into primary maternity services across the country. Late in 2006, the Government announced a $2 million fund for rural midwives, available for use this month. All figures are GST exclusive.
