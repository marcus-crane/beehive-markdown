Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen today accused National Leader John Key of "rank hypocrisy" over his attitude to Brian Connell.

"Mr Key is all huffy and puffy about discipline as far as Mr Connell goes," said Dr Cullen.

"But all Mr Connell did was to do publicly what Mr Key was very busy doing privately: undermining Don Brash's position as National leader.

"Almost everywhere Mr Key went during 2006 he spread the message privately that he was going to replace Don Brash who could not last as National leader.

"We had numerous reports from business people of Mr Key's comments at private meetings undermining Dr Brash.

"Mr Connell's crime was to be open and honest and stab Dr Brash in the front. Obviously he should have just stabbed him in the back like Mr Key and all would have been well," said Dr Cullen.
