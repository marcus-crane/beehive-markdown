Transport Minister Annette King and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today said that they would not be asking Transit to revisit its decision not to fly the "tino rangatiratanga flag" on Auckland Harbour Bridge on Waitangi Day this year.

The ministers said that they understood that Transit's policy, last reviewed in 2003, was only to fly the flags of nation states, in normal circumstances.

"It is not reasonable to expect this policy to be changed at short notice on the eve of Waitangi Day. The government is prepared to consider whether Transit's policy should be broadened in future and on what basis.

"A one-off change now, however, without thinking through implications for other requests which might come, would not be sensible.

"For now, it is important to focus on what unites us on Waitangi Day and not to be distracted by a debate on what flags we fly on the Auckland Harbour Bridge," Annette King and Parekura Horomia said.
