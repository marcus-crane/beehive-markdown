Nick Smith is wrong, says Energy Minister David Parker.

"The Prime Minister did not open a power station in Palmerston North today, as Dr Smith claims."

"In fact she [opened](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28450) a recycling centre, powered by a co-generation plant that [I opened last year](http://www.pncc.govt.nz/City/News/CivicNews.htm?sec=Civic%20News&ID=5581)."

"This is an innovative and excellent use of waste gas from the former landfill, but no-one expects it to be a major contributor to the national grid."

"This is just another case of Nick Smith wilfully misrepresenting issues on energy and the environment, in an attempt to hide the fact that the National Party has nothing better to offer."
