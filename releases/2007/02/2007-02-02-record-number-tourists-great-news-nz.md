Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said he was delighted with statistics out today showing more people visited New Zealand last year than ever before.

A growth rate of 1.6% in 2006 pushed international arrivals up to 2,421,561 for the year, Statistics New Zealand figures show.

“It's great news for New Zealand," Mr O'Connor said.

"The government and the tourism industry are in the process of updating our highly successful tourism strategy, to adapt to a changing world market, and such a strong overall result will act as a real confidence booster."

Mr O’Connor said he looked forward to the good results continuing.

“Anecdotal evidence and conversations I’ve been having with the industry suggest that summer business is solid despite some of the poor weather we’ve been having. Forward bookings are also looking positive."

He praised those in the industry who were busily improving the quality of their businesses, which he said was essential for New Zealand to remain a premium destination.
