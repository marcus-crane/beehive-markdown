National leader John Key and finance spokesman Bill English are clearly at odds over the concept of a mortgage levy, which could potentially ease pressure on exporters, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"Mr English's swift dismissal of the option shows he is not ready for  
serious economic debate," said Dr Cullen

"His comments also damage the carefully orchestrated appearance  
of unity in National's new leadership team.

"Mr English is calling for tighter fiscal policy to combat inflation while  
Mr Key is happy to embrace large-scale tax cuts without accompanying spending  
cuts.

"However, Mr Key is at least open to new approaches to monetary policy.

"I can now reveal that Mr Key and Mr English were invited to a meeting in my  
office before Christmas to discuss alternatives to existing monetary policy instruments to tackle inflation.

"Both Mr Key and myself appreciated the importance of a bi-partisan  
approach.

"At that meeting Mr Key took a balanced and serious approach. Mr English though largely remained silent and his body language spoke volumes about his willingness to embrace new measures that may have a chance to help the New Zealand economy.

"I stress the concept of a mortgage levy is at a very preliminary stage.

"However, the attitude of Mr English is a disappointing start to his tenure as finance spokesman and I am sure many exporters would agree," Dr Cullen concluded.
