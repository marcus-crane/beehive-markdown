Some 10,000 caregivers will receive additional payments, Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope and Ruth Dyson, Associate Minister for Social Development (CYF) announced today.

All caregivers who receive an Unsupported Child’s Benefit, Orphan’s Benefit or Foster Care Allowance will receive an increase in their weekly payments from 1 April 2007.

“The increase recognises the valuable contribution caregivers make to New Zealand’s children, particularly those children who are unable to be cared for by their parents,” Ruth Dyson said at the opening of the International Foster Care Organisation conference today.

“Frequently, grandparents or other extended family members have to step in and provide care,” said Ms Dyson.

All recipients of Unsupported Child’s Benefit, Orphan’s Benefit and the Foster Care Allowance will receive an additional $10 per week, per child, in line with the increases to Family Support payments.

“The changes will provide additional financial assistance to approximately 7,460 caregivers and 3,000 foster parents, who care for a combined total of approximately 15,000 children, " said Mr Benson-Pope.

In addition, people receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit and Orphan’s Benefit (who are not receiving a Care Supplement) will also receive a further $10 per week as a contribution toward care costs. The increases take the rates of payment of Unsupported Child’s Benefit and Orphan’s Benefit to between $117 per week and $153 per week per child.

“The increased payments represent a first step toward providing enhanced support for family caregivers, particularly grandparents. It recognises both the value to children who cannot be looked after by their parents, as well as the financial constraints often faced by caregivers,” said Mr Benson-Pope.

“Further policy work is underway on the provision support for family caregivers and will examine issues around care for extended family members.”
