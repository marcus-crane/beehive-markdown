New Zealand will give Fiji Red Cross $35,000 to assist relief efforts following major flooding in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand has taken a strong stand against Commodore Bainimarama and other coup perpetrators, but this will not stop us helping ordinary Fijians in a time of need,” Mr Peters said.

“Several hundred people have been evacuated because of the floods, and many of them are from squatter settlements. These people are poor and vulnerable and need immediate assistance in the form of temporary shelter, bedding and other relief items.

“New Zealand's assistance will help Fiji Red Cross replenish emergency supplies, which are now seriously depleted after weeks of flooding."

NZAID, the government's aid and development agency, will channel the money through New Zealand Red Cross, which has longstanding links with its sister organisations throughout the Pacific.
