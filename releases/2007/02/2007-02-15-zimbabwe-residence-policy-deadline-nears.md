Zimbabweans eligible for residence under a special policy are being encouraged to come forward and apply before time runs out on 28 February, say Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Immigration Minister David Cunliffe.

Almost 700 people who fled Zimbabwe for the safety of New Zealand have already been made residents since the government introduced a special policy for them in 2005.

“But an estimated 130 people are yet to apply and after 28 February they will no longer have the opportunity,” Mr Hodgson says.

The Special Residence for Zimbabweans Policy (SRZP) was introduced in 2005 as a humanitarian response to the upheaval in Zimbabwe.

An exception to policy also made by the government [last year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F26934) means Zimbabweans eligible under this policy do not have to meet normal heath standards. This includes applicants with HIV/AIDS.

"All applications from HIV-positive Zimbabweans decided to date have resulted in residence being granted," Mr Hodgson said.

"Public health will also be improved if those who might be HIV-positive are tested to determine their status. That is a key feature of this special policy."

Mr Cunliffe emphasised there was a time limit.

"We have heard that a number of eligible people are waiting to get all their documents together before applying. I strongly urge them to contact the Department of Labour now and submit the appropriate form, even if they have to get all of the documents in later.

"Since the health waiver policy was announced in August, the department has been working closely with the New Zealand Zimbabwean community to ensure everyone understands the opportunity presented by the policy and the time limits around it. This has included meetings around the country, working with Zimbabwean community leaders and attempts to directly contact those eligible.

“Over the next week, department staff will be again contacting people individually to remind them about the deadline. They can also contact the department by phone, email or post,” Mr Cunliffe said.
