National's Kate Wilkinson has chosen to disregard the facts in her latest statement on legal aid, Justice Minister Mark Burton said.

"Kate Wilkinson claimed today that the number of family aid lawyers plummeted from 2,012 to 1,017 between 2005 and 2006. The correct 2006 figure is 1,954. Similarly, she claimed that the number of criminal legal aid lawyers fell from 1,084 to 846. Again she is incorrect, the actual number for 2006 is 1,076.

"She also conveniently missed out the fact that the total number of listed legal aid providers actually increased from 2908 in 2005 to 2963 last year.

"Unlike National this government takes the issue of legal aid seriously. Changes to Legal Aid legislation that come into effect on 1 March mean the number of New Zealanders eligible for legal aid will increase from 765,000 to an estimated 1.2 million people.

"Legal aid eligibility thresholds had not been reviewed for two decades. There was enough evidence to suggest that many New Zealanders couldn't pay a lawyer's fees and were ineligible to receive legal aid.

"It was our first priority to ensure that low and modest income New Zealanders have access to justice, which is why the government has changed eligibility thresholds.

"Though it is important that the review of remuneration rates takes into account the effects of the 1 March changes, the Agency has already started scoping the methodology for the review and begun consultation with the Law Society."

Legal aid rates were last reviewed in 1999 under the then National Government, which reduced the rates to 1996 levels.

"The government believes that the review of remuneration rates for legal aid providers is important and is introducing a process to ensure rates are more systematically reviewed in the future, rather than in an ad hoc way as has been the case in the past."

The current guideline hourly rates paid for legal aid work range between $95 and $165 per hour depending on the experience of lawyer and the type of case. In addition certain office expenses are remunerated separately.
