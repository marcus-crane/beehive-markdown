A range of important initiatives have been taken to ensure Pasifika children have the opportunity to learn the language of their forebears, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Phil Goff said today.

"The Race Relations Commissioner is right to express concern that many young New Zealanders of Pacific origin are not maintaining their ability to speak the language of their parents.

"This is probably true of most migrant groups to New Zealand but in the case of small populations such as Niue, Tokelau and the Cook Islands this has implications for future preservation of their languages.

"The Mind Your Language project launched by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs (MPIA) in 2005 is aimed at preserving the three most at risk Pacific languages in New Zealand: Niuean, Cook Island Maori and Tokelauan.

"In 2005 a Vagahau Niue resource was launched to help teach the basics of the Niuean language to Niueans. The 2006 budget allocated $600,000 to the production of similar resources for the teaching of Cook Island Maori and Tokelauan.

"These resources are being developed and delivered during 2007 and 2008 with the development of an interactive language website and radio programme for the Niue Language.

"The Tokelau community has established a national Tokelau Advisory group to monitor the implementation of Tokelau teaching and learning. The Cook Islands community are currently closely working with the MPIA on developing the most appropriate mix of resources for their community.

"In addition to the MPIA led initiatives at schools, in 2006, there were 441 early childhood centres where a Pasifika language was used in teaching. In 2006 there were 2010 enrolments in centres where Cook Island Maori was used, 970 in centres where Niuean was used and 343 where Tokelauan was used.

"While we can provide the opportunity and the support for the languages, the challenge lies in helping the families to motivate their children to retain their Pasifika language skills as well as being fluent in English", said Mr Goff.
