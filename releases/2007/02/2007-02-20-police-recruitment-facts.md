Since 2002, only two police recruits have graduated from the Royal New Zealand Police College as constables with restrictions on their duties, says Police Minister Annette King. Such records have only been kept since 2002.

"One of these constables graduated in 2006, and one earlier this year. Both required additional driving training following graduation, and graduated with restrictions on their driving duties. Both are receiving ongoing driving training,” she says.

"The two are the only cases of constables graduating while on restricted duties out of 2345 people who have started training since 2002."

Ms King says that she is also advised that over the past five years there have been another six cases of members who have NOT graduated during their wing, but who have received continued training to meet the high standards required at the Royal NZ Police College.

“Two of these recruits are still to graduate. One is receiving extra driving training, and is on limited operational duties. The other person yet to graduate is still undergoing intensive language training. He is restricted to observing and participating in non-urgent call taking.

“The other four subsequently graduated after returning to the college and meeting the required performance standards. I am advised they are now doing an excellent job liaising with our ethnic communities.”
