*Speech notes for an address at the AMN-3 Conference, Ilott Theatre, Wellingon Town Hall*

Thank you Kate, and thanks also to the MacDiarmid Institute, as host of this third Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology conference, for giving me this opportunity to speak. Welcome to my fellow speakers here on the stage for this opening session of the conference – the Mayor of Wellington, Kerry Prendergast and Professor Paul Callaghan. It is a great privilege to be able to address such a distinguished group of people, including our two Nobel Laureates, Professor Stephen Chu and Professor Sir Harry Kroto. I’d also like to acknowledge the other plenary speaker, Sir John Pendry from Imperial College in London.

Welcome to our other overseas visitors (and I know that we have a good representation from Australia, Europe, North America and Asia), including the members of the MacDiarmid International Advisory Board. And of course, a big welcome to our scientists from New Zealand. Looking at the programme for AMN-3, I can see you are in for a stimulating event, maintaining the high standard that’s been set by the two previous AMN conferences.

New Zealand’s research strengths are often viewed as being biological. But many of our most famous scientists were or are physicists or chemists - Sir Ernest Rutherford, Maurice Wilkins, Beatrice Tinsley, and, of course, Alan MacDiarmid. Given the role the chemical and physical sciences and engineering are playing in diversifying New Zealand’s industrial base, I’m particularly pleased to see such an impressive gathering of researchers here at this conference. Your presence is an acknowledgement, I believe, of the high standard of the work being carried out by New Zealand’s chemists, physicists and engineers in the field of advanced materials and nanotechnology.

**The role of AMN-3**  
Having so many notable people from the advanced materials and nanotechnology research world coming to New Zealand is invaluable. We in government are well aware of the importance of ensuring our local scientists are linked in to the global research scene. A conference like this – that brings together so many distinguished people to share latest developments – is important in achieving this.

It’s good to have so many young New Zealand scientists in the audience, because being able to rub shoulders with the worlds leading scientists must be inspirational. I hope being able to see the likes of Professors Sir Harry Kroto and Steven Chu in the flesh makes you even more determined to do work as exciting as Sir Harry’s co-discovery of ”Buckyballs”, a new form of carbon, or Professor Chu’s research on trapping atoms with laser light.

You are our future science leaders (and I hope that, among them, might be some of the Nobel Laureates of the future). This is a great opportunity to be linked into the global research community in this field, to be exposed to new ideas as well as established expertise, and to make connections that will be of huge benefit to New Zealand science, not only now, but also into the future.

For an example of the advantages of making connections, this time within New Zealand, we need look no further than the MacDiarmid Institute. It was established in 2002 as one of the Centres of Research Excellence was an initiative to move from a “silo” approach to research to one of collaboration. The MacDiarmid Institute is a virtual institute that is focussed on research excellence in physics, chemistry and engineering. It has a very strong emphasis on collaboration and mentoring and shows how collaborations between universities and our other research institutes can work.

By bringing together the expertise in Victoria and Canterbury Universities with the research capability of Industrial Research Limited we have been able to build an important base for nanoscience and the development of advanced materials that has the potential to provide a real boost to the New Zealand economy. The Institute also draws on the talent of staff at Massey and Otago Universities and Geological and Nuclear Sciences, as well as other universities and research organisations.

We’re also seeing interesting materials and nanotechnology research and development coming out of the University of Auckland’s School of Engineering and Department of Chemistry and I hope we will see them linking in more with the MacDiarmid Institute. New Zealand is small and needs to make the most of our expertise through collaboration.

**Success Stories**  
The calibre of the participants in AMN-3 shows how well New Zealand research in these areas is regarded internationally.

The contribution by Paul Callaghan to science in New Zealand was recognised last year by the government when it made him a Principal Companion to New Zealand Order of Merit – one of our highest honours. This followed on from his being awarded the prestigious AMPERE Prize in 2004.

Research by Professor Richard Blaikie, from the University of Canterbury, on manipulating light was recognised by the magazine New Scientist (5 June 2005) as a key development in their timeline of “A Brief History of Negative Refraction”, along with 10 other scientists including Descartes, Snell, and James Clerk Maxwell.

Two students from the MacDiarmid Institute – James Muys and David Melville – were finalists in the 2005 International Nanochallenge for their technique of producing high-resolution images of cells. A spin-out company, Bioimprint, was formed on the basis of their research.

The MacDiarmid Institute and its researchers are highly regarded internationally and have attracted students and post-doctoral researchers from other countries. In the past many of our best and brightest went elsewhere to do good science. Now we are retaining and attracting some of the worlds best and brightest.

Examples are Pablo Etchegoin, who chose to come here from Imperial College, London, and is continuing his world leading research in tracking individual molecules in cells. And Kate Washburn came here to do her PhD from MIT – that’s the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, not our local Manukau “cousin”.

**From the Lab to the Outside World**  
It’s not all about just doing the science. MacDiarmid Institute researchers have also been involved in other successful activities. The successful “Are Angels OK?” project – where some of New Zealand’s leading creative writers and physicists got together to interpret physics for different audiences – illustrates how even what is perceived to be hard science can resonate across society.

The MacDiarmid Institute is also a sponsor of the Awhina Outreach programme, which is helping less advantaged students study science.

Some of our researchers are not only doing excellent research in their own right, but developing companies based on their science, or working closely with firms to translate the research into new products and processes.

One example is Nano Cluster Devices Ltd, New Zealand’s first nanotechnology company. It is commercialising University of Canterbury-based research on self-assembling nanowires, and high interest in their groundbreaking technology has lead to them being invited by the Japan External Trade Organisation to The International Nanotechnology Business Summit in Tokyo, the world’s biggest annual nanotechnology event. They are one of only 17 companies from around the world to get an invitation.

Another successful company is HTS-110. This was a spin-off from Industrial Research Ltd and built on work on high-temperature superconductivity. HTS-110 produces a wide range of high temperature conductivity products with applications in the science, medicine, transport, and energy sectors.

Magritek is developing nuclear magnetic resonance devices for a wide range of applications based on research undertaken by Paul Callaghan’s group.

Buckley Systems Ltd and Group3 Technology, developed from University of Auckland research, are supplying precision components, such as electromagnets and control systems, to research labs and companies worldwide.

The University of Auckland and Plastics New Zealand have, with the aid of Government funding, established the Centre for Plastics Innovation and Technology to help research organisations and the plastics industry to work together to develop innovate products and processes.

Around the world, a growing number of countries are investing large amounts of money in the emerging areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The MacDiarmid Institute has been very active in promoting the potential of nanotechnology for New Zealand.

The government has recognised that this area – where we have the potential to manipulate materials atom by atom, and create revolutionary new materials – is important to New Zealand. Both because we will be exposed to products derived from nanotechnology from other countries – such as new textiles, electronic products, medical treatments and environmental technologies, and because, like molecular biology, science at the nanoscale will become common in many other areas.

As with biotechnology, nanotechnology is raising widespread interest both for the opportunities it may lead to, and because of challenges applications of the technology may raise – how safe are some of the manufactured nanomaterials, what will be the effect of nano-based industrial processes on existing industries, how can communities have a voice in the types of technologies developed?

The government has, therefore, developed a New Zealand Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies Roadmap. And I am very pleased to launch it today.

This is not a roadmap setting out what technologies will or will not be important. Rather it sets directions for the research community so that we can build up critical mass in research capability. This is important so that we can not only maintain and grow our science capabilities at an international level, but also have the research and policy capability to determine what developments elsewhere are useful and appropriate for New Zealand to adopt and adapt. Nanoscale research and development is moving quickly and New Zealand needs to be well poised to take advantage of future developments (arising both in New Zealand and elsewhere) and to meet challenges associated with this suite of technologies.

Having a roadmap means we can ensure we will be in a good position to harness the nanotech applications (and there are potentially many) that will bring economic, environmental and social benefit New Zealand. The Roadmap identifies the need to bring a range of different disciplines together early in the research process.

Because some applications of nanotechnology may be revolutionary, it is vital that the research is informed of society’s expectations of technology early on, rather than when a lot of money and intellectual effort has been devoted to particular projects that may not welcomed by society. Social scientists have an important role to play in helping inform biophysical scientists of a broader social setting for their research, and the Roadmap signals this both to researchers and those who fund the research.

The Roadmap has also focussed policy makers and regulators attention on ensuring that our regulatory systems are well designed to take account of potential new challenges that nanomaterials may introduce. We want to ensure we have the world’s best systems to protect human and environmental health, while still allowing innovative R&D.

Nanotechnology is currently unfamiliar to many people, but it will challenge them. It is vital that the scientists take a leading role in discussions about this new technology. Not telling the public what it is, but listening to what the public has to say about it.

I encourage the New Zealand researchers in the audience to read the Roadmap and become engaged. The Ministry of Research, Science and Technology is running a symposium at this conference on Thursday that will further discuss some of the opportunities and challenges that nanotechnologies pose for New Zealand. This is a field that has the potential to provide major benefits for New Zealand, and is something we should be paying close attention to.

The AMN conferences are a real asset to New Zealand’s science community and it is encouraging to see them growing in popularity. I am especially pleased to see the conference organisers once again bringing the science to the public, through the public lecture being given by Sir Harry on Thursday evening. It is my hope that this conference will further strengthen New Zealand’s already impressive scientific expertise in the fields of nanotechnology and advanced materials.

I wish you all the best for a very successful third conference.
