The latest UNICEF report on child wellbeing is an important snapshot of young New Zealanders, and highlights many areas in which the government is actively working and making great progress, says Cabinet Minister, Steve Maharey.

"The UNICEF report paints a fair picture of how things were in the late 90s and early this decade. When these figures are compared to more up to date statistics, we can clearly see how this Government has improved the lot of our children.

"The information in the UNICEF report pre-dates significant progress that has been made through the [Working for Families package](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz), and improvements in the areas of health, education, employment, poverty, household crowding and safety."

"For example, by the time the government's Working for Families package is fully implemented, New Zealand will be ranked in the top four OECD countries on the relative poverty indicator. However, the UNICEF report draws on 2001 data, which ranks New Zealand 18th out of 24 OECD countries.

"Also, some important New Zealand data was not actually included in the UNICEF report. A Children's nutrition survey carried out in 2002 found that 84 per cent of 11 to 14 year olds ate breakfast, which would have put New Zealand within the top three in this report."

"Other data that wasn't included was the number of 15-19 year olds not in education, training or employment. The latest 2006 figures indicate only 6 per cent were not, which would have ranked New Zealand 9th out of 23 OECD countries."

Steve Maharey says the UNICEF report is a valuable tool to help focus our energies on what the government is now doing, but it draws on pre-2002 data, which highlights the legacy of poverty inherited from the National party of the nineties.

"We have since made huge inroads into key areas of child wellbeing, in terms of Working for Families, education and health, which will be included in future studies. I am confident the next UNICEF report card will reflect this."
