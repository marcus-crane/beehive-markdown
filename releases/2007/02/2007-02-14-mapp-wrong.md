Media statements released by National Defence spokesman Dr Wayne Mapp over the last three days are factually wrong, says Defence Minister Phil Goff.

"In a statement released on 12 February, Dr Mapp claimed that 'seven new ships are supposed to be delivered in the next two and a half years'. In fact all seven ships are on target to be delivered by the middle of next year, that is within the next eighteen months", Mr Goff said.

"Dr Mapp claims that delays in delivering ships 'are likely to mean an increased dollar tag'. In fact the total cost of the seven new ships which will be commissioned by next year will come within the $500 million budget.

"Sea trials are held for each vessel before delivery to determine what if any defects need to be remedied.

"The expense of any remedial work required prior to ship delivery is met by the manufacturer, under contract, not the purchaser. There will be no additional cost to New Zealand.

"In his statement of February 14, Dr Mapp refers to cracks in the bow door of the Canterbury, as there is no bow door Dr Mapp's claims are clearly wrong, he also refers to an accident involving the vessel. The vessel has not been involved in any accident. A problem relating to the rudder function disclosed in the sea trial is being repaired at the expense of the contractor involved.

"Dr Mapp repeats claims about budget blow outs and New Zealand taxpayers picking up the tab in todays press statement. He is simply repeating what he knows to be untrue and damages his own credibility", Mr Goff said.
