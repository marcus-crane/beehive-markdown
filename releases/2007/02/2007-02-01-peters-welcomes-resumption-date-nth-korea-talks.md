Foreign Minister Winston Peters is welcoming news that the Six Party Talks on North Korea will resume on 8 February.

“The Six Party Talks remain the key vehicle to make progress towards finding a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue," Mr Peters said.

"New Zealand continues to urge North Korea to participate in the talks in good faith and with an appropriate negotiating mandate.

“Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the security of the region, and is inconsistent with the behaviour expected of a state seeking security and other guarantees from the international community.

"New Zealand will continue to support efforts to bring peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula and prosperity to the North Korean people. However, the development of our ties with Pyongyang remains inextricably linked to North Korea's genuine commitment to denuclearisation,” Mr Peters said.

New Zealand established diplomatic relations with North Korea in 2001, but the relationship remains limited to some government-level and private citizen contact.
