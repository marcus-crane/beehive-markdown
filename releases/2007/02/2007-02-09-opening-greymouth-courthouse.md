Courts Minister Rick Barker officially opened the new Greymouth Courthouse today, saying it would meet the region’s needs now and in the future.

“The old Greymouth court was built to meet the needs of a bygone era. It had become too small to provide the functionality required of a modern day court, and lacked basic features such as jury assembly and waiting rooms,” said Rick Barker.

“This new court is more than three times larger than the old Guinness Street premises and has two large courtrooms, one of which is a jury court.

“Court users are now able to access a range of services when they come to the courthouse. There is dedicated space for Community Corrections Probation Service, lawyers, crown solicitors, Police, victim advisors, duty solicitors, and referees.

“The new court has video conferencing technology installed which will enable increased access to justice services and save travel time for court users.

"Today's opening forms part of what has become the largest court building programme in recent history. Since the Labour-led Government was elected six new courthouses have been completed and four more are currently being built. As well as this we have completed 27 major courthouse refurbishments, with nine more planned or underway.

"It is great to be here and see first hand the results of our approach", said Rick Barker.
