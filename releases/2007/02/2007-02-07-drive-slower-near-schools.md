Police and Transport Minister Annette King has backed a new road safety campaign that aims to reduce the special risks faced by New Zealand’s young and vulnerable children as they go to and from school.

Ms King and Transport Safety Minister [Harry Duynhoven](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F28301) visited Miramar Central School today at the start of the new school year to emphasise the Government’s support for the NZ Police campaign to get drivers to [slow down near schools](http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/media/2007/070126.html).

From today NZ Police will strictly enforce the speed limit within 250 metres of the boundaries of all schools and preschools. Drivers who [exceed the speed limit](http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/factsheets/33.html) by more than 4km/hr will be ticketed.

Ms King says the dangers to children from speeding drivers is illustrated by the fact that in the past five years more than 1200 child pedestrians have been killed or injured during school terms.

She welcomes the support of school principals for the campaign, and says that because children are small and often easily distracted and unpredictable, drivers have to be more than usually careful when driving near schools.

“The slower they drive, the more chance they have of reacting safely if something unexpected happens.”

Ms King says police enforcement of the speed limit will be on a risk basis.

"In general speed enforcement and camera deployment times will be between 7.30 am and 6 pm during the week when most children are arriving or leaving school, but enforcement is also likely occur at other high risk times when the school is being used for special events. Drivers have to stay aware at all times.”

The programme extends the ["Speed Kills Kids" campaign](http://www.police.govt.nz/service/road/speed-kills-kids.html) introduced last year, and it is supported by a national advertising campaign, she says.

### Questions and answers

From February 2007, Police will strictly enforce the speed limit within 250 metres on each side of a school’s boundaries. If you drive past a school at 55 km/h in a 50 km/h area, you will be ticketed.

**Why are Police bringing in these restrictions?**  
n the last five years over 1200 child pedestrians have been killed or injured during school terms. In the vicinity of schools, particularly during the high risk morning and afternoon periods, a significant risk is posed to school children by speeding drivers and it is considered that a lower enforcement tolerance by both speed cameras and staff is critical to reducing child pedestrian casualties.

**What are they actually going to do?**  
Strictly enforce a 4 km/hour tolerance within 250 metres on each side of school and preschool boundaries during high use times.

**When will it happen?**  
The new policy will be implemented on 7 February 2007 when the majority of schools, kindergartens, play centres and other organisations return for the start of the school year.

**Where exactly will these restrictions begin and end?**  
Within 250 metres on each side of school boundaries

**Will it apply to all schools?**  
Yes, and also preschools, kindergartens, Kohanaga Reo, play centres etc.

**What times will it apply?**  
The enforcement will be on a risk basis. This means that in general speed enforcement and speed camera deployment times will be between 7.30 am and 6 pm week days when the majority of children are arriving at or leaving school. However, it may also occur at other high risk times when the school is being used for events such as sports events, galas and other school-based activities.

**Why don't they just enforce the actual speed limit?**  
There can sometimes be small variations and fluctuations in the accuracy of the speedometers in some cars and the tolerance allows for this.

**Where will all these police come from?**  
Road policing staff rosters will be adjusted to include this programme but no extra staff will be deployed. Police Education Officers, who work with schools and other educational institutions, will also be on hand to assist.

**Will they be fixed cameras?**  
In some cases fixed cameras will be used but most will be mobile cameras.

**Who do we complain to if we see someone speeding near our school?**  
You should contact your local Road Policing Manager.

**Will there be any warning in signs or other material to let everyone know what's happening?**  
Land Transport NZ and Police have developed a national advertising campaign to support the programme. This includes television advertising featuring school principals, radio advertising, billboards, print advertisements in all national newspapers and information supplied to schools.

**How can I get this information?**  
NZ [Police](http://www.police.govt.nz/) and [LandTransport NZ](http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/road-user-safety/motorists/) websites will carry information about the programme.
