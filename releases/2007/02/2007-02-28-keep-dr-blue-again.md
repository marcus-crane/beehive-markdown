Jackie Blue needs to keep up on what really goes on in the health sector Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Over the last few months Dr Blue has been quizzing DHBs on how many women undergo mastectomies in an effort to understand national patterns or variance.

"While I applaud the sentiment behind her inquiry she is short on both method and conclusion. Researchers have been there with a little more precision earlier than Dr Blue.

It is usual for DHBs to treat patients from outside their area – or domicile. Making straight comparisons is a trap for the inexperienced.

"Yesterday she released a statement alerting the world that nationally the mastectomy rate was 50 per cent but there were marked variations between DHBs ranging from 28 per cent to 99 per cent. Today we find that upward figure for Mid Central DHB closer to 30 per cent.

"She seems unaware that there are variations in surgical services other than mastectomy.

"Last year we began a process of making sure data on intervention rates are as accurate as possible, itself a significant task, which will be completed in a few weeks.

"A hallmark of quality in a health system may be a reduction in variance but sloppy research is not the way to advance." Pete Hodgson said.
