Foreign Minister Winston Peters will host the latest round of six-monthly consultations with his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer in Wellington on Monday.

“There have been significant developments, especially in the Pacific, since our last meeting in Adelaide last July. Monday's meeting provides an opportunity to review what has happened in our immediate neighbourhood, and to exchange views on the way forward," Mr Peters said.

“The challenges faced by the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) are of great concern to New Zealand and Australia, as are the loss of constitutional democracy and human rights in Fiji in the wake of the coup.

"We are also conscious that the situation in Tonga is still fragile following November's riots, and we shall be looking to encourage the government there to regain momentum in the dialogue on political reform.”

Mr Peters said that while the Pacific would dominate discussions, he and Mr Downer would also take stock of bilateral relations, which were in excellent shape, and review developments in the Asia/Pacific region, and globally.

"The opportunity to have a regular exchange of views with Mr Downer is highly valuable. New Zealand and Australia worked closely in partnership across the range of foreign policy issues, and the six-monthly consultations offer an invaluable opportunity to consult and coordinate at the political level," Mr Peters said.
