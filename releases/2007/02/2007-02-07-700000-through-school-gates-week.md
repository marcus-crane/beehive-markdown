Education Minister Steve Maharey today released *Students at School in 2007*, an overview of school rolls, which shows 2007 will see fewer students enrolling in New Zealand schools compared to last year.

An estimated 700,000 students are expected to begin the school year on Wednesday, rising to 753,200 throughout the school year, about 3000 fewer than last year. Around 9,300 new entrants start on Wednesday, the first of 56,000 children who will start school this year, about 2,000 fewer than last year.

"I want to welcome all the new entrants and their families to our school system," Steve Maharey said.

"I'm hugely excited about the year ahead for our schools.

"This year I intend to spend a lot of time meeting with teachers, parents and communities around the country, with a focus on how we can work together to raise student achievement and improve learning outcomes for all students."

Highlights from the report include:

- Around 9,300 new entrants will be enrolled at schools this week. They'll be among an estimated 56,000 children who will start school for the first time throughout the year
- Most new entrants (94.5 percent) will have attended an early childhood education centre
- Some 275,800 children will be attending secondary school, an increase of 300 on last year
- Around 477,400 children will be attending primary school, around 3,300 fewer than last year

While most schools open their doors for the first day of the 2007 school year on 7 February, final figures will not be known until the March 2007 and July 2007 school rolls are collected and analysed.

This year will also see more diversity in New Zealand classrooms, with increasing proportions of Maori, Pasifika, and Asian students enrolling in schools. Secondary school rolls will also continue to increase as the high number of children born in the early 1990's – known as the baby-blip – move through to secondary schooling.

During 2007 an estimated $5.7 billion of Government funding will be spent on schools, $400 million more than last year.
