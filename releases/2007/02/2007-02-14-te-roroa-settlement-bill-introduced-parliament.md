The Te Roroa Claims Settlement Bill was introduced to Parliament today.

The Bill gives effect to the Deed of Settlement, signed in December 2005, to settle all the historical claims of Northland iwi Te Roroa. When completed, the Te Roroa settlement will be the second settlement in Northland, following Te Uri o Hau in 2000.

The settlement package contains a formal Crown apology, cultural redress including the transfer of 24 areas of Crown-owned land of special significance to Te Roroa, and a combination of Crown-owned land and cash to a value of $9.5 million.

Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mark Burton today welcomed the bill's introduction.

"This is an important step in the process to address historical grievances in the Northland area," he said. "I urge all members to support the passage of this bill into legislation."

"The bill is one of two claims settlement bills expected to be introduced in the first half of 2007, and is part of the growing momentum to address historical Treaty grievances."

"Settlements provide a platform that support iwi with their economic, cultural and social development, which in turn has positive impacts for the wider region and the country as a whole."

In December the Government passed legislation that set a closing date of 1 September 2008 for lodging all historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, which followed through on a key commitment made by Labour before the last election.

"The settlement of historical grievances in a peaceful, constructive and timely manner has a positive impact on our developing sense of national identity."
