The latest report from the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](http://www.ipcc.ch/press/prwg2feb07.htm) (IPCC) leaves little room to doubt that the world must take urgent and serious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, says Climate Change Minister David Parker.

"The science has firmed up even more, and the conclusion is inescapable: climate change is real, it's happening right now, and humans are responsible for most of it," David Parker says.

"This is an authoritative report, which pulls together high quality science from thousands of researchers, and has been extensively reviewed."

Among the projections for climate change are higher temperatures, more frequent heavy rainfall, increasing ocean acidification, decreases in snow cover, and a loss of sea ice, including from Antarctica, Mr Parker said.

"These are sobering predictions which should make all countries think more seriously about how they can tackle climate change.

"Clearly, no matter what happens, we New Zealanders must ready ourselves for changes to our climate which may affect our agriculture, biodiversity, tourism and way of life."

"The Labour-led government is pressing ahead with an ambitious climate change programme to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

"I urge all New Zealanders to play a constructive role in responding to this very serious threat."

The IPCC is scheduled to release an Adaptation, Impacts and Vulnerabilities report, including a chapter on Australia and New Zealand, in Brussels on 5 April, and its Mitigation report on 3 May in Bangkok.
