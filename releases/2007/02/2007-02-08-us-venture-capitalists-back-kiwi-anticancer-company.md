Kiwi science and innovation has received a major international endorsement with the news of international venture capital backing for oncology drug discovery company Proacta, Economic Development Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"Congratulations to Proacta and in particular Professors Bill Denny and Bill Wilson of the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre at the University of Auckland who were instrumental in discovering and developing the new anti-cancer compound PR-104 here in New Zealand.

"The injection of $US35 million in US venture capital funds will take the compound PR-104 through the next phase of clinical development, including extending the human clinical trials to Auckland. It will also support the discovery and development of new compounds.

"The fact that New Zealand science has attracted such significant funding from these high level US investors is an enormous endorsement of the calibre of our scientists. It shows New Zealand can take our biotechnology and medical science ideas and convert them into global success.

"It is also very satisfying to see that the public investment in Proacta, via the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF), is also paying off, with this strong endorsement by the international commercial community.

"The government set up the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund in 2001 with exactly these sorts of goals in mind. The fund aims to help the commercialisation of innovative and leading edge technology, products and services in New Zealand that are costly and risky to develop.

"Another goal of the fund is to get more New Zealand businesses on the path to global success by increasing access to international networks and expertise. That goal has clearly been achieved in the case of Proacta, with the involvement now of US venture capital. "

"Our government is committed to backing New Zealand innovation as part of our work to transform New Zealand into a high wage, dynamic export-led economy. We also pinpointed biotechnology as a key sector with good potential to help drive economic growth - and as Proacta has demonstrated, we are on the right track. Proacta also received $3.45 million in grants from [TechNZ](http://www.frst.govt.nz/Business/) and the [Australia New Zealand Biotechnology Partnership Fund](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/section/13681.aspx).

### Background information

**Further information on Proacta:**  
Proacta Inc, an oncology drug discovery and development company, announced today that it has raised a further US$35m from US venture capitalists in a Series B round of funding. This new funding will be used to take New Zealand-discovered anticancer compound PR-104 through the next phase of clinical development and support the discovery and development of new compounds.

The two new US life sciences venture capital firms are Clarus Ventures, and Delphi Ventures, and they join existing investors, Alta Partners (US), GBS Venture Partners (Australia) and New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF), New Zealand funds No 8 Ventures and Endeavour iCap, as well as international pharmaceutical companies Genentech and Roche.

**New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Facts:**

- Changes were made to the $160 million NZVIF fund last year so that as well as backing seed, start-up and early expansion investment, it will also support the expansion and late expansion stages of firm growth. This makes the fund even more attractive to private sector and institutional investors.
- To date NZVIF has made $60m of investment commitments to five VIF Venture Capital Funds.
- A total of 36 young high-growth companies have now received investment through the VIF Venture Capital programme.
- The total amount invested through the VIF Venture Capital programme (including VIF and Private sector) is now $114.2 million.
- An additional $60 million of capital committed by government to the VIF Venture Capital programme in the 06/07 budget.
