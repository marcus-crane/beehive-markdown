We’re only just started the year but we’ve already got off to a great start in the arts, culture and heritage sector.

With the [Wellington Fringe Festival](http://www.fringe.org.nz/), the [Te Matatini Festival](http://www.tematatini.org.nz/) in Palmerston North and [AK07](http://www.aucklandfestival.co.nz/) about to kick off in Auckland there is much to celebrate in the arts in New Zealand.

Internationally, New Zealand films have already received acclaim at the [Sundance](http://festival.sundance.org/2007/) and [Berlin Film Festival](http://www.berlinale.de/en/HomePage.html) and kiwi music will be well presented at the [South By South West](http://2007.sxsw.com/) music festival in Texas.

As you can see there are plenty of opportunities to participate in cultural activities – its about making New Zealand a better place to live! Enjoy.
