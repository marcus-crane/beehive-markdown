The members of the first TAB NZ Board come with experience in racing and sport administration, business and governance, the betting industry, broadcasting and gambling harm minimisation.

“This Board will progress from the excellent work done by the interim board, put in place in August 2020,” Grant Robertson said.

“The TAB Board was created under the Racing Act passed in 2020. The Act outlines a process for appointing the board through the establishment of a selection panel to make recommendations to the Minister of Racing.

“This includes three people nominated by the racing codes and up to four other members who have a range of knowledge and experience outlined in the Act.

“The selection panel has taken particular care to work thoroughly through the process to identify suitable candidates. I thank them for their work.

“I am excited to have the new Board in place. This is a significant step for TAB New Zealand. I also want to thank the interim Board for the work it has done to help get us to this point,” Grant Robertson said.

The TAB NZ Board comprises Mark Stewart (Chair), Anna Stove (Deputy Chair), Bill Birnie, Paul Bittar, Jason Fleming, Wendie Harvey, and Raewyn Lovett. Mr Birnie, Mr Bittar and Mr Fleming are the nominees of the racing codes.
