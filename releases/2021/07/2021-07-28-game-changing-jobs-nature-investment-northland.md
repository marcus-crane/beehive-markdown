Conservation Minister Kiri Allan has announced Jobs for Nature funding for a portfolio of projects that will create ‘game changing’ gains for nature and communities across Northland/Te Tai Tokerau as part of the Government’s acceleration of the economic recovery from COVID.

“This portfolio of 12 projects will see over $20 million invested into creating jobs and controlling predators in vitally important areas; protecting our forest giants, the kauri, restoring important dunes and wetland systems in the region, propagation and planting of indigenous species, weed control and species protection.” Kiri Allan said,

“It will see a total of 324 roles established over a three-year programme, upskilling locals to move into other employment opportunities beyond the life of the projects. 

“This investment provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to lay the foundations for a better future by creating tangible and long lasting benefits not only for the environment,  but for communities who have borne the brunt of the economic impacts of the COVID pandemic,” Kiri Allan said.

“It is the result of collaboration between the community, local government and central government agencies to design and secure an investment that would be a game-changer for the region. 

“The projects will help build skills and confidence for opportunities beyond these projects, especially in some of the most remote areas in Northland/Te Tai Tokerau like Mitimiti, Panguru and Te Hapua.

“One of the projects is in the heart of Puketi and will employ 51 locals over three years in predator and pest control, work that ties in with their ongoing desire to protect and improve the health of this amazing kauri forest.

“Another of the projects –  Te Komanga Whangaroa  - involves working closely with local youth to provide training and enable 2300 ha of pest control via trapping and bait stations targeting stoats, cats, possums, pigs and wilding pines in support of the wider community working towards a predator free Northland/Te Tai Tokerau.

“Our collective efforts mean that we are investing in creating jobs that have meaning and purpose by ensuring these communities can continue to be environmental guardians for future generations,” Kiri Allan said.

**Summary of funded projects announced today:**

- **Te Rūnanga–Ā-Iwi O Ngāpuhi** and its **Kaitiaki Kauri** project ($0.84M)  aims to safeguard kauri across the Bay of Islands including Russell, Puketi, Whangaroa, Omahuta, Rakaumangamanga and Opua Forests.

- **Te Komanga Whangaroa** ($2.06m) project involves working closely with local youth to provide training and enable 2,300 ha of pest control via trapping and bait stations targeting stoats, cats, possums, pigs, and wilding pines in support of wider community working towards Predator Free 2050.
- The implementation of the 20-year **Forest Health Plan for the Russell ngāhere** ($1.57m) will take the community closer to its long-term aim of eradication of predators.
