Tirohia ake ngā whetu 

Me ko Matariki e ārau ana 

Ko Matariki e aratakina te hunga pakeke ki te pō.  

Ka horahia te Kupenga a Taramainuku. 

E Kau ana a Matairangi ki runga i te ara Tohora, ki te Pakeho, Ki Niue. 

Ki runga i ngā wai o te Moana nui a kiwa  

He puna wai kei aku kamo… 

Tātai whetū ki te tangi, mau tonu, 

Tātai tangata ki te whenua, ngaro noa, ngaro noa… 

Ki ngā waihotanga iho, kore e mimiti ngā tai aroha ki a koutou. 

Foreign Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has expressed her sadness at the death of former Premier of Niue, Hon Frank Fakaotimanava Lui, who died peacefully over the weekend.

“Hon Fakaotimanava Lui was widely respected and made a significant contribution to Niue. He will be deeply missed,” Nanaia Mahuta said.  

Hon Fakaotimanava Lui was Premier of Niue from 1993 to 1999 and a Minister in preceding years. He was first elected to Parliament in 1963, serving in administrations with Niue’s founding politicians Sir Robert Rex and Young Vivian.   

During Hon Fakaotimanava Lui’s time as Premier, Niue banned the transportation of nuclear waste through its waters and introduced tougher penalties for drift net fishing. The period also saw the construction and opening of the Matavai Resort, paving the way for tourism to become a key contributor to Niue’s economic development. Hon Fakaotimanava Lui was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1999. 

Nanaia Mahuta offered her condolences to Hon Fakaotimanava Lui’s family and the people and government of Niue. 

Piki ake ki te toi o ngā rangi, ki Matariki, whanaunga kore. Oki oki atu rā.
