The Government is backing New Zealand Young Farmers to help the organisation grow and attract people into the food and fibre sector, said Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor.

"As part of our work to support and grow the sector we will contribute $1.76 million to New Zealand Young Farmers over three years through the Ministry for Primary Industries' Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures (SFF Futures) fund," said Damien O'Connor.

"That will be boosted by support of about $350,000 from DairyNZ, Beef + Lamb New Zealand and AGMARDT."

Damien O'Connor said New Zealand Young Farmers was an important organisation for attracting, nurturing, and retaining people in the sector.

“The organisation has a proud history and we want to ensure it can continue to provide help to young farmers for many years to come. Their network of 80 clubs around the country provides a range of benefits - particularly to rural communities.

"The help from SFF Futures will enable New Zealand Young Farmers to transition to a more financially sustainable business model that delivers more support to its local clubs and members.

"The support will help the organisation focus on further development of its clubs, introduce a new membership model and develop a wide-ranging digital platform to better connect members and provide services.

“The digital platform especially will allow the organisation to reach a far wider, more diverse range of young people and help them connect in with all the sector has to offer. I want our rural communities to be vibrant and viable.

“This project will be transformational for New Zealand Young Farmers – it will bring members back to the centre of focus, set them on a strong path for future growth and boost their part in helping the food and fibre sector add more value to our great products,” Damien O’Connor said.

Damien O'Connor said the Government was proud to support such an important rural organisation.

“New Zealand Young Farmers is part of our rural history and it’s important it continues to help its members and support rural communities.

"As a proud former member of Young Farmers I've seen the importance of the work they do to help farmers adapt and meet challenges head on.

"We’re pleased, alongside our industry partners, to play a part in transitioning the organisation to a more modern and sustainable business model so it continues to thrive and enhance the well being of our rural communities,” Damien O'Connor said.
