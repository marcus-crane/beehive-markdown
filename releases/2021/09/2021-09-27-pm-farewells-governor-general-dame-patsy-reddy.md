The Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy completes her five year term as Governor-General of New Zealand today.

“Today marks the end of an eventful term of office for Dame Patsy and I want to acknowledge and thank her for her tireless service to New Zealand over the last five years,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.

“Dame Patsy has met thousands of people and celebrated the achievements and contribution of extraordinary New Zealanders in every walk of life. She has found new and creative ways to connect with people during the Covid pandemic, using distanced and virtual meetings to highlight the work of those supporting the nation’s response.

“When she came into office Dame Patsy could not have foreseen the unprecedented events that would both challenge and unite our communities. As well as Covid, she stood with us all as we grieved the terror attacks on the Christchurch mosques, the Kaikōura earthquake, and the eruption at Whakaari-White Island. 

“Dame Patsy came to the office of Governor-General from a distinguished career in law and governance. She brought with her a passion for creativity, innovation and the arts, a deep commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and the Crown- Māori relationship, and a desire to contribute to a strong, successful and vibrant Aotearoa New Zealand.

“On behalf of the government and people of Aotearoa New Zealand, I thank her for her service.

“I also wish to acknowledge the dedication and contribution of her husband Sir David Gascoigne. He has stood beside Dame Patsy and supported her throughout her time as Governor-General.

“So I’m very pleased to be able to share the news that he has been appointed as a Companion of the Queen’s Service Order, a much deserved honour,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Note to Editors:

The State Farewell for Dame Patsy planned for Monday 6 September was postponed due to the COVID outbreak. A replacement event will be arranged for a later date.

The Governor-General designate, Dame Cindy Kiro, will be sworn in as Governor-General on 21 October. The Chief Justice, Dame Helen Winkelmann, will act as Administrator of the Government until then.  

Dame Patsy was the third woman to hold the office of Governor-General, after Dame Cath Tizard and Dame Silvia Cartwright.

Dame Patsy received a Damehood (DNZM) for services to the arts and business in 2014.  She was appointed as additional Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (GNZM) and additional Companion of the Queen’s Service Order (QSO) in 2016 as Governor-General Designate.

As well as the Queen’s Service Order Sir David was awarded a CBE for services to film in 1988. He received a Knighthood (KNZM) for services to the arts and business in 2009.
