The Government has increased its targeted mental health and wellbeing investment for Rainbow young people, taking the total amount of funding past its manifesto commitment.

“Earlier this year the Government announced [the first investment of $4-million](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/first-ever-nationwide-funding-mental-health-services-rainbow-young) specifically for Rainbow mental wellbeing initiatives aimed at young people – this has now been boosted by an additional $600,000,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.

“We know the Rainbow community is more at-risk and likely to experience poorer mental health and wellbeing, discrimination, harassment and bullying than the general population and this is unacceptable.

“This funding is to support projects, activities and Rainbow organisations to improve mental health outcomes for future generations of Rainbow communities,” Andrew Little said.

The now $4.6-million package consists of; $3.2 million for primary mental health and addiction services for Rainbow young people across the motu – awarded to RainbowYOUTH  and InsideOUT Kōaro; an $800,000 top-up to the Rule Foundation’s Rainbow Wellbeing Legacy Fund; and $600,000 to deliver Rainbow competency training to mental health and addiction workforces.

“RainbowYOUTH can now extend its peer support service nationwide, and InsideOUT can expand its support service from 200 to 300 schools. Upskilling and supporting the mental health and addiction workforce will equip them to better respond to the needs of the Rainbow community,” Andrew Little said.

“The Rule Foundation has also approved grants to 12 initiatives to help people including Māori/takatāpui and Pacific peoples; Indian, ethnic and migrant communities; transgender/non-binary, intersex people; faith and independent rainbow tradespeople.

“This funding is part of a legacy of positive outcomes being created by the 2019 Wellbeing Budget where we committed to improve access to and choice of mental wellbeing services for all New Zealanders,” Andrew Little said.

Youth mental health is part of the Cooperation Agreement between Labour and The Green Party.

“Back in 2018 the He Ara Oranga Mental Health and Addiction Inquiry made clear that a person’s mental wellbeing relies on each of us having what we need to live our authentic, connected lives. For our rainbow and takatāpui whānau, this means being supported to be who we are, no matter who we are or who we love,” Green Party mental health spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said.

“The Green Party supports the Government’s bills to change the law to end conversion practices and enable self-identification. Today’s funding boost for fit for purpose mental health and addiction supports will help ensure that our communities can access the services they, like all New Zealanders, deserve.”
