**Kua ea te pānuitanga tuatahi o te Pire Whakataunga Whakaaetanga a Ngāti Maniapoto**

No te rā tonu nei i pōhiritia a Ngāti Maniapoto ki te whare Paremata e Andrew Little te Minita mo ngā take Tiriti kia kite ai rātou te pānuitanga tuatahi o te pire Whakataunga Whakaaetanga a Ngāti Maniapoto.

Noho ai a Ngāti Maniapoto ki Te Rohe Pōtae, kei te takiwā o Taumarunui, o Mōkau, o Pureora, o Te Kūiti, o Ōtorohanga, o Te Awamutu, o Kāwhia anō hoki. Ko tōna 45,930 ngā tāngata o te iwi, ka mutu, kei tua atu i te 90-paehēneti te nui o ngā uri kei waho atu o te rohe e noho ana.

Hei tā Andrew Little, “Ko tēnei rā hei whakanui i ngā mahi i oti, he whakanui hoki i te āhutanga i tae ai a Ngāti Maniapoto me te Karauna ki tēnei tūtohu nui, āpā noa atu ko te whakahounga o te tūhonotanga i waenga i ngā rōpū e rua nei.  

“E harikoa ana au kua tae ā-tinana mai ētahi o ngā māngai o te iwi ki te whare Paremata kia kite ai rātou i tēnei rā whakahirahira i runga anō i te mōhio i noho mātata atu a Ngāti Maniapoto i te Karauna ki te haina i te Whakataunga Whakaaetanga nā runga i ngā here o te mate Kowheori-19”.

Ko ngā tūkinotanga i pā ki a Ngāti Maniapoto i roto i ngā tau, ko te heke o te toto i ngā pakanga ki te Karauna, me ngā pānga kino mai o ngā Pakanga o Niu Tireni. Whakahāweatia e te Karauna te mana motuhake o Ngāti Maniapoto, kāore i mau te Karauna ki āna kī-taurangi ki a Maniapoto mō te āhua ki ngā whakahaerenga me te rangatiratanga o ō rātou whenua i ngā tau 1880, ā, pākaha ana te tango a te Karauna i ngā whenua o Ngati Maniapoto.

Hei tā Andrew Little, “Kei tēnei whakataunga kitea ai he tūtohunga, he whakapāha hoki nā te Karauna i āna tūkinotanga ki a Ngati Maniapoto me āna takahitanga i te Tiriti.”

“Kia mana ai tēnei pire i roto i te ture, ka whakawhiwhiwa a Ngāti Maniapoto ki te puretumu pūtea, he kaupapa arumoni $165 miriona te nui, me te puretumu ahurea āpā noa atu i ngā wahi tapu 36 a Ngāti Maniapoto ka whakahokia ki a rātou.

“Kei roto hoki i te Whakataunga Whakaaetanga ka nui kē atu te mana whakahaere a Ngati Maniapoto i ngā rawa taiao o roto i tō rātou nā rohe, ka whakahokia ki a Ngāti Maniapoto, ā, ka takohangia e Ngāti Maniapoto ki te Karauna ‘Te-Ara-o-Tūrongo’ (tētahi wāhanga o te ara tereina matua o te Ika ā Maui), ā, tae noa ki ngā whakaaetanga i waenganui i a Ngāti Maniapoto me ngā tari maha a te Kawanatanga.

Hei tāna anō, “Ahakoa rā tēnei Whakataunga Whakaaetanga, e kore rawa e taea te utu i a Ngāti Maniapoto mō ngā tūkinotanga i pā mai ki a rātou, ko tāku tūmanako kia noho ko tēnei Whakataunga Whakaaetanga hei tūāpapa i waenganui i a Ngāti Maniapoto me te Karauna e kitea ai ngā hua e ngā uri kei te ia o te wā.”

**Maniapoto Claims Settlement Bill passes first reading**

Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little today welcomed Maniapoto to Parliament to witness the first reading of the Maniapoto Claims Settlement Bill.

Maniapoto is based in Te Rohe Pōtae (the King Country), in and around Taumarunui, Mōkau, Pureora, Te Kūiti, Ōtorohanga, Te Awamutu and Kāwhia. The iwi has an estimated 45,930 members, with more than 90-percent living outside of the rohe.

“Today recognises not only the hard work and dedication by Maniapoto and The Crown to reach this significant milestone, but also the renewed relationship between both parties,” Andrew Little said.

“I am pleased some iwi representatives have been able to come to Parliament in person today to witness this important occasion knowing that we had to sign the Deed of Settlement separately because of COVID-19 restrictions.”

Maniapoto’s historical grievances relate to loss of life in conflicts with the Crown and bearing the costs of the New Zealand Wars. The Crown deliberately undermined Maniapoto independence, failed to uphold promises made in the 1880s relating to Maniapoto land administration and self-determination, and acquired Maniapoto land in an aggressive manner.

“The deed includes an acknowledgement and apology by the Crown for its breaches of the Treaty towards Maniapoto,” Andrew Little said.

“Following the passing of legislation, Maniapoto will receive $165 million financial and commercial redress, and cultural redress including 36 sites of traditional, historical and cultural significance to Maniapoto.

“The settlement also includes a greater role in the management of natural resources within the Maniapoto rohe, the gift to Maniapoto and gift back to the Crown of ‘Te-Ara-o-Tūrongo’ (part of the North Island Main Trunk railway line), and agreements with a range of Crown agencies.

“While no Treaty settlement will ever be able to compensate Maniapoto for the true measure of the loss they have suffered, I sincerely hope this settlement will go some way to building a foundation between Maniapoto and the Crown that will be of benefit to future generations,” Andrew Little said.

The Maniapoto Deed of Settlement is available at [www.govt.nz/browse/history-culture-and-heritage/treaty-settlements/find-a-treaty-settlement/maniapoto/](https://www.govt.nz/treaty-settlement-documents/ngati-hinerangi/).
