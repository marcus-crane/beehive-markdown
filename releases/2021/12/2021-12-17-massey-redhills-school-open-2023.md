A new year 1-8 school for the Massey Redhills area of Auckland will help meet demand from rapid housing expansion in the western suburbs, Education Minister Chris Hipkins says.

“We’re planning well ahead to meet the demand identified in the National Education Growth Plan of an extra 3,340 primary aged students expected in the Massey area by 2032,” Chris Hipkins said.

A further 25,000 to 30,000 homes are either under construction or expected to be delivered over the next 25 years in the Massey, Whenuapai and Hobsonville Point suburbs.

“The new Massey Redhills school will open from 2023 to cater for new families in the first phase of the 10,000 homes planned at this 600 hectare development,” Chris Hipkins said.

“In the future we will add to the Massey Redhills school with new schools on a Trig Road site in Whenuapai, and land acquired also at Hobsonville Point.

The Trig Road site will initially be used as a temporary location for the Massey Redhills students, while a new site west of Fred Taylor Drive is acquired and a purpose-built development completed.

Students will be transported to the temporary location where there will be relocatable buildings, currently being used by Scott Point Primary School.

“We’re aiming to have the new build completed for students to learn from the Massey location from term 1 of 2025. The school will have an initial roll of around 250, with capacity at the new site to expand to 900,” Chris Hipkins said.

“An Establishment Board will shortly be appointed which will select a foundation principal and develop the vision and design for the new school.

“More planning is underway for other new schools that will be needed – to make sure students in this high growth catchment can access education locally well into the future.”
