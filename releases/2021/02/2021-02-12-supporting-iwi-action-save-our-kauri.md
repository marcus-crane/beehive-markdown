A historic collaboration between iwi groups in Northland to tackle Kauri dieback is being funded through the Government’s Jobs for Nature programme, Conservation Minister Kiri Allan says.

Up to 30 jobs will be created with the Te Roroa, Te Rarawa, Ngāti Wai, and Ngāti Kurī to address the spread of the disease, which has been a threat for many years.

“Without urgent action, it will devastate iconic Northland forests,” Kiri Allan said.

“The $3.5 million Jobs for Nature project will cover approximately 50 per cent of Kauri forests in the region and include the two most significant old-growth forests in Northland (Waipoua and Warawara) and two of the country’s most significant tourist destinations, Tane Mahuta and Te Rerenga Wairua (Cape Reinga).

“This significant investment in kauri recovery is vital to māori culture, mana, and identity. What we learn through undertaking this work at a scale will be invaluable and will be shared with other Iwi in kauri lands.

“Taitokerau (Northland) has high unemployment rates. This project will create valuable jobs for up to 30 people who will learn valuable skills and play an important role in conserving kauri forests for the future,” Kiri Allan said.

**Background**

Kauri protection will be carried out over the next three years in Waipoua, Maunganui, Waima, Mataraua, Tokatoka, Trounson Park, Marlborough (Te Roroa), Warawara, Herekino, Takahue, Ahipara, Pukepoto, Raetea (Te Rarawa), Te Paki, Hikurua, Kapo Wairua, Te Rerenga Wairua (Ngāti Kuri), Pukenui, Parihaka, Manaia, Glenbervie as well as the offshore islands of Aotea (Great Barrier Island), Te Hauturu-o-Toi (Little Barrier Island), Tawhiti Rahi me Aorangi (Poor Knights Island), and Ngāti Wai (the Hen and Chickens Islands).

The kauri protection needs in each of these forests vary but include prevention, mitigation, education, behaviour change, treatment, restoration and surveillance.
