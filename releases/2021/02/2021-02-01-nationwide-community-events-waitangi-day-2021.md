Community events from Northland to Southland and from the West Coast to the Chatham Islands will draw people together to commemorate Waitangi Day, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Hon Carmel Sepuloni said today.

“Thirty-four grants totalling $288,000 have gone to organisations throughout Aotearoa to support events commemorating the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and celebrate its importance to who we are as a nation,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“The grants have been awarded for events promoting nation and community building and those encouraging wide community participation and cultural experience.

“From workshops on Te Tiriti and whānau-oriented marae days to performance and children’s activities these nationwide events will deepen our understanding of Te Tiriti.

“Alongside the national commemorations at Waitangi, Bay of Islands, the New Zealand Federation of Multicultural Councils is hosting a community wananga in Northland for migrant and refugee communities on the reo Māori version of Te Tiriti.

“The Waikato Museum Te Whare Taonga o Waikato is hosting Te Tiriti focussed exhibitions, with guest speakers, performances, crafts and children’s activities.

“At the Carterton District Council Community event at Hurunui o Rangi Marae there’s an opportunity to connect with mana whenua to learn about Te Tiriti and experience manaakitanga.

“West Coasters have a choice of events in Hokitika, Westport and Greymouth featuring hui, waiata, kanikani, poi, kapa haka and kai.

“Activities in Te Anau include a re-enactment of Te Tiriti signing by Mararoa primary school students and the Chatham Community Focus Trust is running a scavenger hunt, taking the community to places of significance with Waitangi Day questions and quizzes at each site.

“I am sure this year’s events will bring communities together to reinforce the value of Te Tiriti.

“We are fortunate in Aotearoa to be able to host large gatherings, however I encourage grant recipients to remain vigilant and take the necessary steps to align with Ministry of Health guidelines for gatherings to ensure we continue to keep our communities as safe as possible,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

Hei tā te Minita mō Manatū Taonga i te rangi nei, a Hon Carmel Sepuloni, ka whakakotahi mai te tangata ki ngā huihuinga hapori mai i te Tai Tokerau ki Murihiku, mai i te Tai Poutini ki Rēkohu, ki te whakamahara i te Rā o Waitangi.

Hei tā Carmel Sepuloni, “E toru tekau ma wha ngā takuhe e $288,000 te tapeke kua riro ki ētahi whakahaere puta noa i Aotearoa, hei tautoko i ngā huihuinga whakamahara ki te hainatanga o Te Tiriti o Waitangi me te whakanui i tōna hiranga ki te tohu ko wai tātou ā-motu nei.”

“Kua whakawhiwhia ngā takuhe mō ngā huihuinga whakatairanga i te whakatupu i te motu me ngā hapori, me ērā e whakatenatena ana kia whai wāhi atu te hapori whānui me te wheako ahurea.

“Mai i te hui tauwhāiti mō Te Tiriti me te hui a ngā whānau ki ngā marae, ki ngā mahi rēhia me te kaupapa mā te tamariki, mā ngā huihuinga ki te motu e hōhonu ake tō tātou mārama ki Te Tiriti.”

“I te taha o ngā whakamaharatanga o te motu ki Waitangi, Bay of Islands, kei te whakahaeretia i tēnei tau e te New Zealand Federation of Multicultural Councils tētahi wānanga hapori ki te Tai Tokerau mā ngā hapori manene, ngā hapori rerenga mō Te Tiriti ki te reo Māori. 

“Kei te whakakotahitia e Te Whare Taonga o Waikato te hapori i runga i te whakaaturanga e arotahi ana ki Te Tiriti, ki te kaikōrero, te mahi rēhia, te toi me ētahi mahi mā te tamariki.

“I te huihuinga a te Carterton District Council Community ki Hurunui-o-Rangi Marae, ka whai huarahi te iwi ki te hono atu ki te mana whenua, ki te ako mō Te Tiriti o Waitangi me te wheako i te manaakitanga.

“Ka taea e te hunga o Te Tai Poutini te kōwhiri huihuinga ka tū ki Hokitika, ki Kawatiri me Māwhera e whakakotahi ai te iwi ki te hui, ki te waiata, te kanikani, te poi, te kapa haka me te kai.

“Ki Te Anau, ka whakahaeretia anō te hainatanga o Te Tiriti e ngā tauira o te kura o Mararoa, ka mutu, kei te whakahaeretia e te Chatham Community Focus Trust tētahi rapunga taonga e arahina ai te hapori ki ētahi wāhi hiranga, e haere ai ētahi pātai mō te Rā o Waitangi me ētahi kairoro i tēnā, i tēnā wāhi.

"E whakapono ana au ka whakakotahitia ngā hapori e ngā huihuinga o tēnei tau ki te whakaū i te uara o Te Tiriti.

Hei tā Carmel Sepulini anō, “Waimarie ana tātou o Aotearoa i tō tātou āhei ki te whakahaere hui nui, heoi, e whakahau ana au i te hunga i whiwhi takuhe kia noho mataara tonu, me te whai i ngā ara e tika ana kia hāngai ai ngā huihuinga ki ngā aratohu a te Manatū Hauora e noho haumaru tonu ai ō tātou hapori."
