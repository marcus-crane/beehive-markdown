Minister of Health Andrew Little has congratulated the inaugural Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission and its board, as the Commission marks its first day as an independent Crown entity.

“This is a very significant day for the Commission,” said Andrew Little.

“Its members will be dedicated to contributing to better and equitable mental health and wellbeing outcomes for all people in New Zealand. The inaugural Commission has a strong board to support the Government’s goals around mental health and wellbeing and I want to wish chair Hayden Wano and his team all the best for their mahi which lies ahead.

“Hayden also chaired the initial Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission ministerial advisory group, prior to the permanent Commission commencing. He has extensive governance experience and a strong background in the health sector, and his ongoing involvement will be a significant factor in the success of the Commission.

“The board’s membership comprises a diverse range of skills, backgrounds and experience and I am confident it will represent Aotearoa New Zealand’s broad population well and make a tangible difference to our health and social systems in the years to come.

“I want to thank the Inquiry Panel that led the inquiry into mental health and addiction in 2018. They delivered an honest account of the mental health and addiction landscape, including recommendations which have now resulted in change.

“At this time, I also want to acknowledge the work of the outgoing Mental Health Commissioner Kevin Allan. Kevin began his term in 2016 and I recognise his work in helping ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate fully in the community and have access to high quality health, disability, and social services.”

 The following members have been appointed to the Commission, which as an independent Crown entity has its membership appointed by the Governor-General.
