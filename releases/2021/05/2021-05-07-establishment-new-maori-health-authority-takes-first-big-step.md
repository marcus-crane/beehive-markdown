Sir Mason Durie will lead a Steering Group to provide advice to the Transition Unit on governance arrangements and initial appointments to an interim board to oversee the establishment of the Māori Health Authority. This Group will ensure that Māori shape a vital element of our future health system, Minister of Health Andrew Little and Associate Minister of Health Peeni Henare announced today.

“Tā Mason is a pillar of the New Zealand health system and brings tremendous experience and mana to this crucial role. The place of the Māori Health Authority in the future health system is important not only for Māori, but for all New Zealanders. Tā Mason’s appointment is a significant step in the reform programme as we seek to deliver better outcomes for all, in partnership,” Andrew Little said.

Tā Mason will advise on the best composition of leaders to provide high quality governance support to the interim Māori Health Authority, and on how the Authority will be accountable to both the Government and to Māori in driving improvement in hauora Māori.

“He has spent his life working at the forefront of hauora Māori innovation – and so it is right that he help us ensure that the Māori Health Authority continues to be transformative,” Peeni Henare said.

“The Authority will give Māori a voice and influence in how our system needs to perform better for Maori.

“I can’t think of anyone who is better qualified or has greater mana in this area than Tā Mason.

Sir Mason will head a Steering Group working to the Transition Unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It will focus on:

- involving Māori in identifying candidates for the interim Māori Health Authority board, and supporting Ministers in appointing that board with a mandate from Māori
- providing advice on appropriate options for governance and accountability arrangements for the Māori Health Authority.

“I hope to confirm appointments to the interim Māori Health Authority board by 1 September, subject to Cabinet’s agreement once candidates are identified,” Peeni Henare said.
