Nine community energy education initiatives to help struggling New Zealanders with their power bills are being given government funding through the new Support for Energy Education in Communities (SEEC) Programme. 

“Last year we committed nearly $8 million over four years to establish the SEEC Programme. This funding will help expand the existing network of community organisations providing vital energy education to households in need, and ultimately get cheaper power bills’, The Minister of Energy and Resources Hon Dr Megan Woods says.

“Energy hardship is a pressing and complex problem, and in addition to reducing power bills this excellent initiative will help low income households across the country achieve warmer, more energy-efficient homes with programmes that do things like help with energy assessments, or give out energy saving equipment.”

“One of the funding recipients – Habitat for Humanity – Northern Region – delivers essential winter items (Winter Warmer Packs) to low-income families. SEEC funding is enabling them to reach even more households in Greater Auckland and for the first time, in Northland and Great Barrier Island” said Megan Woods.

In total, $1.26 million was available in the first funding round and nine initiatives have been selected to receive between $60,000 and $200,000 each.

The recipients are:

- **‘Anglican Care Energy Poverty Programme’, Anglican Care (Canterbury/Westland)**
