Instant connection to the Māori world is one swipe closer today with the launch of two new apps from Māori Television.

The mobile apps, *Te Ao Māori News* and *Māori TV*, will drive important alerts and messages to communities faster and provide free access to breaking news, favourite shows, documentaries and live events direct to digital devices. 

The Minister for Māori Development, Willie Jackson, said he fully supported the digital direction.

 “The more informed our communities are, the safer we are as a people and as a nation,” said Minister Jackson.

“It’s right that Māori Television leads the charge for Māori news and content in the digital space.  I’d like to acknowledge Māori TV in this great step forward for the future.”

The apps are user-focused with dual language support for all, connecting whānau to communities, New Zealanders to each other and the world to te ao Māori. 

No matter where people are on their reo Māori language journey, they can learn with us at any time from the comfort of their own space on their own device.  For others it’s a doorway to a unique world that’s on our doorstep.

The new *Te Ao Māori News* app includes alerts for breaking news and live events, social media sharing and access to the latest from the Māori Television newsroom.  Users can access by downloading via the Apple App Store.
