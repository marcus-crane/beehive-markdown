Applications are now invited from all councils for a slice of government funding aimed at improving tourism infrastructure, especially in areas under pressure given the size of their rating bases.

Tourism Minister Stuart Nash has [already signalled](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/tourism-fund-prioritise-hard-hit-regions) that five South Island regions will be given priority to reflect that jobs and businesses in these areas have been hardest hit by the loss of international visitors.

“The Tourism Infrastructure Fund opens today for applications,” Mr Nash said. “Between $13 and $18 million is likely to be available.”

“I am particularly keen to see ideas for projects from Kaikōura, MacKenzie District - Aoraki Mt Cook, Queenstown Lakes, Fiordland and South Westland.

“I have today released the formal Priorities Statement that sets the framework for applications. My Priorities Statement makes it clear that while all councils can apply for support with tourism infrastructure, applications from five regions will carry extra weight.

“The projects in these five regions will provide much-needed local employment as tourism towns work to diversify their economies. The new infrastructure will also ensure the quality of the visitor experience is improved for when tourists return in greater numbers.

“The Fund is open for applications till Friday 30 April. Applications are assessed by a Panel of representatives from local government, central government agencies, and those with experience in the tourism and infrastructure sector,” Mr Nash said.

The Minister’s Priorities Statement is copied below.

**Tourism Infrastructure Fund – Round Five**

**Priorities Statement**

The Tourism Infrastructure Fund (TIF) provides financial support for local visitor-related public infrastructure where tourism (domestic and international) is placing pressure on, or potential growth is constrained by, existing infrastructure, and where the local community is unable to respond in a timely way without assistance.

New Zealand’s regions and the tourism industry have been impacted by COVID-19. The regions of Kaikōura, Mackenzie, Queenstown-Lakes, Fiordland, and South Westland have been particularly hard hit. Round five of the TIF will ensure central government support and investment in local government infrastructure can continue over this uncertain time and  help improve the visitor experience for kiwis and international visitors when they return.  

**Government’s priorities for Round Five**

TIF applications are assessed against the TIF eligibility and assessment criteria agreed by Cabinet. Round Five will prioritise projects that demonstrate the need for additional visitor-related public infrastructure. This includes capital works required for infrastructure to manage responsible camping. 

Applications are invited from **all** councils.

Applications from councils in Kaikōura, Mackenzie, Queenstown Lakes, Fiordland, and South Westland will be prioritised.

Projects should also:

- provide innovative approaches to infrastructure needs
- provide sustainable investment which ensures that visitors contribute to the ongoing costs of infrastructure
- use best endeavours to construct any infrastructure out of carbon-neutral building materials
- make use of technology where possible
- retain community support for tourism and ensure high quality experiences
- address capacity issues and future-proofs the proposed infrastructure
- align with the Government’s Tourism Strategy and your region’s destination management planning

Feasibility studies or needs assessments will continue to be considered.
