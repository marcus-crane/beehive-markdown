Kiri Allan, Minister of Conservation and Emergency Management will undertake a leave of absence while she undergoes medical treatment for cervical cancer, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“Kiri’s Parliamentary family will do everything possible to support her during her treatment and recovery.

“Until Kiri is able to return to work I am appointing Acting Ministers to her portfolios.

“Ayesha Verrall will be the Acting Minister of Conservation and Peeni Henare will be Acting Associate Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage.  

“I look forward to welcoming Kiri back on the team and into Cabinet upon her return,” Jacinda Ardern said.
