Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little welcomed ngā uri o Ngāti Hinerangi to Parliament today to witness the third reading of their Treaty settlement legislation, the Ngāti Hinerangi Claims Settlement Bill.

“I want to acknowledge ngā uri o Ngāti Hinerangi and the Crown negotiations teams for working tirelessly during the negotiations process. This is a significant milestone to see this legislation passed,” Andrew Little said.

The settlement provides Crown apology redress, including an agreed historical account, and Crown acknowledgements of its historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Ngāti Hinerangi will receive financial and commercial redress of $8.1 million, and cultural redress, including a cultural fund of $200,000 and a marae rebuild fund of $20,000. Fourteen sites of cultural significance will be returned to them. The cultural redress package also provides for the development of relationships with key Crown agencies and a co-governance arrangement over the upper part of the Waihou and Piako catchments.

“This marks a new beginning in realising the settlement promises made to Ngāti Hinerangi,” Andrew Little said.

“When the Deed of Settlement was signed in May 2019 at Te Ohaki Marae, the Ngāti Hinerangi Chair Phil Smith likened it to a new Treaty between Ngāti Hinerangi and the Crown. In many ways that is true. Today we are reaffirming our relationship with hope and a vision for the future generations of Ngāti Hinerangi”

“This settlement signifies a new phase in the partnership between the Crown and Ngāti Hinerangi, Andrew Little said.”

**Kua ea te pānuitanga tuatoru mō te Kerēme Whakataunga Tiriti a Ngāti Hinerangi**

Nō te rā nei i te whare Paremata whakatauria ai ngā uri o Ngāti Hinerangi e te Minita mō ngā take Tiriti, a Andrew Little, mō rātou i whai wāhi mai ki te pānuitanga tuatoru o tā rātou ture Whakataunga Tiriti, e kīa nei, ko te Pire Whakatau Kerēme a Ngāti Hinerangi.

Hei tā Andrew Little, “He hiahia nōku ki te whakanui i ngā uri o Ngāti Hinerangi mē te rōpū Kaiwhakarite a te Karauna i whakapau kaha i roto i te roanga ake o ēnei whiriwhi. He tūtohu nui tēnei, te kite i te whakamanatanga o tēnei ture.” 

Kei tēnei whakataunga ko te puretumu whakapāha nā te Karauna, ko te whakamanatanga o ngā korero tuku iho e ngā taha e rua, me ngā whakatika mai a te Karauna mō ōna takahitanga i te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Ka riro mai i a Ngāti Hinerangi he wāhanga ahumoni, he wāhanga arumoni $8.1 miriona te nui, ko te puretumu ahurea $200,000 te nui, tae noa mai ki tētahi tahua, $20,000 te nui, ki te whakatika Marae. Tekau mā whā ngā wāhi tapu ka whakahokia ki a rātou. Kei te puretumu ahurea hoki ka kitea  ngā whakaritenga e taea ai te mahi ngātahi me ngā tari Kāwanatanga matua, e ngātahi ai hoki ngā whakaritenga mana whakahaere mō ngā puna hopunga wai ki te taha whakarunga, ki Waihou me Piako.

Hei tā Andrew Little, “He tohu tēnei i te tīmatanga hou e oatitia nei e tēnei whakataunga Tiriti ki a Ngāti Hinerangi.”

“I te wā i hainatia te Whakaaetanga Whakataunga i te marama o Mei 2019 ki Te Ohaki Marae, hei tā te Heamana o Ngāti Hinerangi a Phil Smith, ko te āhua ia he Tiriti hou tēnei i waenganui i a Ngāti Hinerangi me te Karauna. Pono ake nei tēnei kōrero. I tēnei rā, e whakapūmautia ana e mātou tēnei hononga i runga i te tūmanako me te tirohanga whakamua mō ngā uri whakatipu o Ngāti Hinerangi.”

“Ko tēnei whakataunga e tohu nei i te tūārangi hou mō ngā mahinga ngātahi a te Karauna me Ngāti Hinerangi.”
