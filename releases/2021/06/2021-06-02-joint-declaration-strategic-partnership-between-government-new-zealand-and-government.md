On the occasion of the virtual Summit, on June 2 2021, between H.E. Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, and H.E. Mr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain.

New Zealand and the Kingdom of Spain:

*Welcoming* the existing strong links between the two countries;

*Asserting their firm commitment* to the defence of a more democratic rules-based, multilateral order and international institutions, and rules-based trade;

*Reiterating* their shared commitment to a values-oriented foreign policy that pursues democracy, sustainability, gender equality and women’s empowerment, rule of law, human rights, with special emphasis on indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups;

*Determined to* work towards a transformative, sustainable and inclusive economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic;

*Affirming* their common resolve to take decisive action on the urgency of climate change and environmental issues;

*Wishing* to promote global peace, human rights and security;

*Committed* to working more closely together to build a dynamic, strong, and forward-facing relationship to further advance these goals; and

*Recalling* the Joint Declaration and Plan of Action on International Relations and Cooperation concluded in 2009 between their Ministers of Foreign Affairs

*Adopt* this Joint Declaration.

The Kingdom of Spain and New Zealand, despite their geographic situation at the opposite ends of the world, share strong linkages and wish to deepen their ties and bonds through political dialogue, concerted action including in multilateral fora, trade and people-to-people relations.

Furthermore, we have common views on the priorities needed to protect and promote a rules-based international order, with a strengthened United Nations at its core, adapted to enable the necessary transformations of our time, from the green transition to the technological revolution, and to better prepare our societies for the future.

Hence, Spain and New Zealand commit to elevate the bilateral relationship to a Strategic Partnership based on the following elements.

**1. Bilateral Relations**

To pursue high-level political and strategic dialogue, both countries undertake first to carry out periodic, reciprocal visits at the level of Prime Minister and President of Government, when international travel and mobility allows.

Foreign Ministers will meet and confer frequently. Political consultations at the level of Senior Officials’ talks between our Foreign Ministries will continue to take place annually where possible, between alternate capitals. There will be a regular exchange of information and perspectives on areas of mutual interest through briefings and meetings with our Embassies in Wellington and Madrid. Such political consultations and exchanges of information will have a special focus on global governance; global political and security issues of shared concern; and regional matters (in particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa).

Together we will continue to work towards the prompt conclusion of bilateral agreements and arrangements under negotiation, in particular the Arrangement on Antarctic Cooperation.

**2. Global Values Partnership**

New Zealand and Spain share a vision for the world we want to shape together. Our countries are globally oriented and seek to advance a rules-based international order through more and better multilateral cooperation. We both encourage and celebrate diversity. We are determined to advance in our foreign policies the goals of inclusive and more egalitarian societies; a sustainable, greener economy; and vibrant, resilient democracies where pluralism thrives and is reinforced by the technological revolution.

The Global Values Partnership, co-led by New Zealand and Spain, will put such values-driven policies at the forefront of our transformative foreign agendas. By launching the Global Values Partnership, Spain and New Zealand will coordinate more closely their efforts to address global challenges and advance an agenda of reinforced multilateralism. We will seek opportunities to speak out together, and with others, carrying out joint, concrete actions in defence of our modern, democratic and internationalist values.

 **3. Multilateral actions**

New Zealand and Spain will continue our strong record of working together multilaterally, including by:

- Promoting global peace and security, responding to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including online through our continuous support and endorsement of the Christchurch Call to Action.
- Promoting and protecting human rights and gender equality through support for multilateral and regional human rights processes, and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.
- Strengthening the United Nations system so that it better addresses global challenges through concrete actions such as the initiative “Reinforcing Multilateralism Together”, launched in Madrid on November 2020.
- Promoting respect for international law, including international humanitarian law; supporting international courts and others mechanisms to ensure full accountability for violations of international law, particularly international crimes, human rights violations and the use of chemical weapons; and upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets out the definitive legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.
- Enhancing regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America and Africa.
- Working together in support of Pacific Island countries including in taking ambitious action on climate change, amplifying Small Island Developing States’ voices in multilateral fora, and regularly consulting on Pacific issues, including in relation to the European Union’s contribution in the Pacific.

**4. Economy, Trade, Business, Investment, and Technology**

Globalisation has enhanced connectivity between our two countries, brought prosperity to our societies, and improved the lives of millions. It has also posed challenges, and we must bring a broader perspective to economic transformation that puts at the forefront social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and gender perspectives looking for a level playing field for all.

International trade and investment, within multilateral rules, has created an international economic order that has benefitted our economies. This order should be adapted and modernised to ensure it continues to work for all in the 21st Century. We strongly support the World Trade Organisation, its new leadership, and efforts to deliver concrete outcomes and a pathway for meaningful reform.

We support the conclusion of negotiations for a comprehensive, balanced, sustainable and ambitious European Union-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. We are convinced that it will provide increased opportunities for trade and investment between our two countries, and could serve as a new-generation model for future free trade agreements in the world. 

We will foster greater knowledge and interaction between our respective business communities, including through two-way business delegation missions where possible. We will encourage continued trade and investment links between our two countries and a free flow of visits and contacts whenever possible.

Digital technologies are having far-reaching impacts on our economies and societies. We will work together, including within the Christchurch Call to Action and in other relevant fora, to promote a free, open and secure internet, to advance a fair, inclusive digital transformation. We will strive to reach an ambitious, consensus-based solution on digital taxation within the OECD that ensures a fairer global fiscal regime.

**5. COVID-19 Recovery**

Together we will continue to advocate for sufficient production and equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines. We will continue to support the ACT-Accelerator and the COVAX facility, including through donating vaccines from our respective domestic portfolios. The world needs to increase global vaccine production capacity, ensure smooth supply chains, and remove trade barriers and logistical hurdles, ensuring universal access to vaccines as quickly as possible. Intellectual property rights should be part of the solution towards achieving universal access to vaccines, including through a temporary waiver.

Our efforts in this respect will also benefit the access to vaccines for other transmissible diseases. Through our joint constituency of the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), we will continue to promote access to vaccines for children in the world’s least developed countries. Together we will focus in particular on gender equality, vulnerable groups, Small Island Developing States, fragile states, and reducing barriers to vaccine access.

The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased inequalities and fostered more geo-economic competition. In the short term, restoring a safe international mobility and ensuring adequate support to vulnerable sectors particularly hit by the crisis are key priorities. The impact of the pandemic also provides an opportunity to build back better. Together, we will therefore advocate for a comprehensive green economic recovery that focuses on building sustainable, inclusive, carbon neutral, digital economies.

This is also the moment to strengthen the global health system, adapting it to ensure the world is better prepared for any future global health emergency. We will closely consider the recommendations made in the final report of the Independent Panel commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Maintaining open trade flows in COVID-19 related essential goods is in our mutual interest, in particular critical medical supplies, vaccines and vaccine-related equipment.  We will share experience and knowledge on trade in COVID-19 related goods and on strengthening the future resilience of our global supply chain connections.

**6. Climate Change and Environment**

As we get ready for what must be an ambitious COP 26, we will deepen dialogue and our cooperation on climate change, recognising the urgency of climate action to meet the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal, including jointly advocating for international action to limit temperature to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

We will continue to work closely through the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, and to promote action on agricultural emissions through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. We reaffirm our joint commitment to rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, recalling in particular Sustainable Development Goal target 12.C.

**7. Antarctica and oceans**

We will coordinate closely on Antarctic issues, including the advancement of our shared focus on conservation of Antarctic marine ecosystems. We welcome the announcement of an international meeting in Madrid in October 2021 to mark the 30th Anniversary of the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection. We will also continue to coordinate closely on issues related to the ocean, including seabird conservation, particularly albatross and petrels.

**8. People to people, culture, education and sports**

Spain and New Zealand are committed to advocating for gender equality and women’s empowerment; this includes promoting women’s leadership in our societies and their full participation in politics and institutions.

Both our countries cherish the common values that sport helps to promote in our communities: team building, fair play, mutual respect, inclusivity, open participation and common rules. We recognise the contribution of sport to the relationship between our two countries and our people. We will make the most of opportunities to promote these shared values together through events such as FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023, being co-hosted in New Zealand, and the Ocean Race 2022 that will start from Spain.

The Memorandum of Cooperation on Education of 2010 has been the base for the promotion of Spanish language in New Zealand and for engagement of New Zealand in English language programmes in Spain. We will continue to explore options for more cooperation in the field of language education, exchange of language and culture assistants and support the work of the Cervantes Institute, the Prince of Asturias Chair at the University of Auckland, and Casa Asia, to further mutual cultural interaction and enrichment.

We are also committed to fostering better mutual understanding through travel and contacts, especially among young people.
