New Zealand’s Quarantine Free Travel from New South Wales to New Zealand will be paused while the source of infection of new cases announced in Sydney is investigated, says COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins.

There are 10 new community cases of COVID-19 today in New South Wales, taking the Australian State’s recent community cases linked to the cluster to 21.

The pause will come into force from 11.59pm NZT and be in place for 72 hours initially. As with previous pauses, it will be under constant review.

This decision follows a public health assessment today which determined that while the overall risk to public health in New Zealand currently remains low, there are still several unknowns, including a case that was infectious while in the Sydney community and a primary school age child with no clear link established at present.

The Government is taking a precautionary approach and will review the decision to pause again on Thursday.

Anyone who has only been in Norfolk Island and not in NSW is still eligible for Quarantine Free Travel.

**Updated advice for travellers from New South Wales**

New Zealand health officials are also updating their advice for anyone already in New Zealand who has recently visited Sydney’s Westfield Bondi Junction mall.

It follows a new case of COVID-19 reported in Sydney today, connected to the busy mall, which is popular with locals and New Zealand visitors.

In line with NSW Health’s advice: anyone in New Zealand who was at Westfield Bondi Junction (including the car park) in Sydney’s Bondi Junction at any time between 12 June and 18 June should contact Healthline on 0800 358 5453, get tested and stay at home until they get a negative test result, or remain isolated if instructed.

NSW public health officials are continuing to add new locations of interest. Anyone who has been in Sydney since 11 June should check [the NSW Health website.](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/nsw-covid-19-case-locations-map)

Anyone at these locations of interest at the specified times should call Healthline on 0800 358 5453, get tested and self-isolate until they return a negative result.

Anyone who was at a location of interest at the specified times also cannot travel to New Zealand within 14 days of the exposure event.

This is also a reminder that anyone with symptoms, not just recent travellers, should get tested for COVID-19.

New Zealand public health officials are regularly reviewing developments in the Australian State and advice will be updated, if and when required.
