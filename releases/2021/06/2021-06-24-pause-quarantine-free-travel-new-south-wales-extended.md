The pause on Quarantine Free Travel from New South Wales to New Zealand will continue for a further 12 days, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. 

There are now 36 recent community cases of COVID-19 in New South Wales – including four not yet linked to the existing outbreak that are urgently being investigated by Australian health officials.

This decision follows a further public health assessment today in which officials consider a range of factors – whether any new cases are identified, the results from COVID-19 testing of any contacts identified and from the wider Sydney community.

The Government strongly believes a cautious approach is the best course of action while these investigations continue.

New Zealand public health staff remain in close contact with New South Wales authorities about the actions being taken in Sydney, and will review the decision to continue the pause late next week.

Anyone who has only been in Norfolk Island and not elsewhere in New South Wales is still eligible for Quarantine Free Travel.

However anyone who was at a location of interest at the specified times cannot travel to New Zealand within 14 days of the exposure event. This applies to all travellers, no matter what Australian State or Territory they are departing from.

Passengers will be asked on departure from Australia by their airline and on arrival in New Zealand by Customs at the eGate if they have been at a location of interest.  

All travellers to New Zealand must also [complete the Nau Mai Ra travel declaration](https://naumaira.covid19.govt.nz/) which allows contact tracers to get in touch with them if they’ve been in an affected area at the relevant time but have since travelled to New Zealand.

**Advice for travellers from New South Wales already in New Zealand**

New Zealand health officials recently [updated their advice](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/contact-tracing-covid-19/quarantine-free-travel-contact-tracing-locations-interest) for anyone already in New Zealand who has recently visited Sydney’s Westfield Bondi Junction mall.

New South Wales public health officials are continuing to add new locations of interest. Anyone who has been in Sydney since 11 June should check [the NSW Health website.](https://scanmail.trustwave.com/?c=15517&d=w6HR4LxQ_LOUgO_o_jEAegfWf6lQu90T3z62fz-Lfw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsw.gov.au%2Fcovid-19%2Fnsw-covid-19-case-locations-map)

Anyone who has been at these locations of interest at the specified times should call Healthline on 0800 358 5453, get tested and self-isolate until they return a negative result.
