Following two unlinked community cases reported in the Far North, the north of the region will move to Alert Level 3 from 11:59 tonight, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today. 

“The Alert Level boundary runs through the centre of Hokianga Harbour to Mangamuka Junction on SH 1, east to Kaeo on SH 10, and then to just east of the entrance to Whangaroa Harbour,” Chris Hipkins said.

“People must stay home in their bubble, monitor for symptoms and get tested if they are feeling unwell. It is recommended to wear a face covering when leaving the house and use the NZ COVID Tracer App to record any movements.”

While today’s reported case is a household contact of a case reported yesterday, both cases are unlinked to the other cases in Northland at this stage.

Contact tracing and public health interviews are underway to identify any locations of interest and close contacts, and Northlanders are urged to check the [Ministry of Health website](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/contact-tracing-covid-19/covid-19-contact-tracing-locations-interest) for updates on locations of interest.

“Vaccination rates for Northland are currently at 79% for first doses, and 65% for second doses. These rates are still not high enough for us to be confident that communities would be sufficiently protected in the case of a wider outbreak,” Chris Hipkins said. 

“In Northland yesterday 1,125 tests were processed and 1,161 vaccinations provided. We want these numbers to rise, and encourage Northlanders to use this time to go and get vaccinated.

“If you have had your first shot already, you can get your second shot after 3 weeks.

“If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, even if these are mild, get tested as soon as possible.”
