Whānau and communities affected by current COVID-19 alert levels are being encouraged to access support available through the Ministry of Social Development and Whānau Ora.

“Government is continuing to move hard and early to stomp out COVID-19 from our communities,” Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni said. “This includes working closely with social service, community, iwi and Whānau Ora organisations who are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities impacted by the current alert level change.”

“The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) remain in contact with social service providers across the country and have provided guidance around who can operate at Alert Level 4, how to do this safely and within the boundaries of public health guidelines.

“One area we’re keeping a watchful eye on is foodbanks to ensure they’re able to get food out to vulnerable whānau and communities. Government has provided further funding to the New Zealand Food Network to support regional food hubs across the country.

“While people can get financial assistance for food through Work and Income, they can also make online orders and arrangements through local supermarkets and their Priority Assistance Service.

“MSD are making changes to make things as seamless as possible for people needing assistance and support. For example, deferring reviews of clients’ circumstances, streamlining application and verification processes, and removing the need for existing clients to provide medical certificates to continue their eligibility for a main benefit. Operating hours for the general enquiries phone line has also been extended this weekend.

“While MSD’s service centres are closed at Alert Level 4, people can continue to get in touch through MyMSD or by phoning 0800 559 009. Clients have been e-mailed to reassure them regular payments will continue.” Carmel Sepuloni said.

Minister for Whānau Ora Peeni Henare said the Whānau Ora provider network have once again seamlessly stepped up to support whānau and their communities.

“During our earlier lockdowns, the Whānau Ora provider network did an amazing job to help whānau with kai, heating, communications, connectivity and other supports. They have again mobilised to provide support to whānau across the motu overnight.” Peeni Henare said.
