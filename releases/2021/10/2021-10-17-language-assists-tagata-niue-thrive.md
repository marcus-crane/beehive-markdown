Despite the uncertain times we face with the challenges of COVID-19, our cultural knowledge, values and language remain constant, helping us progress towards goals in life, said  the Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

This year, the Niuean community in New Zealand decided on the theme, “Kia tupuolaola e moui he Tagata Niue” which means “May the Tagata Niue thrive” for Faahi tapu he Vagahau Niue – Niue Language Week 2021.

The theme stems from the umbrella concept of wellbeing, for this year’s nine Pacific Language Weeks.“If we look at the challenges which our people have faced due to the impact of the global pandemic, it can be completely overwhelming,” Aupito William Sio said.

“However, if we turn to what is constant in our lives, which for Pacific peoples is faith, cultural knowledge, values and language, the unknown doesn’t seem so daunting.

“By combining the complex elements of spiritual, emotional, physical and social wellness, it ensures prosperity and wealth in the home, community and nation.

“It is vital people develop and embrace goals and opportunities despite the distractions of life.

“Instead of worrying about what we cannot control, we look to what we can, and we can start to move forward again, and even thrive,” Aupito William Sio said.

Niue Language Week is the second to last of the 2021 Pacific Language Weeks series and activities and events will be delivered online due to recent COVID-19 restrictions.

Hosted by Vagahau Niue Trust, Niue Language Week runs from the 17 October and concludes on the 23 October and will be officially launched online today at 5pm. Go to: [https://fb.me/e/1rOAvqO95](https://fb.me/e/1rOAvqO95)

The number of people in New Zealand, who identify as Niuean is 30,867, according to the 2018 Census, with the population increasing steadily over the past two decades.

“We are inspired by Niue achieving 97% vaccination of its eligible population. Following the leadership of our families and friends in Niue, I encourage the Niueans of Aotearoa to take up your COVID-19 vaccination. Do it to keep yourselves, your families and communities safe.

“With more Niueans living in Aotearoa than in Niue, revitalising the culture and language is more crucial now than ever,” said Aupito William Sio.
