The Government is providing $5.3 million to assist sport and recreation organisations in the Auckland region financially affected by the latest lockdown.

“The investment is being provided through Sport NZ from the $265 million Sport Recovery Package announced in Budget 2020,” Grant Robertson said.

The new recovery investment is being made via existing Sport NZ partners and comprises:

- Up to $3 million for Aktive Auckland Sport and Recreation to support local and regional sport and recreation organisations across the Auckland Region
- Up to $1.5 million for Recreation Aotearoa to support outdoor education providers experiencing reductions in revenue due to the cancellation of school-group activities at Alert Levels 3 and 4
- An additional $800,000 for Variety NZ to support tamariki and rangatahi in financial need through the existing Active Me – Kia Tū initiative.

“The cancellation of competitions and other fundraising events impact a significant source of income for clubs and regional bodies in the Auckland region.

“Much of this $5.3 million investment will help with fixed administration and operating costs to help organisations and providers remain viable.

“It will provide some much-needed financial assistance to clubs, regional bodies and whānau across the Auckland region so Aucklanders can continue to maintain their wellbeing through physical activity,” Grant Robertson said.
