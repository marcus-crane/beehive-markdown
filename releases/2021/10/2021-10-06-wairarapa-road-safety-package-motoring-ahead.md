A package of improvements to make State Highway 2 in Wairarapa safer has been given the green light by Waka Kotahi, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced today.

Dependent on property acquisition and consents, construction will begin early next year on package of safety improvements on SH2 between Masterton and Carterton. This includes flexible safety barriers, pedestrian crossings for school children, walking and cycling paths, road widening, new signage and new roundabouts at Ngaumutawa Road, Norfolk Road and East Taratahi/Wiltons Road.

Michael Wood said making our roads safer is a priority for the Government.

“It’s good news for locals that SH2 will be made a lot safer with these common-sense upgrades. The reality is improvements like safety barriers and roundabouts help save lives and prevent serious injuries.

“Through our safety strategy *[Road to Zero](https://www.transport.govt.nz/area-of-interest/safety/road-to-zero/)*, we’re taking a balanced approach and investing in road policing, driver education, safety infrastructure and safer speeds to help Kiwis get around safely,” Michael Wood said.

“Wairarapa has been screaming out for roundabouts at the Ngaumutawa Road, Norfolk Road and Wiltons Road intersections for years,” said Wairarapa MP Kieran McAnulty.

“I’m really pleased that the voice of our community has been heard and these important safety improvements will be going ahead. We campaigned on these at the last election and now we’re delivering them.

“Wairarapa is a growing region and more people are using this road every day so these safety improvements are critical. No matter where they’re going, everyone travelling on our roads should be able to get to their destination and back safely,” Kieran McAnulty said.

Waka Kotahi is currently working with landowners and communities to seek feedback on the current designs of the $24.8 million package of improvements, before going out to tender later this year. Construction is expected to take two years.
