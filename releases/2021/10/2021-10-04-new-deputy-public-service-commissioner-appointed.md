Minister for the Public Service Chris Hipkins today announced the appointment of Heather Baggott as the second Deputy Public Service Commissioner.

Ms Baggott is the Deputy Commissioner, Leadership, Diversity and Inclusion at the Public Service Commission, a position she has held since July 2020.

The Deputy Public Service Commissioner works closely with the Public Service Commissioner to provide leadership and oversight of the Public Service. The new Deputy Public Service Commissioner would have a particular focus on the Māori-Crown relations area.

Chris Hipkins said Ms Baggott brings experience to ensure the Public Service delivers for New Zealanders and to the Government’s priorities.

“Ms Baggott is a trusted and dedicated public service leader who embodies the spirit of service,” Chris Hipkins said.

Ms Baggott (Ngati Maniapoto, Te Atiawa) played key roles in codifying, for the first time, the Crown-Māori relationship in the Public Service Act 2020, and supported the establishment of Te Arawhiti and the strategic repositioning of Te Puni Kōkiri in their respective system leadership roles.

**Notes to the editor:**

Ms Baggott has held a range of relevant roles, including at the Office of Treaty Settlements, the Special Jurisdictions Group at the Ministry of Justice, and at the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

She holds a Bachelor of Management Studies (First Class Honours) from the University of Waikato. She has been appointed for five years from 18 October 2021.

There are two statutory Deputy Public Service Commissioners, Helene Quilter and Ms Baggott. Deputy Public Service Commissioners are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under the Public Service Act 2020. Subject to the direction of the Public Service Commission, the Deputy Public Service Commissioner has all the functions, duties and powers of the Commissioner.
