Improvements to child and maternity facilities at Timaru Hospital are well underway, and the next stage of the project will begin next month.

Health Minister Andrew Little visited Timaru Hospital today to view progress onsite.

“The improvements are part of South Canterbury DHB’s four-year refurbishment project and will create a new hub for children and women’s care on a single floor within the hospital,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.

“The refurbishment of maternity, paediatrics and the new transitional care unit will improve access to healthcare, bring services closer to home for many families, and provide a better working environment for staff to deliver greater care for mums and babies.”

Construction on the refurbishment began in May and will see an additional birthing room and assessment unit. Construction starts on the new transitional care unit in November.

“The new purpose-built transitional care unit will mean preterm babies that are born at 34 weeks would not have to be transferred to Canterbury District Health Board, and South Canterbury women can remain in their community,” Andrew Little said.

The project received $2 million in funding through the New Zealand Upgrade Programme’s Health Infrastructure Package in January 2020.

While COVID-19 had caused some disruption to the build, construction team is still on track to complete improvements by August 2022.
