Students most in need of extra help in the classroom are the focus of a new review that gets under way today, Associate Education Minister Jan Tinetti says.

About 50,000-80,000 children and young people are expected to benefit from a Ministry of Education review into Highest Need Learners that will help to ensure all young people are receiving the education they deserve.

“All our tamariki should be receiving the best education possible. As a teacher I saw first-hand the importance of supporting kids with high needs. Good support ensures our kids can fulfil their potential, which is the goal of education,” Minister Tinetti, a former primary school principal and educator, said.

“The purpose of the review is to ensure that children and young people with the highest needs for learning supports, receive the right support when they need it, and for as long as they need it. The Government is committed to barrier-free access to education that includes all students.

“I look forward to seeing a range of options for improvements to supporting our tamariki next year,” Jan Tinetti said.

Current services and supports will remain in place until the Review is completed toward the end of 2022, its recommendations considered, and the decisions subsequently implemented.
