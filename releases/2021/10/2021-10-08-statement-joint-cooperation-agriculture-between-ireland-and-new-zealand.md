8 October 2021 - Dublin, Ireland

Agriculture plays an important role in the economic, social, environmental, and cultural wellbeing of Ireland and New Zealand. We are focused on increasing the productivity, inclusivity, and resilience of our respective primary sectors. As agri-food exporting nations, we also share a commitment to a fair, rules-based global trading system and acknowledge the role of inclusive and progressive trade in supporting all pillars of sustainable development.

The governments of Ireland and New Zealand recognise the urgent need to find solutions that address the impact of agricultural production systems on the climate, water quality, and biodiversity. No country can address these existential challenges alone. Ireland and New Zealand recognise that active global partnerships are an integral part of achieving our domestic and global ambitions. Building on our strong history of bilateral cooperation in agriculture, this statement re-affirms the agricultural cooperation partnership between Ireland and New Zealand.

To promote the development of this partnership, we affirm that officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM), and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), will meet annually for agriculture policy dialogues.

Building on the bilateral dialogues held on the 28th and 29th of September 2021, officials from DAFM and MPI will develop a joint cooperation agenda around the central mission of Advancing a Progressive International Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture.

The actions under the joint agenda will build on already strong technical and research partnerships, including on the measurement and reduction of biogenic methane emissions through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA) where we are strong collaborators.

The agenda will also seek to develop our bi-lateral cooperation across international fora such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), and under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Looking beyond the recent United Nations Food Systems Summit, Ireland and New Zealand will also seek to cooperate on the important task of promoting and implementing food systems approaches, investing in the sustainability of our food for future generations.
