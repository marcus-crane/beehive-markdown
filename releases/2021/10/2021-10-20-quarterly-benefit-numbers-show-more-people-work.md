Benefit figures released today show a year on year fall of 9,807 people receiving a Main Benefit in the September Quarter.

“The Government is working hard to tackle COVID-19 and it is clear our strong response to the initial outbreak has created a resilient labour market which is providing opportunities for people to move into work,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“It has been a tough couple of months as our nation responds to the Delta outbreak, but today’s figures are encouraging.

“One of the highlights is the record number of people who moved off a Main Benefit and into work for a September Quarter. The highest since records began in 1996, building on the trend we saw in MSD’s March and June reporting.

“The quarter also saw a record number of Māori find work with 9,753 moving off a benefit and into work. This is almost 3,000 higher than the previous record September Quarter in 2002.

“Another highlight is that a third of people who found work, had been receiving a Benefit for more than a year, showing the Government’s investment in front-line work focused case management is working.

“We are not out of the woods and we are keeping a close watch on the Delta outbreak.  We will respond with targeted interventions when we see needs arise,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
