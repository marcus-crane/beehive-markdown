Further Government support for New Zealand’s longest-standing sustainable business organisation will open up opportunities for dozens of workers impacted by COVID-19 to jump start a nature-based career, Conservation Minister Kiri Allan says.

Partnering to Plant Aotearoa, led by the Sustainable Business Network (SBN), is a collaboration with iwi, hapū and local community groups to undertake small-scale but valuable ecological restoration.

“Since September 2020, the project has delivered $2.5 million in Jobs for Nature funding to ten community-based conservation partners, creating over 120 full and part-time employment opportunities in areas where there have been significant job losses,” Kiri Allan said.

“A further $2.5million will allow SBN to bring two more partner groups on board, opening up 60 jobs across the country and generating more than 53,000 hours of conservation work.

“We know many young people and part-timers have been affected by these uncertain times. Partnering to Plant specifically targets both of those groups and is aimed at helping them get a foot-hold in a job that could lead on to a career in conservation.

“The work includes extensive planting, weeding and fencing to improve habitat and food sources for native species, protect endangered species from predators, and improve water and air quality.

“This is about empowering action across Aotearoa New Zealand in a way that addresses the direct pressures our biodiversity faces.

“Supporting work which provides positive impacts on conservation, keeps boots on the ground and aids in our economic recovery, is what our Jobs for Nature programme is all about.

“We’re proud to support this project and an organisation whose goals align with the kaupapa of Jobs for Nature in supporting communities to be champions for the environment,” Kiri Allan said.
