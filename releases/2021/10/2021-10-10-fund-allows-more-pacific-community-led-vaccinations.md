The Government has made $1.1 million available through ‘The Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund’ to directly support Pacific community-led initiatives towards increasing vaccinations, said Associate Minister of Health, Aupito William Sio.

“The best way to protect our communities from COVID-19 is through vaccination.

“We need to explore every avenue to ensure we can vaccinate every eligible person in our Pacific communities. That means allowing our communities to take greater ownership to reach those people we are having difficulty in reaching. These are people some community and church organisations are engaging with on a day-by-day basis.”

National vaccination figures for Pacific peoples show that 75 per cent have received their first dose, and 48 per cent are fully vaccinated.

“I’m proud of the great response to the vaccination clinics delivered through Pacific models of care. But there is still so much more we need to do to reach at least 90 percent to protect our Pacific communities,” said Aupito William Sio.

“The Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund, being administered through The Cause Collective, is available mainly for Pacific community groups in the Auckland region, where most of our Pacific population live. However, applications from outside the region may also be considered.

“Pacific ethnic specific community groups, Pacific churches, Pacific youth groups and other groups that work with marginalised Pacific communities will be eligible to apply from $500 up to $40,000 from the Prepare Pacific Vaccination Fund. Successful initiatives will be expected to demonstrate the ability to increase vaccinations for Pacific peoples.”

The Prepare Pacific Vaccination Fund is now open and will run until 30 June 2022 or when funds have been fully distributed. Go to [https://preparepacific.nz/resources/community-vaccination-fund/](https://preparepacific.nz/resources/community-vaccination-fund/).

“Through this fund we are asking our Pacific communities to answer our call, to rise up to the challenge as you’ve done so many times before and play your part in keeping us all safe from COVID-19,” said Aupito William Sio.
