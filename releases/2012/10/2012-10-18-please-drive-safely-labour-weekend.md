Associate Minister of Transport Simon Bridges is urging drivers to take care this holiday weekend.

“Labour Day weekend is traditionally a busy one so it’s important to remember that being safe on the roads is everyone’s responsibility.”

Last year’s toll was high – there were eight deaths, 17 serious injuries and 92 minor injuries.

“Most crashes are caused by preventable actions.  If drivers are focused, drive to the conditions and obey speed limits then our holiday roads will be much safer.”

Police will be out in force and will again be focusing on reduced speed tolerances of no more than 4km/hr over all permanently posted speed limits and targeting safe following distances.

“Please be careful, patient and respectful of other motorists,” says Mr Bridges.

Labour Day weekend 2012 officially starts at 4pm on Friday 19 October and ends at 6am on Tuesday 23 October.
