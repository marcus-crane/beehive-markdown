Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says New Zealand's response to disaster management is setting a benchmark for countries in Asia and the Pacific.

Mr Tremain has just attended the Fifth Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Indonesia.  The conference was hosted by the Government of Indonesia and the United Nations.

"We shared the lessons learnt from the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011, and explained the structure we use for disaster risk management," says Mr Tremain.

"New Zealand has a world leading disaster management system and we agreed to look for ways in which we can help the United Nations develop models and practical examples that will promote disaster resilience.

"A declaration was agreed on by 62 countries that committed to integrate local level disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into their national development planning.

"New Zealand provides direct support for disaster reduction and response through our overseas development assistance programmes. We reaffirmed our commitment to the Hyogo Framework for Action, to the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre in Indonesia and to Project Rebuild in the Philippines."
