Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee is applauding the success of the new AMI Stadium in Christchurch, with figures following Tuesday night's All Whites versus Tahiti football match showing over 200,000 tickets have been sold since the venue's launch in March.

"For a city of some 380,000 people this is a truly heartening response, which proves the importance of delivering a multi-use facility at a time when the community is picking itself up and moving on from the earthquakes," Mr Brownlee says.

"We always said the new stadium would be multi-use, and so it has proved, with rugby union – including a great All Blacks' test – rugby league, football, and now the summer concert season on our doorstep.

"The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) also hosted 20,000 Cantabrians to a hugely enjoyable free community day in April," Mr Brownlee says.

In two weeks' time, on Saturday 3 November, the new AMI Stadium will also host ‘The Concert', which is the latest positive idea from Christchurch's Sam Johnson, founder of the Student Volunteer Army.

"Sam's goal of getting 10,000 people to do 40,000 hours of volunteering in the community, for which they'll get a well-earned pat on the back with attendance at Christchurch's largest music event of 2012, is a superb concept," Mr Brownlee says.

"It's not too late for people to register their volunteer work or pledge to do some community service following The Concert, so I urge Cantabrians to get involved in helping the community, the recovery, and have a great day out at their stadium."
