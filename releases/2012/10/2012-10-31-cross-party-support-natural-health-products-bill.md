The Natural Health Products Bill has been reported back to Parliament with the support of all parties on the Health Select Committee.

Health Minister Tony Ryall is pleased with progress on the bill, which will provide regulation of commercial natural health products, such as vitamin supplements, Echinacea and fish oil.

“New Zealanders can continue to support and manage their own health as they do now, but the bill will ensure the natural health products they buy are safe, the labels are accurate and the claims the products make, such as ‘will improve your immunity’, are true,” Mr Ryall said.

“This low cost, low bureaucracy regulation will give the public greater confidence about the safety and integrity of natural health products.”

Mr Ryall acknowledged the cooperation of the Green Party in the development of the Bill which was reported back unanimously.

Green Party Natural Health spokesperson Mojo Mathers said, “The Bill brings in a good balance between light handed regulation and protecting consumers.”

“The schedule of approved pharmacopeia in the Bill will make the process of approving traditional claims very straightforward for many natural health products.

“I’m pleased that products prepared as part of traditional medicine practice such as Rongoa are exempted.”

Only commercial products will be affected – people can continue to prepare home remedies.

The Government and the Green Party also acknowledged the support of the Labour Party.

The detailed regulatory work will be undertaken in consultation with the industry, and public. As part of the memorandum of understanding agreement, the Government has also agreed the Green Party will be involved at every stage of the development of these regulations.
