Prime Minister John Key will host the President of the Philippines for discussions on two-way trade and other bilateral matters later this month.

President Benigno Aquino III will be accompanied by Secretary of Foreign Affairs Albert del Rosario, other members of the President’s Cabinet and a large trade delegation.

“I am delighted to welcome President Aquino on his first visit to New Zealand, particularly as our countries share so many interests, including as members of regional forums such as APEC and the East Asia Summit,” says Mr Key.

“The Philippines’ economy is growing strongly, and President Aquino’s administration is making progress to improve the business environment as well as peace and security.  

“Our ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement offers many opportunities for increasing two-way trade. This potential is reinforced by New Zealand’s growing Filipino community.”

The Philippines is an important market for New Zealand dairy exports and it is expected discussions will include how the two countries can collaborate further in dairy development. The geothermal industry, tourism and aviation are also expected to be raised.

President Aquino will be in New Zealand 22-23 October.
