New Zealand and China Customs have agreed to work more closely together to combat the smuggling of pharmaceutical products used to manufacture methamphetamine (‘P’). 

The agreement is the result of talks between Chinese officials and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson during a two-day visit by China Customs.

The two customs administrations are also committed to continuing work to advance further growth in trade.

“The visit of China Customs Vice Minister, Mr Lu Peijun, has reaffirmed the excellent relationship New Zealand has with China Customs in all areas of Customs activity,” Mr Williamson says.

“We have agreed to work closely in areas of intelligence, targeting and operations to combat drug trafficking.  This will result in a better understanding of illicit drug supply and presents the opportunity to disrupt the supply chain from the export end.”

The Minister commends China Customs’ willingness to approach issues that are specific to New Zealand’s trade, and reiterated New Zealand Customs’ willingness to assist China with any issues it has with New Zealand trade.

“We are committed to working together, in practical ways, to streamline processes. The cooperation between customs has helped ensure the success of the Free Trade Agreement,” Mr Williamson says.”
