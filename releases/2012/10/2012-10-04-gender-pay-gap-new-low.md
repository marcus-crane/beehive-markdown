Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew is pleased that the New Zealand Income Survey out today shows the gender pay gap has reached an all-time low.

“The New Zealand Income Survey shows that the gender pay gap has decreased from 9.6 percent to 9.3 percent in the last financial year; the lowest since the NZIS began in 1997,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The economic independence of women is imperative for a healthy economy and a number of recent economic indicators are showing positive signs in spite of continuing global uncertainty.

“Recent GDP results show economic growth of 0.6 per cent for the June 2012 quarter. This takes annual growth to 2.6 per cent – the highest rate since 2007, before the domestic recession and the Global Financial Crisis.

“Our Business Growth Agenda is focusing on making it easier for businesses to access the six key areas they need to grow – capital markets, infrastructure, innovation, skilled and safe workplaces, resources, and export markets.

“Building on these positive signs, we need to ensure women at all stages of their working lives have good choices that will strengthen their ability to be economically independent,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Careers advisors, human resource professionals, and others should help women to be well-informed about their options. Training and education are significant investments for anyone, and pay can vary hugely between occupations.

“This Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand women are able to realise their economic potential by increasing the number of women in education, encouraging a broader range of education and career choices, and removing barriers to women’s participation in work,” she says.
