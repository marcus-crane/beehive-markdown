Prime Minister John Key is saddened at the death today of Sir Wilson Whineray, KNZM, OBE.

Sir Wilson was New Zealand’s longest-serving captain of the All Blacks and a leading businessman and was knighted in 1998 for services to sport and business management.

“Sir Wilson was a great All Black and may have been the greatest captain we ever had,” says Mr Key.

As captain of the All Blacks during the 1960s, Sir Wilson led the country to 41 wins out of 50 games.

“His business acumen was hugely respected as well. He made his mark at APN, the NZ Wool Marketing Corporation, National Bank and Auckland International Airport, although most of us remember his time at the helm of Carter Holt Harvey.

“It is fitting that the only biography of Sir Wilson was titled “A Perfect Gentleman’. He was the rare breed of man whose modesty and humility gave no hint of the greatness he had achieved.

“I knew Sir Wilson and respected him immensely. This is a loss all of New Zealand will feel.”
