Australian Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Hon Joe Ludwig will visit New Zealand for bilateral and primary industries meetings over the next two days.

Hon Ludwig, who will be joined by Primary Industries Ministers from NSW, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory, will meet with Minister Carter this afternoon.

"This visit is a valuable opportunity to discuss two-way trade and issues in the primary sector that affect both Australia and New Zealand," says Mr Carter.

While in Auckland Hon Ludwig will also Chair the Standing Council on Primary Industries Meeting.

"This meeting is attended by Primary Industries Ministers from New Zealand and Australia and allows us to share approaches, ideas, and views on the challenges and opportunities facing the primary industries.

"One of the issues we will discuss is the food sector opportunities available to both countries.

"By focusing on our food industries, New Zealand and Australia have the ability to increase productivity, innovate and add value to the domestic and export sector. There are opportunities in working together.

"We enjoy a strong relationship with Australia, our largest trading partner, and meetings such as this play an important role in enhancing primary sector collaboration between our two countries," Mr Carter says.
