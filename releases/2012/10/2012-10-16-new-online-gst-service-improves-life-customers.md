Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has congratulated Inland Revenue for making it easier for customers to file GST returns online.

“We know a lot of businesses look after their own GST returns, and October is a peak period for small businesses, so it is great timing to launch the smarter service,” Mr Dunne said.

Customers no longer need a document lodgement number (DLN) when they file online and their details will be pre-populated into their online return. All they need to do is fill in their financial details. The smarter online service also:

- Allows customers to register for GST in real time
- Has calculations prepopulated
- Allows customers save a draft and complete at a later date and save an online copy for their records
- Allows customers to receive instant confirmation from IR when they file their return
- Allows customers track a return’s status
- Allows customers to delegate the filing.

To use the service, customers need to be registered for Inland Revenue’s MyIR Online Services.

Once a return is filed online, Inland Revenue will stop sending them paper-based GST returns. Instead they will be notified when their GST return is ready to file within their online account. The improved filing service was in response to customer feedback about the current online GST form,” Mr Dunne said.

“Inland Revenue is working hard to meet changing customer expectations. With more than one million customers registered to do business online, and the improved GST service, Inland Revenue is helping customers complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment,” he said.

Mr Dunne said the latest State Services Commission *Kiwis Count* surveyshowed an increase in public satisfaction with the process of registering a business entity for tax purposes or filing a tax return.

“Around 2000 new customers register for GST every month. Inland Revenue’s goal is to get them online right from the start. These improvements will mean a better online experience for their existing 640,000 GST customers who file about three million returns a year. It will also save them a lot of paper.”

“This is a great example of Inland Revenue moving customers to more cost-effective channels while making it easier for them to self-manage their tax matters online.”
