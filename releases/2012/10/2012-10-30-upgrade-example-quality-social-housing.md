Housing Minister Phil Heatley says the $34.4 million upgrade to Wellington’s Central Park Apartments is a great example of good quality social housing.            

Mr Heatley and Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown reopened the complex this afternoon.

“This complex is now a modern, attractive place to live,” Mr Heatley said.

“Inside, there is new insulation, double glazing, redecorating, better ventilation and heating. The flats are warm and comfortable.”

The upgrade to the Central Park Apartments is part of Wellington City Council’s $400 million joint project with the Government to bring the city’s social housing up to modern standards.  The programme will see 40 housing complexes, 2300 homes and 13 large complexes finished in the first 10 years.

“I’m particularly pleased by the council’s attitude that its social housing is more than housing, it’s about a community of people,” Mr Heatley said.

“Better recreation facilities have been provided here, and there’s also a community centre.  

“It’s great to see tenants closely involved with the projects and helping make Central Park and the other complexes vibrant neighbourhoods.”
