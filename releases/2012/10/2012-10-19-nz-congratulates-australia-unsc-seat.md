Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today congratulated Australia, together with Luxembourg, Korea, Argentina and Rwanda, on their election to non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.

"I have congratulated Foreign Minister Carr on a well-fought campaign, which Australia thoroughly deserved to win," Mr McCully says.

"New Zealand looks forward to working closely with Australia during its two-year tenure on the Security Council.

"New Zealand's bid for a seat in the 2015-16 term is in good shape, and we will continue to campaign energetically."
