The Government will ensure young people are better informed about the skills needed in our economy and what to train for in a new initiative announced as part of the *Skilled and Safe Workplaces* progress report released today.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce announced that the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will produce an annual Occupational Outlook that will clearly set out information collected from industries and businesses on the expected demand for key occupations in the years ahead.

“There has been a shortage of good occupation-level information for students, parents and tertiary providers about where the skill gaps will be and what students need to do to seize those opportunities as they embark on their studies. The Occupational Outlook will help address that gap,” Mr Joyce says.

“Employers have been telling us anecdotally for some time that there is a supply glut in some occupations, and a real shortage in areas like Engineering and ICT. We have addressed the availability of study places with our Budget 2012 increased investment in Engineering courses. The next issue is to help increase student interest in taking the right subjects so they can take up these opportunities.

“The Occupational Outlook will provide information on job prospects for around 40 occupations, as well as setting out likely income ranges, and qualifications needed. This will be very useful information for parents, students, education and training providers, and Government agencies.”

Mr Joyce says the Occupational Outlook will also be used to assist the TEC in making its funding investment decisions. It will sit alongside other government initiatives to ensure New Zealand’s skilled workforce matches what employers need. These include the new Vocational Pathways for 16 and 17 year olds, and reviews of careers information and the industry training sector.
