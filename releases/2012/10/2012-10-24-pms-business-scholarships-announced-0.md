Prime Minister John Key has congratulated the 14 recipients of this year’s Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

The scholarships will allow the recipients to study at prestigious international institutions including Harvard, London Business School, and the INSEAD Business School in Singapore and France. The study programmes range from five days, to several intensive blocks over 17 months.

The scholarships, which were launched in 2010, are designed to build business capability and enhance New Zealand’s opportunity for growth by developing skills in management and international business leadership.

The 14 recipients choose which business programme they attend and each will receive up to $57,000 to cover half the costs of their course and direct expenses.

“These scholarships recognise the skills, achievements and potential of some of the best and brightest business minds in New Zealand.

“It will enable them to fine-tune their skills and increase their knowledge, which will have many positive flow-on effects for Kiwi businesses,” Mr Key says.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says the calibre of applicants was extremely high, which resulted in more scholarships being offered this year than in previous years.

“These prestigious scholarships have been awarded to the up-and-coming stars of the New Zealand business scene and will give them the chance to increase their skills to help them achieve at the highest levels,” Mr Joyce says.
