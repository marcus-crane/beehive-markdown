Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman expresses the Government’s condolences to the family of Private Michael Ross, after Police and Navy divers located his body in Lake Moawhango yesterday.

Private Ross was an experienced serviceman who had served his country well both in New Zealand and in Timor Leste.

“The loss of any of our service people, whether abroad in action, or here at home is tragic.  My thoughts are with Private Ross’s family, friends and colleagues at this sad time.  The only consolation is that he can now be returned to his family.

“My thanks go to the NZ Defence Force and Police personnel who have worked so tirelessly over the last week to locate Private Ross,” Dr Coleman said.
