Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will hold official talks with his counterpart from Burma (Myanmar), Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin, on Monday.

Mr Lwin is visiting New Zealand as part of his country’s increasing international engagement since embarking on fundamental political and economic reforms a year ago.

“New Zealand is greatly encouraged by the nature and scale of the reforms and wants to support them both symbolically and practically. Our discussions over the long weekend are part of that process,” Mr McCully says.

“Several New Zealand businesses already export to Burma, so we are also keen to support further commercial opportunities as the Burmese economy opens up.”

Mr McCully has previously met Mr Lwin at several international meetings and while visiting Naypyitaw and Yangon in March, where he also met President Thein Sein and National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
