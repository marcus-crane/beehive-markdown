Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says today’s announcement of grants by the Canterbury Fund will make a positive difference to Christchurch communities.

A joint partnership between the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Vodafone New Zealand Foundation today announced grants totalling $1.15 million to 66 community organisations in Christchurch.

“I was impressed with the holistic approach taken by the selection team. As well as assisting recreation and sports projects, grants have been given to help fund mentoring and counselling programmes,” says Mr Tremain.   

“The earthquakes had a significant impact on children and many are still dealing with the trauma and loss they experienced.  The grants will have a long term benefit to young people’s health and well-being.

“Restoring community facilities and activities is an important part of getting life back to normal for Cantabrians and rebuilding their city.”

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust was launched by Prime Minister John Key and has raised more than $100 million. The Trust has benefited 125 projects to date, and will release its annual report this week.
