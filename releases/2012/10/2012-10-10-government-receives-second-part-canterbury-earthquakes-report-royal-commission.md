The government has received the second part (volume 4 of 7) of the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by Canterbury Earthquakes, addressing practice and policy issues relating to earthquake-prone buildings, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ministers will now consider the second part of the report and its recommendations. An announcement about the government’s response and about the public release of the report will be made in due course.

The Chair of the Royal Commission, Hon Justice Cooper, presented the second part (volume 4 of 7) of the Royal Commission’s report to the Governor-General in Wellington this morning. The Secretary of Internal Affairs received the report from the Governor-General, and has transmitted it to the office of the Attorney-General, who is the minister responsible for the Royal Commission of Inquiry.

Volumes 1-3 of the final report, were delivered by the Royal Commission of Inquiry in June and were released publicly in August.

Volume 4 of the final report, which has been received today, addresses a range of practice and policy issues relating to earthquake-prone buildings. 

The third part (volumes 5-7) of the final report will be received in November. It will look at remaining issues, including the collapse of the CTV building.

No further comment will be made at this time
