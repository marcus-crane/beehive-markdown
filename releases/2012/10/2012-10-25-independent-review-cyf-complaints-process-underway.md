Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says work on the White Paper for Vulnerable Children is moving ahead with the review of the Child Youth and Family complaints process already underway.

“I felt it was important we get an independent reviewer to look at whether there needs to be an independent complaints body for CYF.”

“This is something that came up at Green Paper meetings and in public submissions, so New Zealanders have been heard and we are responding,” says Mrs Bennett.

Former Police Commissioner Howard Broad has been appointed as the independent reviewer.

“I am confident Mr Broad will bring all of his skill and experience to bear when undertaking this independent review and I look forward to his findings.”

The Terms of Reference include:

- The current arrangements for members of the public to have a complaint about Child, Youth and Family heard
- Provide a view on how the current arrangements are working
- Consider options for independence and report on the financial, legislative and accountability implications of these options.

It will not re-examine any particular case investigated by the Ministry or CYF Complaints Panel.

The review will be completed by the end of 2013.
