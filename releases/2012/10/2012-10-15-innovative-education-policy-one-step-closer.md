The establishment of Partnership Schools|Kura Hourua is one step closer with the introduction of the Education Amendment Bill, Associate Education Minister John Banks said today.

“The Bill sets out the legal framework for this exciting new type of school which is based on international best practice but tailored to New Zealand’s unique education and social environment,” Mr Banks said.

“The Partnership Schools|Kura Hourua model has been developed to assist those students whose needs are not being met in the current education system. 

“We have an education system that is among the best in the world.  Four out of five kids are successfully getting the qualifications they need from school, but the Government’s education plan is about getting five out of five.

“We want all our kids to leave school with the skills they need to reach their potential in the modern economy. That means lifting up those who are being left behind, and encouraging those who are doing well to do even better.

“Partnership Schools|Kura Hourua will have greater flexibility and freedom to innovate, providing more opportunities for passionate educators with fresh ideas to contribute to the success and wellbeing of our children. 

“In exchange for greater freedom, Partnership Schools will be held more accountable for improving student outcomes. There will be strong contract management processes in place, including the possibility of closure.  

“The introduction of the Partnership Schools|Kura Hourua legislation marks a significant day for New Zealand education policy, particularly for those students who are underserved by the current system. 

“It is anticipated that formal expressions of interest for prospective sponsors will be called for in early 2013 with the first Partnership Schools expected to open for the 2014 school year,” Mr Banks said.
