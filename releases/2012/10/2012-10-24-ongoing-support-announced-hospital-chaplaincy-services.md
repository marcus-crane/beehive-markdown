Associate Minister of Health Jo Goodhew today confirmed that the 40 year partnership between the Ministry of Health and the Interchurch Council for Hospital Chaplaincy Trust would continue for a further three years from July 2013. 

Speaking at an annual gathering of the Interchurch Council for Hospital Chaplaincy Aotearoa New Zealand Trust Board, Mrs Goodhew acknowledged the work of the Trust and the value of hospital chaplaincy to patients and their families at what is often a very emotional time in their lives.  

There are currently 88 hospital chaplains available in 48 public hospitals across New Zealand providing ministry to around 360,000 patients every year.  The spiritual support provided is an important contribution to the holistic model of care New Zealand's health services are seeking to provide.

“Chaplaincy services are recognised as contributing to a multi-disciplinary approach in supporting the health and well-being of patients, their families, as well as staff” Mrs Goodhew said.
