Tim Groser, Trade Minister and Minister for Climate Change Issues, departs today for Indonesia and South Korea for trade policy and international climate change discussions.

In Jakarta Mr Groser will attend the World Export Development Forum where he will discuss New Zealand’s experience in meeting the demands of new consumer markets, particularly in emerging and developing economies.

Fellow speakers include Indonesian President H.E. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, World Trade Organisation Director General Pascal Lamy, and Trade and Industry Ministers from Indonesia, Jamaica and South Africa.

In Seoul, Mr Groser will attend a Ministerial meeting in preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha in December.  Mr Groser will lead discussion on a session on shaping the future of the international climate regime.

“We’re in the first phase of negotiations for a global climate change deal that will, for the first time, include all developed and developing countries. We need to learn from experience, look at what’s worked and what hasn’t, so that the new agreement can make a real difference to climate change,” says Mr Groser.

While in Seoul, Mr Groser will also meet with his counterpart, Trade Minister Bark Tae-ho, and key business contacts to promote closer trade and economic linkages between New Zealand and South Korea. 2012 is a "Year of friendship" marking 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
