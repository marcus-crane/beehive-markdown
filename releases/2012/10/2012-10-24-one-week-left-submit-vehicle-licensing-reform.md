People wanting to have their say on Vehicle Licensing Reform have one week left to make a submission before the 31 October deadline, says Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

The Vehicle Licensing Reform project, jointly led by the Ministry of Transport and the NZ Transport Agency, is looking at ways to improve the following systems:

- warrant of fitness and certificate of fitness
- annual vehicle licensing (commonly known as registration)
- transport services licensing

"The Government wants to find simpler and more efficient ways to run these systems while still keeping vehicles and roads safe," says Mr Bridges.

"To date, nearly 2500 submissions have been made showing a high level of public interest in this project. In general, people have welcomed the opportunity to relook at these licensing systems.

"I appreciate the time and effort people are putting into their submissions."

The Ministry of Transport and the NZ Transport Agency have also commissioned independent research about people’s attitudes to warrant of fitness inspections, vehicle maintenance and safety, and annual vehicle licensing.

"This research will add to the information we get through the public submissions process and help us understand how New Zealanders respond to our current vehicle licensing systems and maintain their vehicles. This will add a deeper and more robust picture to help decision making," says Mr Bridges.

This research and a summary of submissions will be released at a later date.
