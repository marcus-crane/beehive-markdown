Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced that from Friday 2 November New Zealanders will pay less for their adult passport and be able to renew their passports online.

“All adult passport applicants whose application is processed in New Zealand will pay less. Prices for adult passports will drop by as much as $28 for renewals using the new online service,” says Mr Tremain.

“Using the Passport Online Renewal Service is a much more convenient way to renew an adult passport.  New Zealanders will be able to simply apply at [www.passports.govt.nz](http://www.passports.govt.nz)  in their own time, anywhere they have internet access.

“The Government is committed to returning savings to passport holders and providing even better public services at lower cost. Our goal is for 70 per cent of New Zealanders’ most common transactions with government to be done online by 2017.”

The price for an adult passport is currently $153.30 (inclusive of GST).  From Friday, the price will drop to:

- adult first-time application (printed form): $140.00
- adult renewal (printed form): $134.50
- adult renewal (online): $124.50

The Passport Online Renewal Service is available for adults over the age of 16 who are renewing their passport.  Almost 70 per cent of passport applications are adult renewals. Children under the age of 16, first-time applicants, applicants who have changed their name since their last passport, and applicants who have an endorsement (e.g. for headdress) on their passport must continue to complete the paper forms.  A full list of eligibility criteria can be found at [www.passports.govt.nz](http://www.passports.govt.nz)
