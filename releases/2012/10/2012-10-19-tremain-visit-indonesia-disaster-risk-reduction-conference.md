Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain will travel to Indonesia next week to attend the Fifth Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction.

The conference is being hosted by the National Agency for Disaster

Management of Indonesia and supported by the United National International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. 

“Nothing tested New Zealand’s disaster management framework like the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011,” says Mr Tremain. 

“The conference provides an opportunity to share New Zealand’s recent experiences in disaster response and discuss the lessons learnt. 

“I will be stressing the importance of communities and organisations investing in risk reduction, being prepared and having an effective emergency plan for themselves.

“New Zealand will also reaffirm its commitment to the Hyogo Framework for Action and highlight aid investment in disaster risk reduction in Asia and the Pacific.”
