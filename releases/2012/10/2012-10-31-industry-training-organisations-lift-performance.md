Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) have lifted their educational performance in 2011, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“Overall, the sector credit achievement rate was 71 per cent in 2011. The programme completion rate was 69 per cent,” Mr Joyce says.

“It is pleasing to see the sector continue to improve its performance. These results show that more trainees are progressing well and obtaining skills which will benefit both industry and the economy as a whole.”

The total number of funded trainees decreased from 168,798 in 2010 to 140,056 in 2011.  Within that total the number of funded trainees who did not earn credits decreased from 74,574 in 2010 to 41,187 in 2011.

“The drop in the number of people listed as trainees between 2010 and 2011 is the result of 2010 changes to operational policy which were designed to ensure funded trainees are actively learning and achieving credits.  There is still more work to do in this area but we are making good progress,” Mr Joyce says.

The Tertiary Education Commission has this year introduced a new data collection system which has provided greater accuracy in monitoring trainees and their performance.  The new system uses NZQA data to independently verify trainee achievement of credits and qualifications.  The change in system means that 2011 achievement data is not directly comparable with previous years; however, it’s a more robust method of measuring achievement.

“I am confident that both Government and industry are getting better value for money on their investment, with more trainees completing their qualifications and making an enhanced contribution to the workplace,” Mr Joyce says.

“The improved performance of ITOs is encouraging as the country looks to this sector to deliver the skilled workers needed to drive the economy and the Canterbury rebuild.”
