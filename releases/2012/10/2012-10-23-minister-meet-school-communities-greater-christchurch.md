Education Minister Hekia Parata has offered to visit all the schools proposed for closure or merger in greater Christchurch.

Ms Parata has written to the 37 schools most affected by the proposals offering to meet with parents and the schools’ communities over the next three weeks.

“I am keen to visit schools, listen to parents and school communities to hear all that they wish to tell me. We want to get this right. 

“Our Government has committed $1 billion to rebuilding the education sector in greater Christchurch over the next 10 years.  It’s not simply about putting back what was there, but focusing on what can be done to achieve better outcomes for children,” Ms Parata says.

Of the 215 schools across greater Christchurch, 13 are proposed for closure and 18 for merger.  It is also proposed five Aranui schools will form a new Year 1-13 campus and two Banks Peninsula schools will become attached to the Akaroa Area School while remaining on their own sites.  

There were already around 5,000 spaces available in greater Christchurch schools before the earthquakes, and a further 4,300 students had not re-enrolled as at July 2012. Five of the 13 schools proposed for closure have less than 50 pupils, two of which have volunteered to close. 

“I absolutely appreciate how difficult this is for the greater Christchurch region. I understand that schools are cornerstones of communities and they have provided a stable environment for children during this difficult time. But, given the extent of the damage and the population movement, the sector simply cannot be returned to how it was.

“We want to continue to work with the sector and communities to ensure schools are in the right locations and that children have access to good, quality education,” Ms Parata says.
