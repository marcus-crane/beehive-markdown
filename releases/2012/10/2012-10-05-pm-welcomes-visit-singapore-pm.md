Prime Minister John Key will host Singapore’s Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong when he visits New Zealand next week.

This is the second visit to New Zealand by Mr Lee since becoming Prime Minister in 2004. Mr Lee also hosted Mr Key when he visited Singapore in April.

Mr Key says New Zealand’s relationship with Singapore is a deep and enduring one, and this visit underscores those close ties.

“Our two countries share common views on many of the issues that confront us regionally and globally. I look forward to having constructive discussions with Prime Minister Lee.

“New Zealand and Singapore share a long history of education and defence cooperation.

“Singapore has also cemented its position as a key regional hub and gateway into Asia, which is particularly important for New Zealand companies.

“The Closer Economic Partnership agreement between New Zealand and Singapore is one of our most comprehensive. This has resulted in an impressive increase in trade between our two countries, and we have built on this with the P4 agreement and our on-going collaboration towards the Trans Pacific Partnership.

“This visit provides an ideal opportunity to reaffirm New Zealand’s close and valued friendship with Singapore and we continue to strengthen our cooperation in a broad range of areas, including science and innovation, where strong collaborative relationships have been developed,” says Mr Key.

Mr Lee arrives in Auckland on Sunday 7 October for his three-day visit, where he will meet the Singaporean community and senior business leaders before travelling to Wellington to meet Mr Key.
