Police Minister Anne Tolley has honoured Police officers who have lost their lives while on duty, at a service to mark Police Remembrance Day.

The service, at the Royal New Zealand Police College in Porirua, also paid tribute to the serving and former Police staff who have died in the last year.

“29 Police officers have died in the line of duty, and they have a special place in the hearts of New Zealanders,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Our Police officers show bravery and dedication every single day to make our communities safer, and the Government appreciates their commitment to serving the public.

“Today’s service was a solemn occasion, but it also gave us the opportunity to celebrate the achievements of the brave men and women of our Police staff.

“It is an honour to be Minister of Police, and this Remembrance Day ensures that the names of our officers who have fallen in the line of duty will never be forgotten.

“I also want to acknowledge the families of our officers, who continue to play such an important role in supporting our staff.”
