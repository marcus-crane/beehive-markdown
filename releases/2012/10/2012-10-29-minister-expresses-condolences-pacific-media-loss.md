Pacific Island Minister Hekia Parata expresses her condolences at the sudden loss of Pacific media leader Tom Etuata, Chief Executive of the Pacific Media Network.

"My thoughts and condolences to the Niuean community, the wider Pacific Island community and in particular, the Etuata family. He will be missed dearly by the strong Pacific media and creative industries in Aotearoa,” says Ms Parata.

Tom Etuata was husband to Viola and father of Summer. His parents are Rev Tom and Akeletama Etuata, great community leaders in Wellington.

“He was a gentleman with great vision.”

“Ki a fakamafana mai he Atua e tau lot omomoko he magaaho nei. May the Lord surround you with an incredible sense of warmth and peace at this time of loss.”

Mr Tom Etuata was born in Niue in May 1966 and started with Radio 531pi in a managerial role in February 2003.

Following the merger of Radio 531pi and Niu FM, Mr Etuata became the Programming Director of Radio 531pi under Pacific Media Network. Mr Etuata then became Acting CEO in 2008 before his appointment as Chief Executive of Pacific Media Network on 8th August 2009.
