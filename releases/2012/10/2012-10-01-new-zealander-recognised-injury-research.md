ACC Minister Judith Collins has today congratulated Emeritus Professor John Langley for his lifetime contribution to injury prevention.

Ms Collins presented Professor Langley with a special award at the 2012 Safety conference in Wellington for his leadership and support in helping build world class injury prevention research, policy and practice.

“I would like to acknowledge and thank Professor Langley for the significant contribution he has made in raising the profile and capability of injury prevention both in New Zealand and overseas, Ms Collins said. 

“Throughout his career, Professor Langley has been a strong advocate for improvements in injury prevention policy to bring our nation’s injury prevention science and practice into the modern age.

“Under his leadership and now with a new generation of researchers, Professor Langley’s work – and his influence on the work of hundreds of others – has had a great impact on injury prevention in New Zealand and around the world.”

Professor Langley has been involved in injury prevention research since 1978. In 1990 he became the Founding Director of the Injury Prevention Research Unit (IPRU), based at the University of Otago.

His research has dealt with a wide range of injury prevention issues including alcohol related harm, young drivers, self-harm and disability following injury.

Professor Langley served for several years as Deputy Editor of Injury Prevention, and in 2004 received the International Distinguished Career Award from Injury Control and Emergency Health Services Section of the American Public Health Association.
