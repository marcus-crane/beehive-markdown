A further 150 schools will be ready for the ultra-fast broadband rollout as the next stage of the School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) is announced.

Associate Minister of Education, Craig Foss says that upgrade work on 150 schools will start by the end of the year.

More than one third of eligible schools have already been upgraded, giving students access to a faster, better quality internet connection.

“Access to fast internet provides 21st century learning environments and gives young learners the best possible access to information from around the world,” says Mr Foss.

“Providing schools with ultra-fast broadband access will undoubtedly result in better educational outcomes for learners. Ensuring that ICT networks in schools are up to standard plays a key role in supporting Government’s education outcomes,” says Mr Foss.
