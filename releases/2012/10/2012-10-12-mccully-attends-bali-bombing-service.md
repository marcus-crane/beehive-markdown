Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today attended a 10th anniversary commemorative service for the victims of the 12 October 2002 Bali bombings.

Mr McCully was present at the service together with New Zealanders affected by the bombings, the New Zealand Ambassador to Indonesia and staff of the New Zealand Embassy.

After the service, Mr McCully hosted a morning tea for some of the New Zealanders injured in the bombings.

“The service was a moving reminder of the tragedy that affected so many nations,” Mr McCully says. 

“I was grateful for the chance to pay respects to New Zealand victims and their families, and to acknowledge once again the terrible losses suffered especially by Australia and Indonesia.”

The commemoration, which was held in the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, was attended by Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott and by former Prime Minister John Howard (who was Prime Minister at the time of the bombings). 

Senior Indonesian dignitaries present included Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi, and Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika.

“In the ten years since this event, Indonesia has come to grips with the problem of home-grown terrorism,” Mr McCully says. 

“All of Indonesia’s friends are delighted that such progress has been made in the campaign to end attacks of this kind.”
