Employers in both the state and private sectors have been recognised today for going the extra mile for staff with significant disabilities.

At today’s Mainstream Awards ceremony in Wellington, the New Zealand Police was named the 2012 employer of the year for providing high quality supported employment.

The awards ceremony – into its 13th year – acknowledges those employers who have created successful job placements for disabled people and encourages other employers to follow suit.

Tariana Turia, Associate Minister for Social Development, presented today’s award. She says Mainstream is an ideal stepping stone for helping those with disabilities to get a job.

“Having a significant disability can make it that much harder to find work. However, more than 210 people are currently in job placements because of Mainstream. “

“This year, since the programme has been opened up to private sector employers, it is now fully subscribed with a waiting list.”

“I believe the awards are that much more meaningful because staff are the ones who nominate their employers,” Ms Turia says.

One of the Mainstream judges said NZ Police was rewarded for its support of a man who had been extremely disabled following a stroke in 2008. The employee says “NZ Police gave me the chance to rebuild my career and my life”.

The Mainstream Employment Programme provides a package of subsidies, training, and other support to help people with significant disabilities get work.
