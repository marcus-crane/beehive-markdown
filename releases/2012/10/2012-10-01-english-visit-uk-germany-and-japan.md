Finance Minister Bill English leaves tonight for overseas meetings with business, investment and political leaders, which will include the annual meeting of International Monetary Fund and World Bank governors in Tokyo.

The meetings will provide another opportunity to assess latest global economic developments and their likely impact on New Zealand.

“It’s clear that the global economic situation remains uncertain and that many countries still face considerable challenges,” Mr English says. “Compared to many developed economies, New Zealand is relatively well placed. But the challenges faced in Europe will have an impact on New Zealand, and I expect that to continue for some time.

“So I’m keen to hear first-hand from the policy makers and business people dealing directly with these deep-seated issues.”

In London this week, Mr English will meet Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, chief secretary to the UK Treasury Danny Alexander and other government figures. He will also attend a number of functions with business and investment leaders.

Next week in Germany, Mr English will visit the Airbus Industries operation in Hamburg and meet New Zealand business people active in Europe.

In Frankfurt, he will visit the European Central Bank, the Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank, before speaking at the opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair on 9 October. New Zealand is guest of honour and has a pavilion at the fair, the world’s largest annual publishing event, which will provide significant business and trade opportunities for this country.

On 11 October, Mr English travels to Tokyo to attend the IMF and World Bank governors’ annual meeting, which will provide another opportunity to assess the global economic situation. He returns to New Zealand on 14 October.
