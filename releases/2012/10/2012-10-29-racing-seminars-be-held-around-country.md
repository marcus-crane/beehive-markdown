Racing Minister Nathan Guy will join New Zealand racing industry leaders at a series of regional meetings this week.

He will be joined by the New Zealand Racing Board’s Chairman Dr Alan Jackson and Chief Executive Chris Bayliss to discuss the issues and opportunities facing racing.

“This is an opportunity for people involved at the grassroots of racing to meet with me and the new leadership team at the Racing Board.
