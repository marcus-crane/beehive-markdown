Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today launched the Christchurch Housing Showcase Design Competition in Christchurch.

Phase one of the competition will seek innovative and exciting designs that can be translated into an inner city housing complex.

“The competition is an opportunity to explore the potential for Christchurch to become an example of modern living and is open to any consortium that includes a professional designer and a property developer,” Mr Williamson says. 

“This competition is about setting a new standard, not just for Christchurch or even New Zealand but inspiring the world to achieve more beautiful and desirable inner cities.  Rebuilding Christchurch is one of the Government’s key priorities”. 

In February 2013, three designs will be chosen to progress to the next phase.  The selected groups will be given $20,000 to develop concepts ready for construction.

The land for the project is in central Christchurch adjacent to Latimer Square, just three blocks from Cathedral Square.

Kevin McCloud, the host of popular international television show Grand Designs, is on the judging panel.

“Having Mr McCloud on the panel highlights that the winner is likely to be an international trend setter,” Mr Williamson says.

The winner will be announced in August 2013, with construction due to commence later in the year.
