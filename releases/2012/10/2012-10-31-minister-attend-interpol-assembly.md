Police and Corrections Minister Anne Tolley is travelling to England and Italy from October 31 to November 8 for discussions on organised crime, the UK sex offenders' register, online child pornography and prisoner rehabilitation.

The Minister will attend the 81st INTERPOL General Assembly in Rome, and take part in ministerial meetings on organised crime and dealing with criminal violence.

Mrs Tolley will meet English Police representatives in London for discussions on the UK sex offenders' register. This will be followed by talks on international cooperation in tackling online child pornography and a visit to the Serco-run Doncaster Prison.

"My meetings in Rome with other ministers will be extremely valuable in sharing information on important issues that we have in common," says Mrs Tolley.

"Organised crime operates across borders and we must do everything we can to tackle it head on, rather than dealing with it in isolation.

"While in London I will receive an update on the UK sex offenders' register. I have already asked Police and Corrections to work together on how a possible New Zealand register could work, and findings from the UK will feed into this.

"I am also looking forward to seeing the successful prisoner rehabilitation programmes at Doncaster Prison, as we continue our own intense focus on reducing reoffending."
