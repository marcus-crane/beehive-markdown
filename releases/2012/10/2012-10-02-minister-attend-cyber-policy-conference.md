Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams leaves today for a cyber policy conference in Budapest.

More than 600 delegates from about 60 countries will be represented at the three-day conference, which will focus building a resilient global digital environment.

More than 2000 New Zealanders are affected by cyber crime every day in the form of computer viruses and malware, credit card fraud, online scams, phishing and identity theft. It is estimated that cyber crime cost New Zealand about $625 million in 2011.

“Governments around the world are increasingly focused on the need for global collaboration to improve cyber security,” Ms Adams says.

“Given the resources being devoted internationally to protecting cyber space, international co-operation will give New Zealand access to the latest thinking and technology that will complement our own work in this area.

“As we increasingly move into a fibre world, we must make sure that we get the balance right between ensuring information, innovation and ideas can continue to flow freely and making cyber space safer and more secure.”

There has been interest from other countries in the lead-up to the conference around what New Zealand has done in investing in cyber security through the Cyber Security Strategy, Ms Adams says.

The strategy provides a framework for industry, the public and government to meet the challenges posed by the increasing and evolving cyber security threats.

Last year, the Government also launched the National Cyber Security Centre, which provides enhanced protection for government and industry against advanced and sophisticated cyber intrusions.

“The work we do around cyber policy is becoming increasingly important for New Zealanders, businesses and government. Cyber intrusions have the potential to impact on the reliability of critical infrastructure, government services, and the economy.”

The conference will also provide an opportunity for Ms Adams to meet with a number of her Ministerial counterparts.
