Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Papua New Guinea today to meet members of the new government, including Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato.

The meetings will include discussions on Asia-Pacific regional issues, trade and investment links, aid, and political and economic developments in Papua New Guinea and Bougainville.

Following the meetings in Port Moresby, Mr McCully will travel to the Highlands region with Mr Pato for a first-hand look at economic development, agriculture and energy opportunities.

"This visit comes at an important juncture in the relationship between Papua New Guinea and New Zealand," Mr McCully says.

"I will be meeting with a new PNG government, formed after elections in July for which New Zealand provided vital logistical support."

Mr McCully will be accompanied by a small business delegation.
