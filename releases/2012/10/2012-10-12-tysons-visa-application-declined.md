Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson has declined to grant a visa that would allow Mike Tyson to enter New Zealand.

"The original decision in respect of Mr Tyson was a finely balanced call based on the letter of support from a board member of the Life Education Trust," Ms Wilkinson says.

"When the Trust withdrew its support I received another application from Mr Tyson's representatives with the support of the Manukau Urban Maori Authority.

"This new application was not enough to get the application over the line and as such, I have declined to grant Mr Tyson a new visa under the Immigration Act 2009.

"I have nothing more to add and therefore will not be making any further comment on this matter."
