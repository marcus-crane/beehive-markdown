The Crown signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Te Rarawa at Te Ahu Centre in Kaitaia today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

"The actions of the Crown left the people of Te Rarawa without sufficient and suitable land for their needs," Mr Finlayson said. "This settlement will allow Te Rarawa to move on with a secure base for economic and social development. It is well overdue, 27 years after the Muriwhenua claims were first lodged."

"This region suffers from some of the most deprived circumstances in the country. This settlement will be a catalyst for progress and development for Te Rarawa."

Te Rarawa will receive commercial redress of $33.84 million, and the return of culturally significant sites such as the Epakauri Conservation Area and Tauroa Point.

The collective redress shared with other Te Hiku iwi includes a co-governance arrangement with Northland Regional Council and the Far North District Council over Te Oneroa-a-Tōhē / Ninety Mile Beach to protect and manage the beach. Te Hiku iwi will be involved in decisions for the protection and development of public conservation lands remaining in Crown ownership through the Korowai for Enhanced Conservation. Also included is an Accord that sets out how the Crown and iwi will work together to transform the social development and wellbeing of Te Hiku whānau, hapū, iwi and wider community.

The deed of settlement will be given effect through legislation.
