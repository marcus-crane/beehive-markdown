Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson leaves for India today to attend the 11th Convention on Biological Diversity in Hyderabad.

"The conference will bring together an estimated 8,000 delegates including representatives from states, non-government organisations, and indigenous people’s groups," Ms Wilkinson says.

"New Zealand has a long history of actively engaging in these meetings. The decisions which come from them cover a wide range of issues, set international environmental standards, and have the potential to cut across our agricultural and trade interests."

Key areas to be discussed include biodiversity and livelihoods; integration of the value of biodiversity in national planning, strategic resource mobilisation and coastal and marine biodiversity.

"These topics are of key relevance to New Zealand. I look forward to taking part in this convention," Ms Wilkinson says.
