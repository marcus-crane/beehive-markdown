The Minister responsible for the Serious Fraud Office, Anne Tolley, has thanked the agency’s outgoing Chief Executive, Adam Feeley, who leaves the position today.

"Early in 2010 the Government promised to rebuild the Serious Fraud Office," says Mrs Tolley.

"We made the resources available to enable the SFO to maintain and build New Zealand's reputation as a safe place to invest and do business.

"Adam Feeley has delivered on this with his hard work and determination.

"He has raised the profile of the SFO, especially in its work prosecuting finance companies, and has sent a strong message that white collar crime is being tackled head-on.

"The SFO has been a real success story under Adam Feeley and I wish him well in his new position as Chief Executive of the Queenstown Lakes District Council."
