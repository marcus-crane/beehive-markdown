The all-of-government contracts for recruitment services have successfully been negotiated with 44 recruitment companies, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

“These contracts will deliver savings of between $5.1 million and $16.8 million a year,” Mr Joyce says.

The final level of savings will depend on how much use individual government agencies make of the contracts.

The contracts are for the supply of recruitment services to government agencies for the hiring of permanent employees, temporary staff and contractors in the corporate, administration and information technology areas.

All government agencies in the wider public sector are eligible to join this procurement arrangement. The more agencies that participate, the greater the savings will be.

“Standardising the way government agencies contract with recruitment providers has benefits for both suppliers and government,” Mr Joyce says.

“Recruitment providers will find it easier and cheaper to interact with government as we have introduced one standard process for engagement, and a consistent set of terms and conditions. 

“This is the latest in a number of all-of-government contracts for services to agencies that are being put in place to bring savings to taxpayers and make it easier for firms to do business with government.”
