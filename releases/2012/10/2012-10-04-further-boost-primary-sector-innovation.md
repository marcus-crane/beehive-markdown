Primary Industries Minister David Carter has welcomed today's announcement of another successful Primary Growth Partnership bid which lifts the total allocated to around $600 million.

PGP is to fund nearly half of a $14.6 million programme led by PGG Wrightson Seeds to develop new pasture and forage crop technologies.

"In just three years, the PGP programme has worked with industry to develop some of the most exciting primary sector research and innovation proposals New Zealand has ever seen," says Mr Carter.

"Co-funding of these projects by government and industry is what PGP is all about – a joint commitment to growing our economy through greater investment in R&D."

The PGP programmes currently underway cover sectors including wool, red meat, dairy, seafood, manuka honey and forestry.

"Every New Zealander stands to gain from innovative investment in the primary sector because our food, fishing, fibre and forestry industries are pivotal to the success of the economy," Mr Carter says.
