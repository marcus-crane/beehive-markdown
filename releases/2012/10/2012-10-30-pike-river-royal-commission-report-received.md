The government has received the report of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ministers will now consider the report and its recommendations. The report will be released, first to victims’ families and then to the public, early next week, along with the government’s response.

The Chair of the Royal Commission, Hon Justice Pankhurst, presented the Royal Commission’s report to the Governor-General in Wellington this afternoon. The Secretary of Internal Affairs received the report from the Governor-General, and has transmitted it to the office of the Attorney-General, who is the minister responsible for the Royal Commission.

No further comment will be made at this time.
