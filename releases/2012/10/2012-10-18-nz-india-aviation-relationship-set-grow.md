Collaboration and trade between New Zealand and India in the aviation sector is set to grow following the signing last night of the India New Zealand Aviation Arrangement in New Delhi, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

The agreement was signed by the New Zealand High Commissioner Jan Henderson and the Indian Secretary of Civil Aviation Shri KN Srivastava and was witnessed by Mr Joyce and India's Minister of Civil Aviation, Sri Ajit Singh.

"India is predicted to jump from the ninth largest civil aviation market in the world to the third by 2020. Domestic traffic in India is expected to grow from 46 million to 90 million passengers per year, with international traffic soaring from 34 million to 90 million in the same period," Mr Joyce says.

"This rapidly growing market provides massive opportunities for New Zealand companies involved in aviation and the signing of the aviation agreement with India will strengthen the business relationship between our two countries.

"It will encourage greater training and technical cooperation in aviation, including in the design and building of airports in India and flight training for Indian students in New Zealand."

Mr Joyce was accompanied on his visit to New Delhi by nine New Zealand aviation companies. He is also in India leading a delegation to lift New Zealand's profile as a destination for international students and to support our tertiary institutions and companies seeking to grow their business in the Indian market.
