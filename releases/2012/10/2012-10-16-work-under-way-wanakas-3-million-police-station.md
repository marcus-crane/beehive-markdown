Police Minister Anne Tolley has today turned the sod for the new Wanaka Police station.

The total cost of the new state of the art facility will be around $3 million, with the station set to open with 18 staff in the middle of 2013.

“This is an exciting time for Police staff and the Wanaka community,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They are soon going to have the modern Police station they deserve.

“This is first and foremost a Police station, but community partners such as LandSAR will also be able to take advantage of the facility for meetings and operational use.

“The modern design and technology is going to provide a real boost for Police and I look forward to returning next year when the station is up and running.”
