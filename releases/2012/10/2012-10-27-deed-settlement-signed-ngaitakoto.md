The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with NgāiTakato at Te Ahu Centre in Kaitaia today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

"NgāiTakoto were left virtually landless by the historical actions of the Crown," Mr Finlayson said. "Finally, the people of NgāiTakoto can look forward to a brighter future - 27 years since the Muriwhenua claims were lodged in the area."

"This area is one of the most deprived in the country. This settlement will provide NgāiTakoto with a strong foundation for economic and social development and will help to transform the social circumstances of their people."

NgāiTakoto will receive commercial redress of $21.04 million, and the return of culturally significant sites such as on Wharemaru/East Beach.

The collective redress that will be shared with other Te Hiku iwi includes a co-governance arrangement with Northland Regional Council and the Far North District Council over Te Oneroa-a-Tōhē / Ninety Mile Beach to protect and manage the beach. Te Hiku iwi will be involved in decisions for the protection and development of public conservation lands remaining in Crown ownership through the Korowai for Enhanced Conservation. Also included is an Accord that sets out how the Crown and iwi will work together to transform the social development and wellbeing of Te Hiku whānau, hapū, iwi and wider community.

The deed of settlement will be given effect through legislation.
