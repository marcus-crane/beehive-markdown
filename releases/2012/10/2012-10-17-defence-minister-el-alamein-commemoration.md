The Defence Minister is travelling to Egypt to attend the 70th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of El Alamein.

Dr Coleman will join a contingent of veterans attending the commemorations of a battle significant for the 2nd New Zealand Division during its World War Two North African campaign.

The Minister will also use the trip to visit the New Zealand contingent serving with the Multinational Force and Observers group (MFO) in the Sinai.

He will also hold talks with the Director General of the MFO, David Satterfield.

During his visit to Cairo Dr Coleman will also meet with the Egyptian Minister of Defence.

While in El Alamein he will visit an Agricultural Development project and also meet with land mine victims.

Dr Coleman left this evening and returns Friday next week.
