Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Malaysia and Indonesia this week for bilateral talks, and to attend the Bali bombing 10th anniversary commemorations.

In Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa will host Mr McCully for the 5th annual Indonesia-New Zealand Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC).

“Building on the momentum created by the Prime Minister’s visit to Jakarta in April, we will discuss developments in agriculture cooperation, the environment, labour, and geothermal energy,” Mr McCully says.

“As Indonesia is a key player in ASEAN, this will also be a valuable opportunity to discuss developments in the region.”

In Kuala Lumpur, Mr McCully will meet Foreign Minister Anifah Aman for formal talks on bilateral and regional issues.

“New Zealand and Malaysia are close friends and I look forward to an update on regional developments from the Minister. Our discussions will include the timetable for New Zealand’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, where our troops serve side by side.”

Mr McCully will also represent New Zealand at a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombing on 12 October. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, former Prime Minister John Howard and Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbot will also be attending.
