Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of former Auckland Grammar School Headmaster John Morris to the Tertiary Education Commission Board.

“Mr Morris brings invaluable educational experience to this role as the founding Chairman of the Association of Cambridge Schools in New Zealand, a former Chairman of the Education Forum, and a member of the University of Auckland Council for seven years­­.

“Mr Morris has also recently been appointed as a member of the Education New Zealand Board. His appointment to the Tertiary Education Commission will strengthen the links between these two boards.” Mr Joyce says.

John Morris replaces Mr Anthony Hall, whose term on the Tertiary Education Commission board has expired.

***Biographical details of the appointee***

Mr Morris was recently appointed to the Education New Zealand board. He served as Headmaster at Auckland Grammar School from July 1993 until his recent resignation from the role. Prior to that Mr Morris was Principal of Takapuna Grammar School for nearly four years. 

Mr Morris is founding Chairman of the Association of Cambridge Schools in New Zealand, a former Chairman of the Education Forum, an education lobby group and think-tank, and was a member of the University of Auckland Council for seven years.

In 1999 he was awarded a Woolf Fisher Fellowship for Outstanding Educational Leadership. He is a frequent speaker at various educational forums, most recently in Westminster speaking on New Zealand education reform and at the New South Wales Principals' Council Conference speaking on leadership in the New Zealand state school. 

As well as a strong academic background, Mr Morris represented New Zealand in soccer and was Chairman of New Zealand Soccer between 2002 and 2008. He was also a long-serving member of the FIFA Technical and Development Committee.
