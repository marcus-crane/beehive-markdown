The contract for the Crown Observer appointed to assist the Christchurch City Council is to end on 1 July, Local Government Minister David Carter said today.

“The appointment of Kerry Marshall in January aimed to rebuild the professional relationships between the Mayor, Councillors and staff and to provide guidance on governance and decision-making.

“The Council and the Crown Observer have worked together positively and I am encouraged by the progress made.

“The Crown Observer has helped Christchurch City Council address ways to improve its working relationships and present a more united front. This has led to the development of a Council Charter signed by the Mayor and all Councillors.”

Mr Carter said the Crown Observer was initially appointed for a six-month term.

“With the positive progress made, Mr Marshall and I have agreed that his contract will end on1 July. I am confident that Christchurch City Council can continue to rebuild public confidence in the authority without additional government-funded support.”

“Effective governance has never been so important in the city’s 160-year history and I thank Mr Marshall for his guidance and assistance,” Mr Carter said.
