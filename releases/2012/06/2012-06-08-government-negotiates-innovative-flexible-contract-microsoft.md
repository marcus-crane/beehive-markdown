Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain announced today that the Department of Internal Affairs has signed a three year agreement with Microsoft which will reduce future licensing costs by up to $119 million.

The agreement, negotiated by the Department of Internal Affairs, will provide a range of products to government agencies on desktop and office productivity software like Windows and Office, and enterprise software like Windows Server, Exchange and SQL Server Database.

“This agreement offers a significant improvement on previous all-of government Microsoft contracts. For example, it offers new and innovative licensing models based on the number of users, rather than the number of devices being licensed,” says Mr Tremain.

“Agencies can also take advantage of subscription based licensing which, through annualised reviews, offers greater flexibility at lower cost compared to traditional licensing models.

“The terms of this new agreement are perfectly aligned with what the Government has been demanding of agencies and the marketplace: innovative solutions for increased agility and helping agencies collaborate through licence sharing. This is an important contributor to better public services and smarter spending of taxpayer money.”
