The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust will donate over $1 million to fund repairs to the damaged Kaiapoi Aquatic Centre, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“The earthquakes have created a shortage of pool spaces in the Canterbury region, so the funding decision is a big boost to the community groups which use this facility,” says Mr Key.

“The generous $1,100,000 grant will go towards replacing the roof and supporting structures, including new foundations, beams, flooring and walls.”

The total repair costs are estimated at $4.9 million, with additional funding being covered by insurance and the Waimakariri District Council.

“Public swimming pools, such as the Kaiapoi Aquatic Centre, are enjoyed by those as young as six months old to more senior members of the community. It will be fantastic to have this valuable facility back up and running.”

The project is expected to be completed within 12-14 months.

While in Canterbury today, Mr Key will also visit the temporary building accommodation project in Rangiora, which received funding from the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust.

“The Trust approved funding of up to $200,000 to support the project. This will give local businesses displaced by the earthquakes the ability to keep trading in their town centre.”

The funding has been used to provide public amenities including lighting, walkways, walkway covers, signage and landscaping for the buildings constructed by the Waimakariri District Council.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal was launched by Mr Key, and is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort for Christchurch and the Canterbury region.
