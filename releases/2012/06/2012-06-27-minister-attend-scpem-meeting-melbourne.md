Police Minister Anne Tolley is to attend a meeting of the Standing Council on Police and Emergency Management (SCPEM) in Melbourne on 28 and 29 June.

Police Ministers and Commissioners from across Australia will be taking part, to discuss and develop an integrated approach to issues of common interest.

“The SCPEM meeting provides a valuable forum for New Zealand and Australia, to discuss a range of issues from crime to disaster management,” says Mrs Tolley.

“There will be a major focus on Australian firearms legislation and organised crime, two areas in which our country has a particular interest.

“I also expect to have discussions on trans-Tasman law enforcement information sharing.”
