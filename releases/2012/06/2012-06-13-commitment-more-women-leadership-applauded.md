The creation of the 25 Percent Group and its commitment to increase the number of women in leadership roles has been applauded by Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew.

“Diversity in leadership is vital for building and sustaining New Zealand’s competitive edge in an increasingly challenging and volatile global market,” Mrs Goodhew said.

Prime Minister John Key and Mrs Goodhew today launched the 25 Percent Group, a group of prominent chairs, chief executives and directors who are actively committed to achieving diversity at senior management level and in New Zealand boardrooms.

The Group’s goal is to achieve 25 per cent female participation on New Zealand boards by 2015.

Group members represent private, publicly-listed and multi-national companies. The Secretary of the Treasury is also a member.

“It speaks volumes that these leaders, from some of New Zealand’s largest companies, believe so strongly in the value of diversity of thought and the positive impact on decision making that they are prepared to dedicate time, energy and resources to championing change – not only within their own companies but among the wider business community,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The Group will encourage companies to think about the range of experience and perspectives they need in their leadership and to seek out more women.

“There is a strong evidence base linking diversity at a board level with stronger organisational performance,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“This initiative is complementary to the Government’s commitment to increase the participation of women in governance to 45 per cent in the public sector.”

At present women hold 9.3 per cent of private sector directorships in New Zealand and 41 per cent of state sector board positions.
