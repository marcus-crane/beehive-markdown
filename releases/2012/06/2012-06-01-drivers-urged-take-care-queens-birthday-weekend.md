Associate Minister of Transport Simon Bridges is urging drivers to take care this Queen’s Birthday weekend.

“Holiday weekends can be a dangerous time on New Zealand roads. There is more traffic, people drive longer distances and there are real dangers from fatigue.

“As people try to pack a lot into their weekend, drivers often do not take proper breaks or get enough sleep.”

Last year there was one fatality – the lowest on record – and 107 injuries, 15 of these serious. Losing control, alcohol and inattention were the three most common factors contributing to the crashes.

“With winter on its way, let’s stay focused, drive to the conditions and be aware of the risks.”

Police will be out in force and will again be enforcing reduced speed tolerances of no more than 4km/h over all permanently posted speed limits.

“Let’s have another holiday weekend like Easter 2012, without a fatality.”

Queen's Birthday weekend 2012 officially starts at 4pm on Friday June 1 and ends at 6am on Tuesday June 5.
