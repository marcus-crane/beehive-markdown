Representatives from three New Zealand fishing companies have met with their newly appointed employees and agents in Shanghai and Guangzhou this week. The businesses are part of the trade mission to China headed by Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

“Māori asset holders represent generations of people and now control 37% of New Zealand’s total fish quota. They are continuing to manage assets innovatively and carefully,” said Dr Sharples.

“Our fishing businesses are already in China, strengthening existing bonds and forging new ones. A relationship is as strong as the people within it and in recent years we have seen Māori relationships with the people of China blossom.”

“Māori New Zealanders share ancient cultural bonds with our kin in Asia and China and we are proud to celebrate them,” said Dr Sharples.

Representatives from Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd, Ngai Tahu Fisheries Ltd and Ngāti Kahungunu are part of the trade mission. The delegation is made up of businesses from a wide range of sectors including, forestry, agribusiness, education, food and beverage, investment and banking.

“Some of our largest Māori-owned farms, iconic tourism ventures and other innovative businesses are joining us – at no small expense to themselves,” said Dr Sharples.

The business delegation is part of an ongoing trade strategy with China, and aligned with NZ Inc. They are meeting government and commercial leaders in Beijing, Guizhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Hong Kong.
