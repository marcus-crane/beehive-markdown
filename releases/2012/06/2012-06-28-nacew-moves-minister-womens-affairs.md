The ministerial responsibility and funding for the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW) is being transferred from Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson to Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew, the two Ministers announced today.

“NACEW is an important advocate for women in the workplace. Since its establishment in 1967, the council has had an instrumental role in influencing changes to legislation and policy to recognise and develop women’s employment in New Zealand,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“NACEW’s input has informed the Government’s planned improvements to flexible working arrangements, and I have been impressed with its recent focus on improving the prospects for young women, particularly Māori and Pacific young women, in employment.

“This transfer aligns NACEW’s work more closely with the portfolio of Women’s Affairs, particularly the priority to improve women’s economic independence.”

Mrs Goodhew said she was delighted with the transfer of NACEW.

“I am pleased to take responsibility for NACEW. I look forward to continuing the strong tradition of leading changes to enhance the opportunities for women’s employment in New Zealand.”

The transfer of NACEW to the Minister of Women’s Affairs will take effect from 1 July 2012. From this date the Ministry of Women’s Affairs will provide support for NACEW.

About NACEW
