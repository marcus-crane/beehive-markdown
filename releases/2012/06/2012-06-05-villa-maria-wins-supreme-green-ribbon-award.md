Environment Minister Amy Adams has tonight announced that Auckland-based winery Villa Maria Estate is the Supreme Winner of the Green Ribbon Awards.

The award was presented to Villa Maria Estate at a ceremony hosted by Ms Adams at Parliament tonight. A further twelve Green Ribbon Awards category winners from around the country were also announced.

"Villa Maria is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its business and has demonstrated that environmental best-practice can boost profitability and be part of everyday business.

“The winery takes a holistic approach to environmental best practice, implementing a variety of effective initiatives nationwide. These range from growing grapes organically through to projects that reduce the environmental effects of operations in the processing plant.

“Specific initiatives include reducing fungicide and pesticide applications, energy conservation, and a comprehensive package of emissions-reduction projects.”

The Green Ribbon Awards recognise the outstanding contributions made by organisations, businesses and communities to protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment, Ms Adams says.

The awards had more than 280 entries this year, an increase of 68 on last year, which shows that more New Zealanders are taking action to improve the environment.

The finalists covered areas such as improving water and air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste, and boosting biodiversity by protecting coasts and oceans.

“Volunteers play a significant role in all of this work, and the awards give them much-deserved public recognition, while providing others with ideas on how to get their initiatives off the ground.”

Increasing the number of native plants, eliminating introduced pests like possums and stoats, and helping native birds and fish re-establish themselves in streams and on farmland were some of the success stories of the volunteer and community groups that won Green Ribbon Awards this year.
