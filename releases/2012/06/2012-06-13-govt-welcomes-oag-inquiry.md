The Government today welcomed the announcement by the Office of the Auditor-General that it has decided to carry out an inquiry into the expressions of interest process for proposals to establish an international convention centre.

“The Government is very relaxed about the Office of the Auditor-General having a look at the EOI process for the National Convention Centre,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“We are confident the EOI process was transparent and each application was assessed on its merit.

“The Auditor-General’s process will not impact on the Government's negotiations with SkyCity. We have said that the Government will only sign up to a deal that is overall in the best interests of New Zealanders.

“This is just another example of the Greens and Labour wanting to halt and delay projects that create jobs and economic growth in New Zealand while at the same time moaning that there are not enough jobs.

“A national convention centre will be a major asset for New Zealand and would generate significant spin-off benefits including a $90 million annual injection into the economy; an estimated 1000 jobs during construction; and 800 jobs once it is up and running.”
