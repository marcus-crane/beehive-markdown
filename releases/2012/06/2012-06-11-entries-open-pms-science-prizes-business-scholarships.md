Economic Development and Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce is encouraging New Zealand’s top scientists and upcoming executives to make applications to the 2012 Prime Minister’s Science Prizes and Business Scholarships.

The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes, presented annually, are New Zealand’s most prestigious and high-value science awards with prize money of $1 million. Entries for four of the Prime Minister’s Science Prizes can be lodged up until 24 July 2012.

“The prizes reflect the importance of science and innovation to New Zealand’s future and the opportunities they provide to lift both the country’s economic prosperity and our quality of life,” Mr Joyce says.

“The aim is to encourage more people to choose careers in science and also to inspire our scientists to do world-leading research in New Zealand.”

Mr Joyce also announced the opening today of the 2012 Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships, which are designed to build business capability and develop skills, particularly in management and international business leadership.

“As part of growing our economy we need to develop better management skills to get the best out of our workforce. Better managers mean more productive firms,” Mr Joyce says. “Getting access to the best knowledge from the world’s best business schools can only benefit our senior executives and the companies they return to.”

The scholarships, which close on 31 July 2012, cover 50 per cent of costs associated with studying at an international business school, including course fees, airfares, accommodation, and other costs such as textbooks.
