Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says a computer infrastructure deal signed off by the Department of Internal Affairs will save taxpayers up to $250 million over the next ten years.

The Department of Internal Affairs today confirmed IBM as the third member of the Government Infrastructure as a Service supplier panel. IBM joins Datacom and Revera Ltd who were awarded contracts in October 2011.

“There is significant change taking place across government departments to ensure they deliver better public services and better value for taxpayers. The completion of the Infrastructure as a Service contracts is another milestone,” says Mr Tremain.

“Infrastructure as a Service provides government departments with the opportunity to purchase the use of IT hardware on demand. This reduces the need for individual departments to maintain their own infrastructure.

“All agencies across the state sector will be able to select the service offering which is right for them, leading to greater flexibility and cost savings for tax payers. The projected savings of up to $250 million go to the heart of the Government’s drive to reprioritise spending to achieve better results.

“The launch of the Infrastructure as a Service panel is an important part of the Government’s aim to reduce the cost of ICT and improve public customer services.”
