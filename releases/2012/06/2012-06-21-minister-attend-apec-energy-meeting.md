Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley heads overseas today to attend the 10th APEC Energy Ministers Meeting in St Petersburg, Russia, and the Ministerial Forum on Offshore Energy Safety in Norway.

“Energy underpins economic growth. Global energy demand is forecast to increase by 40 per cent between 2009 and 2035, and energy co-operation between members is an important agenda item for APEC,” Mr Heatley said.

“I’m looking forward to discussions with other Ministers representing economies for whom energy is crucial.”

The Minister will then attend the Ministerial Forum on Offshore Energy Safety in Norway. This forum will allow Ministers from countries with offshore petroleum activities to share information and developments on offshore energy safety best practice with regulators and industry.

“The Forum is an excellent opportunity for New Zealand to learn about the latest developments in offshore energy safety and to understand how Norway organises its world-renowned petroleum industry,” the Minister said.
