The Minister of Defence has extended his condolences over the death of a New Zealand Defence Force sailor in the Cook Islands.

Able Seaman Combat Specialist William Delamare died in Rarotonga early this morning in a scooter accident while on leave. His ship HMNZS Otago was visiting Rarotonga.

“I wish to extend my condolences to friends and loved ones of William Delamare and also to his crewmates on the Otago,” said Dr Coleman.

“The tragic loss of this young life will be a big shock to all those close to William Delamare.”

“The NZ Defence Force will be providing support for his whanau and close mates at what is a very difficult time for them,” said Dr Coleman.

The coroner in Rarotonga is investigating the accident.
