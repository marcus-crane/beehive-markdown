Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson today congratulated the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki on receiving the prestigious International Award for Architectural Excellence from The Royal Institute of British Architects for its recently completed redevelopment.

It is the first time a New Zealand building has won.

“It is very pleasing to see the exceptional new Auckland Art Gallery building recognised on the world stage,” Mr Finlayson said. “This result reinforces what can be achieved for the arts sector through partnership, with the Auckland Council, central government and private philanthropy through the Auckland Art Gallery Foundation together contributing the funds for the development of this world class public space.”

The awards, the winners of which were announced last Thursday, are given to only 12 buildings a year.

The redeveloped Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki was opened last year. It has also won plaudits in domestic competitions, earning the New Zealand Architecture Medal at the New Zealand Architecture Awards, and winning at the annual Property Industry Awards.
