The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Ranginui at Te Ranga near Tauranga today, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

The Crown was represented at the signing by Mr Finlayson and Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples. The signing was witnessed by local Member of Parliament Simon Bridges.

“Ngāti Ranginui and other Tauranga iwi have suffered some of the worst grievances in New Zealand’s history including the loss of life and the raupatu of land,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today's settlement provides redress recognising those losses. It will create opportunities for economic development in the Tauranga region and allow Ngāti Ranginui to look forward to a stronger future.”

The settlement includes financial redress of $38 million, and also the return of Omanawa River Conservation Area, Mangaone Stream Conservation Area, Taumata and Te Awa Ngāumuwahine, as well as the co-management of the Margaret Jackson Wildlife Management Reserve.

“This government is committed to moving on from the grievances of the past by settling claims in a timely fashion, and the Ngāti Ranginui settlement is an important step towards resolving historical claims in the Tauranga region,” he said.

The deed of settlement was ratified by the Ngāti Ranginui community with support of over 87% of those who voted and will now be implemented through legislation.

The deed of settlement and a summary will be available on the Office of Treaty Settlements website www.ots.govt.nz
