The Government has approved an Order in Council to give Christchurch City Council more flexibility in setting rates, Local Government Minister David Carter announced today.

“Under this Order, Christchurch City Council will be able to reassess rates during the year, rather than only at the start of the financial year,” says Mr Carter.

“The Canterbury earthquakes have had a significant impact on the nature and speed of building activity in Christchurch, but this cannot be reflected in the current rating system.

“The Order in Council will allow rates to immediately reflect changes in the rateable value of properties due to building, demolition or subdivision. It means rates can be more closely aligned with the true value of a property at any time.”

Mr Carter says the financial impact on individual ratepayers will vary depending on their particular situation but the move creates a more equitable rating base.

“The earthquakes have resulted in Christchurch City Council forgoing a significant portion of its rating base. This is a way of collecting rates more fairly as redevelopment gathers pace.

“The Order will not affect those eligible for the Council’s 40 per cent rates remission on uninhabitable residential properties because that is Council policy,” Mr Carter says.

The Order In Council comes into effect on 1 July and will expire in March 2016.
