Prime Minister John Key and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen today signed a partnership arrangement to maintain and strengthen the strong co-operation that New Zealand has developed with NATO.

The Individual Partnership and Co-operation Programme Arrangement was signed today at a ceremony at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. Mr Key is on a European visit that includes Britain, Germany, and the European Union.

“The relationship and engagement between New Zealand and NATO has developed considerably over the past 10 years, mainly through our involvement in the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan,” says Mr Key.

“This arrangement is a move to capitalise on this engagement, and formalise the current, more substantive relationship that exists between NATO and New Zealand.

“The arrangement is a non-binding agreement that will be used to maintain ongoing political and operational discussions and underpin any future co-operation with NATO where it is mutually desirable.

“Co-operation could come in a number of areas, including maintaining ongoing political dialogue on security issues of mutual interest, offering further NATO training opportunities to our Defence Force, and engagement with NATO as it moves to tackle emerging security challenges of interest to New Zealand.

“I welcome the signing of this partnership arrangement. It signals a healthy, ongoing relationship with this very important organisation,” says Mr Key.
