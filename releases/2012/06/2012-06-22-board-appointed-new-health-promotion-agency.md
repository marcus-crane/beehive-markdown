Board members of the new Health Promotion Agency have been announced today by Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

“The new agency will be established on 1 July and it will lead and deliver innovative, high quality and cost effective health promotion programmes,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Health Promotion Agency brings the functions of ALAC, the Health Sponsorship Council and some health promotion work of the Ministry of Health into one agency.

Mrs Goodhew says $7.5 million in savings are expected over four years from greater co-ordination and integration of programmes that are currently delivered by various agencies across Government.

“The agency will draw on a wider range of relationships and expertise to lead programmes that promote health, well-being and healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, illness and injury prevention.

“I am pleased to announce that Dr Lee Mathias has been confirmed as chair of the new Health Promotion Agency Board.

“Dr Mathias is a former nurse with an extensive background in health service management and governance, deputy chair of Auckland DHB, and was the chair of the Health Promotion Agency Establishment Board.”

The other members of the board are:

Mr Rea Wikaira - current Chairman of ALAC and Acting National Operations Manager, Business Manager and Board Secretary of the National Hauora Coalition.

Dame Susan Devoy - a former New Zealand squash player and a member of the Health Sponsorship Council board.

Mrs Katherine Rich - current Chief Executive of the New Zealand Food & Grocery Council and has a longstanding involvement in national leadership on social issues.

Professor Grant Schofield – currently Professor of Public Health at Auckland University of Technology and Director of AUT’s Centre for Physical Activity and Nutrition.

Mrs Barbara Docherty – a registered nurse, an Honorary Clinical Lecturer at the University of Auckland and Director of Training and Development Services (TADS) Ltd.
