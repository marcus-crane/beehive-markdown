Prime Minister John Key has paid tribute to former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Brian Talboys, who passed away in Invercargill yesterday.

“I was saddened to learn of Sir Brian’s death and my thoughts are with his family at this time,” Mr Key says.

Sir Brian was a member of Parliament from 1957 to 1981 and served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1975 to 1981. He served as a minister across a range of portfolios, including agriculture, science, foreign affairs and trade.

“Sir Brian was a gracious and articulate politician who was always looking for solutions. He represented the best of the pragmatic tradition of the National Party.

“He had a truly international view of New Zealand’s place in the world and was a strong advocate of our trade interests in a time of profound change.

“He was heavily involved in the creation of CER and represented New Zealand’s interests when the UK joined the European common market.

“Sir Brian will be remembered for his wide and distinguished contribution to New Zealand politics,” Mr Key says.
