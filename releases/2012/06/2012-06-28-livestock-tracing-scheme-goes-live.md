New Zealand agriculture marks a significant milestone on 1 July when the National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme (NAIT) goes live, says Primary Industries Minister David Carter.

“NAIT is an important partnership between industry and the Crown which began eight years ago in recognition of the growing need for better animal identification and tracing systems.”

The scheme is mandatory for cattle from 1 July 2012 and for deer on 1 March 2013.

“I am delighted that NAIT already has some 30-thousand people and their properties registered on the database,” says Mr Carter.

“NAIT is a significant step in protecting our farmers in the international marketplace. With most other agricultural producing nations already having computerised tracing of animals, New Zealand simply cannot afford to lag behind.

“Lifetime animal traceability is an asset that New Zealand can leverage as part of its international reputation for producing food to the highest standards. It is also an opportunity for farmers to increase productivity by identifying superior animals.

“In the case of a biosecurity outbreak affecting livestock, NAIT will enable a quick and efficient response reducing the impact on the agriculture sector and the entire New Zealand economy,” Mr Carter says.
