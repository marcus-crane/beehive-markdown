Justice Minister and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will travel to Beijing tomorrow to meet with a range of Ministers and influential political leaders to discuss New Zealand’s growing relationship with China.

While in Beijing, Ms Collins will meet with the Minister of State Ethnic Affairs and officials at the State Council Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs and the Ministry of Justice.

“It’s a real privilege to make my first official visit to China as Minister of Justice and Minister for Ethnic Affairs,” Ms Collins says.

“Despite differences in size, political and economic development, New Zealand has a positive political relationship with China and this is going from strength to strength.

“New Zealand’s Chinese communities make a significant contribution to our nation’s economy and they continue to enrich the lives of all New Zealanders through the sharing of Chinese arts, culture and traditions.

“This year marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries and I’m looking forward to meeting my ministerial counterparts in China to further promote and reinforce this strong working relationship.”
