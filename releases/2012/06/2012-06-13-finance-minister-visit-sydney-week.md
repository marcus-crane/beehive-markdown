Finance Minister Bill English travels to Sydney tomorrow for a two-day visit that includes meetings with Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, along with business and economic leaders.

During his meeting with Mr Swan tomorrow, Mr English will discuss progress with the Trans-Tasman Single Economic Market, and share thoughts on the latest global economic developments and their impact on the New Zealand and Australian economies.

“This will be another opportunity for a valuable exchange with the Treasurer, which is important given how close our economies are,” Mr English says. “It’s important that we continue to work together on issues that affect both our countries.”

Mr English will meet business groups with interests in New Zealand, including the Australian Business Economists and the Business Council of Australia.

He returns to New Zealand late on Friday.
