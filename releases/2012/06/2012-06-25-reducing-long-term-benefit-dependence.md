The Government is aiming to reduce the number of long term beneficiaries on Jobseeker Support by 30 per cent from 78,000 to 55,000 by 2017, says Social Development Minster Paula Bennett.

“Welfare reform will require more working age people to look for work, and the Government is targeting those who can work but have been on a benefit long term,” says Mrs Bennett.

In July 2013 about 130,000 people will move on to the new Jobseeker Support, of which 78,000 will have been on working-age benefits for more than 12 months.

The Government is targeting a 30 per cent reduction in the number of long term beneficiaries on Jobseeker Support from 78,000 to 55,000 by 2017.

“The longer a person is out of the workforce, the harder it is for them to return to employment. The Government has support in place to help people into work,” says Mrs Bennett.

“A job not only has proven positive impacts on health and wellbeing – it also helps to connect people to their community, and ultimately having more people in paid work is better for New Zealand,” she says.
