A new publication showing economic, social, cultural, and environmental statistics on Māori will benefit all New Zealanders, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

Mr Williamson launched *Te Ao Mārama 2012* in Parliament House today.

The publication delivers a range of Māori statistics including population, age, and income.

It also contains statistics on iwi groups, cultural vitality and the use of te reo.

“*Te Ao Mārama 2012* is a useful tool in its own right, but it will also draw people into the Māori statistics section on Statistics New Zealand’s website,” Mr Williamson says.

“Here they will find a wealth of in-depth material on Māori – the value of which is immense. I urge all New Zealander to check out this new information.”
