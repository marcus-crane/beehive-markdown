Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew announced today the members of the newly established Charities Registration Board.

From 1 July, the functions of the former Charities Commission will be undertaken by the Department of Internal Affairs.

“The new Charities Registration Board will be established on 1 July and will make independent decisions on applications from organisations that wish to register for charitable status,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“It will also decide the removal of charitable status from registered charities that do not continue to meet the necessary requirements.

“I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Roger Miller as Chair of the new Charities Registration Board.

“Mr Miller is a Wellington lawyer and Registered Trustee, whose specialisations include trust law and governance. He chairs the Scots College Foundation and the Porirua City Council Community Services Board and is a trustee of Performing Arts Foundation of New Zealand.”

The other two members of the Board are:

Caren Rangi, a chartered accountant and audit specialist from Napier. Ms Rangi has extensive community governance experience and is currently a board member of the Broadcasting Commission (NZ On Air) and a trustee of the Eastern and Central Community Trust.

Kirikaiahi Albert, a Wellington lawyer with experience in taxation, Treaty settlements and iwi governance. Ms Albert is active in the Māori legal community, Wellington rugby league and international indigenous networks.

“Together the members bring the skills, experience and diversity necessary to fulfil the independent functions of the Board in a manner that over time will earn the confidence of the charitable sector and the New Zealand public.”

There will be no substantive changes for registered charities or applicants for registration arising from the transition to the new structure. Access to information about charities on the Charities Register and all the educational guidance developed for charities will continue to be available on the website [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz).
