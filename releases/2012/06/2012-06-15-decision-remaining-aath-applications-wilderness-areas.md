Five aerially assisted trophy hunting (AATH) concessions for the Hooker-Landsborough, Adams and Olivine Wilderness Areas are to be granted by Associate Conservation Minister Peter Dunne.

They are being granted under section 17Q of the Conservation Act and section 22 of the Wild Animal Control Act.

Mr Dunne said he was obliged to consider the five applications within the framework of current legislation and has taken into account the recent public submission process.

“I am concerned about the actual and potential impact that AATH has on other users of public conservation land, therefore I have decided to grant the permits for two years, rather than the 10 years applied for,” Mr Dunne said.

“As well as the two-year period I have decided to accept the recommendation that the proposed block WA03 within the Hooker-Landsborough Wilderness Area be excluded from these concessions due to the popularity of this area with trampers, climbers and hunters.

“Furthermore, AATH will not be allowed within the Olivine Wilderness Area unless animal numbers exceed departmental guidelines and more control is required – this will be determined by the Otago Conservator,” he said.

“I accept that AATH activities have an adverse effect on recreational ballot hunting and believe conflict can best be avoided through a total separation of the activities. Ways to achieve this separation will be considered by the Department of Conservation and the Tahr Liaison Group.”

Consistent with the permits approved in February for non-wilderness areas, Mr Dunne has also decided to impose the following additional conditions on each concession:

- The concessionaire must not shoot or authorise shooting from helicopters except where a wounded animal needs to be killed for humane reasons;
- The concessionaire must not carry out any form of hazing of wild animals (being the persecution, harassment or maltreatment of wild animals using a helicopter); and
- The concessionaire must not use a helicopter to herd wild animals in any situation where that activity would interfere with:
  
  1\. the safe enjoyment of public conservation land by other users;
  
  2\. the control of wild animals by recreational hunting.

“It is my expectation that all concession holders will comply with the rules and conditions relating to their concession,” Mr Dunne said.
