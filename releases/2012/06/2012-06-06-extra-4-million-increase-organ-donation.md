The Government is investing an extra $4 million over four years to encourage more organ donations says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Mr Ryall has announced three organ donation initiatives in Dunedin today with Chief Government Whip, Michael Woodhouse MP.

“Organ donation saves the lives of people with severe heart, lung and liver disease, and improves the length and quality of lives of people with kidney or pancreas failure,” says Mr Ryall.

“Last year 186 people received transplants in New Zealand, but many people are still waiting for organs to be donated in order to have a transplant - over 600 for kidney replacements alone.

“We are investing $2 million over four years to increase training and support for intensive care health professionals to identify dying patients who might become donors – and give greater support to their families.

“We are also investing another $1.75 million to increase live organ donation, by employing dedicated staff who can support and guide family and friends while they make the decision to become donors.

“Some patients requiring a transplant will have a family member or friend willing to donate an organ, such as a kidney, but because of different blood or tissue types they are incompatible.

“So we’re spending a further $250,000 to explore the option of establishing a national donor exchange scheme, where we can mix and match several incompatible donor and recipient pairs together so each recipient gets a compatible donor.

“We hope to give many more people who need a transplant, renewed lives, and reduce expensive health care costs, such as dialysis.

“Despite tight financial times, the Government has made $435 million available for Vote Health in 2012/13 bringing the total spend to $14.12 billion. This demonstrates the National Government’s commitment to protecting and growing public health services.”
