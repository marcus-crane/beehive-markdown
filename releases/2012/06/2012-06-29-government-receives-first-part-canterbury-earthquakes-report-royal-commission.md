The government has received the first part of the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by Canterbury Earthquakes, dealing with matters that will inform the rebuild of Christchurch, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ministers will now consider the report and its recommendations. An announcement about the government’s response and about the public release of the report will be made in due course.

The Chair of the Royal Commission, Hon Justice Cooper, presented the first part of the Royal Commission’s report to the Governor-General in Auckland this morning. The Secretary of Internal Affairs received the report from the Governor-General, and has transmitted it to the Attorney-General, who is the minister responsible for the Royal Commission of Inquiry.

The Royal Commission was originally to have presented its final report on 11 April 2012.  In February 2012, Cabinet agreed that the final reporting date for the Royal Commission be extended. The Royal Commission is now required to provide its final report in parts, with a report on matters that would inform decision making on rebuilding and repair work in Christchurch to be provided by 29 June 2012.  A report or reports on all remaining matters is required by 12 November 2012, with the Royal Commission able to provide further parts of its final report before that date, if it is able to do so.

No further comment will be made at this time.
