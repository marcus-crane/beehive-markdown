Environment Minister Amy Adams leaves for Brazil today to lead New Zealand’s delegation at the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development.

“At Rio de Janeiro, New Zealand is focussing on areas that can deliver real and substantial economic, social and environmental benefits,” Ms Adams says.

“We won’t have the biggest voice, but we will be able to contribute practical and relevant ideas.

“New Zealand wants all the countries at Rio+20 to commit to eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies. These contribute to overfishing and to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. They also create perverse economic incentives that affect the long-term sustainability of the world’s fisheries.

“We also want a commitment to phase out the inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that some countries have in place. If we are successful, this could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by up to 10 per cent by 2050.”

New Zealand also has a strong contingent of youth, business and non-governmental organisations attending Rio+20.

“New Zealand’s position reflects the concerns of our Pacific neighbours. Our focus is on achievable commitments that advance sustainable development.

“I am acutely aware that Rio+20 is taking place against a backdrop of global recession and uncertainty. This is inevitably creating challenges.

“Nearly 200 countries will be at Rio+20, all with their own needs and aspirations, but I am hopeful that we can all work constructively together for continued action on sustainable development.

“We think it is important to be a part of the global conversation on sustainable development. New Zealand is a strong supporter of a multilateral rules-based system, and we will play an active part in Rio+20.”

While in Rio de Janeiro, Ms Adams will also hold meetings with her counterparts from Australia, China, Korea, United Kingdom, Canada, Chile and Indonesia.
