Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew is calling for communities to speak out about elder abuse.

Friday 15 June marks the seventh World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.

“Today is about raising awareness so that friends, neighbours, family members and professionals all know the signs to look out for,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Organisations like Age Concern are regularly contacted about elder abuse but we know the majority of cases go unreported. Older people can be vulnerable and can be taken advantage of financially or emotionally by people who are meant to love or care for them.

“Elder abuse is any behaviour or lack of action by someone who is trusted which causes physical, psychological, sexual or financial harm or distress to an older person.

“There are some common signs which may indicate elder abuse such as new and unexplained behaviour, fear of particular people, increased social isolation or unexplained injuries.”

Mrs Goodhew is unveiling a Tree of Life sculpture in Papatoetoe today. The sculpture features purple ribbons which are the international symbol for preventing elder abuse and neglect.
