Health Minister Tony Ryall has today released the Primary Health Organisation (PHO) league tables which show how they are performing against the three national preventative health targets.

The results, to March 2012, rank the 32 PHOs in the country for immunising two year olds, assessing a patient’s risk of heart disease, and offering support for smokers to quit.

“The league tables show how well PHOs are supporting GPs to achieve these targets and improve the health of New Zealanders. It also highlights where they can make improvements,” said Mr Ryall.

“A number of PHOs are close to achieving the immunisation target with nine PHOs less than two per cent away from achieving the 95 per cent target.

“Five PHOs have achieved the more heart checks target of 60 per cent. Western Bay of Plenty PHO is a top performer achieving 68 per cent.

“Whanganui Regional PHO is the only PHO to achieve the better help for smokers to quit target of 90 per cent.

"What we've found with releasing the health targets of district health boards is performance has improved and patients are benefiting from better health services. There is nothing like a bit of healthy competition to improve results.”

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are registered with them.
