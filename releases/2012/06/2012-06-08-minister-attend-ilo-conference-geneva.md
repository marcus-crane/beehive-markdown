Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson will take part in discussions, with a focus on youth employment, at the International Labour Conference in Geneva.

Ms Wilkinson will address the meeting of Asia Pacific Labour Ministers on Tuesday, as part of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) discussion on the global youth employment crisis.

“Youth employment is a growing problem around the world. It is a very complex issue and demands comprehensive responses from Governments and the international community.

“This is an opportunity for New Zealand to be part of the conversation – to show our all-of-Government approach to supporting youth into work and get a grasp of the measures being introduced in other nations.”

Ms Wilkinson will also be addressing the ILO Plenary on the sub-theme of Building a Future with Decent Work.

The Minister will go on to a number of bi-lateral meetings in Geneva, London and Vancouver before returning to New Zealand on June 22.
