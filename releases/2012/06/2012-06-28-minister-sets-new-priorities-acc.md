ACC Minister Judith Collins today tabled a new Service and Purchase Agreement between the Government and ACC outlining the services to be provided by the Corporation.

Ms Collins says the new agreement comes into effect on 1 July and represents a rebalance of the broader responsibilities ACC has to all New Zealanders.

“New Zealanders rightfully expect to be able to trust in ACC and its integrity and for ACC to ensure entitlements are delivered transparently and fairly to those who need them.

“Our new priorities set out key initiatives, measures and targets to ensure ACC meets the highest standards of best practice and service for its clients, and achieves outcomes that are consistent with the spirit of ACC’s pioneering objectives.

“A critical priority for ACC is to promote and rebuild the trust and confidence of Kiwis in the scheme it manages on their behalf. Privacy and information security is also a priority and I expect ACC to improve its practices and culture in this area.

“For claimants with a genuine need and a right to support, ACC must follow a fair process for assessing their eligibility and ensuring they receive fair entitlements.

“I expect ACC to be sensitive, responsive, and provide an excellent and timely service that reflects best practice and to minimise the number of disputes proceeding to review and litigation.

“ACC must achieve outcomes that are consistent with the letter and spirit of the legislation, while still preserving public trust and confidence,” says Ms Collins.

Among the Government’s new priorities for ACC are for the Corporation to:

- improve public trust and confidence
- improve management and security of private information
- maintain a focus on levy stability and financial sustainability
- provide high quality services for clients, and
- ensure early resolution of disputes.

ACC’s *Statement of Intent* was also tabled today and outlines ACC’s work plan for the next three years.

“The Service and Purchase Agreement and the Board’s *Statement of Intent*, signal an appropriate rebalance of strategic objectives in ACC.

“I look forward to working with incoming interim Board Chair Paula Rebstock on these changes and further improvements from ACC,” says Ms Collins.
