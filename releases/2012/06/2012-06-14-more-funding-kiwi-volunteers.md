Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced a three-year support package of $24 million for Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA) to help place skilled New Zealand volunteers in developing countries.

“New Zealand is a world leader in areas like agriculture and tourism development that are vital for developing countries, especially in the Pacific,” Mr McCully says.

“The government wants more New Zealanders to be involved in the delivery of our aid programme. VSA now has a strong focus on supporting economic development and is delivering more opportunities for volunteers in the Pacific.”

In the last year alone VSA volunteers have contributed to; improved access to drinking water for almost 9000 people, the provision of sanitation facilities for more than 3000, the treatment of more than 200 patients, and the upgrade or building of around 90 kilometres of roads.

“VSA is also offering more short-term assignments and partnering with other New Zealand organisations such as Downer NZ, Tuia International, World Vision and Rotary NZ to access more New Zealanders with specific expertise,” Mr McCully says.
